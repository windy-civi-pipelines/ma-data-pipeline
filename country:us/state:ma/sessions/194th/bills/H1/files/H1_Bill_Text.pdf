MAURA T. HEALEY KIMBERLEY DRISCOLL
GOVERNOR LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR
January 22, 2025
To the Honorable Senate and House of Representatives,
I am filing for your consideration a bill entitled “An Act Making Appropriations for the
Fiscal Year 2026 for the Maintenance of the Departments, Boards, Commissions, Institutions,
and Certain Activities of the Commonwealth, for Interest, Sinking Fund, and Serial Bond
Requirements, and for Certain Permanent Improvements,” more commonly known as House 1.
This budget proposes $59.58 billion in appropriations for Fiscal Year 2026 (FY26),
excluding spending tied to the income surtax and the Medical Assistance Trust Fund. This
represents 2.6 percent growth over FY25 estimated spending, responsibly keeping the size of our
state’s non-surtax budget within the rate of inflation in order to ensure that we are living within
our means and putting Massachusetts on a sustainable path for the future.
Additionally, this budget proposes $1.95 billion in spending tied to the Fair Share income
surtax, consistent with our consensus revenue agreement. We expect the surtax to continue to
generate significant new revenue for Massachusetts in FY26, allowing for transformative
investment in our education and transportation systems that will continue to expand access for
students from Pre-K through higher education and improve the safety and reliability of our roads,
bridges and public transit.
Our administration’s House 1 budget takes a balanced approach, ensuring key priorities
are funded to further affordability, competitiveness, and equity while managing competing
pressures of growing spending and slower growing revenue. The state continues to experience
heightened demands on key services – health care, high-quality early education and care, and
housing stabilization, just to name a few. At the same time, our tax revenue estimates, while
projecting modest growth at 2.2 percent, cannot keep up with these demands on state services.

This mismatch between spending and revenue growth has required the Healey-Driscoll
Administration to examine the budget to create meaningful savings, so that our most critical
services can be maintained.
The administration is proud that this budget fully funds the fifth-year implementation of
the Student Opportunity Act, and increases Unrestricted General Government Aid by 2.2
percent, keeping pace with our projected growth in revenue. All together, we propose to spend
$9.2 billion for local aid, a $480.7 million increase over FY25 GAA.
Building on our approach in FY25 to Fair Share, House 1 also proposes to maximize
these dollars to put billions toward our transportation and higher education capital needs, while
also stabilizing the MBTA and continuing to support income-eligible fare relief, regional fare-
free transit, universal school meals and free community college.
House 1 dedicates $765 million to the Commonwealth Transportation Fund (CTF) to
leverage $5 billion in borrowing over the next 10 years for capital, while also allowing us to put
$500 million toward operating support for the MBTA to address that agency’s budget shortfall.
This is integral to our plan to invest $8 billion over the next 10 years in our transportation
infrastructure. This funding will also maintain key initiatives such as the MBTA Academy, water
transportation, Regional Transit Authority connectivity, and community transit grant programs
and funding for MassDOT operations to support workforce needs, with an emphasis on the
mega-projects division.
In education, with the $1.185 billion in Fair Share spending in education proposed in
House 1 we will continue to fully fund Commonwealth Cares for Children grants for child care
providers at $475 million, expand Literacy Launch, which equips students with the reading and
writing skills necessary for academic success and lifelong learning, and better fund mental and
behavioral health services in schools.
This budget also proposes to leverage $125 million of surtax revenue to support $2.5
billion in new borrowing over the next 10 years to invest in our higher education campuses. This
will help begin to tackle the significant backlog of deferred maintenance and modernize our
students’ facilities, while also addressing the decarbonization goals of our state.
Alongside, House 1 the administration is also filing a supplemental Fair Share budget
with a plan to deploy $1.3 billion in surplus surtax revenue from FY24 to support programs like
Early College and Innovation/Career Pathways, universal Pre-K, high-dosage literacy tutoring,
transit safety, microtransit and RTA workforce initiatives. When viewed together, House 1 and
the supplemental budget will provide for a near even split in Fair Share spending between
education and transportation.
House 1 also sustains record investment in climate and environmental programming,
including a planned transfer to the new Disaster Relief and Resiliency Fund. This budget spends
$42 million for continued operating funding for the Massachusetts Emergency Food Assistance
Program, $8.2 million to maintain support for environmental justice programming, and $30

million for the Massachusetts Clean Energy Center to continue supporting workforce training
programs in the clean energy industry, clean transportation adoption, and an energy retrofit pilot
program.
We continue to make progress tackling our housing shortage by supporting the
implementation of the Affordable Homes Act and investing $1.2 billion to make housing more
affordable and accessible. Our efforts include language to eliminate renter-paid broker fees
unless that broker is hired by the renter.
We are also proposing to support new rate increases for human service providers under
Chapter 257 and to protect patient access to medication by penalizing manufacturers for
excessive pricing of drugs.
Recognizing the fiscal challenges confronting us, House 1 recommends a thoughtful
combination of recurring and one-time funding sources to ensure a responsibly balanced budget
that sets us up for future sustainability in coming fiscal years. Importantly, this budget does not
utilize any funding from the Stabilization Fund, which is estimated to grow to a record high of
$8.333 billion after House 1 makes $133 million in transfers from excess capital gains.
The consensus revenue estimate assumes $2.33 billion of capital gains tax revenue of
which $666 million will be statutorily transferred to support long-term liabilities, such as the
Stabilization Fund, pension costs and retiree health insurance expenses.
The budget maintains the state’s commitment to fully fund its pension liability by 2036
with $4.933 billion in FY26, a $433 million increase over the Fiscal Year 2025 contribution. In
order to maximize our available resources, we propose directing a greater portion of excess
capital gains towards our pension and OPEB contributions than traditionally used, which has the
benefit of freeing up space on the budget for other critical programs.
In addition, our administration proposes meaningful savings proposals, focused on
mitigating direct impacts on services for our most vulnerable populations and some targeted
proposals for revenue generation that close loopholes and more fairly apply the state’s tax code.
As required by section 6E of chapter 29 of the General Laws, my recommendations today
constitute a balanced budget for the Commonwealth. I urge you to enact this legislation in time
for the start of the coming fiscal year.
Respectfully submitted,
Maura T. Healey,
Governor

SECTION 3.
Notwithstanding any general or special law to the contrary, for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2026 the
distribution of Unrestricted General Government Aid to cities and towns of the balance of the State
Lottery and Gaming Fund, as paid from the General Fund in accordance with clause (c) of the second
paragraph of section 35 of chapter 10 of the General Laws, and additional funds from the General Fund
and the Gaming Local Aid Fund, shall be $1,337,505,368 and shall be apportioned to cities and towns
in accordance with this section. For fiscal year 2026 the total amounts to be distributed to each city,
town, and regional school district, as calculated pursuant to chapter 70 of the General Laws and paid
from item 7061-0008 of section 2 and from item 1596-2450 of Section 2F, shall be as set forth in the
following lists; provided, that for purposes of calculating preliminary local contributions, municipal
revenue growth factors shall be calculated in a manner consistent with calculations made in fiscal year
2025; provided further, that the effort reduction percentage shall be 100 per cent; provided further, that
the minimum aid per pupil dollar amount shall be $75; and provided further, that the total statewide

below shall be deemed in full satisfaction of the amounts due under said chapter 70. The department of
elementary and secondary education shall not consider health care costs for retired teachers to be part
of net school spending for any district in which such costs were not considered part of net school
spending in fiscal year 1994 and for any district that has not accepted the provisions of section 260 of
chapter 165 of the acts of 2014; provided, that any district for whom such costs are not so considered
shall have included as part of net school spending an amount equal to the increase in the foundation
budget for the district associated with health care costs of retired teachers. No payments to cities,
towns or counties maintaining an agricultural school under this section shall be made after November
30 of the fiscal year until the commissioner of revenue certifies acceptance of the prior fiscal year's
annual financial reports submitted under section 43 of chapter 44 of the General Laws. Advance
payments shall be made for some or all of periodic local reimbursement or assistance programs to any
city, town, regional school district, or agricultural school that demonstrates an emergency cash shortfall,
as certified by the commissioner of revenue and approved by the secretary of administration and
finance, under guidelines established by the secretary.

Section 43 - Deeds Excise Clarifications 1
SECTION 43. Chapter 64D of the General Laws is hereby amended by striking out section 1 and

Section 1. There shall be levied, collected and paid, for and in respect of the deeds, instruments
and writings hereinafter mentioned and described, or for or in respect of the vellum, parchment or paper
upon which such deeds, instruments or writings, or any of them are written or printed, the excise taxes
herein specified:- Deed, instrument or writing, whereby any lands, tenements or other realty sold shall
be granted, assigned, transferred or otherwise conveyed to, or vested in, the purchaser or purchasers,
or any other person or persons, by his, her or their direction, when the consideration of the interest or
property conveyed, exclusive of the value of any lien or encumbrance not to exceed $1,000,000

remaining thereon at the time of the sale, exceeds $100 and does not exceed $500, $2; and for each
additional $500 or fractional part thereof, $2; provided, however, that in Barnstable county, the excise
tax herein specified shall be $2.50 for each $500 or fractional part of said consideration, excluding a
consideration of between $0 and $100. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this section or any
other general or special law to the contrary, Nantucket county may disburse and expend deposits in
said Funds for the purpose of facilities and programs related to law enforcement, including the
planning, improving or constructing of police stations and other related facilities and programs. The
excise tax shall also apply to a transfer or acquisition of a controlling interest in an entity with an interest
in real property. In the case of such a transfer or acquisition, the consideration subject to the excise tax
is the portion of the total consideration reasonably attributable to the real property, without deduction for
the value of any lien or encumbrance remaining thereon at the time of the sale. Said excise tax shall be
payable at the registry of deeds in the county in which the real property lies, regardless of whether the
transfer or acquisition is evidenced by a deed, instrument, or other writing or whether such deed,
instrument, or other writing is otherwise recorded. This chapter shall not apply to any instrument or
writing given to secure a debt or to any deed, instrument or writing to which the commonwealth, a city
or town of the commonwealth, or the United States or any of their agencies are a party.
For the purposes of this chapter, unless otherwise expressly stated, the following words shall
have the following meanings:
"Interest in real property", includes, but is not limited to, an estate in fee simple, a beneficial
interest, a life estate, a perpetual easement or a leasehold or sublease interest, ordinary or proprietary,
but only where the sum of the term of the lease or sublease and any options for renewal, extension, or
the like exceeds 49 years.
"Transfer or acquisition of a controlling interest", in the case of a corporation which has an
interest in real property, occurs when a person, or group of persons acting in concert, transfers or
acquires, directly or indirectly, including through the transfer or acquisition of an interest in another
entity, a total of 50 per cent or more of the total combined stock of the corporation, by vote or value. In
the case of any partnership, limited liability company, association, trust, or other non-corporate entity
having an interest in real property, the transfer or acquisition of a controlling interest therein occurs
when a person, or group of persons acting in concert, transfers or acquires, directly or indirectly,
including through the transfer or acquisition of an interest in another entity, a total of 50 per cent or
more of the capital, profits, or beneficial interest in the entity.
Persons are considered to be acting in concert when they have a relationship such that one
person influences or controls the actions of another. Where the individuals or entities are not commonly
controlled or owned, persons shall be considered to be acting in concert when the unity with which the
sellers or purchasers have negotiated and will consummate the transfer of ownership interests
indicates that they are acting as a single entity. If the transfers or acquisitions are completely
independent, each seller selling or purchaser buying without regard to the identity of the other sellers or
purchasers, then the transfers or acquisitions shall be treated as separate transfers or acquisitions.
For purposes of determining whether a controlling interest is transferred or acquired, only transfers or
acquisitions of interests occurring on or after the effective date of this section shall be added together.
Where there is a transfer or acquisition of an interest in an entity that has an interest in real property on
or after the effective date, and subsequently there is a transfer or acquisition of an additional interest or
interests in the same entity, the transfers or acquisitions shall be added together to determine if a
transfer or acquisition of a controlling interest has occurred. No transfer or acquisition of an interest in
an entity that has an interest in real property shall be added to another transfer or acquisition in the
same entity if they occur more than 3 years apart, unless the transfers or acquisitions are so timed as
part of a plan to avoid the excises herein specified.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, a bona fide pledge of stock, partnership or other interest as loan
collateral, or any conveyance of publicly traded stock, partnership or other interest, shall not be
considered subject to taxation under this chapter.
The commissioner shall promulgate regulations or other guidance to implement this section.
Summary:
This section, together with a related section, imposes deeds excise on transfers of controlling interests
in entities holding real property and caps the deduction for assumed mortgages in calculating the deeds
excise.

there is a transfer or acquisition of a controlling interest in an entity with an interest in real property, the
tax imposed by this chapter shall be paid by the person who conveys such interest, including but not
limited to, a shareholder, partner, or other interest-holder transferring stock, a partnership interest, or
another equity interest, respectively. The payment of the tax shall be denoted by adhesive stamps
affixed to the deed, instrument or writing, or to the vellum, parchment or paper upon which it is written
or printed, except that in the instance of a transfer or acquisition of a controlling interest in an entity with
an interest in real property, the commissioner shall prescribe a form for such purpose that shall be
recorded and shall evidence the recording stamp required by this section. The person using or affixing
a stamp shall cancel the same by writing or stamping thereon the initials of his name and the date when
the same is affixed or used, in such manner that it cannot be used again; provided, however, that the
stamp shall not be so defaced as to prevent determination of its denomination and genuineness.

include political subdivisions of the commonwealth, individuals, partnerships, corporations, trusts,
limited liability companies, societies, associations and any other form of unincorporated enterprise.

(a) A tax is hereby imposed upon the transfer of the estate of each person dying on or after
January 1, 1997 who, at the time of death, was a resident of the commonwealth. The amount of the tax
shall be equal to the credit for state death taxes that would have been allowable to a decedent's estate
as computed under section 2011 of the Code, as in effect on December 31, 2000, hereinafter referred
to as the "credit". The credit shall be determined based on the value of the federal gross estate after
such estate is increased by the value of any property: (i) not included in the federal gross estate; (ii) in
which the decedent had at death a qualifying income interest for life described in subsection (c) of
section 3A; (iii) for which a deduction was allowed for Massachusetts estate tax purposes with respect
to the transfer of such property to the decedent; and (iv) which is not real or tangible personal property
located outside of the commonwealth at the time of death. If the federal gross estate of a person
includes real or tangible personal property located outside of the commonwealth at the time of death,
the credit shall be determined based on the value of the federal gross estate after such estate is
reduced by the value of such real or tangible personal property located outside of the commonwealth
and increased by the value of any property: (A) not included in the federal gross estate; (B) in which the
decedent had at death a qualifying income interest for life described in subsection (c) of section 3A; and

tangible personal property located outside of the commonwealth.
(b) A tax is hereby imposed upon the transfer of real property situated in this commonwealth
and upon tangible personal property having an actual situs in this commonwealth of every person who
at the time of his death was not a resident of this commonwealth. The amount of this tax is the amount
of the credit calculated based upon a federal gross estate that is equal to the sum of: (i) the value of the
estate's real or tangible personal property located in the commonwealth; and (ii) the value of any real or
tangible property (A) not included in the federal gross estate, (B) in which the decedent had at death a
qualifying income interest for life described in subsection (c) of section 3A, (C) for which a deduction
was allowed for Massachusetts estate tax purposes with respect to the transfer of such property to the
decedent, and (D) which is not located outside of the commonwealth at the time of death. Under this
subsection, for the purposes of calculating the federal taxable estate, no deduction shall be allowed that
is attributable to property other than such real or tangible personal property located in the

before a hearing officer. The hearing officer may be an employee of the enforcing authority or such
other person as the enforcing authority may designate. Written notice of the date, time and place of the
hearing shall be sent by first class mail to each registered owner of the motor vehicle. The hearing shall
be informal, the rules of evidence shall not apply and the decision of the hearing officer shall be final
subject to judicial review pursuant to section 14 of chapter 30A. Not more than 21 days after the
hearing, the enforcing authority or the hearing officer shall send the decision of the hearing officer,
including the reason for the outcome, by first class mail to the registered owner. If the registered owner
is found to be responsible for the speed camera enforceable violation, the registered owner shall pay
the fine in the manner described in subsection (g) not more than 14 days after the issuance of the
decision or request further judicial review pursuant to said section 14 of said chapter 30A.
(k) The enforcing authority may avail itself of the registrar's non-renewal program when a
registered owner of a motor vehicle to whom a notice of a speed camera enforceable violation has

(i) and fails to pay the fine in the notice in accordance with subsection (g) within 60 days of the
violation; or (ii) is found responsible for the violation and does not pay the fine in accordance with
subsection (h) or subsection (i). The enforcing authority may at any time but not later than two years
after the initial fine issuance was made, transmit to the registrar, in such form as approved by the
registrar, notice of such nonpayment, specifying the name and address of the person to whom the fine
is assessed, the amount of the fine due and any other costs relative thereto, and such information as
the registrar may require; provided, however, that no notice shall be transmitted to the registrar under
this section at a time when there is pending, before either the enforcing authority or a court, a duly filed
appeal of the fine. Upon receipt of such notification of nonpayment the registrar shall place the matter
on record and not renew the registration of the motor vehicle to which a notice of a speed camera
enforceable violation has been issued to the registered owner, nor allow an exchange of the registration
of such vehicle nor issue a new registration of such vehicle to the person to whom the unpaid fine was
assessed until after notice from the enforcing authority that the matter has been disposed of in
accordance with the requirements herein. Upon such notification of nonpayment to the registrar, an
additional $20 charge payable to the registrar of motor vehicles shall be assessed against the
registered owner of said vehicle to be collected by the enforcing authority to be transferred to the
registry of motor vehicles as part of the non-renewal process. It shall be the duty of the enforcing
authority to notify the registrar that such matters have been disposed of in accordance with the
requirements herein; provided however, that a certified receipt of full and final payment from the
enforcing authority shall also serve as a legal notice to the registrar that the matter has been resolved.
The registrar shall approve such forms as they deem necessary to implement this section and said
forms shall be printed and used by the enforcing authorities.
Section 4. (a) Notwithstanding section 3, if the registered owner of a motor vehicle is a person
or entity engaged in the business of leasing or renting motor vehicles and the motor vehicle was
operated under a rental or lease agreement at the time of the speed camera enforceable violation, this
section shall be applicable and the registered owner shall not be liable for any unpaid fines if the
registered owner has complied with the requirements of this section.

(b) The enforcing authority shall provide notice in writing of each speed camera enforceable
violation to the registered owner of a motor vehicle if a motor vehicle owned by the registered owner is
involved in a speed camera enforceable violation.

authority, in writing, the name and address of the lessee or rentee of the motor vehicle at the time of the
speed camera enforceable violation, the lessee's or rentee's driver's license number, the state that
issued the driver's license and the lessee's or rentee's date of birth.
(d) Upon receipt of the information required under subsection (c), the enforcing authority shall
issue a notice of a speed camera enforceable violation to the lessee or rentee in the form prescribed by
section 3 and the lessee or rentee shall be liable for the violation.
(e) The enforcing authority may avail itself of the registrar's non-renewal program as provided in
subsection (k) hereof if the lessee or rentee to whom a notice of violation has been issued: (i) fails to
contest the responsibility for a speed camera enforceable violation pursuant to either subsection (i) or
subsection (j) of section 3 and fails to pay the fine in the notice in accordance with subsection (h) of
said section 3 within 90 days of the violation; or (ii) is found responsible for the violation and does not
pay the fine in accordance with said subsection (i) or said subsection (j) of said section 3, provided,
however, that if the vehicle owner furnished the information under subsection (c), such non-renewal
shall only apply to the license to operate of the lessee or rentee and not the registration of the vehicle.
Section 5. (a) An enforcement authority shall install a reasonable distance away from each road
safety camera system an unobstructed sign notifying the public that an automated road safety camera
system is in use.

or administrative proceeding, other than in a proceeding held pursuant to this chapter, without a court
order. A photograph or video taken pursuant to this chapter shall not be admissible in any judicial or

administrative proceeding, other than in a proceeding to adjudicate liability for a violation of this
chapter, without a court order. A court shall not order a release of a photograph or video taken pursuant
to this chapter unless the photograph or video establishes or undermines a finding of a moving violation
and the speed camera enforceable violation is material as to a finding of civil or criminal liability.
(c) Photographs, video and other personal identifying information collected by a city or town
pursuant to this chapter shall not be a public record under clause twenty-sixth of section 7 of chapter 4
or chapter 66. Each enforcing authority shall maintain the confidentiality of all information including, but
not limited to, photographs or other recorded images and credit and account data, relative to the
registered vehicle or registered owner of the vehicle subject to a speed camera enforceable violation.

enforceable violations under this act.
(d) An automated road safety camera system shall not be utilized to take a frontal view
photograph of a motor vehicle operator committing a speed camera enforceable violation or other
occupants of the vehicle. A frontal view photograph of a motor vehicle committing a speed camera
enforceable violation taken by an automated road safety camera system that captures the operator or
occupants of the vehicle shall not be discoverable or admissible in any judicial or administrative
proceeding and shall not be used as the basis for a speed camera enforceable violation under this
chapter. To the extent practicable, additional efforts shall be made to ensure that photographs
produced by an automated road safety camera system shall not be used to identify the vehicle
operator, the passengers or the contents of the vehicle. The use of facial recognition technology in
conjunction with an automated road safety camera system is prohibited.
(e) A city or town or a manufacturer or vendor of an automated road safety camera system may
not use, disclose, sell or permit access to data collected by an automated road safety camera system
except as necessary to process speed camera enforceable violations and fulfill reporting requirements
in accordance with this chapter.

ownership interest in the pharmacy; (B) who directly or indirectly controls, or has the ability to control to
any significant degree, the management or policies of the pharmacy; or (C) who is related to the
