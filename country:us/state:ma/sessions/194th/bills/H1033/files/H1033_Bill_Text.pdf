_______________
An Act responding to the threat of invasive species.
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives in General Court assembled, and by the authority
of the same, as follows:
1 SECTION 1. Chapter 10, as appearing in the 2022 Official Edition, of the General Laws
2 is hereby amended by adding the following sections:-
3 Section 78. As used in section 79, the following words shall have the following meanings
4 unless the context clearly requires otherwise:-
5 “committee”, the invasive species advisory committee established under section 38 of
6 chapter 20;
7 “coordinator”, the statewide invasive species coordinator established under section 36 of
8 chapter 20;
9 “executive office”, the executive office of energy and environmental affairs
1 of 14

10 “recurring maintenance projects”, invasive species projects that previously received grant
11 funding and require long-term control or management activity.
12 Section 79. (a) There shall be a fund to be known as the Invasive Species Trust Fund.
13 Notwithstanding any general or special law to the contrary, there shall be credited to the fund: (i)
14 any revenue from appropriations or other money authorized by the general court and
15 specifically designated to be credited to the fund, (ii) any gifts, grants, private contributions or
16 investment income earned by the fund’s assets and all other sources and (iii) any monies
17 provided voluntarily from anyone applying for sporting, hunting, fishing and trapping licenses.
18 (b) The fund, subject to appropriation, shall be received and held in trust solely for: (i)
19 support to the committee, (ii) the executive office’s invasive species office established under
20 section 36 of chapter 20, (iii) development and implementation of the statewide strategic
21 management plan for invasive species pursuant to section 32 of chapter 20, (iv) research and
22 pilot projects at Massachusetts universities, colleges, non-profit organizations and other facilities
23 to test new and emerging technologies for controlling invasive species, and (v) grants awarded

2 of 14

31 (d) A municipality, or group of municipalities, a cooperative invasive species
32 management area, a non-profit or an agency of the state, which desires state assistance to control
33 invasive species, may apply in writing to the invasive species office in a manner prescribed by
34 the office. When the office finds that a proposed invasive species control program aligns with
35 objectives developed in the statewide strategic management plan, and is suitable to eradicate,
36 control, or minimize the effect an invasive species has on the ecosystem under consideration, it
37 may grant an award as determined necessary by the office. Recurring maintenance
38 projects may be awarded grants of up to seventy-five percent the full amount of the annual
39 project cost for a maximum of five years. In approving requests and determining the amount of
40 any grant, the office shall consider the following: (i) the long-range impacts of the strategic
41 management plan developed by the applicant, (ii) the natural resources to be conserved and
42 protected by such control, (iii) the presence of any invasive species prioritized by the committee,
43 (iv) recommendations from the committee, and (v) any impact on endangered, threatened or
44 special concern species listed under chapter 131A.
45 (e) In prescribing such manner of application for state assistance, the office shall require
46 applicants to develop a management plan and shall offer consultation for development of such
47 plans. The plans shall (i) identify root causes of the existing invasive species problem, (ii)
48 specify control techniques to manage or eradicate the existing infestation, (iii) identify and
49 specify control techniques that will minimize adverse environmental impact to the surrounding
50 area, (iv) specify best management practices to prevent future infestations, and (v) identify the
51 adverse impact of such specified control techniques on any rare species listed under chapter
52 131A.
3 of 14

53 (f) The office shall make awards to priority projects to the extent that funds are available.
54 First priority shall be projects to manage incipient infestations of invasive species with the
55 potential for eradication, second priority shall be projects to prevent or control the further spread
56 of an invasive species, and third priority shall be recurring maintenance projects. In establishing
57 priorities for individual projects, the office shall consider the following: (i) public accessibility
58 and recreational uses; (ii) the importance to commercial, agricultural or other interests; (iii) the
59 degree of local interest, including municipal or other support to the project; (iv) local efforts to
60 control invasive species; (v) other considerations affecting feasibility of achieving long-term
61 control including the need for multi-year control efforts; and (vi) necessity or advantage
62 of the proposed work. In all cases, the office shall consider whether the proposed project is
63 included in or compatible with applicable law and regulations, and whether the proposed project
64 furthers goals established by the statewide strategic management plan.
65 SECTION 2. Chapter 20, as appearing in the Official Edition, of the General Laws is
66 hereby amended by adding sections 33 to section 38:-

74 government and any other appropriate parties to manage and control regional invasive species;
75 “coordinator”, the statewide invasive species coordinator;
76 “department”, the department of agricultural resources;
77 “introduction”, the intentional or unintentional escape, release, dissemination, or
78 placement of a species into an ecosystem as a result of human activity;
79 “introduction pathway”, the mechanism by which an invasive species enters
80 Massachusetts;
81 “invasive species”, a species that is non-native to the ecosystem under consideration, and
82 whose introduction causes or is likely to cause economic or environmental harm or harm to
83 human health;
84 “Massachusetts Aquatic Invasive Species Management Plan”; a five-year plan, created by
85 the Massachusetts Aquatic Invasive Species Working Group, for aquatic invasive species
86 management in Massachusetts with the goal of implementing a coordinated approach to
87 minimizing the ecological and economic impacts of aquatic invasive species in marine and
88 freshwater environments. The plan was the first comprehensive effort to assess the impacts and
89 threats of aquatic invasive species in Massachusetts and was published in December 2002;
90 “native species”, a species that, other than as a result of an introduction, historically
91 occurred or currently occurs in a particular ecosystem;
5 of 14
