1 SECTION 1. Section 2 of chapter 132B of the General Laws is hereby amended by
2 inserting after the definition of “Nematode” the following definition:-
3 “Neonicotinoid,” a pesticide belonging to the neonicotinoid class of chemicals which act
4 selectively on nicotine acetylcholine receptors, including but not limited to, imidacloprid,
5 acetamiprid, clothianidin, dinotefuran, nithiazine, nitenpyram, thiacloprid, and thiamethoxam,
6 and any other pesticide identified as a neonicotinoid by the United States Environmental

9 section 16 the following section:-
1 of 3

10 Section 17. (a) Beginning on January 1, 2029, no person shall distribute, sell, or offer for
11 sale any agricultural seed for corn, wheat, or soybean if such seed is treated with a neonicotinoid
12 unless a waiver is issued by the department to the user of such seed pursuant to this section.
13 (b) Beginning on January 1, 2029, no person without a waiver issued by the department
14 pursuant to this section shall use any agricultural seed for corn, wheat, or soybean if such seed is

16 (c) The department may issue a waiver to allow the use of agricultural seeds treated with
17 a neonicotinoid for the production of agricultural crops only upon application by a person who
18 has completed an integrated pest management training, conducted a pest risk assessment, and
19 submitted to the department a pest risk assessment report. The department may issue a waiver if,

21 the occurrence of a pest presents a significant risk of imminent harm, injury, or loss to
22 agricultural crops; (ii) that the use of agricultural seeds treated with a neonicotinoid will be
23 effective in addressing the pest risk; (iii) that the use of agricultural seeds treated with a
24 neonicotinoid will not cause unreasonable adverse effects on the environment, including on non-
25 target organisms, surface water quality, and groundwater quality; and (iv) that no other less
26 harmful seed treatment, pesticide, or pest management practice will be effective in addressing
27 the pest risk.
28 (d) A waiver issued pursuant to this section shall: (i) provide the basis for the
29 determinations made by the department pursuant to subsection (c) of this section; (ii) specify the
30 waiver’s geographic scope, which may include only properties identified in the pest risk
