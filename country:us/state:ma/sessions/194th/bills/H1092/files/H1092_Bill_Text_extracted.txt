Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives in General Court assembled, and by the authority
of the same, as follows:
1 SECTION 1. Section 1 of chapter 6D of the General Laws, as appearing, is hereby
2 amended by inserting after the definition of “Alternative payment methodologies or methods”
3 the following 2 definitions:-
4 “Biosimilar”, a drug that is produced or distributed pursuant to a biologics license
5 application approved under 42 U.S.C. 262(k)(3).
6 SECTION 2. Said chapter 6D, as so appearing, is hereby further amended by adding the
7 following section:-Section 22. (a) For the purposes of this section, “Manufacturer” shall mean an
8 entity that manufactures a pharmaceutical drug.
9 (b) The commission may require a manufacturer specified in subsection (c) to disclose to
10 the commission within a reasonable time information relating to the manufacturer’s pricing of
11 that drug, on a standard reporting form developed by the commission with the input of the
12 manufacturers, which includes, but shall not be limited to, the following:
1 of 8
13 (1) A schedule of the drug’s wholesale acquisition cost increases over the previous 5
14 calendar years;
15 (2) The manufacturer’s aggregate, company-level research and development and other
16 relevant capital expenditures, including facility construction, for the most recent year for which
17 final audited data are available;
18 (3) A written, narrative description, suitable for public release, of factors that contributed
19 to reported changes in wholesale acquisition cost during the previous 5 calendar years; and
20 (4) Any other information that the manufacturer wishes to provide to the commission.
21 Based on the records furnished, the commission may identify a proposed value for a
22 prescribed drug specified in subsection (c). The Commission may request additional relevant
23 information that it deems necessary.
24 (c) A manufacturer of a drug for which the commission has received a referral from the
25 center under subsection (b) of section 25 of chapter 12C shall comply with the requirements set
26 forth in this section; provided that the commission may select or prioritize a subset of the
27 referred drugs for the commission’s review.
28 (d) Records disclosed by a manufacturer under this section shall: (i) be accompanied by
29 an attestation that all information provided is true and correct; (ii) not be public records under
30 section 7 of chapter 4 or chapter 66; and (iii) remain confidential; provided, however, that the
31 commission may produce reports summarizing any findings; provided that any such report shall
32 not be in a form that identifies specific prices charged for or rebate amounts associated with
2 of 8
33 drugs by a manufacturer, or in a manner that is likely to compromise the financial, competitive or
34 proprietary nature of the information.
35 (e) If, after review of any records furnished to the commission under subsection (b), the
36 commission determines that the manufacturer’s pricing of the drug is potentially unreasonable or
37 excessive in relation to the commission’s proposed value under subsection (b), the commission
38 shall require that the manufacturer provide within 30 days further information related to the
39 pricing of the prescribed drug and the manufacturer’s justification for the pricing. In addition to

41 patients, providers, provider organizations and payers who may provide information to the
42 commission.
43 (f) The commission shall provide to the manufacturer for review and input any
44 information, analyses or reports regarding a particular drug reviewed or relied on by the
45 commission in assessing the proposed value of the drug shall be provided to the manufacturer.

47 respect to its drug. The commission may not rely solely on the analysis or research of an outside
48 third party in reaching its determination regarding the proposed value or the reasonableness of
49 the drug pricing.
50 (g) If the commission relies upon a third party to provide cost-effectiveness analysis or
51 research related to the proposed value, such analysis or research shall also provide, without
52 limitation (i) a description of the methodologies and models used by the third party in its
53 analysis; (ii) any assumptions and potential limitations of research findings in the context of the
54 results; and (iii) outcomes for affected subpopulations that utilize the drug, including but not
3 of 8
55 limited to potential impacts on individuals of minority racial or ethnic groups, and on individuals
56 with specific disabilities or health conditions who regularly utilize the eligible drug.
57 (h) Not later than 60 days after receiving information from the manufacturer, as required
58 under subsections (b) or (e), the commission shall issue a determination on whether the
59 manufacturer’s pricing of a drug is unreasonable or excessive in relation to the commission’s
60 proposed value of the drug. Following the determination, the commission shall issue
61 recommendations on measures to reduce the cost of the drug and to improve the affordability of
62 the drug for patients. Recommendations may include, but not be limited to: (i) an alternative
63 purchasing plan or value-based payment methodology; (ii) a bulk purchasing program; (iii)
64 changes to co-pay, deductibles, coinsurance or other cost-sharing requirements; or (iv) a
65 reinsurance program to subsidize the cost of the eligible drug. The commission shall make its
66 determination and recommendations public and shall post them on its website and shall provide
67 them to private and public health care payers.
68 (i) If the manufacturer fails to timely comply with the commission’s request for records
69 under subsections (b) or (e), or otherwise knowingly obstructs the commission’s ability to issue
70 its determination under subsection (h), including, but not limited to, providing incomplete, false
71 or misleading information, the commission may assess a civil penalty to a manufacturer of not
72 more than $500,000. A civil penalty assessed under this subsection shall be deposited into the
73 Payment Reform Fund established pursuant to section 100 of chapter 194 of the acts of 2011.
74 The commission shall seek to promote compliance with this section and shall only impose a civil
75 penalty on the manufacturer as a last resort.
4 of 8
76 (j) Neither the proposed value, nor the analysis produced via the process to determine a
77 proposed value, is intended to be used by MassHealth, health insurance carriers, managed care
78 organizations, accountable care organizations, hospitals or pharmacies to determine whether a
79 treatment should be approved for an individual patient, whether any individual patient should be
80 subjected to step therapy or other utilization management methodology,
81 (k) The commission shall adopt any written policies, procedures or regulations that the
82 commission determines necessary to implement this section.
83 SECTION 3. Section 11N of chapter 12 of the General Laws, as so appearing, is hereby
84 amended by striking out subsection (a) and inserting in place thereof the following subsection:-

116 manufacturing company that fails, without just cause, to provide the requested information
117 within 2 weeks following receipt of the written notice required under this section of not more
