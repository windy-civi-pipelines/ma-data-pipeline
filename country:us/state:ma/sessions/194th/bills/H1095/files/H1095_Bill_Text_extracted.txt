17 Consumer Price Index (CPI). Adjustments will be rounded to the nearest $100.
18 (D) Term life insurance policies shall continue to be excluded from Medicaid eligibility

20 death benefit protection.
21 (E) Every three year, the office of Medicaid shall submit a report to the senate and house
22 committees on ways and means evaluating the financial impact of the increased exemption on
23 the Medicaid program, including any changes in beneficiary access to life insurance policies and
