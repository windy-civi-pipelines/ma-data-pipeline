An Act regulating certain mortgages.
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives in General Court assembled, and by the authority
of the same, as follows:
1 Chapter 167E of the General Laws is hereby amended by adding the following
2 section :-
3 Section 17. (a) An entity , its successors or assigns, may originate or act as an
4 intermediary between originators and borrowers on a shared appreciation mortgage loan,
5 pursuant to a program for shared appreciation mortgage loans which has been submitted to and
6 approved by the Commissioner of Banks, to the owner of real estate improved with a dwelling
7 designed to be occupied by not more than 4 families, provided, however, that the owner shall
8 occupy the mortgaged real estate in whole or in part.
9 (b) Definitions:
10 “shared appreciation mortgage” shall mean a mortgage loan, as defined in section 3
11 of chapter 167E, containing an agreement between a mortgagor and a mortgagee that provides
12 for the mortgagee, its successors or assigns, to share in any appreciation in value (or the option to
1 of 7

13 do so), of the residential property upon the occurrence of a certain event, including but not
14 limited to the transfer of ownership, repayment maturity date, sale of the residential property, or
15 any other event contemplated by such loan agreement.
16 “shared appreciation payment” shall mean the amount of any appreciation in value
17 that the mortgagor is required to pay to the mortgage holder.
18 “appreciation in value” shall be measured as the difference, if positive, between the
19 gross sales proceeds of the sale of the residential property or the appraised value of the property
20 at the time payment in full of the loan is due, and the appraised value of the residential property
21 at the time of the original closing of the shared appreciation mortgage loan, minus the actual cost
22 of any improvements made by the mortgagor. The appraised values in this subsection shall be
23 determined by an appraisal by a state-certified general real estate appraiser or a state-certified
24 residential real estate appraiser as defined by section 178 of chapter 112.
25 a shared appreciation mortgage loan is a residential mortgage loan, as defined in 15
26 U.S.C.§ 1602(dd)(5).
27 (c) The terms of the shared appreciation mortgage loan:
28 shall state that the shared appreciation payment shall not exceed the lesser of:
29 15 per cent of the appreciation value; or
30 15 percent of the value of the property at the time of the consummation of the
31 shared appreciation mortgage loan, as determined by an appraisal of comparable home values by
32 a state-certified general real estate appraiser or a state-certified residential real estate appraiser as
33 defined by section 178 of chapter 112.
2 of 7

34 shall not include a penalty for satisfying or otherwise terminating the mortgage
35 before its scheduled maturity date;
36 shall not restrict or waive the mortgagor’s substantive or procedural rights or
37 remedies at law;
38 shall not be prohibited from refinancing at any given time for the duration of the
39 mortgage;
40 shall require the mortgage holder to agree to subordinate the shared appreciation
41 mortgage upon request and if the borrower qualifies to refinance the first lien mortgage;
42 shall state “Any person who purchases or is otherwise assigned this obligation shall
43 be subject to all claims and defenses that the mortgagor could assert against the original
44 mortgagee;”
45 shall not include confidentiality provisions regarding the terms of the loan;
46 shall not include mandatory arbitration clauses; and
47 shall not become due and owing upon the death of the borrower if the borrower’s
48 heir(s) are living in or intend to live in the property at the time of the borrower’s death. The
49 surviving heir household member(s) shall be able to continue paying on the loan until the loan
50 becomes due and owing in full.
51 (d) Required pre-consummation housing counseling:
52 a shared appreciation mortgage may not be consummated less than 14 calendar
53 days after the mortgagor obtains counseling from a HUD-certified housing counselor;

55 appreciation mortgage loan and alternatives;
56 the mortgagee shall pay the cost of the housing counseling.
57 (e) Notice before consummation of the shared appreciation mortgage: At least 21
58 business days prior to consummating a shared appreciation mortgage, and no less than 3 days
59 before the mortgagor is scheduled to attend housing counseling pursuant to subsection (d) of this
60 section, the mortgage holder shall provide to the mortgagor, in writing, in a form that the
61 mortgagor may keep:
62 all documents to be signed or otherwise provided upon consummation of the shared
63 appreciation mortgage;
64 a clear and conspicuous disclosure, with the format and content to be determined
65 by the Attorney General, stating:

68 setting;
69 the maximum shared appreciation payment the mortgagor will be required to pay at

92 The entity that originated a shared appreciation mortgage loan, and its successors
93 or assigns shall provide notification of transfer of servicing and transfer of ownership of the loan

95 under TILA and the Real Estate Settlement Procures Act (RESPA) 12 U.S.C. 2601 et seq. even if
96 the entity is not otherwise subject to the federal TILA or RESPA.
97 The entity that originated the shared appreciation mortgage loan, and its successors
98 or assigns, and the servicer of the shared appreciation mortgage loan shall act in good faith

6 of 7

116 housing counselor, at the mortgage holder’s expense, for assistance in determining what options
117 are available to remain in the home before any of the shared appreciation amounts can be
118 disbursed.
119 (h) Remedies:
120 If any of the provisions of this Section are violated, the contract shall be void and
121 the mortgagor shall be entitled to actual damages and reasonable attorneys fees.
122 Any shared appreciation agreement which violates any of the provisions of this
123 section is declared void, is a per se violation of the Massachusetts chapter 93A, and is grounds
124 for license revocation.
125 Section 369 of chapter 128 of the Acts of 2024 is hereby repealed
126 The Attorney General shall promulgate regulations necessary to carry out this
127 section and shall be entitled to enforce these regulations, including by recommending to the
