By Representative DuBois of Brockton, a petition (accompanied by bill, House, No. 1146) of
Michelle M. DuBois for legislation to establish a publicly owned and administered trust fund for
receipt of reasonable mortgage payments. Financial Services.
The Commonwealth of Massachusetts
_______________
In the One Hundred and Ninety-Fourth General Court
(2025-2026)
_______________
An Act to establish a Resolution Trust Fund for receipt of reasonable mortgage payments.
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives in General Court assembled, and by the authority
of the same, as follows:
1 Whereas because changes in financial industry practice as to predatory lending have
2 significantly decapitalized the Commonwealth, reduced the tax base of Massachusetts
3 communities, detrimentally affected Massachusetts residents as consumers of predatory
4 mortgage loan products, and made the chain of title of many mortgages of real property
5 untraceable, it is in the interest of the Commonwealth to establish a publicly owned and
6 administered fund authorized to receive assets and monies, including residential mortgages and
7 mortgage payments where the mortgagee and/or note owner cannot be ascertained, and to
8 discharge related functions to help rebuild our economy and municipal tax base, especially in the
9 neighborhoods most affected by predatory lending and concomitant foreclosure.

11 is hereby amended by inserting after section 78 the following sections:-
