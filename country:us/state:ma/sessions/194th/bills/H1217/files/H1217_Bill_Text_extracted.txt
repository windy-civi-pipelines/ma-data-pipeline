2 Insurance Act”.
3 SECTION 2. The Massachusetts general laws, as so appearing, are hereby amended by
4 adding the following new chapter:-
5 “CHAPTER 183
6 Massachusetts Private Flood Insurance Act
7 Section 1. It is the intent of this chapter to foster innovative flood insurance coverages
8 providing insurers the ability to test products in the market and consumers greater choice for
9 flood insurance coverage. It is also the intent of this chapter to instruct the Commissioner to
1 of 12
10 track and report the participation of private flood insurers in the State of Massachusetts through
11 the count of private flood policies from both domestic, foreign and alien, admitted and surplus
12 lines, on a calendar year basis.
13 Section 2. For the purposes of this section:
14 (1) ‘Flood’ means:
15 (a) a general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of two or more
16 acres of normally dry land area or of two or more properties, at least one of which is the
17 policyholder’s property, from:
18 (i) overflow of inland or tidal waters;
19 (ii) unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any source; or
20 (iii) mudflow; or
21 (b) collapse or subsidence of land along the shore of a lake or similar body of water as a
22 result of erosion or undermining caused by waves or currents of water exceeding anticipated
23 cyclical levels that result in a flood as defined in this section.
24 (2) ‘Mudflow’ means a river of liquid and flowing mud on the surfaces of normally dry
25 land areas, as when earth is carried by a current of water. Other earth movements, such as
26 landslide, slope failure, or a saturated soil mass moving by liquidity down a slope, are not
27 mudflows.
28 (3) ‘Private flood insurance’ means personal lines or commercial flood insurance policies
29 or endorsements providing coverage for the peril of flood issued directly by insurers.
2 of 12
30 Section 3. An insurer may issue an insurance policy, contract, or endorsement providing
31 commercial lines or personal lines coverage for the peril of flood or excess coverage for the peril
32 of flood on any structure, on the contents of commercial or personal property contained
33 therein, or to insure against indirect losses from the peril of flood subject to the requirements of
34 this chapter. Any reference to policy in this chapter also includes endorsements that provide
35 private flood insurance coverage.
36 Section 4. (A) Private flood insurance policies issued pursuant to this chapter include:

40 (NFIP) including deductibles, exclusions, and other terms and conditions offered by the insurer.
41 The policy form also must include:
42 (a) information about the availability of flood insurance coverage under the NFIP;
43 (b) a mortgage interest clause substantially similar to the clause contained in a standard
44 flood insurance policy under the NFIP;
45 (c) a provision requiring an insured to file suit no later than one year after the date of a
46 written denial of all or part of a claim under the policy; and
47 (d) cancellation provisions that are as restrictive as the provisions contained in a standard
48 flood insurance policy under the NFIP.
3 of 12
49 (2) ‘Nonstandard flood insurance’, which may, but is not required to, provide coverage
50 designed to supplement a flood policy obtained from the NFIP or from an insurer issuing
51 standard flood insurance pursuant to this section. This includes any other policy issued for the
52 coverage of flood that does not meet the definition of a standard flood insurance policy as
53 defined above. Nonstandard flood insurance also includes policies that have a broader definition
54 of flood than that provided for in Section 2(1) and discretionary acceptance private flood
55 insurance as provided for in 12 C.F.R. Part 208.25.

61 is not a policy from the NFIP.

63 pursuant to this chapter shall file with the Commissioner all rates and supplementary rate

76 upon by the insurer to support the multiplier and any modifications to loss costs subject to the
77 use and file provisions of this section.
78 (3) Licensees shall establish loss costs and multipliers for expenses based on actuarial
79 data, methodologies, and standards and guidelines relating to flood insurance that produce rates

147 endorsement must contain a provision stating that it meets the private flood insurance
148 requirements specified in 42 U.S.C. Section 4012a(b) and may not contain provisions that, when
149 taken as a whole, are not in compliance with 42 U.S.C. Section 4012a(b).
150 (B) The admitted insurer or its agent may reference or include a certification pursuant to

158 chapter; or
159 (2) misrepresents the scope of the coverage of the flood insurance policy, contract, or
160 endorsement commits an unfair or deceptive act pursuant to Chapter 176D and is subject to the
161 penalties set forth in this chapter.
162 Section 12. (A) The insurer shall give written notice forty five days before cancellation or
163 nonrenewal of private flood insurance coverage to:
164 (1) the insured; and

188 (4) Notwithstanding the provisions of item (1), an insurer only may cancel a standard
189 flood insurance policy in accordance with 42 U.S.C. Section 4012a(b).
190 Section 13. (A) If an insurer intends to renew a policy, the insurer shall furnish renewal
191 terms and a statement of the amount of premium or estimated premium due for the renewal
10 of 12
192 policy period in the manner required by this section.
193 (B) If the policy being renewed (original policy) is written for a term of one year or less,

223 The count of policies, and the report from the Commissioner, shall not report any proprietary
224 rating information, insured information, insured address or other proprietary information. The
225 insurer may, at their option, report to the Commissioner the geographic location, region or any
226 other information. The only required information from the insurers to the Commissioner shall be
227 the number of policies in force in the current calendar year. The Commissioner shall publish the
228 report annually for the public to view.
229 SECTION 16. This act becomes effective sixty days following approval by the Governor.
230 Insurers that are writing private flood insurance at the time of enactment have an additional one
231 hundred twenty days to come into compliance with the requirements of this act."

116 b, Section 168 of Chapter 175 of the General Laws.
117 Section 8. (A) In addition to any other applicable requirements pursuant to this title, any

133 admitted or surplus lines insurer, an insurance producer, broker, or the insurer shall provide a
134 written notice to the applicant advising that if the applicant discontinues coverage under the
135 NFIP, which is provided at a subsidized rate, the full risk rate for flood insurance may
136 apply to the property if the applicant later seeks to reinstate coverage under the program.
137 (B) This section only applies if the applicant lives in a special flood hazard area. The
138 producer, broker, or insurer shall retain this notice for three years. This section automatically

140 insurance and NFIP coverage without penalty.
141 Section 10. With respect to the regulation of private flood insurance written in this State
142 by authorized insurers, this title controls if there is a conflict between this title and any other
143 applicable state law.
144 Section 11. (A) An admitted insurer offering flood insurance may certify that a policy,
145 contract, or endorsement provides coverage for the peril of flood which equals or exceeds the
146 flood coverage offered by the NFIP. To be eligible for certification, the policy, contract, or
147 endorsement must contain a provision stating that it meets the private flood insurance
148 requirements specified in 42 U.S.C. Section 4012a(b) and may not contain provisions that, when
149 taken as a whole, are not in compliance with 42 U.S.C. Section 4012a(b).
150 (B) The admitted insurer or its agent may reference or include a certification pursuant to
151 subsection (A) in advertising or communications with an agent, a lending institution, an insured,
152 or a potential insured only for a policy, contract, or endorsement that is certified pursuant to this
153 section. The admitted insurer may include a statement that notifies an insured of the certification
8 of 12

154 on the declarations page or other policy documentation related to flood coverage certified
155 pursuant to this section.
156 (C) An insurer or agency who knowingly:
157 (1) misrepresents that a flood policy, contract, or endorsement is certified pursuant to this
158 chapter; or
159 (2) misrepresents the scope of the coverage of the flood insurance policy, contract, or
160 endorsement commits an unfair or deceptive act pursuant to Chapter 176D and is subject to the
161 penalties set forth in this chapter.
162 Section 12. (A) The insurer shall give written notice forty five days before cancellation or
163 nonrenewal of private flood insurance coverage to:
164 (1) the insured; and
165 (2) the federally supervised institution that made the designated loan secured by the
166 property covered by the private flood insurance, or the servicer acting on its behalf, if any.
167 (B) The notice must:
168 (1) be filed with the Commissioner or their designee;
169 (2) state the date no less than forty five days for any cancellation or nonrenewal; and
170 (3) inform the insured of its right to request a review by the division of insurance.
171 (C)(1) An insurer may cancel or refuse to issue or renew a private flood insurance policy,
172 except for the reasons set forth below:

181 (i) income level; or
182 (j) lawful occupation, including the military service of the person seeking the coverage.
183 (2) Nothing in this section prohibits an insurer from limiting the issuance of private flood
184 insurance policies covered in this chapter only to persons engaging in or who have engaged in a
185 particular profession or occupation, or who are members of a particular religious sect.
186 (3) Nothing in this section prohibits an insurer from refusing to issue private flood
187 insurance policies due to the exposure of flood.
188 (4) Notwithstanding the provisions of item (1), an insurer only may cancel a standard
189 flood insurance policy in accordance with 42 U.S.C. Section 4012a(b).
190 Section 13. (A) If an insurer intends to renew a policy, the insurer shall furnish renewal
191 terms and a statement of the amount of premium or estimated premium due for the renewal
10 of 12

192 policy period in the manner required by this section.
193 (B) If the policy being renewed (original policy) is written for a term of one year or less,

195 insured no less than forty five days prior to the expiration date of the original policy.
196 (C) If the original policy is written for a term of more than one year or for an indefinite
197 term, the renewal terms and statement of premium or estimated premium due must be furnished
198 to the insured no less than forty five days prior to the anniversary date of the original policy.
199 (D) The insurer may satisfy its obligation to furnish renewal terms and statement of
200 premium or estimated premium due by either of the following methods:
201 (1) mailing or delivering renewal terms and statement to the insured via electronic
202 delivery in accordance with Massachusetts law, at the address shown in the policy or, if not

204 anniversary; or
205 (2) mailing or delivering renewal terms and statement to the producer or broker of record,
206 if any, no less than sixty days prior to expiration or anniversary, along with instructions that the
207 agent or broker furnish the renewal terms and statement to the insured no less than forty five
208 days prior to expiration or anniversary.
209 (E) If the insurer fails to furnish the renewal terms and statement of premium or
210 estimated premium due in the manner required by this section, the insured may elect to cancel
211 the renewal policy within the forty five day period following receipt of the renewal terms and
11 of 12

212 statement of premium or estimated premium due. Earned premium for any period of
213 coverage must be calculated pro rata based upon the premium applicable to the original policy
214 and not the premium applicable to the renewal policy.
215 Section 14. The department is authorized to promulgate by bulletin, order, or regulation
216 the requirements necessary to implement the requirements of this chapter.”
217 Section 15. The Insurance Commissioner shall, on an annual basis, report the number of
218 private flood policies in effect in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. The Commissioner shall
219 obtain this information by requesting it from private flood insurance companies. Admitted
220 insurers shall be required to report to the Commissioner the number of private flood policies the
221 insurer has in force. For non-admitted insurers, the Commissioner shall strongly encourage the
222 insurers to participate in the count of the number of private flood policies in force in the State.
223 The count of policies, and the report from the Commissioner, shall not report any proprietary
224 rating information, insured information, insured address or other proprietary information. The
225 insurer may, at their option, report to the Commissioner the geographic location, region or any
226 other information. The only required information from the insurers to the Commissioner shall be
227 the number of policies in force in the current calendar year. The Commissioner shall publish the
228 report annually for the public to view.
229 SECTION 16. This act becomes effective sixty days following approval by the Governor.
230 Insurers that are writing private flood insurance at the time of enactment have an additional one
231 hundred twenty days to come into compliance with the requirements of this act."
