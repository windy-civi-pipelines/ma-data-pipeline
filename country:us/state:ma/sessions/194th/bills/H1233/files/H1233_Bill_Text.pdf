An Act relative to insurance company rebates.
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives in General Court assembled, and by the authority
of the same, as follows:
1 SECTION 1. Chapter 175 of the General Laws is amended by striking out section 182, as
2 appearing in the 2020 Official Edition, and inserting in place thereof the following section:
3 Section 182. No company, no officer or agent thereof and no insurance broker shall pay or allow,
4 or offer to pay or allow, in connection with placing or negotiating any policy of insurance or any
5 annuity or pure endowment contract or the continuance or renewal thereof, any valuable
6 consideration or inducement in an amount greater than twenty five dollars not specified in the
7 policy or contract, or any special favor or advantage in the dividends or other benefits to accrue
8 thereon; or shall give, sell or purchase, or offer to give, sell or purchase, anything of value
9 whatsoever in an amount greater than twenty five dollars not specified in the policy; or shall
10 give, sell, negotiate, deliver, issue, or authorize to issue or offer to give, sell, negotiate, deliver,
11 issue, or authorize to issue any policy of workers' compensation insurance, or any motor vehicle
1 of 5

12 liability bond or any motor vehicle liability policy, both as defined in section thirty-four A of
13 chapter ninety, at a rate different from that fixed, established or approved by the commissioner.
14 Valuable consideration or inducement shall not include any products or services provided at no
15 or a reduced cost by or through an insurance company, insurance agent, or third party
16 representative, when such products or services are not specified in the policy of insurance, if the
17 products or services relate to the insurance coverage and are primarily designed to satisfy one or
18 more of the following: (i) provide loss mitigation or loss control; (ii) reduce claim costs or claim
19 settlement costs; (iii) provide education about liability risks or risk of loss to persons or property;
20 (iv) monitor or assess risk, identify sources of risk, or develop strategies for eliminating or
21 reducing risk; (v) provide administrative services; (vi) enhance health; (vii) enhance financial
22 wellness through items such as education or financial planning services; (viii) provide post-loss
23 services; (ix) incent behavioral changes to improve the health or reduce the risk of death or
24 disability of a customer (defined for purposes of this section as policyholder, potential
25 policyholder, certificate holder, potential certificate holder, insured, potential insured or
26 applicant); or (x) assist in the administration of the employee or retiree benefit insurance
27 coverage.
28 No such company, officer, agent or broker shall at any time pay or allow, or offer to pay
29 or allow, any rebate of any premium paid or payable on any policy of insurance or any annuity or
30 pure endowment contract. Nothing in this chapter shall prevent any life company from making
31 supplemental agreements, not specified in the policy, which give the policy owner or insured the
32 right to borrow money from the life company in connection with a student loan insurance
33 program, pursuant to United States Public Law 89â€“329, or pursuant to any similar federal statute;
2 of 5

34 provided, however, that such loans are to be made, issued, assumed or guaranteed by the United
35 States of America or any instrumentality thereof, or by any state of the United States.
36 SECTION 2. Said chapter 175 is hereby further amended by striking out section 183, as
37 appearing in the 2020 official edition, and inserting in its place thereof the following section:-
38 Section 183. No person shall receive or accept from any company or officer or agent thereof, or
39 any insurance broker, or any other person, any such rebate of premium paid or payable on the
40 policy or contract, or any special favor or advantage in the dividends or other benefits to accrue
41 thereon, or any valuable consideration as an inducement in an amount greater than twenty five
42 dollars not specified in the policy or contract or any policy of workers compensation insurance,
43 or any motor vehicle liability bond or any motor vehicle liability policy, both as defined in
44 section 34A of chapter 90, at a rate different from that fixed, established or approved by the
45 commissioner. Valuable consideration or inducement shall not include any products or services
46 provided at no or a reduced cost by or through an insurance company, insurance agent, or third
47 party representative, when such products or services are not specified in the policy of insurance,
48 if the products or services relate to the insurance coverage and are primarily designed to satisfy
49 one or more of the following: (i) provide loss mitigation or loss control; (ii) reduce claim costs or
50 claim settlement costs; (iii) provide education about liability risks or risk of loss to persons or
51 property; (iv) monitor or assess risk, identify sources of risk, or develop strategies for eliminating
52 or reducing risk; (v) provide administrative services; (vi) enhance health; (vii) enhance financial
53 wellness through items such as education or financial planning services; (viii) provide post-loss
54 services; (ix) incent behavioral changes to improve the health or reduce the risk of death or
55 disability of a customer (defined for purposes of this section as policyholder, potential
56 policyholder, certificate holder, potential certificate holder, insured, potential insured or
3 of 5

57 applicant); or (x) assist in the administration of the employee or retiree benefit insurance
58 coverage. No person shall be excused from testifying, or from producing any books, papers,
59 contracts, agreements or documents at the trial of any other person charged with violating any
60 provision of this and the preceding section, on the ground that such testimony or evidence may
61 tend to incriminate himself; but no person shall be prosecuted for any act concerning which he
62 shall be compelled so to testify or produce evidence, documentary or otherwise, except for
63 perjury committed in so testifying.
64 SECTION 3. Section 3 of chapter 176D of the General Laws, as appearing in the 2020
65 Official Edition, is hereby amended by striking out the first paragraph of subsection (8) and
66 inserting in place thereof following: (8) Rebates: Except as otherwise expressly provided by law,
67 knowingly permitting or offering to make or making any insurance contract, including but not
68 limited to a contract for life insurance, life annuity or accident and health insurance, or
69 agreement as to such contract other than as plainly expressed in the insurance contract issued
70 thereon, or paying or allowing, or giving or offering to pay, allow, or give, directly or indirectly,
