29 Section 2. If a qualified individual has reasonable cause to believe that the financial
30 exploitation of an eligible adult may have occurred, may have been attempted, or is being
31 attempted, then the qualified individual shall promptly notify the Secretary and any relevant
32 adult protective services agency.
33 Section 3. The notification required by section 2 must be made by written communication
34 or by form as issued by the Secretary. Such notice shall include, to the extent possible: (1) the
35 name and address of the eligible adult; (2) the name and address of the eligible adult's caretaker;

42 attempted, then a qualified individual may notify any third party previously designated by the
43 eligible adult; provided, however, that a qualified individual shall not notify any designated third
44 party that is suspected of the financial exploitation or other abuse of the eligible adult.
45 Section 5. (1) A financial institution may delay a disbursement from, or a transaction in

50 the eligible adult.

52 financial institution shall: (a) immediately, and in no event more than two business days after the
53 requested disbursement or transaction was delayed, provide written notification of the delay and
54 the reason for the delay to all parties authorized to transact business on the account, unless
55 there is reasonable cause to believe such party engaged in the suspected or attempted
56 financial exploitation of the eligible adult; (b) immediately, and in no event more than two
57 business days after the requested disbursement or transaction was delayed, notify the Secretary
58 and any relevant adult protective services agency pursuant to section 3; and (c) continue an

60 necessary, and report the investigation's results to the Secretary and any relevant adult protective
61 services agency within 7 business days of the requested disbursement or transaction.
62 (3) The authorization of any delay of a disbursement or transaction pursuant to this
63 section shall expire upon the sooner of: (a) the determination by the financial institution that the
64 disbursement or transaction will not result in the financial exploitation of the eligible adult; or (b)
65 15 business days after the date on which the financial institution first delayed the requested
66 disbursement or transaction. A court of competent jurisdiction may enter an order extending the
67 delay of a disbursement or transaction under this section, or may order other protective relief,
68 upon the petition of the Secretary; adult protective services agency; a financial institution that
69 initiated the delay under this section; or other interested party.
70 Section 6. A financial institution shall provide access to or copies of records that are

73 may include historical records and records pertaining to a disbursement or transaction related to
74 the suspected or attempted financial exploitation of an eligible adult. Records made available
75 pursuant to this section shall not be public records and shall not be available for public
76 examination.
77 Section 7. Nothing in this chapter shall limit or otherwise impede the authority of the
78 Secretary from accessing or examining the books and records of a broker-dealer or investment
79 adviser as otherwise provided by law or conducting any lawful investigation into potential
80 violations of chapter 110A.
81 Section 8. A qualified individual that, in good faith and exercising reasonable care,
82 complies with this chapter shall be immune from any administrative or civil liability that might
83 otherwise arise from such action. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this section shall

85 any claim, or for reasonable attorneys' fees, costs, and litigation expenses related to such claim,
86 for participating in or materially aiding the financial exploitation of an eligible adult. Any such
87 civil claim may be asserted by the eligible adult, or on his or her behalf by an appropriate
88 guardian or representative who is not involved in or otherwise suspected of participating in the
89 financial exploitation of the eligible adult, by filing a civil action in a court of competent
90 jurisdiction.
