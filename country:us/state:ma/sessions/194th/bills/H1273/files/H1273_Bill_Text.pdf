32 (b) Nothing in this section shall limit the right of any individual or entity who has been

34 licensee or exempt person under section 24A of this chapter, to bring an action to recover

44 (1) to prohibit the person from performing in the capacity of a principal employee on
45 behalf of any licensee for a period of time that the commissioner deems necessary;
46 (2) to prohibit the person from applying for or obtaining a license from the commissioner

3 of 51

53 (b) A written notice issued under subsection (a) shall contain a written statement of the
54 facts that support the prohibition and shall give notice of an opportunity for a hearing to be held
55 thereon. The hearing shall be fixed for a date not more than 30 days after the date of service upon
56 the commissioner of the request for a hearing. If the person fails to submit a request for a hearing
57 within 20 days of service of notice under subsection (a), or otherwise fails to appear in person or
58 by a duly authorized representative, the party shall be deemed to have consented to the issuance
59 of an order of prohibition in accordance with the notice.
60 (c) In the event of a consent under subsection (b), or if after a hearing the commissioner
61 finds that any of the grounds specified in the notice have been established, the commissioner
62 may issue an order of prohibition in accordance with subsection (a) as the commissioner finds
63 appropriate.
64 (d) An order issued under subsection (b) or (c) shall be effective upon service upon the
65 person. The commissioner shall also serve a copy of the order upon the licensee of which the
66 person is an employee or on whose behalf the person is performing. The order shall remain in
67 effect and enforceable until it is modified, terminated, suspended, or set aside by the
68 commissioner or a court of competent jurisdiction.
69 (e) Except as consented to in writing by the commissioner, any person who, pursuant to
70 an order issued under subsection (b) or (c), has been prohibited from participating in whole or in
71 part in the conduct of the affairs of a debt collector or a third party loan servicer in Massachusetts
72 may not, while the order is in effect, continue or commence to perform in the capacity of a
73 principal employee, or otherwise participate in any manner, if so prohibited by order of the
74 commissioner, in the conduct of the affairs of:
4 of 51

75 (1) any licensee or registrant under this chapter;
76 (2) any other business which requires a license from the commissioner; and
77 (3) any bank, as defined under section one of chapter one hundred sixty-seven, or any
78 subsidiary thereof.
79 SECTION 5. Section 99 of chapter 140 of the General Laws, as so appearing, is hereby
80 amended by striking out section 99 and inserting in place thereof the following section:—
81 Section 99. A licensee shall, when directed by the commissioner, permit the
82 commissioner or the commissioner’s duly authorized representative to inspect its records and
83 evidence of compliance with this chapter or any rule and regulation issued thereunder and with
84 any other law, rule and regulation applicable to the conduct of its business. The commissioner
85 shall preserve a full record of each examination of a licensee including a statement of its
86 condition. All records of investigations and reports of examinations by the commissioner,
87 including workpapers, information derived from the reports or responses to the reports, and any
88 copies thereof in the possession of any licensee under the supervision of the commissioner, shall
89 be confidential and privileged communications, shall not be subject to subpoena and shall not be
90 a public record under clause twenty-sixth of section 7 of chapter 4. For the purpose of this
91 paragraph, records of investigation and reports of examinations shall include records of
92 investigation and reports of examinations conducted by a financial regulatory agency of the
93 federal government and any other state, and of any foreign government which are considered
94 confidential by the agency or foreign government and which are in possession of the
95 commissioner. In any proceeding before a court, the court may issue a protective order to seal the
96 record protecting the confidentiality of any such record, and other than any such record on file
5 of 51

97 with the court or filed in connection with the court proceeding, and the court may exclude the
98 public from any portion of a proceeding at which any such record may be disclosed. Copies of
99 reports of examination shall be furnished to a licensee for its use only and shall not be exhibited
100 to any other person, organization or agency without prior written approval by the commissioner.
101 The commissioner may, in his or her discretion, furnish to regulatory agencies of the federal
102 government, of other states, or of foreign countries, and any law enforcement agency, the
103 information, reports, inspections and statements relating to the licensees under the
104 commissioner’s supervision.
105 The commissioner may summon licensees, companies or associations, or any of their
106 agents or employees, and other witnesses as necessary, and examine them relative to their
107 transactions and to the condition of their business, and for that purpose may administer oaths.
108 Whoever without justifiable cause refuses to appear and testify when so required, or obstructs the
109 commissioner or the commissioner’s representatives in the performance of their duties, shall be
110 punished by a fine of not more than $1,000 or by imprisonment for not more than 6 months, or
111 both. The penalty provision of this section shall be in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other
112 provision of law applicable to a licensee or other person for violating section 96 or any rule or
113 regulation made thereunder.
114 SECTION 6. Section 103 Chapter 140 of the General Laws, as so appearing, is hereby
115 amended by striking out section 103, and inserting in place thereof the following three
116 sections:—
117 Section 103. The commissioner may suspend or revoke any license issued pursuant to
118 section ninety-six if the commissioner finds that:
6 of 51

119 (i) the licensee has violated any provision of sections ninety-six to one hundred and
120 fourteen, inclusive, or any rule or regulation made by the commissioner under any provision of
121 sections ninety-six to one hundred and fourteen, inclusive, or any other law applicable to the
122 conduct of the business; or
123 (ii) any fact or condition exists which, if it had existed at the time of the original
124 application for the license, would have warranted the commissioner in refusing to issue the
125 license.
126 Except as provided in section one hundred and three A, no license shall be revoked or
127 suspended except after notice and a hearing thereon pursuant to chapter thirty A.
128 A licensee may surrender a license by delivering to the commissioner written notice that
129 it thereby surrenders the license, but the surrender shall not affect the civil or criminal liability of
130 the licensee for acts committed before the surrender.
131 No revocation, suspension or surrender of any license shall impair or affect the obligation
132 of any pre-existing lawful contract between the licensee and any person.
133 The penalty provision of this section shall be in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other
134 provision of law applicable to a licensee or other person for violating section ninety-six, ninety-
135 seven, ninety-eight, one hundred, one hundred and one, one hundred and two, one hundred and
136 four, one hundred and six, and one hundred and nine or any rule or regulation made thereunder.
137 Section 103A. (a) If the commissioner determines, after giving notice of an opportunity
138 for a hearing, that a licensee has engaged or is about to engage in an act or practice constituting a
139 violation of a provision of sections ninety-seven, ninety-eight, one hundred, one hundred and
7 of 51

140 one, one hundred and two, one hundred and four or one hundred and nine, or any rule or
141 regulation made by the commissioner under section ninety-seven or one hundred and six, or any
142 other law applicable to the conduct of the business, the commissioner may order the licensee to
143 cease and desist from the unlawful act or practice and take affirmative action as in his or her
144 judgment will effect the purpose of sections ninety-seven, ninety-eight, one hundred, one
145 hundred and one, one hundred and two, one hundred and four or one hundred and nine, or any
146 rule or regulation made by the commissioner under section ninety-seven or one hundred and six,
147 or any other law applicable to the conduct of the business.
148 (b) If the commissioner makes written findings of fact that the public interest will be
149 irreparably harmed by delay in issuing an order under section (a) the commissioner may issue a
150 temporary cease and desist order. Upon the entry of a temporary cease and desist order, the
151 commissioner shall promptly notify, in writing, the licensee affected thereby that the order has
152 been so entered, the reasons therefor, and that within 20 days after receipt of a written request
153 from the licensee, the matter will be scheduled for a hearing to determine whether or not the
154 temporary order shall become permanent and final. If no hearing is requested and none is
155 ordered by the commissioner, the order shall remain in effect until it is modified or vacated by
156 the commissioner. If a hearing is requested or ordered, the commissioner, after giving notice of
157 and opportunity for a hearing to the licensee subject to the order, shall, by written finding of facts
158 and conclusions of law, vacate, modify or make permanent the order.
159 (c) No order under this section, except an order issued pursuant to subsection (b), may be
160 entered without prior notice of and opportunity for a hearing. The commissioner may vacate or
161 modify an order under this section upon finding that the conditions which required the order
162 have changed and that it is in the public interest to so vacate or modify.
8 of 51

163 Any order issued pursuant to this section shall be subject to review as provided in chapter
164 thirty A.
165 Section 103B. The commissioner may enforce the provisions of section ninety-six
166 through one hundred and fourteen A, or restrain any violations thereof, by filing a civil action in
167 any court of competent jurisdiction.
168 SECTION 7. Chapter 140 of the General Laws, as so appearing, is hereby amended by
169 adding after section 113 the following two sections:—
170 Section 113A. (a) Whenever the commissioner finds that any licensee or exempt person
171 under section ninety-six of this chapter has violated any provision of this chapter or any rule or
172 regulation adopted thereunder, or any other law of the Commonwealth applicable to the conduct
173 of the business of making small loans, the commissioner may, by order, in addition to any other
174 action authorized under this chapter or any rule or regulation made thereunder, impose a penalty
175 upon the person which shall not exceed $5,000 for each violation, up to a maximum of $100,000
176 for the violation plus the costs of investigation. The commissioner may impose a penalty which
177 shall not exceed $5,000 for each violation of this chapter, or any rule or regulation adopted
178 thereunder, by a person other than a licensee or exempt person under section ninety-six of this
179 chapter, plus the costs of investigation.
180 (b)In addition to any other action authorized under this chapter or any rule of regulation
181 made thereunder, a licensee who violates the provisions of section one hundred may also be
182 punished by imprisonment for not more than one year. Each day the violation occurs or
183 continues shall be deemed a separate offense. Any loan made by any person so licensed in
9 of 51

184 violation of section one hundred may be declared void by the supreme judicial or superior court
185 in equity upon petition by the person to whom the loan was made.
186 (c) Nothing in this section shall limit the right of any individual or entity who has been
187 injured as a result of any violation of this chapter by a licensee, or any person other than a
188 licensee or exempt person under section ninety-six of this chapter, to bring an action to recover
189 damages or restitution in a court of competent jurisdiction.
190 (d) Any findings or order issued by the commissioner pursuant to this section shall be
191 subject to review as provided in chapter thirty A.
192 Section 113B. (a) Whenever the commissioner determines that any person has, directly or
193 indirectly, violated any section of this chapter or any rule or regulation adopted thereunder,
194 applicable to the conduct of the business of making small loans; or any order issued by the
195 commissioner under this chapter or any written agreement entered between the licensee and the
196 commissioner; the commissioner may serve upon the person a written notice of intention:
197 (1) to prohibit the person from performing in the capacity of a principal employee on
198 behalf of any licensee for a period of time that the commissioner deems necessary;
199 (2) to prohibit the person from applying for or obtaining a license from the commissioner
200 for a period up to 36 months following the effective date of an order issued under subsection (b)

208 thereon. The hearing shall be fixed for a date not more than 30 days after the date of service upon
209 the commissioner of the request for a hearing. If the person fails to submit a request for a hearing
210 within 20 days of service of notice under subsection (a), or otherwise fails to appear in person or
211 by a duly authorized representative, the party shall be deemed to have consented to the issuance
212 of an order of prohibition in accordance with the notice.
213 (c) In the event of a consent under subsection (b), or if after a hearing the commissioner
214 finds that any of the grounds specified in the notice have been established, the commissioner
215 may issue an order of prohibition in accordance with subsection (a) as the commissioner finds
216 appropriate.
217 (d) An order issued under subsection (b) or (c) shall be effective upon service upon the
218 person. The commissioner shall also serve a copy of the order upon the licensee of which the
219 person is an employee or on whose behalf the person is performing. The order shall remain in
220 effect and enforceable until it is modified, terminated, suspended, or set aside by the
221 commissioner or a court of competent jurisdiction.
222 (e) Except as consented to in writing by the commissioner, any person who, pursuant to
223 an order issued under subsection (b) or (c), has been prohibited from participating in whole or in
224 part in the conduct of the affairs of a business making small loans in Massachusetts may not,

239 to one hundred fourteen, inclusive; provided, that the institutions may not take, receive, reserve
240 or charge interest, expenses and other considerations for making or securing any loan subject to

252 savings and loan association, or credit union organized under the laws of any other state making
253 such a loan shall be subject to a fine of not more than $1,000.
254 This section shall not be construed as preventing a rate of charge for interest, expenses
255 and other consideration on one or more portions of a loan in excess of the permitted maximum
256 rate of charge applicable to the portion or portions, provided, that the composite rate of charge on
257 the whole loan produces an amount equal to or less than that which would be produced were the
258 maximum rate of charge applied to the loan. Extension, default or deferment charges shall not be
259 deemed to be interest, expenses and other considerations in determining the maximum rate of
260 charge that may be taken, received, reserved or charged for the loan.
261 SECTION 9. Section 4 of chapter 167F of the General Laws, as amended by section 5 of
262 chapter 144 of the acts of 2012, is hereby amended by striking out the first paragraph and
263 inserting in place thereof the following paragraph:—
264 Any bank as defined in section one of chapter one hundred sixty-seven, a national
265 banking association, a federally-chartered credit union, a federal savings and loan association, a
266 federal savings bank, or any subsidiary of the above, any bank, trust company, savings bank,

269 checks or money orders for use primarily for personal, family, or household purposes, except all
13 of 51

270 of the institutions described above may engage in the business through agents who shall not be
271 deemed to be branches of the institutions. No person, other than the foregoing, shall engage in

274 institutions described above, authorized to receive money and transact such business on the
275 person’s behalf is filed annually, as of a date determined by the commissioner.

278 The commissioner shall examine any person, to whom a certificate to engage in the
279 business of selling, issuing or registering checks or money orders has been issued, as the
280 commissioner deems necessary and in a manner the commissioner deems appropriate. The
281 commissioner shall preserve a full record of each examination of a check seller including a
282 statement of its condition. All records of investigations and reports of examinations by the
283 commissioner, including workpapers, information derived from the reports or responses to the
284 reports, and any copies thereof in the possession of any licensee under the supervision of the
285 commissioner, shall be confidential and privileged communications, shall not be subject to
286 subpoena and shall not be a public record under clause twenty-sixth of section 7 of chapter 4. For
287 the purpose of this paragraph, records of investigation and reports of examinations shall include
288 records of investigation and reports of examinations conducted by a financial regulatory agency
289 of the federal government and any other state, and of any foreign government which are
290 considered confidential by the agency or foreign government and which are in possession of the
291 commissioner. In any proceeding before a court, the court may issue a protective order to seal the
292 record protecting the confidentiality of any such record, other than any such record on file with
14 of 51

293 the court or filed in connection with the court proceeding, and the court may exclude the public

296 to any other person, organization or agency without prior written approval by the commissioner.
297 The commissioner may, in his or her discretion, furnish to regulatory agencies of the federal
298 government, of other states, or of foreign countries, and any law enforcement agency, the

300 commissioner’s supervision.
301 The commissioner, or the commissioner’s examiners or other assistants as the
302 commissioner may designate, may summon the directors, officers or agents of a licensee, or any
303 other witnesses, and examine them relative to the affairs, transactions and condition of the
304 licensee, and, for that purpose, may administer oaths. Whoever, without justifiable cause, refuses
305 to appear and testify when so required or obstructs the person making the examination in the
306 performance of their duty, shall be punished by a fine of not more than $1,000 or by
307 imprisonment for not more than one year.
308 SECTION 11. Said section 4 of chapter 167F of the General Laws, as so appearing, is
309 hereby further amended by striking out the fifth paragraph.

772 chapter if the commissioner finds that:
773 (i) the licensee has violated any provision of this chapter or any rule or regulation
774 adopted hereunder, or any other law applicable to the conduct of its business; or
775 (ii) any fact or condition exists which, if it had existed at the time of the original
776 application for the license, would have warranted the commissioner in refusing to issue the
777 license.
778 The commissioner shall have sufficient cause to suspend or revoke a license whenever
779 the commissioner learns from the commissioner of insurance or from any other source that the
780 licensee has failed to return the full amount of a return premium to the person whose insurance

782 seventy-six A of chapter one hundred and seventy-five.
783 A licensee may surrender a license by delivering to the commissioner written notice that
784 it thereby surrenders the license, but the surrender shall not affect the civil or criminal liability of

791 forthwith execute in duplicate a written order to that effect, and shall file one copy of the order in
792 the office of the secretary of state and mail one copy to the licensee. A suspension or revocation

795 a hearing, that a licensee has engaged in or is about to engage in an act or practice constituting a
796 violation of a provision of this chapter or a rule, regulation or order hereunder, the commissioner
797 may order the licensee to cease and desist from the unlawful act or practice and take affirmative
798 action as in his or her judgment will effect the purposes of this chapter.
799 (b) If the commissioner makes written findings of fact that the public interest will be
800 irreparably harmed by delay in issuing an order under subsection (a) the commissioner may issue
801 a temporary cease and desist order. Upon the entry of a temporary cease and desist order, the
802 commissioner shall promptly notify, in writing, the licensee affected thereby that the order has
803 been so entered, the reasons therefor, and that within 2 days after the receipt of a written request

847 imprisonment for not more than one year.

1076 licensee, and, for that purpose, may administer oaths. Whoever, without justifiable cause, refuses
1077 to appear and testify when so required or obstructs the person making the examination in the
1078 performance of their duty, shall be punished by a fine of not more than $1,000 or by
1079 imprisonment for not more than one year.
