21 coverage for:
22 General liability risks associated with AV operations, including testing and deployment.
23 Product liability to address claims from defects in autonomous technology.
24 Cybersecurity risks, including unauthorized access, hacking, and operational disruptions.
25 Personal Injury Protection (PIP), consistent with the Commonwealth’s no-fault insurance
26 laws.
27 Uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage.
28 (b) The DOI shall establish minimum coverage amounts, with specific thresholds for

43 systems capable of identifying individuals within 50 feet of a crosswalk and stopping when a
44 pedestrian is detected.
45 (c) Prohibition on Testing During Active School Hours: Testing of AVs in school zones
46 is prohibited during active school hours or high pedestrian traffic periods unless permitted by

52 operational requirements for autonomous vehicles, provided such requirements are:
53 Consistent with state regulations established under this act;
