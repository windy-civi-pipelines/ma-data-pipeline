12 and any insurer licensed to write and engaged in the writing of homeowners’ insurance shall
13 provide the following coverage to owners of residential property to whom a homeowners’
14 insurance policy is issued or renewed: (i) first-party property coverage for response action costs
15 incurred under chapter 21E or chapter 21K or any regulation promulgated pursuant to said
16 chapter 21E or chapter 21K and property damage on the insured’s residential property caused by
17 or in response to a release of heating oil from a residential liquid fuel tank or any piping, fuel

23 any associated personal property damage. For the purposes of this section, third-party liability
24 coverage shall include: (i) the obligation to defend the insured at the insurer’s expense against

39 failure to comply with the requirements of said subsection (b) or subsection (c) of section 38J of
40 chapter 148, or any regulations promulgated pursuant to said subsection (b) or said subsection (c)
41 of said section 38J of said chapter 148; provided, however, that the joint underwriting association
