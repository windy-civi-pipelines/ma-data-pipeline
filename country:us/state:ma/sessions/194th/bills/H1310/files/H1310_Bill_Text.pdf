2 section:-

5 “Program”, the municipal vulnerability preparedness plus grant program, or MVP plus
6 program, established in this section.
7 (b) The secretary shall develop and support a municipal vulnerability preparedness plus
8 grant program, to be known as the MVP plus program. Municipalities that are certified as MVP
9 plus communities shall annually receive a share of the funds deposited into the Municipal
10 Vulnerability Preparedness Trust Fund. Municipalities shall use their share of the funds for
11 climate resilience projects approved by the executive office or to hire personnel who implement
12 and manage climate resilience and sustainability projects; provided, that the project approval
1 of 8

13 process shall be designed to minimize burdens on municipalities and that projects not approved
14 or denied within 30 days shall be deemed approved; provided further, that municipalities may
15 use funds for regional projects or for personnel shared with one or more other municipalities; and
16 provided further, that municipalities may use funds to contract with regional planning
17 agencies,nonprofit watershed associations, or other nonprofit entities for the management of
18 regional projects.
19 The executive office shall establish a formula for the disbursement of funds from the
20 Municipal Vulnerability Preparedness Trust Fund to MVP plus-certified communities. Variables
21 and weighted proportions of the formula shall include, but not be limited to: (i) the road mileage
22 within the municipality; (ii) the total population of the municipality; (iii) the total number of
23 employed individuals within the borders of the municipality; (iv) the Centers for Disease Control
24 and Prevention’s Social Vulnerability Index scores for census tracts within the municipality; and
25 (v) the proportion of the municipality that lies within an area that is designated as a special flood
26 hazard area by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or the proportion of the
27 municipality that is vulnerable to flooding according to a different measure approved by the
28 secretary that is at least as inclusive as the special flood hazard area designation.
29 (c) Municipalities seeking designation as an MVP plus community shall file an
30 application in a form and manner to be prescribed by secretary. To qualify as a MVP plus
31 community, a municipality shall: (1) complete the community-led resilience building process and
32 vulnerability assessment described in section 11 of this chapter; (2) adopt the specialized stretch
33 resilience code; and (3) adopt at least 4 of the following 6 policies and programs:
2 of 8

34 (i) a stormwater utility program to fund upgrades to stormwater infrastructure and other
35 projects that mitigate flooding and protect natural bodies of water;
36 (ii) a program establishing climate resilience hubs, or participation in multi-community
37 climate resilience hubs, located in buildings including but not limited to schools, libraries, and
38 community centers, to educate residents about extreme weather preparedness and the impacts of
39 climate change and to provide shelter and assistance during weather-related emergencies;
40 (iii) a policy for the use of green infrastructure in appropriate public works and public
41 infrastructure projects and a requirement that municipal employees who participate in the
42 planning and design of public works and public infrastructure projects participate in a green
43 infrastructure training program approved or designed by the secretary that includes at least 35
44 hours of training on subjects including nature-based stormwater management practices and
45 nature-based climate resilience strategies; provided, that members of local planning boards,
46 conservation commissions, or other public bodies that participate in the planning and design of
47 public works and public infrastructure projects but who are not full-time municipal employees
48 may participate in an abbreviated green infrastructure training program approved or designed by
49 the secretary that includes 5 hours of such training;
50 (iv) a floodplain overlay district that covers special flood hazard areas designated by the
51 Federal Emergency Management Agency and other areas designated by the municipality that are
52 projected to become vulnerable to flooding due to climate change and that imposes restrictions
53 on construction, significant renovation, dumping, and filling that are designed to protect human
54 life and property from the hazards of periodic flooding, preserve the natural flood control
3 of 8

55 characteristics and the flood storage capacity of the floodplain, and preserve and maintain the
56 groundwater table and water recharge areas within the floodplain;
57 (v) a tree ordinance or by-law that (A) requires the planting of trees to provide adequate
58 shade to large paved areas such as parking lots; and (B) designates trees with a diameter at breast
59 height of 8 or more inches as protected trees and prohibits the removal of protected trees under

62 plant and care for trees; provided, that the ordinance or by-law shall require an applicant who
63 plants native replacement trees to consult the municipal tree warden about which species of tree
64 are suitable for planting and which locations are optimal for planting; and

66 requires the use of National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Atlas 14 precipitation
67 estimates or the best available forward-looking precipitation estimates, as determined by the
68 secretary.
69 (d) The executive office shall be responsible for the administration and oversight of the
70 MVP plus program, including by: (1) adopting rules, regulations and guidelines for the
71 administration and enforcement of this section, including, but not limited to, establishing
