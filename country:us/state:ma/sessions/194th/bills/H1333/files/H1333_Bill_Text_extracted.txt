6 individuals, surrogates, foster care parents and adoptive parents during and after pregnancy,
7 labor, childbirth, miscarriage, stillbirth or loss.
8 (b) There shall be established and set up on the books of the commonwealth a separate

11 department of public health, referred to hereafter as “the department.” The fund shall be credited
12 with: (i) revenue from appropriations or other money authorized by the general court and
13 specifically designated to be credited to the fund; and (ii) funds from non-state entities,
14 including, but not limited to gifts, grants and donations from private entities and local and federal

27 health care-related workforce development, doula mentorship and supervision, and fiscal
28 management.
29 4. Provide, subject to available funding, support to existing community-based doula
