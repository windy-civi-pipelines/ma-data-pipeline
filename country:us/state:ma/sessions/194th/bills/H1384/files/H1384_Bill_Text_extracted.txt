96 benchmark not later than April 15 of the year immediately preceding the first calendar year of a
97 benchmark cycle.
5 of 15
98 (b) The health care cost growth benchmark shall be equal to the growth rate of potential
99 gross state product established under section 7H½ of chapter 29, plus the adjustment factor
100 adopted by the commission upon the recommendation of the technical advisory committee
101 pursuant to subsections (c) and (d). The commission shall establish procedures to prominently
102 publish the health care cost growth benchmark on the commission’s website.
103 (c) The technical advisory committee shall recommend an adjustment factor to the
104 commission not later than February 15 of the year immediately preceding the first calendar year
105 of the benchmark cycle; provided, that the adjustment factor shall not be greater than 1 per cent
106 or less than minus 1 per cent. The adjustment factor shall be based on economic and market

113 factor shall be approved by a majority vote of the technical advisory committee; provided,
114 however, that should the technical advisory committee fail to approve a recommended
115 adjustment factor, the adjustment factor shall be 0 per cent. The technical advisory committee
116 shall submit its recommendation to the commission in a public report that shall include an
117 analysis supporting the technical advisory committee’s recommended adjustment factor.
118 (d) The commission shall hold a public hearing prior to accepting or rejecting the
119 technical advisory committee’s recommended adjustment factor. The public hearing shall be
120 based on the report submitted by the technical advisory committee pursuant to subsection (c), the
6 of 15
121 report submitted by the center pursuant to section 16 of chapter 12C, any other data provided by
122 the technical advisory committee and the center, and such other pertinent information or data as
123 may be available to the commission. The commission shall provide public notice of such hearing
124 at least 45 days prior to the date of the hearing, including notice to the joint committee on health
125 care financing. The joint committee on health care financing may participate in the hearing. The
126 commission shall identify as witnesses for the public hearing a representative sample of
127 providers, provider organizations, payers and such other interested parties as the commission
128 may determine. Any other interested parties may testify at the hearing. The hearing shall
129 examine health care provider, provider organization and private and public health care payer
130 costs, prices and cost trends, with particular attention to factors that contribute to cost growth
131 within the commonwealth’s health care system, and whether, based on the testimony,
132 information and data presented at the hearing, it is appropriate to accept the recommended
133 adjustment factor.
134 (e) The commission shall approve the recommended adjustment factor by a majority vote
135 of the board.
136 Section 10. (a) As used in this section the following words shall, unless the context
137 clearly requires otherwise, have the following meanings:
138 “Health care entity”, a clinic, hospital, ambulatory surgical center, physician
139 organization, or accountable care organization required to register under section 11.
140 (b) The commission shall provide notice to a health care entity identified by the center
141 under section 18 of chapter 12C that the commission may analyze the cost growth and the health
7 of 15
142 care spending performance of the individual health care entity and that the commission may
143 require certain actions, as established in this section, from health care entities so identified.
144 (c) If the commission finds, based on the center’s benchmark cycle report issued under
145 subsection (d) of section 16, that the percentage change in total health care expenditures during
146 the benchmark period exceeded the health care cost growth benchmark, the commission may
147 require certain health care entities to file and implement a performance improvement plan,
148 subject to the factors in subsection (f).
149 (d) In addition to the notice provided under subsection (b), the commission shall provide
150 written notice to a health care entity it determines must file a performance improvement plan.
151 Within 45 days of receipt of such written notice, the health care entity shall either:
152 (1) file a performance improvement plan with the commission; or
153 (2) file an application with the commission to waive or extend the requirement to file a
154 performance improvement plan.
155 (e) The health care entity may file any documentation or supporting evidence with the
156 commission to support the health care entity’s application to waive or extend the requirement to
157 file a performance improvement plan. The commission shall require the health care entity to
158 submit any other relevant information it deems necessary in considering the waiver or extension
159 application; provided, however, that such information shall be made public at the discretion of
160 the commission.
161 (f) The commission may waive or delay the requirement for a health care entity to file a
162 performance improvement plan in response to a waiver or extension request filed under
8 of 15
163 subsection (d) in light of all information received from the health care entity, based on a
164 consideration of the following factors:
165 (1) the baseline spending and trends relative to cost, price, utilization and payer mix of
166 the health care entity over time, independently and as compared to similar entities, and any
167 demonstrated improvement to reduce health status adjusted total medical expenses;
168 (2) any ongoing strategies or investments that the health care entity is implementing to
169 improve future long-term efficiency and reduce cost growth;
170 (3) whether the factors that led to increased costs for the health care entity can reasonably
171 be considered to be unanticipated and outside of the control of the entity. Such factors may
172 include, but shall not be limited to, age and other health status adjusted factors and other cost
173 inputs such as pharmaceutical expenses, medical device expenses and labor costs;
174 (4) the overall financial condition of the health care entity;
175 (5) a significant difference between the growth rate of potential gross state product and
176 the growth rate of actual gross state product, as determined under section 7H½ of chapter 29; and
177 (6) any other factors the commission considers relevant.
178 (g) If the commission declines to waive or extend the requirement for the health care
179 entity to file a performance improvement plan, the commission shall provide written notice to the
180 health care entity that its application for a waiver or extension was denied and the health care
181 entity shall file a performance improvement plan.
182 (h) A health care entity shall file a performance improvement plan: (1) within 45 days of
183 receipt of a notice under subsection (d); (2) if the health care entity has requested a waiver or
9 of 15
184 extension, within 45 days of receipt of a notice that such waiver or extension has been denied; or
185 (3) if the health care entity is granted an extension, on the date given on such extension. The
186 performance improvement plan shall be generated by the health care entity and shall identify the
187 causes of the entity's cost growth and shall include, but not be limited to, specific strategies,
188 adjustments and action steps the entity proposes to implement to improve cost. The proposed
189 performance improvement plan shall include specific identifiable and measurable expected
190 outcomes and a timetable for implementation. The timetable for a performance improvement
191 plan shall not exceed 3 years.
192 (i) The commission shall approve any performance improvement plan that it determines
193 is reasonably likely to address the underlying cause of the health care entity’s cost growth and
194 has a reasonable expectation for successful implementation.
195 (j) If the board determines that the performance improvement plan is unacceptable or
196 incomplete, the commission may provide consultation on the criteria that have not been met and
197 may allow an additional time period, up to 30 calendar days, for resubmission; provided,
198 however, that all aspects of the performance improvement plan shall be proposed by the health
199 care entity and the commission shall not require specific elements for approval.
200 (k) Upon approval of the proposed performance improvement plan, the commission shall
201 notify the health care entity to begin implementation of the performance improvement plan.
202 Public notice shall be provided by the commission on its website, identifying that the health care
203 entity is implementing a performance improvement plan. All health care entities implementing
204 an approved performance improvement plan shall be subject to additional reporting requirements
205 and compliance monitoring, as determined by the commission. The commission shall provide
10 of 15
206 assistance to the health care entity in the successful implementation of the performance
207 improvement plan.
208 (l) All health care entities shall, in good faith, work to implement the performance
209 improvement plan. A health care entity may file amendments to the performance improvement
210 plan at any point during the implementation of the performance improvement plan, subject to
211 approval of the commission.
212 (m) At the conclusion of the timetable established in the performance improvement plan,
213 the health care entity shall report to the commission regarding the outcome of the performance
214 improvement plan. If the commission finds that the performance improvement plan was
215 unsuccessful, the commission shall either: (i) extend the implementation timetable of the existing
216 performance improvement plan; (ii) approve amendments to the performance improvement plan
217 as proposed by the health care entity; (iii) require the health care entity to submit a new
218 performance improvement plan, including requiring specific elements for approval,
219 notwithstanding the limitation in subsection (j) on the commission’s authority during its review
220 of an initial plan proposal; (iv) waive or delay the requirement to file any additional performance
221 improvement plans; or (v) conduct a cost and market impact review of the health care entity
222 under section 13.
223 (n) Upon the successful completion of the performance improvement plan, the identity of
224 the health care entity shall be removed from the list of entities currently implementing a
225 performance improvement plan on the commission’s website.
226 (o) The commission may submit recommendations and draft legislation necessary to
227 implement said recommendations to the joint committee on health care financing if the
11 of 15
228 commission determines that further legislative authority is needed to achieve the
229 commonwealth’s health care quality and spending sustainability objectives, assist health care
230 entities with the implementation of performance improvement plans or otherwise ensure
231 compliance with the provisions of this section.
232 (p) If the commission determines that a health care entity has: (i) willfully neglected to
233 file a performance improvement plan with the commission within 45 days as required under
234 subsection (d); (ii) failed to file an acceptable performance improvement plan in good faith with
235 the commission; (iii) failed to implement the performance improvement plan in good faith; or
236 (iv) knowingly failed to provide information required by this section to the commission or
237 knowingly falsified the same, the commission may: (i) assess a civil penalty to the health care
238 entity of not more than $500,000 for a first violation, not more than $750,000 for a second
239 violation and not more than $1,000,000 for a third or subsequent violation; (ii) stay consideration
240 of any material change notice submitted under section 13 by the health care entity until the
241 commission determines that the health care entity is in compliance with this section; and (iii)
242 notify the department of public health that the health care entity, if applying for a notice of
243 determination of need, is not in compliance with this section. The commission shall seek to
244 promote compliance with this section and shall only impose a civil penalty as a last resort.
245 (q) The commission shall promulgate regulations necessary to implement this section;
246 provided, however, that notice of any proposed regulations shall be filed with the joint
247 committee on health care financing at least 180 days before adoption.

254 during the benchmark cycle exceeded the health care cost growth benchmark in the previous
255 calendar year, the commission may conduct a cost and market impact review of any provider or
256 provider organization identified by the center under section 18 of said chapter 12C.
257 SECTION 10. Section 1 of chapter 12C of the General Laws, most recently amended by

5 of 15

98 (b) The health care cost growth benchmark shall be equal to the growth rate of potential
99 gross state product established under section 7H½ of chapter 29, plus the adjustment factor
100 adopted by the commission upon the recommendation of the technical advisory committee
101 pursuant to subsections (c) and (d). The commission shall establish procedures to prominently
102 publish the health care cost growth benchmark on the commission’s website.
103 (c) The technical advisory committee shall recommend an adjustment factor to the
104 commission not later than February 15 of the year immediately preceding the first calendar year
105 of the benchmark cycle; provided, that the adjustment factor shall not be greater than 1 per cent
106 or less than minus 1 per cent. The adjustment factor shall be based on economic and market

115 adjustment factor, the adjustment factor shall be 0 per cent. The technical advisory committee
116 shall submit its recommendation to the commission in a public report that shall include an
117 analysis supporting the technical advisory committee’s recommended adjustment factor.
118 (d) The commission shall hold a public hearing prior to accepting or rejecting the
119 technical advisory committee’s recommended adjustment factor. The public hearing shall be
120 based on the report submitted by the technical advisory committee pursuant to subsection (c), the
6 of 15

121 report submitted by the center pursuant to section 16 of chapter 12C, any other data provided by
122 the technical advisory committee and the center, and such other pertinent information or data as
123 may be available to the commission. The commission shall provide public notice of such hearing
124 at least 45 days prior to the date of the hearing, including notice to the joint committee on health
125 care financing. The joint committee on health care financing may participate in the hearing. The
126 commission shall identify as witnesses for the public hearing a representative sample of
127 providers, provider organizations, payers and such other interested parties as the commission
128 may determine. Any other interested parties may testify at the hearing. The hearing shall
129 examine health care provider, provider organization and private and public health care payer
130 costs, prices and cost trends, with particular attention to factors that contribute to cost growth
131 within the commonwealth’s health care system, and whether, based on the testimony,
132 information and data presented at the hearing, it is appropriate to accept the recommended
133 adjustment factor.
134 (e) The commission shall approve the recommended adjustment factor by a majority vote
135 of the board.
136 Section 10. (a) As used in this section the following words shall, unless the context
137 clearly requires otherwise, have the following meanings:
138 “Health care entity”, a clinic, hospital, ambulatory surgical center, physician
139 organization, or accountable care organization required to register under section 11.
140 (b) The commission shall provide notice to a health care entity identified by the center
141 under section 18 of chapter 12C that the commission may analyze the cost growth and the health
7 of 15

142 care spending performance of the individual health care entity and that the commission may
143 require certain actions, as established in this section, from health care entities so identified.
144 (c) If the commission finds, based on the center’s benchmark cycle report issued under
145 subsection (d) of section 16, that the percentage change in total health care expenditures during
146 the benchmark period exceeded the health care cost growth benchmark, the commission may
147 require certain health care entities to file and implement a performance improvement plan,
148 subject to the factors in subsection (f).
149 (d) In addition to the notice provided under subsection (b), the commission shall provide
150 written notice to a health care entity it determines must file a performance improvement plan.
151 Within 45 days of receipt of such written notice, the health care entity shall either:
152 (1) file a performance improvement plan with the commission; or
153 (2) file an application with the commission to waive or extend the requirement to file a
154 performance improvement plan.
155 (e) The health care entity may file any documentation or supporting evidence with the
156 commission to support the health care entity’s application to waive or extend the requirement to
157 file a performance improvement plan. The commission shall require the health care entity to
158 submit any other relevant information it deems necessary in considering the waiver or extension
159 application; provided, however, that such information shall be made public at the discretion of
160 the commission.
161 (f) The commission may waive or delay the requirement for a health care entity to file a
162 performance improvement plan in response to a waiver or extension request filed under
8 of 15

163 subsection (d) in light of all information received from the health care entity, based on a
164 consideration of the following factors:
165 (1) the baseline spending and trends relative to cost, price, utilization and payer mix of
166 the health care entity over time, independently and as compared to similar entities, and any
167 demonstrated improvement to reduce health status adjusted total medical expenses;
168 (2) any ongoing strategies or investments that the health care entity is implementing to
169 improve future long-term efficiency and reduce cost growth;
170 (3) whether the factors that led to increased costs for the health care entity can reasonably
171 be considered to be unanticipated and outside of the control of the entity. Such factors may
172 include, but shall not be limited to, age and other health status adjusted factors and other cost
173 inputs such as pharmaceutical expenses, medical device expenses and labor costs;
174 (4) the overall financial condition of the health care entity;
175 (5) a significant difference between the growth rate of potential gross state product and
176 the growth rate of actual gross state product, as determined under section 7H½ of chapter 29; and
177 (6) any other factors the commission considers relevant.
178 (g) If the commission declines to waive or extend the requirement for the health care
179 entity to file a performance improvement plan, the commission shall provide written notice to the
180 health care entity that its application for a waiver or extension was denied and the health care
181 entity shall file a performance improvement plan.
182 (h) A health care entity shall file a performance improvement plan: (1) within 45 days of
183 receipt of a notice under subsection (d); (2) if the health care entity has requested a waiver or
9 of 15

184 extension, within 45 days of receipt of a notice that such waiver or extension has been denied; or
185 (3) if the health care entity is granted an extension, on the date given on such extension. The
186 performance improvement plan shall be generated by the health care entity and shall identify the
187 causes of the entity's cost growth and shall include, but not be limited to, specific strategies,
188 adjustments and action steps the entity proposes to implement to improve cost. The proposed
189 performance improvement plan shall include specific identifiable and measurable expected
190 outcomes and a timetable for implementation. The timetable for a performance improvement
191 plan shall not exceed 3 years.
192 (i) The commission shall approve any performance improvement plan that it determines
193 is reasonably likely to address the underlying cause of the health care entity’s cost growth and
194 has a reasonable expectation for successful implementation.
195 (j) If the board determines that the performance improvement plan is unacceptable or
196 incomplete, the commission may provide consultation on the criteria that have not been met and
197 may allow an additional time period, up to 30 calendar days, for resubmission; provided,
198 however, that all aspects of the performance improvement plan shall be proposed by the health
199 care entity and the commission shall not require specific elements for approval.
200 (k) Upon approval of the proposed performance improvement plan, the commission shall
201 notify the health care entity to begin implementation of the performance improvement plan.
202 Public notice shall be provided by the commission on its website, identifying that the health care
203 entity is implementing a performance improvement plan. All health care entities implementing
204 an approved performance improvement plan shall be subject to additional reporting requirements
205 and compliance monitoring, as determined by the commission. The commission shall provide
10 of 15

206 assistance to the health care entity in the successful implementation of the performance
207 improvement plan.
208 (l) All health care entities shall, in good faith, work to implement the performance
209 improvement plan. A health care entity may file amendments to the performance improvement
210 plan at any point during the implementation of the performance improvement plan, subject to
211 approval of the commission.
212 (m) At the conclusion of the timetable established in the performance improvement plan,
213 the health care entity shall report to the commission regarding the outcome of the performance
214 improvement plan. If the commission finds that the performance improvement plan was
215 unsuccessful, the commission shall either: (i) extend the implementation timetable of the existing
216 performance improvement plan; (ii) approve amendments to the performance improvement plan
217 as proposed by the health care entity; (iii) require the health care entity to submit a new
218 performance improvement plan, including requiring specific elements for approval,
219 notwithstanding the limitation in subsection (j) on the commission’s authority during its review
220 of an initial plan proposal; (iv) waive or delay the requirement to file any additional performance
221 improvement plans; or (v) conduct a cost and market impact review of the health care entity
222 under section 13.
223 (n) Upon the successful completion of the performance improvement plan, the identity of
224 the health care entity shall be removed from the list of entities currently implementing a
225 performance improvement plan on the commission’s website.
226 (o) The commission may submit recommendations and draft legislation necessary to
227 implement said recommendations to the joint committee on health care financing if the
11 of 15

228 commission determines that further legislative authority is needed to achieve the
229 commonwealth’s health care quality and spending sustainability objectives, assist health care
230 entities with the implementation of performance improvement plans or otherwise ensure
231 compliance with the provisions of this section.
232 (p) If the commission determines that a health care entity has: (i) willfully neglected to
233 file a performance improvement plan with the commission within 45 days as required under
234 subsection (d); (ii) failed to file an acceptable performance improvement plan in good faith with
235 the commission; (iii) failed to implement the performance improvement plan in good faith; or
236 (iv) knowingly failed to provide information required by this section to the commission or
237 knowingly falsified the same, the commission may: (i) assess a civil penalty to the health care
238 entity of not more than $500,000 for a first violation, not more than $750,000 for a second
239 violation and not more than $1,000,000 for a third or subsequent violation; (ii) stay consideration
240 of any material change notice submitted under section 13 by the health care entity until the
241 commission determines that the health care entity is in compliance with this section; and (iii)
242 notify the department of public health that the health care entity, if applying for a notice of
243 determination of need, is not in compliance with this section. The commission shall seek to
244 promote compliance with this section and shall only impose a civil penalty as a last resort.
245 (q) The commission shall promulgate regulations necessary to implement this section;
246 provided, however, that notice of any proposed regulations shall be filed with the joint
247 committee on health care financing at least 180 days before adoption.
