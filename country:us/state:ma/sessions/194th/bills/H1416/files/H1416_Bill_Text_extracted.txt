570 infectious disease in the general population, oral health conditions, or behavioral health
571 conditions); and (2) meets criteria to be an environmental justice population or other definition of
572 social inequity as determined by the department.
573 (b) There shall be established and set upon the books of the commonwealth a separate
574 fund to be known as the Health Equity Zone Trust Fund to be expended, without further
575 appropriation, by the department of public health. The fund shall consist of revenues collected by
576 the commonwealth including: (1) any revenue from appropriations or other monies authorized by
577 the general court and specifically designated to be credited to the fund; (2) any fines and
578 penalties allocated to the fund under the General Laws; (3) any funds from public and private
28 of 45
579 sources such as gifts, grants and donations to further community-based prevention activities; (4)
580 any interest earned on such revenues; and (5) any funds provided from other sources, including

584 to, establishing a mechanism to facilitate financial contributions from private organizations to the
585 Health Equity Zone Trust Fund to supplement public revenues allocated by the commonwealth,
586 and the ability of private organizations to participate as part of a multi-sector partnership,

594 efforts to address health disparities and develop a stronger evidence base of effective place-based
595 health equity interventions.
596 (e) The purpose of the Health Equity Zone Trust Fund is to enable the creation of so-
597 called health equity zones, namely geographic areas where existing opportunities emerge and
598 investments are made to address inequities in health outcomes. The Health Equity Zone Trust
599 Fund will equip multi-sector partnerships which may include residents, businesses and other
600 private sector stakeholders, community-organizations, and municipal agencies to identify and
29 of 45
601 create community determined solutions necessary to create just and fair conditions for health.
602 The Health Equity Zone Trust Fund shall prioritize investment in the communities that have been
603 systematically oppressed and where decades of disinvestment have created inequitable health
604 outcomes.
605 The commissioner shall award not less than 85 per cent of the Health Equity Zone Trust
606 Fund through a competitive grant process to municipalities, community-based organizations, and
607 regional-planning agencies that apply for the implementation, technical assistance, and
608 evaluation of health equity activities, consistent with the below. To be eligible to receive a grant

613 state, private or federal public health-related funding.
614 (f) Priority shall be given to proposals in a geographic region of the state with a higher
615 than average prevalence of preventable health conditions (including oral and behavioral health
616 conditions), as determined by the commissioner of public health, in consultation with the Health
617 Equity Zone Advisory Board. If no proposals were offered in areas of the state with particular
618 need, the department shall ask for a specific request for proposal for that specific region. If the
619 commissioner determines that no suitable proposals have been received, such that the specific
620 needs remain unmet, the department may work directly with municipalities or community-based
621 organizations to develop grant proposals. The department should also gather feedback from
622 community-based organizations and municipalities in such region(s) in order to understand the
623 barriers to applying and make every effort to mitigate these barriers for future rounds of funding.
30 of 45
624 The department of public health shall, in consultation with the Health Equity Zone
625 Advisory Board, conduct a periodic review of the funding allocations, grant activities, and
626 progress being made by each grantee as well as the overall grant program, for the purposes of
627 program improvement. Each grantee shall participate in any evaluation, transparency and
628 accountability processes, and reporting requirements implemented or authorized by the
629 department in carrying out its duties to conduct the periodic review described herein, provided,

672 hereby amended by striking out, in line 104, “from” and inserting in place thereof the following
673 words:- “from the office of equity,”.
674 SECTION 39. Clause (ii) of paragraph (4) of subsection (a) of section 25L of chapter

681 section 51A the following section:-
682 Section 51B. (a) As used in this section, the following words shall have the following
683 meanings:
684 “Board”, each board of registration authorized to establish continuing education
685 requirements for healthcare professions under this chapter (as determined by the commissioner
686 of public health) and the Massachusetts Board of Registration in Medicine.
687 “Cultural safety”, an examination by health care professionals of themselves and the
688 potential impact of their own culture on clinical interactions and health care service delivery.
33 of 45
689 This requires individual health care professionals and health care organizations to acknowledge
690 and address their own biases, attitudes, assumptions, stereotypes, prejudices, structures, and
691 characteristics that may affect the quality of care provided. In doing so, cultural safety
692 encompasses a critical consciousness where health care professionals and health care
693 organizations engage in ongoing self-reflection and self-awareness and hold themselves
694 accountable for providing culturally safe care, as defined by the patient and their communities,
695 and as measured through progress towards achieving health equity. Cultural safety requires
696 health care professionals and their associated health care organizations to influence health care to
697 reduce bias and achieve equity within the workforce and working environment.
698 “Structural competency”, a shift in medical education away from pedagogic approaches
699 to stigma and inequalities that emphasize cross-cultural understandings of individual patients,
700 toward attention to forces that influence health outcomes at levels above individual interactions.
701 Structural competency reviews existing structural approaches to stigma and health inequities
702 developed outside of medicine and proposes changes to United States medical education that will
703 infuse clinical training with a structural focus.
704 (b) By January 1, 2028, the board shall adopt rules requiring a licensee to complete health
705 equity continuing education training at least once per licensing cycle, as determined by the
706 licensing requirements for each respective profession.
707 (c) Health equity continuing education courses may be taken in addition to or, if the
708 board determines the course fulfills existing continuing education requirements, in place of other
709 continuing education requirements imposed by the board.

710 (d)(1) The secretary and the board must work collaboratively to provide information to
711 licensees about available courses. The secretary and board shall consult with patients from
712 priority populations and communities with lived experiences of health inequities or racism in the
713 health care system and relevant professional organizations when developing the information and
714 must make this information available by July 1, 2027. The information should include a course
715 option that is free of charge to licensees.

720 organizations, and the board in the development of these rules.

722 factors, such as bias, racism, ableism, and poverty, that manifest as health inequities. These skills

732 and how communication styles differ across cultures; (C) implicit bias training to identify
35 of 45
733 strategies to reduce bias during assessment and diagnosis; (D) methods for addressing the
734 emotional well-being of children and youth of diverse backgrounds; (E) ensuring equity and

736 structural competency training addressing five core competencies, which are: (i) recognizing the
737 structures that shape clinical interactions; (ii) developing an extra clinical language of structure;
738 (iii) rearticulating cultural formulations in structural terms; (iv) observing and imagining
739 structural interventions; and (v) developing structural humility; (G) cultural safety training; and
740 (H) providing effective care to individuals with disabilities and behavioral health diagnoses.

743 continuing education requirement established in this section.

568 and documented health inequities and poor health outcomes (including disproportionately high
569 rates of maternal mortality and morbidity, infant and child health conditions, chronic and
570 infectious disease in the general population, oral health conditions, or behavioral health
571 conditions); and (2) meets criteria to be an environmental justice population or other definition of
572 social inequity as determined by the department.
573 (b) There shall be established and set upon the books of the commonwealth a separate
574 fund to be known as the Health Equity Zone Trust Fund to be expended, without further
575 appropriation, by the department of public health. The fund shall consist of revenues collected by
576 the commonwealth including: (1) any revenue from appropriations or other monies authorized by
577 the general court and specifically designated to be credited to the fund; (2) any fines and
578 penalties allocated to the fund under the General Laws; (3) any funds from public and private
28 of 45

579 sources such as gifts, grants and donations to further community-based prevention activities; (4)
580 any interest earned on such revenues; and (5) any funds provided from other sources, including
581 financial contributions from private organizations.
582 The department of public health shall establish a framework to incentivize private sector

584 to, establishing a mechanism to facilitate financial contributions from private organizations to the
585 Health Equity Zone Trust Fund to supplement public revenues allocated by the commonwealth,
586 and the ability of private organizations to participate as part of a multi-sector partnership,
587 consistent with subsection (e).
588 The commissioner of public health, as trustee, shall administer the fund. The

593 (d) All expenditures from the Health Equity Zone Trust Fund shall support the state’s
594 efforts to address health disparities and develop a stronger evidence base of effective place-based
595 health equity interventions.
596 (e) The purpose of the Health Equity Zone Trust Fund is to enable the creation of so-
597 called health equity zones, namely geographic areas where existing opportunities emerge and
598 investments are made to address inequities in health outcomes. The Health Equity Zone Trust
599 Fund will equip multi-sector partnerships which may include residents, businesses and other
600 private sector stakeholders, community-organizations, and municipal agencies to identify and
29 of 45

601 create community determined solutions necessary to create just and fair conditions for health.
602 The Health Equity Zone Trust Fund shall prioritize investment in the communities that have been
603 systematically oppressed and where decades of disinvestment have created inequitable health
604 outcomes.
605 The commissioner shall award not less than 85 per cent of the Health Equity Zone Trust
606 Fund through a competitive grant process to municipalities, community-based organizations, and
607 regional-planning agencies that apply for the implementation, technical assistance, and
608 evaluation of health equity activities, consistent with the below. To be eligible to receive a grant
609 under this subsection, a recipient shall be: (1) a community-based organization or group of

613 state, private or federal public health-related funding.
614 (f) Priority shall be given to proposals in a geographic region of the state with a higher
615 than average prevalence of preventable health conditions (including oral and behavioral health
616 conditions), as determined by the commissioner of public health, in consultation with the Health
617 Equity Zone Advisory Board. If no proposals were offered in areas of the state with particular
618 need, the department shall ask for a specific request for proposal for that specific region. If the
619 commissioner determines that no suitable proposals have been received, such that the specific
620 needs remain unmet, the department may work directly with municipalities or community-based
621 organizations to develop grant proposals. The department should also gather feedback from
622 community-based organizations and municipalities in such region(s) in order to understand the
623 barriers to applying and make every effort to mitigate these barriers for future rounds of funding.
30 of 45

624 The department of public health shall, in consultation with the Health Equity Zone
625 Advisory Board, conduct a periodic review of the funding allocations, grant activities, and
626 progress being made by each grantee as well as the overall grant program, for the purposes of
627 program improvement. Each grantee shall participate in any evaluation, transparency and
628 accountability processes, and reporting requirements implemented or authorized by the
629 department in carrying out its duties to conduct the periodic review described herein, provided,
630 however, that the department shall make such evaluation, transparency and accountability
631 processes, and reporting requirements as minimally burdensome as is possible.

681 section 51A the following section:-
682 Section 51B. (a) As used in this section, the following words shall have the following
683 meanings:
684 “Board”, each board of registration authorized to establish continuing education
685 requirements for healthcare professions under this chapter (as determined by the commissioner
686 of public health) and the Massachusetts Board of Registration in Medicine.
687 “Cultural safety”, an examination by health care professionals of themselves and the
688 potential impact of their own culture on clinical interactions and health care service delivery.
33 of 45

689 This requires individual health care professionals and health care organizations to acknowledge
690 and address their own biases, attitudes, assumptions, stereotypes, prejudices, structures, and
691 characteristics that may affect the quality of care provided. In doing so, cultural safety
692 encompasses a critical consciousness where health care professionals and health care
693 organizations engage in ongoing self-reflection and self-awareness and hold themselves
694 accountable for providing culturally safe care, as defined by the patient and their communities,
695 and as measured through progress towards achieving health equity. Cultural safety requires
696 health care professionals and their associated health care organizations to influence health care to
697 reduce bias and achieve equity within the workforce and working environment.
698 “Structural competency”, a shift in medical education away from pedagogic approaches
699 to stigma and inequalities that emphasize cross-cultural understandings of individual patients,
700 toward attention to forces that influence health outcomes at levels above individual interactions.
701 Structural competency reviews existing structural approaches to stigma and health inequities
702 developed outside of medicine and proposes changes to United States medical education that will
703 infuse clinical training with a structural focus.
704 (b) By January 1, 2028, the board shall adopt rules requiring a licensee to complete health
705 equity continuing education training at least once per licensing cycle, as determined by the
706 licensing requirements for each respective profession.
707 (c) Health equity continuing education courses may be taken in addition to or, if the
708 board determines the course fulfills existing continuing education requirements, in place of other
709 continuing education requirements imposed by the board.
34 of 45

710 (d)(1) The secretary and the board must work collaboratively to provide information to
711 licensees about available courses. The secretary and board shall consult with patients from
712 priority populations and communities with lived experiences of health inequities or racism in the
713 health care system and relevant professional organizations when developing the information and
714 must make this information available by July 1, 2027. The information should include a course
715 option that is free of charge to licensees.
716 (2) By January 1, 2028, the department, in consultation with the board, shall adopt model
717 rules establishing the minimum standards for continuing education programs meeting the
718 requirements of this section. The department shall consult with patients and communities with
719 lived experience of health inequities or racism in the health care system, relevant professional
720 organizations, and the board in the development of these rules.
721 (3) The minimum standards must include instruction on skills to address the structural
722 factors, such as bias, racism, ableism, and poverty, that manifest as health inequities. These skills
723 include individual-level and system-level intervention, and self-reflection to assess how the
724 licensee’s social position can influence their relationship with patients and their communities.
725 These skills enable a health care professional to care effectively for patients from diverse
726 cultures, groups, and communities, varying in race, ethnicity, gender identity, sexuality, religion,
727 age, ability, socioeconomic status, and other categories of identity. The courses must assess the
728 licensee’s ability to apply health equity concepts into practice. Course topics may include, but
729 are not limited to: (A) strategies for recognizing patterns of health care disparities on an
730 individual, institutional, and structural level and eliminating factors that influence them; (B)
731 intercultural communication skills training, including how to work effectively with an interpreter
732 and how communication styles differ across cultures; (C) implicit bias training to identify
35 of 45

733 strategies to reduce bias during assessment and diagnosis; (D) methods for addressing the
734 emotional well-being of children and youth of diverse backgrounds; (E) ensuring equity and
735 antiracism in care delivery pertaining to medical developments and emerging therapies; (F)
736 structural competency training addressing five core competencies, which are: (i) recognizing the
737 structures that shape clinical interactions; (ii) developing an extra clinical language of structure;
738 (iii) rearticulating cultural formulations in structural terms; (iv) observing and imagining
739 structural interventions; and (v) developing structural humility; (G) cultural safety training; and
740 (H) providing effective care to individuals with disabilities and behavioral health diagnoses.
741 (e) The board may adopt rules to implement and administer this section, including rules
742 to establish a process to determine if a continuing education course meets the health equity
743 continuing education requirement established in this section.
744
