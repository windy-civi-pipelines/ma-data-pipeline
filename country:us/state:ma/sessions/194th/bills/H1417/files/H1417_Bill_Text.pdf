470 improve the affordability and quality of care” and inserting in place thereof the following
471 words:- (6) to improve the affordability and quality of care; and (7) to reduce identified
472 disparities or otherwise advance equity in care delivery.
473 SECTION 36. Chapter 111 of the General Laws is hereby amended by inserting after
474 section 2J the following sections:-
23 of 39

475 Section 2K. (a) As used in this section, the following words shall, unless the context
476 clearly requires otherwise, have the following meanings:-
477 “Environmental justice population”, as defined in section 62 of chapter 30.
478 "Health equity zone", a contiguous geographic area that: (1) demonstrates measurable
479 and documented health inequities and poor health outcomes (including disproportionately high
480 rates of maternal mortality and morbidity, infant and child health conditions, or chronic and
481 infectious disease in the general population); and (2) meets criteria to be an environmental justice
482 population or other definition of social inequity as determined by the department.
483 (b) There shall be established and set upon the books of the commonwealth a separate
484 fund to be known as the Health Equity Zone Trust Fund to be expended, without further
485 appropriation, by the department of public health. The fund shall consist of revenues collected by
486 the commonwealth including: (1) any revenue from appropriations or other monies authorized by
487 the general court and specifically designated to be credited to the fund; (2) any fines and
488 penalties allocated to the fund under the General Laws; (3) any funds from public and private
489 sources such as gifts, grants and donations to further community-based prevention activities; (4)
490 any interest earned on such revenues; and (5) any funds provided from other sources.
491 The commissioner of public health, as trustee, shall administer the fund. The
492 commissioner, in consultation with the Health Equity Zone Advisory Board established under
493 section 2L, shall make expenditures from the fund consistent with subsection (e).
494 (c) Revenues deposited in the fund that are unexpended at the end of the fiscal year shall
495 not revert to the General Fund and shall be available for expenditure in the following fiscal year.
24 of 39

496 (d) All expenditures from the Health Equity Zone Trust Fund shall support the state’s
497 efforts to address health disparities and develop a stronger evidence base of effective place-based
498 health equity interventions.
499 (e) The purpose of the Health Equity Zone Trust Fund is to enable the creation of so-
500 called health equity zones, namely geographic areas where existing opportunities emerge and
501 investments are made to address inequities in health outcomes. The Health Equity Zone Trust
502 Fund will equip multi-sector partnerships which may include residents, businesses, community-
503 organizations, municipal agencies to identify and create community determined solutions
504 necessary to create just and fair conditions for health. Investments shall prioritize investment in
505 the communities that have been systematically oppressed and where decades of disinvestment
506 have created inequitable health outcomes.
507 The commissioner shall award not less than 85 per cent of the Health Equity Zone Trust
508 Fund through a competitive grant process to municipalities, community-based organizations,
509 regional-planning agencies that apply for the implementation, technical assistance, and
510 evaluation of health equity activities. To be eligible to receive a grant to lead Health Equity Zone
511 under this subsection, a recipient shall be: (1) a community-based organization or group of
512 community-based organizations working in collaboration; (2) a community-based organization
513 working in collaboration with 1 or more municipality; or (3) a regional planning agency.
514 Expenditures from the fund for such purposes shall supplement and not replace existing local,
515 state, private or federal public health-related funding.
516 (f) Priority shall be given to proposals in a geographic region of the state with a higher
517 than average prevalence of preventable health conditions, as determined by the commissioner of
25 of 39

518 public health, in consultation with the Health Equity Zone Advisory Board. If no proposals were
519 offered in areas of the state with particular need, the department shall ask for a specific request
520 for proposal for that specific region. If the commissioner determines that no suitable proposals
521 have been received, such that the specific needs remain unmet, the department may work directly
522 with municipalities or community-based organizations to develop grant proposals.
523 The department of public health shall, in consultation with the Health Equity Zone
524 Advisory Board, develop guidelines for an annual review of the progress being made by each
525 grantee. Each grantee shall participate in any evaluation or accountability process implemented
526 or authorized by the department, provided, however, that the department shall make evaluation
527 and accountability processes as minimally burdensome as is possible.
528 (g) The department of public health shall, annually on or before January 31, report on
529 expenditures from the Health Equity Zone Trust Fund. The report shall include, but not be
530 limited to: (1) the revenue credited to the fund; (2) the amount of fund expenditures attributable

539 Equity Zone Advisory Board, annually report on its strategy for administration and allocation of
26 of 39

540 the fund, including relevant evaluation criteria. The report shall set forth the rationale for such
541 strategy.
542 (i) The department of public health shall promulgate regulations necessary to carry out
543 this section.
544 Section 2L. There shall be a Health Equity Zone Advisory Board to make
545 recommendations to the commissioner concerning the administration and allocation of the
546 Health Equity Zone Trust Fund established in section 2K, establish evaluation criteria and
547 perform any other functions specifically granted to it by law.
548 The board shall consist of: the commissioner of public health or a designee, who shall
549 serve as co-chairperson; and 10 persons to be appointed by the commissioner through a public

568 SECTION 38. Said subsection (g) of section 25C of chapter 111, as so appearing, is
569 hereby amended by striking out, in line 104, “from” and inserting in place thereof the following
570 words:- “from the office of equity,”.
571 SECTION 39. Said section 25C of chapter 111, as so appearing, is hereby amended, by
572 inserting after subsection (n) the following subsection:-
573 (o) A determination of need under this section shall take into account a health equity
574 assessment, which shall be included in the application described in subsection (h). Such
575 application shall include: (1) a demonstration of whether, and if so how, the extent to which such
576 populations in the applicant’s service area access the applicant’s facility or services at the time of
577 the application and the extent to which the proposed construction or change of services is
578 expected to impact that access; (2) a description of the amount of indigent care, both free and
579 below cost, that will be offered by the applicant if the construction or service change is
580 approved; (3) an assessment of any impacts on access by public or private transportation,
581 including applicant-sponsored transportation services, to the applicant’s facility if the

587 SECTION 40. Clause (ii) of paragraph (4) of subsection (a) of section 25L of chapter
588 111, as so appearing, is hereby amended by striking out, in line 47, “comprehensive recruitment

592 recipients of scholarship and student loan repayment programs).
593 SECTION 41. Chapter 112 of the General Laws is hereby amended by inserting after
594 section 51A the following section:-
595 Section 51B. (a) As used in this section, the following words shall have the following
596 meanings:
597 “Board”, each board of registration authorized to establish continuing education
598 requirements for healthcare professions under this chapter (as determined by the commissioner
599 of public health) and the Massachusetts Board of Registration in Medicine.
600 “Cultural safety”, an examination by health care professionals of themselves and the
601 potential impact of their own culture on clinical interactions and health care service delivery.
602 This requires individual health care professionals and health care organizations to acknowledge
603 and address their own biases, attitudes, assumptions, stereotypes, prejudices, structures, and
604 characteristics that may affect the quality of care provided. In doing so, cultural safety
605 encompasses a critical consciousness where health care professionals and health care
29 of 39

606 organizations engage in ongoing self-reflection and self-awareness and hold themselves
607 accountable for providing culturally safe care, as defined by the patient and their communities,
608 and as measured through progress towards achieving health equity. Cultural safety requires
609 health care professionals and their associated health care organizations to influence health care to
610 reduce bias and achieve equity within the workforce and working environment.
611 “Structural competency”, a shift in medical education away from pedagogic approaches
612 to stigma and inequalities that emphasize cross-cultural understandings of individual patients,
613 toward attention to forces that influence health outcomes at levels above individual interactions.
614 Structural competency reviews existing structural approaches to stigma and health inequities
615 developed outside of medicine and proposes changes to United States medical education that will
616 infuse clinical training with a structural focus.
617 (b) By January 1, 2026, the board shall adopt rules requiring a licensee to complete health
618 equity continuing education training at least once every four years.
619 (c) Health equity continuing education courses may be taken in addition to or, if the
620 board determines the course fulfills existing continuing education requirements, in place of other
621 continuing education requirements imposed by the board.
622 (d)(1) The secretary and the board must work collaboratively to provide information to
623 licensees about available courses. The secretary and board shall consult with patients and
624 communities with lived experiences of health inequities or racism in the health care system and
625 relevant professional organizations when developing the information and must make this
626 information available by July 1, 2025. The information should include a course option that is free
627 of charge to licensees.
30 of 39

628 (2) By January 1, 2026, the department, in consultation with the board, shall adopt model
629 rules establishing the minimum standards for continuing education programs meeting the
630 requirements of this section. The department shall consult with patients and communities with
631 lived experience of health inequities or racism in the health care system, relevant professional
632 organizations, and the board in the development of these rules.
633 (3) The minimum standards must include instruction on skills to address the structural
634 factors, such as bias, racism, and poverty, that manifest as health inequities. These skills include
635 individual-level and system-level intervention, and self-reflection to assess how the licensee’s
636 social position can influence their relationship with patients and their communities. These skills
637 enable a health care professional to care effectively for patients from diverse cultures, groups,
638 and communities, varying in race, ethnicity, gender identity, sexuality, religion, age, ability,
639 socioeconomic status, and other categories of identity. The courses must assess the licensee’s
640 ability to apply health equity concepts into practice. Course topics may include, but are not
641 limited to: (A) strategies for recognizing patterns of health care disparities on an individual,
642 institutional, and structural level and eliminating factors that influence them; (B) intercultural
643 communication skills training, including how to work effectively with an interpreter and how
644 communication styles differ across cultures; (C) implicit bias training to identify strategies to
645 reduce bias during assessment and diagnosis; (D) methods for addressing the emotional well-
646 being of children and youth of diverse backgrounds; (E) ensuring equity and antiracism in care
647 delivery pertaining to medical developments and emerging therapies; (F) structural competency
648 training addressing five core competencies, which are: (i) recognizing the structures that shape
649 clinical interactions; (ii) developing an extra clinical language of structure; (iii) rearticulating
31 of 39

650 cultural formulations in structural terms; (iv) observing and imagining structural interventions;
651 and (v) developing structural humility; and (G) cultural safety training.
652 (e) The board may adopt rules to implement and administer this section, including rules
653 to establish a process to determine if a continuing education course meets the health equity
654 continuing education requirement established in this section.
655 SECTION 42. Chapter 118E of the General Laws, as appearing in the 2020 Official

695 following words:- Section 63 is hereby repealed.
696 SECTION 46. (a) Notwithstanding any general or special law to the contrary, there shall
697 be established a program for cost-sharing eliminations for targeted high-value services,
698 treatments and prescription drugs used to treat certain chronic conditions. In order to implement
699 said program, the secretary of health and human services, in consultation with the secretary of
