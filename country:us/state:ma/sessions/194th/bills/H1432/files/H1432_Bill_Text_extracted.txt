7 institution, and shall include procedures related to the transferability of these credits to another
8 institution of higher education. An institution may not require an exam score of more than three

10 student to be successful in a related or more advanced course for which the lower-division course
1 of 3
11 is a prerequisite. The department of higher education shall provide guidance on what constitutes
12 as evidence for an institution to require an examination score of more than three.

17 who shall post each institution’s policies and procedures, or changes thereto, on the department’s
18 website.
19 (c) The board of higher education, and in the case of the University of Massachusetts, in
20 cooperation with the board of trustees of the University of Massachusetts, shall annually review
21 the advanced placement examination score course granting policies of each institution of higher
22 education and any evidence supporting policies requiring scores above 3 in accordance with the
23 requirements of this section, and report its findings, evidence supporting policies requiring scores
24 above 3, and any recommendations with the clerks of the senate and the house of representatives,
25 and the chairs of the joint committee on higher education not later than July 1. Each institution of
26 higher education shall provide the board of higher education, and in the case of the University of
27 Massachusetts, its board of trustees, with all necessary data, in accordance with the federal
28 Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974, to conduct the analysis.
29 (d) All policies and procedures governing the award of credit shall be posted in an easily
30 accessible location on the institution’s website. The institution shall update the website as
31 necessary to reflect any changes in policies and procedures. Each institution shall submit its
2 of 3
32 policies and procedures, and any changes, to the department which shall post a summary of each
33 institution’s policies and procedures on the department’s website.
34 SECTION 2. The first annual report required by subsection (c) of section 39A of chapter
35 15A of the General Laws shall be published not later than July 1, 2025.
