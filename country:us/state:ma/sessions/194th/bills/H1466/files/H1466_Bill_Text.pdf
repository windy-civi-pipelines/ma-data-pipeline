15 guidelines and procedures governing the grant making process and the program using available
16 data pertaining to student hunger. The director may also conduct any additional surveys the
17 department deems necessary to understand gaps in addressing student food insecurity and hunger
18 eligible higher education campuses across the commonwealth.

20 The guidelines and procedures that govern the program shall specify any requirements
21 applicable to eligible institutions of higher education including, but not limited to: (i) whether the
22 institution has designated campus staff to interface with the department; (ii) the existence and

32 (b) Subject to appropriation, the department shall award grants to institutions that have
33 met the guidelines and procedures established by the department. Upon recommendation by the
34 director of the program, the commissioner or a designee shall determine the amount of each grant

36 with the program and shall establish reporting guidelines for grant recipients.

48 money authorized by the general court and specifically designated to be credited to the fund; (ii)
49 interest earned on such revenues; and (iii) funds from public and private sources such as gifts,
50 grants and donations. Amounts credited to the fund shall not be subject to further appropriation
51 and any money remaining in the fund at the end of a fiscal year shall not revert to the General
52 Fund. Amounts credited to the fund shall be used to fund grants made pursuant to the program,
53 and for the cost of administration of such program by the department of higher education.
54

56 senate and house of representatives, the joint committee on higher education and the house and
