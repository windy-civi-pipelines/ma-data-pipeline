136 an offer and execute a purchase contract with a third party during this thirty-day period, subject
137 to paragraphs (4) to (7), inclusive.

161 days after the receipt of the third-party purchase contract and the proposed purchase contract,
162 execute the proposed purchase contract or such other agreement as is acceptable to both parties.
163 The time periods set forth in this subsection may be extended by agreement between the
164 Owner and the Tenant Association, its Successor or its Designee. Except as otherwise specified
165 in subsection (5), the terms and conditions of the proposed purchase contract offered to the
166 Tenant Association, Successor, or its Designee, shall be the same as those of the executed third-
167 party purchase contract. The Tenant Association or its Successor or Designee must include
168 reasonable evidence of Minimum Tenant Participation with its proposed purchase contract.
169 (5) Any purchase contract offered to, or proposed by, the Tenant Association, its
170 Successor or its Designee shall provide at least the following terms:
171 (i) the earnest money deposit shall not exceed the lesser of:
172 (A) the deposit in the third-party purchase contract;
173 (B) 5 per cent of the Sale price; or
174 (C) $250,000; provided, however, that the Owner and the Tenant Association, or its
175 Successor, or its Designee, may agree to modify the terms of the earnest money deposit;
176 provided, further, that the earnest money deposit shall be held under commercially-reasonable
177 terms by an escrow agent selected jointly by the Owner and the Tenant Association, its
178 Successor or its Designee;
9 of 22
179 (ii) the Owner must provide the following information, documentation, and permissions,

184 capital improvements; permission to inspect all common and maintenance service areas of the
185 property, including roof, boiler room, electrical and telecommunications rooms; permission to
186 conduct inspections and tests for the presence of lead paint and asbestos; and permission to do

189 (iii) the contract will contain all reasonable contingencies, including financing,
190 marketability of title, and appraisal contingencies;
191 (iv) the earnest money deposit shall be refundable for not less than 60 days from the date
192 of execution of the purchase contract or such greater period as provided for in the third-party
193 purchase contract (due diligence period); provided, however, that if the Owner unreasonably
194 delays the buyer's ability to conduct due diligence during the 60 day period, the earnest money
195 deposit shall continue to be refundable for an additional period of one day for every day beyond
196 the required 20 days that the Owner has not complied with the provisions of subsection (5) (ii)
197 above. After the expiration of the specified time period, the earnest money deposit shall become
198 non-refundable but shall continue to be a deposit toward the full purchase price.
199 (v) real estate broker commissions or fees that are associated with the third-party
200 purchase transaction shall be payable upon the closing of the purchase.
10 of 22
201 (6) Closing date: The Tenant Association or its Successor, or Designee, shall have 60
202 days for a property of 1 to 5 units, 75 days for a property of 6 to 20 units, and 120 days for a
203 property of 21 or more units, from execution of the purchase contract to perform all due
204 diligence, secure financing for and close on the purchase of the building; provided, however, that
205 if the Owner unreasonably delays the buyer's ability to conduct due diligence, the closing date
206 shall be extended for an additional period of one day for every day beyond the required 20 days
207 that the Owner has not complied with the provisions of subsection (d) (5) (ii) above. Failure to
208 exercise the purchase option by the closing date shall constitute a waiver of the purchase option
209 by the Tenant Association, its Successor, or its Designee. The closing date may be extended by
210 agreement of both parties.
211 (7) If the Tenant Association, its Designee or Successor, do not exercise their purchase
212 option the Owner may proceed with the sale to the third-party. If the closing date in the third-
213 party contract is extended, for each such extension, the Owner shall provide the municipality and
214 the Tenant Association, Designee or Successor a notarized amendment to the purchase contract
215 extending the date of the closing. Within 7 days of the termination of the third-party purchase
216 contract the Owner shall notify the municipality and the Tenant Association, its Designee or its
217 Successor of the termination. Said notice shall trigger the provisions of paragraphs (d)(1) through
218 (d)(7) of this Section.
219 (8) In any instance where the Tenant Association, its Designee or Successor, is not a
220 successful purchaser, an Owner shall provide evidence of compliance with this Section by filing
221 a affidavit of compliance signed under the penalty of perjury with the municipality, the
222 Executive Office, and the official records of the county where the property is located within
223 seven days of the Sale.
11 of 22
224 (9) The Tenant Association, Successor, or its Designee shall ensure that their purchase of
225 the property will not result in the displacement of any Tenant households existing at the time of
226 purchase based solely on their choice not to participate in the purchase of the property.
227 (10) Any property acquired under this subsection, that is not subject to a Long-Term
228 Affordable Housing requirement, shall be for the purpose of use of the property as: (i) Long-
229 Term Affordable Housing set out in a recorded restriction; (ii) cooperative housing subject to a
230 covenant, satisfactory to the municipality in form and substance and having a term of not less
231 than twenty years, that a majority of residential units be occupied by Tenant-stockholders as their
232 primary residence; or (iii) condominium units subject to a covenant, satisfactory to the
233 municipality in form and substance and having a term of not less than twenty years, that a
234 majority of units be occupied by unit Owners as their primary residence. For purposes of (ii) and
235 (iii) of this requirement, Owner-occupied or Tenant-stockholder occupied includes (i) a person in
236 military service on active duty who intends to occupy the residential unit when not on active
237 duty, and (ii) a disabled occupant where the Owner/Tenant-stockholder is their parent or legal
238 guardian.

240 (i) property that is the subject of a government taking by eminent domain or a negotiated
241 purchase in lieu of eminent domain;
242 (ii) a proposed below-market Sale to an organization organized under Section 501(c)(3)

250 the temporary or transitional nature of the housing;
251 (vi) rental units in a nonprofit facility that provides a structured living environment that
252 has the primary purpose of helping homeless persons obtain the skills necessary for independent

310 occupying the Housing Accommodation notify the Owner, in writing, that they collectively
311 desire to receive information relating to the proposed Sale. Tenants may indicate this desire
312 within the same notice described in paragraph (2). Any notice of the offer required to be given
313 under this subsection shall include the price, calculated as a single lump sum amount and of any
314 promissory notes offered in lieu of cash payment.
315 (4) A Tenant Association representing at least 51 per cent of the households occupying
316 the Housing Accommodation that are entitled to notice under the preceding paragraph (3) shall
317 have the collective right to purchase, in the case of a Third-Party Offer that the Mortgagee
318 intends to accept, provided that it:
319 (i) submits to the Owner reasonable evidence that the Tenants of at least 51 per cent of
320 the occupied units in the Housing Accommodation have approved the purchase of the Housing
321 Accommodation,
322 (ii) submits to the Owner a proposed purchase and sale agreement on substantially
323 equivalent terms and conditions within 60 days of receipt of notice of the offer made under the
324 preceding paragraph (3),
325 (iii) obtains a binding commitment for any necessary financing or guarantees within an
326 additional 90 days after execution of the purchase and sale agreement, and
327 (iv) closes on such purchase within an additional 90 days after the end of the 90-day
328 period described in clause (iii).
329 No Owner shall unreasonably refuse to enter into, or unreasonably delay the execution or
330 closing on a purchase and sale with Tenants who have made a bona fide offer to meet the price
16 of 22
331 and substantially equivalent terms and conditions of an offer for which notice is required to be
332 given pursuant to paragraph (3). Failure of the Tenants to submit such a purchase and sale
333 agreement within the first 60-day period, to obtain a binding commitment for financing within
334 the additional 90-day period or to close on the purchase within the second 90-day period, shall
335 serve to terminate the rights of such Tenants to purchase. The time periods herein provided may
336 be extended by agreement. Nothing herein shall be construed to require an Owner to provide
337 financing to such Tenants. A Tenant Association that has the right to purchase hereunder, at its
338 election, may assign its purchase right hereunder to the city or town in which the Housing
339 Accommodation is located, or the housing authority of the city or town in which the Housing
340 Accommodation is located, or an agency of the commonwealth, nonprofit, community
341 development corporation, affordable housing developer, or land trust. A right to purchase
342 hereunder shall be for the purpose of maintaining the use of the Housing Accommodation as
343 permanently affordable rental housing.
344 (5) The right of first refusal created herein shall inure to the Tenants for the time periods
345 hereinbefore provided, beginning on the date of notice to the Tenants under paragraph (1). The
346 effective period for such right of first refusal shall begin anew for each different offer to
347 purchase that the Mortgagee intends to accept. The right of first refusal shall not apply with
348 respect to any offer received by the Owner for which a notice is not required pursuant to said
349 paragraph (3).
350 (6) In any instance where the Tenants are not the successful purchaser of the Housing
351 Accommodation, the Mortgagee shall provide evidence of compliance with this section by filing
352 an affidavit of compliance signed under the penalty of perjury with the attorney general, and the
17 of 22
353 registry of deeds for the county and district where the property is located within 7 days of the
354 Sale.
355 (7) The attorney general shall enforce this subsection (e) and shall promulgate rules and
356 regulations necessary for enforcement. The attorney general may seek injunctive, declaratory,
357 and compensatory relief on behalf of Tenants and the Commonwealth in a court of competent
358 jurisdiction. The attorney general shall post a sample intent to sell notice, sample proof of notice
359 to Tenants, sample notice of offer, and other necessary documents.
360 (f) Foreclosures. In any city or town that adopts the provisions of this Section:
361 (1) When a Mortgagee seeks to foreclose, the Mortgagee shall provide copies of all
362 Foreclosure notices required by Chapter 244, sections 14 and 35A, or any other applicable
363 Foreclosure law, by regular and certified mail to the Tenants of the Housing Accommodation
364 and to the municipality adopting this Section. The Mortgagee shall also provide Tenants and the
365 municipality, by regular and certified mail, with a copy of any Complaint filed in Land Court and
366 any Order of Notice issued by the Land Court, pursuant to the Service Members Civil Relief Act
367 if applicable, within five (5) days of issuance.
368 (2) The Mortgagee shall provide each Tenant household and the municipality adopting
369 this Section, by regular and certified mail, a copy of any and all Notices of Sale published
370 pursuant to Section 14 of chapter 244.
371 (3) No later than 5 business days before the Foreclosure Auction of a Housing
372 Accommodation, the Tenants shall inform the Mortgagee, in writing, if a Tenants Association
373 representing at least fifty-one percent of the households occupying the Housing Accommodation
18 of 22
374 or an entity to which they have assigned their right of first refusal intend to exercise their right of
375 first refusal at Auction and desire to receive information relating to the proposed Auction.
376 (4) A Tenants Association representing at least fifty-one percent of the households
377 occupying the Housing Accommodation or their assignee may exercise their collective right to
378 purchase the Housing Accommodation, in the event of a Third-Party Offer at Auction that the
379 Mortgagee receives, provided that the Tenants Association
380 (i) submits to the Mortgagee reasonable evidence that the Tenants of at least fifty-one
381 percent of the occupied homes in the Housing Accommodation have approved the purchase of
382 the Housing Accommodation,
383 (ii) submits to the Mortgagee a proposed purchase and sale agreement on substantially
384 equivalent terms and conditions to that received by the Mortgagee in the Third-Party Offer
385 within sixty days of receipt of notice of the bid made under paragraph (3) of this section,
386 (iii) obtains a binding commitment for any necessary financing or guarantees within an
387 additional ninety days after execution of the purchase and sale agreement, and
388 (iv) closes on such purchase within an additional ninety days after the end of the ninety-
389 day period under clause (iii).
390 No Mortgagee shall unreasonably refuse to enter into, or unreasonably delay the
391 execution or closing on a purchase and sale with Tenants who have made a bona fide offer to
392 meet the price and substantially equivalent terms and conditions of a bid received at Auction.
393 Failure of the Tenants to submit such a purchase and sale agreement within the first sixty day
394 period, to obtain a binding commitment for financing within the additional ninety day period or
19 of 22
395 to close on the purchase within the second ninety-day period, shall serve to terminate the rights
396 of such Tenants to purchase. The time periods herein provided may be extended by agreement.
397 Nothing herein shall be construed to require a Mortgagee to provide financing to such
398 Tenants. A Tenant Association which has the right to purchase hereunder, at its election, may
399 assign its purchase right hereunder to the city, town, housing authority, or agency of the
400 commonwealth, nonprofit, community development corporation, affordable housing developer,
401 or land trust; a right to purchase hereunder shall be for the purpose of maintaining the use of the
402 Housing Accommodation as permanently affordable rental housing.
403 If there are no third-party bids at Auction for the Housing Accommodation, the Tenants
404 shall have a right of first refusal whenever the Mortgagee seeks to sell the Housing
405 Accommodation. The Tenants shall be notified of any offers the Mortgagee intends to accept and
406 shall be given an opportunity to meet the price and substantially the terms of a Third-Party Offer
407 based on the same time line described in paragraph (4).
408 (5) The right of first refusal created herein shall inure to the Tenants for the time periods
409 herein before provided, beginning on the date of notice to the Tenants under paragraph (1).
410 (6) In any instance where the Tenants are not the successful purchaser, the seller of such
411 unit shall provide evidence of compliance with this Section by filing an affidavit of compliance
412 signed under the penalty of perjury with the attorney general, the Executive Office, and the
413 official records of the county where the property is located within seven days of the Sale.
414 (7) The attorney general shall enforce this subsection (f) and shall promulgate rules and
415 regulations necessary for enforcement. The attorney general may seek injunctive, declaratory,
416 and compensatory relief on behalf of Tenants and the Commonwealth in a court of competent
20 of 22
417 jurisdiction. The attorney general shall post a sample intent to sell notice, sample proof of notice
418 to Tenants, sample notice of offer, and other necessary documents.
419 (g) Any notice required by this section, except notice provided by a Tenant Association
420 to the municipality, shall be deemed to have been provided when delivered in person or mailed
421 by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, to the party to whom notice is required;
422 except that with respect to providing notice to Tenants, notice shall be deemed to have been
423 provided when either: (i) the notice is delivered in hand to the Tenant or an adult member of the
424 Tenant's household; or (ii) the notice is sent by first class mail and a copy is left in or under the
425 door of the Tenant's dwelling unit. A notice to the affected municipality shall be sent to the chief
426 executive officer.
427 (h) It is illegal for an Owner or their agent to take any action to evict, threaten, coerce, or
428 retaliate against a Tenant or Tenants in order to avoid application of this Section.
429 (i) A Tenant, Tenant Association, or Successor, Designee or assignee shall not solicit or
430 accept payment or any other consideration for assigning or waiving any rights under this section.
431 (j) Aggrieved Tenants, Tenant Associations, Designees, Successors, assignees, and
432 municipalities may seek damages under chapter 93A and may file a complaint with the attorney
433 general, and may also file a court complaint for equitable and/or monetary relief, including but
434 not limited to damages of a percentage of the sales price and/or injunctive relief in the form of
435 specific performance. Nothing in this Section shall be construed to limit or constrain in any way
436 the rights Tenants currently have under applicable laws, including but not limited to chapters 186
437 and 186A. At all times, all parties must negotiate in good faith.
21 of 22
438 (k) The Executive Office shall promulgate rules and regulations to effectuate the
439 purposes and implement this Section not later than 150 days after the effective date of this act.
440 The attorney general shall promulgate rules and regulations necessary for enforcement and may
441 seek injunctive, declaratory, and compensatory relief on behalf of tenants and the commonwealth

132 (ii) A Tenant Association with the Minimum Tenant Participation, or its Successor or
133 Designee, may, within 30 days after receipt of the Owner's intention to sell, submit an offer to
134 the Owner to purchase the property. Failure to submit an offer within thirty days shall constitute
135 an irrevocable waiver of the Tenants' rights under this paragraph (3). An Owner also may accept
136 an offer and execute a purchase contract with a third party during this thirty-day period, subject
137 to paragraphs (4) to (7), inclusive.

138 (4) Upon execution of any purchase contract with a third party, within 7 days, the Owner
139 shall, unless the Owner can prove they are exempt from this Section, submit: a copy of the
140 executed contract and proof that the deposit toward the purchase has been paid by the third party
141 along with a proposed purchase contract for execution by Tenant Association or its Successor, or
142 Designee (collectively, “the Purchase Documents”), and if no Tenant Association or Successor
143 or Designee exists, the Owner shall provide, within 7 days of execution of the third party
144 contract, the Purchase Documents to the municipality and provide a summary of the Purchase
145 Documents (including purchase price, amount and schedule of deposits, length of due diligence/
146 deposit refundability period, and closing date) to each Tenant household, by hand delivery and
147 United States' mail.
148 If (i) at least 30 days has passed from the Tenant households’ receipt of notice of the
149 Owner’s intention to sell (provided for in (d)(1)) and their receipt of the summary of the
150 Purchase Documents, and if a Tenant Association, with or without Minimum Tenant
151 Participation, or its Successor or Designee does not exist, then the Owner may immediately
152 proceed with the purchase contract with the third party;
153 if (ii) less than 30 days have passed and no Tenant Association with Minimum Tenant
154 Participation has been formed, the Tenants shall have 45 days after the receipt of the summary of
155 the Purchase Documents, to form a Tenant Association with Minimum Tenant Participation,
156 select a Designee or Successor it they choose, and have the Tenant Association or its Successor
157 or its Designee execute the proposed purchase contract or such other agreement as is acceptable
158 to both parties; and
8 of 22

159 (iii) in all other cases, if the Tenant Association, or its Successor or, its Designee, elect to
160 purchase the property, the Tenant Association, or its Successor, or its Designee, shall within 21
161 days after the receipt of the third-party purchase contract and the proposed purchase contract,
162 execute the proposed purchase contract or such other agreement as is acceptable to both parties.
163 The time periods set forth in this subsection may be extended by agreement between the
164 Owner and the Tenant Association, its Successor or its Designee. Except as otherwise specified
165 in subsection (5), the terms and conditions of the proposed purchase contract offered to the
166 Tenant Association, Successor, or its Designee, shall be the same as those of the executed third-
167 party purchase contract. The Tenant Association or its Successor or Designee must include
168 reasonable evidence of Minimum Tenant Participation with its proposed purchase contract.
169 (5) Any purchase contract offered to, or proposed by, the Tenant Association, its
170 Successor or its Designee shall provide at least the following terms:
171 (i) the earnest money deposit shall not exceed the lesser of:
172 (A) the deposit in the third-party purchase contract;
173 (B) 5 per cent of the Sale price; or
174 (C) $250,000; provided, however, that the Owner and the Tenant Association, or its
175 Successor, or its Designee, may agree to modify the terms of the earnest money deposit;
176 provided, further, that the earnest money deposit shall be held under commercially-reasonable
177 terms by an escrow agent selected jointly by the Owner and the Tenant Association, its
178 Successor or its Designee;
9 of 22

179 (ii) the Owner must provide the following information, documentation, and permissions,
180 within 20 days of the date of the purchase contract of the Tenant Association, its Designee or
181 Successor: the current rent roll by unit size without tenant names or other identifying
182 information; the expiration date of every lease (if there is a lease); documentation of all operating
183 expenses for the prior two years, including utilities, insurance premiums, bills for repairs, and
184 capital improvements; permission to inspect all common and maintenance service areas of the
185 property, including roof, boiler room, electrical and telecommunications rooms; permission to
186 conduct inspections and tests for the presence of lead paint and asbestos; and permission to do
187 tests for regulated environmental toxins on unbuilt areas of the property, if required by the lender
188 of the Tenant Association, or its Designee or Successor;
189 (iii) the contract will contain all reasonable contingencies, including financing,
190 marketability of title, and appraisal contingencies;
191 (iv) the earnest money deposit shall be refundable for not less than 60 days from the date
192 of execution of the purchase contract or such greater period as provided for in the third-party
193 purchase contract (due diligence period); provided, however, that if the Owner unreasonably
194 delays the buyer's ability to conduct due diligence during the 60 day period, the earnest money
195 deposit shall continue to be refundable for an additional period of one day for every day beyond
196 the required 20 days that the Owner has not complied with the provisions of subsection (5) (ii)
197 above. After the expiration of the specified time period, the earnest money deposit shall become
198 non-refundable but shall continue to be a deposit toward the full purchase price.
199 (v) real estate broker commissions or fees that are associated with the third-party
200 purchase transaction shall be payable upon the closing of the purchase.
10 of 22

201 (6) Closing date: The Tenant Association or its Successor, or Designee, shall have 60
202 days for a property of 1 to 5 units, 75 days for a property of 6 to 20 units, and 120 days for a
203 property of 21 or more units, from execution of the purchase contract to perform all due
204 diligence, secure financing for and close on the purchase of the building; provided, however, that
205 if the Owner unreasonably delays the buyer's ability to conduct due diligence, the closing date
206 shall be extended for an additional period of one day for every day beyond the required 20 days
207 that the Owner has not complied with the provisions of subsection (d) (5) (ii) above. Failure to
208 exercise the purchase option by the closing date shall constitute a waiver of the purchase option
209 by the Tenant Association, its Successor, or its Designee. The closing date may be extended by
210 agreement of both parties.
211 (7) If the Tenant Association, its Designee or Successor, do not exercise their purchase
212 option the Owner may proceed with the sale to the third-party. If the closing date in the third-
213 party contract is extended, for each such extension, the Owner shall provide the municipality and
214 the Tenant Association, Designee or Successor a notarized amendment to the purchase contract
215 extending the date of the closing. Within 7 days of the termination of the third-party purchase
216 contract the Owner shall notify the municipality and the Tenant Association, its Designee or its
217 Successor of the termination. Said notice shall trigger the provisions of paragraphs (d)(1) through
218 (d)(7) of this Section.
219 (8) In any instance where the Tenant Association, its Designee or Successor, is not a
220 successful purchaser, an Owner shall provide evidence of compliance with this Section by filing
221 a affidavit of compliance signed under the penalty of perjury with the municipality, the
222 Executive Office, and the official records of the county where the property is located within
223 seven days of the Sale.
11 of 22

224 (9) The Tenant Association, Successor, or its Designee shall ensure that their purchase of
225 the property will not result in the displacement of any Tenant households existing at the time of
226 purchase based solely on their choice not to participate in the purchase of the property.
227 (10) Any property acquired under this subsection, that is not subject to a Long-Term
228 Affordable Housing requirement, shall be for the purpose of use of the property as: (i) Long-

264 than 10 residential rental units in the municipality.
265 (ix) any unit that is held in trust on behalf of a disabled individual who permanently
266 occupies the unit, or a unit that is permanently occupied by a disabled parent, sibling, child, or

283 (12) The Executive Office shall provide municipalities with sample purchase contracts
284 incorporating the requirements of this Section that an Owner can provide to a Tenant
285 Association, its Designee or Successor.
286 (e) Short-Sales. In any city or town that adopts the provisions of this Section:
14 of 22

287 (1) An Owner, other than the Owner of a 1- 4 unit Owner-occupied property, shall give
288 notice to each Tenant household of a Housing Accommodation of the intention to sell the
289 Housing Accommodation by way of Short-Sale to avoid Foreclosure. Such notice shall be mailed
290 by regular and certified mail, with a simultaneous copy to the attorney general, and the
291 municipality adopting this section within 2 business days of the Owner's submission of a request
292 or application to the Mortgagee for permission to sell the Housing Accommodation by way of
293 Short-Sale or to accept a Deed in Lieu. This notice shall also include a notice of the rights
294 provided by this section.
295 (2) No Mortgagee may accept any Third-Party Offers or deem the Owner's application
296 for Short-Sale submitted for review unless and until: the Mortgagee receives documentation in a
297 form approved by the attorney general demonstrating that the Tenants of the Housing
298 Accommodation have been informed of the Owner's intent to seek a Short-Sale or Deed in Lieu
299 and the Tenants have had the opportunity to express their interest in exercising a right of first
300 refusal within 60 days or the opportunity to assigned their right of first refusal, or the Tenants
301 have waived those rights. If Tenants have not affirmatively expressed their interest in exercising
302 a right of first refusal or in assigning that right within 60 days, or have not affirmatively waived
303 that right within 60 days, the Tenants' rights are deemed waived.
304 (3) Before a Housing Accommodation may be transferred by Short-Sale or Deed in Lieu,
305 the Owner, other than the Owner of a 1-4 unit owner-occupied property shall notify each Tenant
306 household, with a simultaneous copy to the attorney general and the municipality adopting this
307 section, by regular and certified mail, of any bona fide offer that the Mortgagee intends to accept.
308 Before any Short-Sale or transfer by Deed in Lieu, the Owner shall give each Tenant household
309 such a notice of the offer only if households constituting at least 51 per cent of the households
15 of 22

310 occupying the Housing Accommodation notify the Owner, in writing, that they collectively
311 desire to receive information relating to the proposed Sale. Tenants may indicate this desire
312 within the same notice described in paragraph (2). Any notice of the offer required to be given
313 under this subsection shall include the price, calculated as a single lump sum amount and of any
314 promissory notes offered in lieu of cash payment.
315 (4) A Tenant Association representing at least 51 per cent of the households occupying
316 the Housing Accommodation that are entitled to notice under the preceding paragraph (3) shall
317 have the collective right to purchase, in the case of a Third-Party Offer that the Mortgagee
318 intends to accept, provided that it:
319 (i) submits to the Owner reasonable evidence that the Tenants of at least 51 per cent of
320 the occupied units in the Housing Accommodation have approved the purchase of the Housing
321 Accommodation,
322 (ii) submits to the Owner a proposed purchase and sale agreement on substantially
323 equivalent terms and conditions within 60 days of receipt of notice of the offer made under the
324 preceding paragraph (3),
325 (iii) obtains a binding commitment for any necessary financing or guarantees within an
326 additional 90 days after execution of the purchase and sale agreement, and
327 (iv) closes on such purchase within an additional 90 days after the end of the 90-day
328 period described in clause (iii).
329 No Owner shall unreasonably refuse to enter into, or unreasonably delay the execution or
330 closing on a purchase and sale with Tenants who have made a bona fide offer to meet the price
16 of 22

331 and substantially equivalent terms and conditions of an offer for which notice is required to be
332 given pursuant to paragraph (3). Failure of the Tenants to submit such a purchase and sale
333 agreement within the first 60-day period, to obtain a binding commitment for financing within
334 the additional 90-day period or to close on the purchase within the second 90-day period, shall
335 serve to terminate the rights of such Tenants to purchase. The time periods herein provided may
336 be extended by agreement. Nothing herein shall be construed to require an Owner to provide
337 financing to such Tenants. A Tenant Association that has the right to purchase hereunder, at its
338 election, may assign its purchase right hereunder to the city or town in which the Housing
339 Accommodation is located, or the housing authority of the city or town in which the Housing
340 Accommodation is located, or an agency of the commonwealth, nonprofit, community
341 development corporation, affordable housing developer, or land trust. A right to purchase
342 hereunder shall be for the purpose of maintaining the use of the Housing Accommodation as
343 permanently affordable rental housing.
344 (5) The right of first refusal created herein shall inure to the Tenants for the time periods
345 hereinbefore provided, beginning on the date of notice to the Tenants under paragraph (1). The
346 effective period for such right of first refusal shall begin anew for each different offer to
347 purchase that the Mortgagee intends to accept. The right of first refusal shall not apply with
348 respect to any offer received by the Owner for which a notice is not required pursuant to said
349 paragraph (3).
350 (6) In any instance where the Tenants are not the successful purchaser of the Housing
351 Accommodation, the Mortgagee shall provide evidence of compliance with this section by filing
352 an affidavit of compliance signed under the penalty of perjury with the attorney general, and the
17 of 22

353 registry of deeds for the county and district where the property is located within 7 days of the
354 Sale.
355 (7) The attorney general shall enforce this subsection (e) and shall promulgate rules and
356 regulations necessary for enforcement. The attorney general may seek injunctive, declaratory,
357 and compensatory relief on behalf of Tenants and the Commonwealth in a court of competent
358 jurisdiction. The attorney general shall post a sample intent to sell notice, sample proof of notice
359 to Tenants, sample notice of offer, and other necessary documents.
360 (f) Foreclosures. In any city or town that adopts the provisions of this Section:
361 (1) When a Mortgagee seeks to foreclose, the Mortgagee shall provide copies of all
362 Foreclosure notices required by Chapter 244, sections 14 and 35A, or any other applicable
363 Foreclosure law, by regular and certified mail to the Tenants of the Housing Accommodation
364 and to the municipality adopting this Section. The Mortgagee shall also provide Tenants and the
365 municipality, by regular and certified mail, with a copy of any Complaint filed in Land Court and
366 any Order of Notice issued by the Land Court, pursuant to the Service Members Civil Relief Act
367 if applicable, within five (5) days of issuance.
368 (2) The Mortgagee shall provide each Tenant household and the municipality adopting
369 this Section, by regular and certified mail, a copy of any and all Notices of Sale published
370 pursuant to Section 14 of chapter 244.
371 (3) No later than 5 business days before the Foreclosure Auction of a Housing
372 Accommodation, the Tenants shall inform the Mortgagee, in writing, if a Tenants Association
373 representing at least fifty-one percent of the households occupying the Housing Accommodation
18 of 22

374 or an entity to which they have assigned their right of first refusal intend to exercise their right of
375 first refusal at Auction and desire to receive information relating to the proposed Auction.
376 (4) A Tenants Association representing at least fifty-one percent of the households
377 occupying the Housing Accommodation or their assignee may exercise their collective right to
378 purchase the Housing Accommodation, in the event of a Third-Party Offer at Auction that the
379 Mortgagee receives, provided that the Tenants Association
380 (i) submits to the Mortgagee reasonable evidence that the Tenants of at least fifty-one
381 percent of the occupied homes in the Housing Accommodation have approved the purchase of
382 the Housing Accommodation,
383 (ii) submits to the Mortgagee a proposed purchase and sale agreement on substantially
384 equivalent terms and conditions to that received by the Mortgagee in the Third-Party Offer
385 within sixty days of receipt of notice of the bid made under paragraph (3) of this section,
386 (iii) obtains a binding commitment for any necessary financing or guarantees within an
387 additional ninety days after execution of the purchase and sale agreement, and
388 (iv) closes on such purchase within an additional ninety days after the end of the ninety-
389 day period under clause (iii).
390 No Mortgagee shall unreasonably refuse to enter into, or unreasonably delay the
391 execution or closing on a purchase and sale with Tenants who have made a bona fide offer to
392 meet the price and substantially equivalent terms and conditions of a bid received at Auction.
393 Failure of the Tenants to submit such a purchase and sale agreement within the first sixty day
394 period, to obtain a binding commitment for financing within the additional ninety day period or
19 of 22

395 to close on the purchase within the second ninety-day period, shall serve to terminate the rights
396 of such Tenants to purchase. The time periods herein provided may be extended by agreement.
397 Nothing herein shall be construed to require a Mortgagee to provide financing to such
398 Tenants. A Tenant Association which has the right to purchase hereunder, at its election, may
399 assign its purchase right hereunder to the city, town, housing authority, or agency of the
400 commonwealth, nonprofit, community development corporation, affordable housing developer,
401 or land trust; a right to purchase hereunder shall be for the purpose of maintaining the use of the
402 Housing Accommodation as permanently affordable rental housing.
403 If there are no third-party bids at Auction for the Housing Accommodation, the Tenants
404 shall have a right of first refusal whenever the Mortgagee seeks to sell the Housing
405 Accommodation. The Tenants shall be notified of any offers the Mortgagee intends to accept and
406 shall be given an opportunity to meet the price and substantially the terms of a Third-Party Offer
407 based on the same time line described in paragraph (4).
408 (5) The right of first refusal created herein shall inure to the Tenants for the time periods
409 herein before provided, beginning on the date of notice to the Tenants under paragraph (1).
410 (6) In any instance where the Tenants are not the successful purchaser, the seller of such
411 unit shall provide evidence of compliance with this Section by filing an affidavit of compliance
412 signed under the penalty of perjury with the attorney general, the Executive Office, and the
413 official records of the county where the property is located within seven days of the Sale.
414 (7) The attorney general shall enforce this subsection (f) and shall promulgate rules and
415 regulations necessary for enforcement. The attorney general may seek injunctive, declaratory,
416 and compensatory relief on behalf of Tenants and the Commonwealth in a court of competent
20 of 22

417 jurisdiction. The attorney general shall post a sample intent to sell notice, sample proof of notice
418 to Tenants, sample notice of offer, and other necessary documents.
419 (g) Any notice required by this section, except notice provided by a Tenant Association
420 to the municipality, shall be deemed to have been provided when delivered in person or mailed
421 by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, to the party to whom notice is required;
422 except that with respect to providing notice to Tenants, notice shall be deemed to have been
423 provided when either: (i) the notice is delivered in hand to the Tenant or an adult member of the
424 Tenant's household; or (ii) the notice is sent by first class mail and a copy is left in or under the
425 door of the Tenant's dwelling unit. A notice to the affected municipality shall be sent to the chief
426 executive officer.
427 (h) It is illegal for an Owner or their agent to take any action to evict, threaten, coerce, or
428 retaliate against a Tenant or Tenants in order to avoid application of this Section.
429 (i) A Tenant, Tenant Association, or Successor, Designee or assignee shall not solicit or
430 accept payment or any other consideration for assigning or waiving any rights under this section.
431 (j) Aggrieved Tenants, Tenant Associations, Designees, Successors, assignees, and
432 municipalities may seek damages under chapter 93A and may file a complaint with the attorney
433 general, and may also file a court complaint for equitable and/or monetary relief, including but
434 not limited to damages of a percentage of the sales price and/or injunctive relief in the form of
435 specific performance. Nothing in this Section shall be construed to limit or constrain in any way
436 the rights Tenants currently have under applicable laws, including but not limited to chapters 186
437 and 186A. At all times, all parties must negotiate in good faith.
21 of 22

439 purposes and implement this Section not later than 150 days after the effective date of this act.
