Cannabis Policy.
The Commonwealth of Massachusetts
_______________
In the One Hundred and Ninety-Fourth General Court
(2025-2026)
_______________
An Act for cannabis market modernization.
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives in General Court assembled, and by the authority
of the same, as follows:
1 Whereas, the cannabis industry has changed more rapidly than the regulatory framework
2 governing the Massachusetts marketplace anticipated;
3 Whereas, more than a dozen marijuana retailers, medical marijuana dispensaries and
4 marijuana cultivators went out of business in 2024, causing a loss of jobs and tax revenue in the
5 Commonwealth;
6 Whereas, there is an impending threat of many more cannabis business closures in areas
7 disproportionately impacted by cannabis criminalization, leaving businesses and low-income
8 individuals employed bearing the brunt of regulations that are not commensurate with public
9 safety, employee safety, or consumer needs;
10 Whereas, many social equity businesses are deprived by law of the most important
11 incident of small business ownership: the ability to profit from the sale of the business and
12 realize a return on investment;
1 of 13

13 Whereas, the appearance of hemp-derived THC intoxicating products on the shelves of
14 package stores and gas stations created the greatest external threat to the existing regulated
15 marketplace;
16 Whereas, a small, but significant number of cannabis businesses are in default of
17 payment obligations, leaving a receivables crisis for many cannabis suppliers;
18 Whereas, the Cannabis Control Commission in its current structure has been beset by
19 dysfunction and a lack of accountability; and
20 Whereas, reforms are needed to create a more stable and equitable cannabis industry in
21 the Commonwealth.

129 clearly requires otherwise, have the following meanings:-
130 “Artificially derived”, the creation of a chemical substance by a chemical reaction that
131 changes the molecular structure of any chemical substance.
132 “Cannabidiol (CBD)” means a nonpsychoactive cannabinoid found in the cannabis sativa
133 plant. CBD has the formula C21H30O2 and chemical structure, inclusive of stereochemical
134 variations. CBD is not tetrahydrocannabinol.
135 “Cannabinoids” means compounds structurally defined as a diverse class of C21 or C22
136 terpenophenolic compounds found in Cannabis sativa L., their carboxylic acids, analogs, and
7 of 13

137 transformation products. Cannabinoids, for the purposes of this chapter, shall include structurally
138 unrelated cannabimimetic compounds. The main cannabinoids found in cannabis plants are
139 Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and Cannabidiol (CBD). In addition to THC and CBD, there are
140 more than 100 cannabinoids that could be identified.
141 “Cannabimimetic”, a compound that is not structurally a cannabinoid, but which can
142 elicit a biological response similar to those produced by cannabinoids by acting directly or
143 indirectly on cannabinoid receptors in the body.
144 “Delta-8-tetrahydrocannabinol (Delta-8-THC)”, a psychoactive cannabinoid compound
145 found in the Cannabis sativa plant, but does not occur in naturally significant amounts. It has the
146 chemical formula C21H30O2 and the chemical structure inclusive of stereochemical variations.
147 “Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Delta-9-THC)”, a psychoactive cannabinoid compound
148 found in the Cannabis sativa plant, and the primary psychoactive compound found in marijuana.
149 Delta-9 THC has the formula C21H30O2 and the chemical structure inclusive of stereochemical
150 variations.
151 “Dry weight basis”, a method of determining the percentage of a chemical in a substance
152 after removing the moisture from the substance. The ratio of the amount of moisture in a sample
153 to the amount of dry solid in a sample.
154 “Decarboxylation”, a process of treating a cannabis material or product to remove
155 carboxyl groups from the cannabinoids native in the plant, to form transformation products such
156 as THC and CBD. Decarboxylation is commonly accomplished by application of heat.
157 Decarboxylation is not considered a synthetic process.
8 of 13

158 “Hemp-derived cannabinoid product”, a product derived from hemp intended for human
159 consumption, by means including, but not limited to ingestion, injection or inhalation, that
160 contains more than .5 milligrams of total tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) per any serving or other
161 individual unit, and 2.5 milligrams per multi-serving package, container, or packages or
162 containers sold as a single unit.
163 “Intoxicating tetrahydrocannabinols”, naturally occurring, synthetically derived,
164 artificially derived, isomerized, or synthetically converted tetrahydrocannabinols which, when
165 consumed, have the potential to induce disturbances in nervous system function and may result
166 in changes in cognition, perception, judgement, mood, consciousness, or behavior, that resolve
167 with time.
168 “Isomers”, molecules or polyatomic ions with identical molecular formulae (i.e., the
169 same number of atoms of each element) but distinct arrangements of atoms in space.
170 “Isomerization”, is the process in which a molecule, polyatomic ion or molecular
171 fragment is transformed into an isomer with a different chemical structure.
172 “Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)”, (i) all naturally, synthetically or artificially derived
173 tetrahydrocannabinols, or any structural, optical or geometric isomers or analogs of
174 tetrahydrocannabinols, which include but are not limited to, Delta-1 tetrahydrocannabinol; Delta-

176 tetrahydrocannabinol; Delta-10 tetrahydrocannabinol, Delta-11 tetrahydrocannabinol; (ii) any
177 other intoxicating tetrahydrocannabinols, (iii) any other naturally or artificially derived
178 cannabinoid that has an intoxicating or psychoactive effect; and (iv) any other chemically similar
179 compound, substance, derivative, or isomer of tetrahydrocannabinol.

195 SECTION 13. Chapter 94G of the General Laws, as so appearing, is hereby amended by
196 inserting after section 24 the following section:-
197 Section 25. It shall be unlawful for any licensee under this chapter to receive credit,
198 directly or indirectly, for marijuana or marijuana products sold or delivered to any licensee
199 engaged in the sale of marijuana or marijuana products for a period of not more than sixty days.
200 Nothing in this chapter shall require any licensee to extend credit to any other licensee. The
10 of 13

201 credit period shall be calculated from the date of the delivery of the marijuana or marijuana
202 products to the purchasing licensee to the date when the purchasing licensee discharges in full
203 the indebtedness for which the credit was extended. If any licensee does not discharge in full any
204 such indebtedness within such sixty day period, the indebtedness shall be overdue and such
205 licensee shall be delinquent within the meaning of this section. Within three days after a licensee
206 becomes delinquent, the licensee who extended the credit shall mail a letter of notice by certified
207 mail to the commission and a copy thereof to the delinquent licensee. The notice shall contain
208 the name of the delinquent licensee, the date of delivery of the marijuana and marijuana
209 products, the amount of the indebtedness remaining undischarged, and all available proof of the
210 indebtedness and delinquency. Within five days after receipt of such a letter of notice, the
211 commission shall post on its website the name and address only of the delinquent licensee in a
212 complete and current delinquent list containing the names and addresses of all delinquent
213 licensees. Such posting shall constitute notice to all licensees of the delinquency of such licensee.
214 If a licensee is seriously damaged in his business by riot, insurrection, civil disturbance,
215 fire, explosion or by an act of God, so-called, the licensee may file an application with the
216 commission requesting that the provisions of the first paragraph of this section be suspended as
217 to him for a reasonable period. The commission shall set down the application for hearing within
218 twenty-one days and shall notify all licensees engaged in selling to said applicant of the hearing
219 and give all interested parties the right to be heard. Pending such hearing, the commission may,
220 after an investigation and determination that the facts as stated by the licensee in his application
221 would constitute reasonable grounds for relief, order that such licensee shall not be posted as
222 delinquent. If the commission finds it is in the public interest to do so, it may suspend the
223 application of said first paragraph with respect to the applicant for such period as it may consider
11 of 13

224 to be reasonable and in the public interest. Such action shall not deprive licensees of all legal
225 rights available to them for the collection of the indebtedness and shall be contingent on such
226 terms and conditions as the commission shall determine.
227 No licensee under this chapter shall sell or deliver, directly or indirectly, marijuana or
228 marijuana products to a licensee whose name is posted on the delinquent list, except for payment
229 in cash on or before delivery, and no licensee who is posted on the delinquent list shall purchase
230 or accept delivery of any marijuana or marijuana products except for payment in cash on or
231 before delivery.
232 The commission shall not authorize a change of ownership or control of a licensee on the
233 delinquent list until all delinquencies are satisfied and the commission has removed the licensee
234 from the delinquent list under this section, except for approval of court-appointed receivers or
235 trustees under a voluntary assignment for the benefit of creditors, provided that prior approval of
236 such assignment is obtained from the commission after notice to all creditors has been given and
237 reasonable time allowed for objections by all creditors.
238 Upon full discharge of the indebtedness for which a licensee was posted, the licensee
239 who filed the letter of notice of delinquency shall, within twenty-four hours thereafter, notify the
240 commission, by mailing a letter by certified mail addressed to the commission of the discharge of
241 the indebtedness. The commission shall immediately strike the name of the delinquent licensee
242 from the list.
243 Notwithstanding and in lieu of any other penalty in any other provision of this chapter,
244 any person who violates any provision of this section shall be punished by a fine of not more
245 than five thousand dollars.
12 of 13

246 The provisions of this section shall apply to all credit extended after April the first, two
247 thousand and twenty.
248 The commission shall promulgate any necessary regulations to implement this section
249 within 90 days of the effective date.
250 SECTION 14. Chapter 128 of the General Laws, as so appearing, is hereby amended by
251 inserting after section 124 the following section:-
252 Section 125. The attorney general may make a complaint or seek indictment against any
253 person for the sale of hemp or hemp-derived products that are not approved for use, ingestion, or
254 inhalation by consumers by the Department and the Department of Public Health where such
255 person does not hold a license authorizing the sale of such hemp or hemp-derived products from
256 the Department or the Cannabis Control Commission. Any person, 90 days after the filing of a
257 complaint with the attorney general, or sooner if the attorney general assents in writing, and
258 within 3 years after the sale of hemp or hemp-derived products, may institute and prosecute in
259 his own name and on his own behalf, or for others similarly situated, a civil action for injunctive
260 relief to enjoin the sale of such hemp or hemp-derived products and any other relief the court
261 may deem just and equitable. Any person instituting such action shall be deemed aggrieved and
262 jurisdiction for such action shall lie in the superior court department whether or not the person
263 has suffered monetary damages. Any person who prevails in such an action shall be awarded
264 treble damages, if any, the costs of the litigation and reasonable attorneys' fees.
