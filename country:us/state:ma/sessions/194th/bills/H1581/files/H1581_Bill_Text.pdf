17 (F) is equipped with an override of the mechanism that:
18 (i) may be activated by an employee of a business establishment; and
19 (ii) creates a record of each activation of the override.
20 (b)(1) A retailer shall not sell to the same person, and a person shall not purchase,
21 products containing more than three and six tenths (3.6) grams per day or more than nine (9)
22 grams per thirty day period of ephedrine or pseudoephedrine base, or their isomers. The limits
23 shall apply to the total amount of base ephedrine and pseudoephedrine contained in the products,
24 and not the overall weight of the products.
25 (2) Nonprescription products containing pseudoephedrine or ephedrine shall be
26 maintained behind the counter or in a locked case where the customer does not have direct
27 access.
28 (c) The retailer shall require any person purchasing a nonprescription product that

31 quantity of product purchased; date and time purchased; and purchaser identification type and
32 number, such as driver license state and number, and require the purchaser’s signature in a

34 (d) Beginning January 1, 2026, a retailer shall, before completing a sale under this
35 section, electronically submit the required information to the real-time stop sale system
36 administered by the department of public health or such other appropriate state agency; provided
37 that the system is available without a charge to retailers for access. Absent negligence,
38 wantonness, recklessness, or deliberate misconduct, any retailer utilizing the electronic sales
39 tracking system in accordance with this subdivision shall not be civilly liable as a result of any
40 act or omission in carrying out the duties required by this subsection and shall be immune from
41 liability to any third party unless the retailer has violated any provision of this subsection in
42 relation to a claim brought for such violation.
43 (e) If a retailer selling a nonprescription product containing pseudoephedrine or
44 ephedrine experiences mechanical or electronic failure of the electronic sales tracking system
45 and is unable to comply with the electronic sales tracking requirement, the retailer shall maintain
46 a written log or an alternative electronic recordkeeping mechanism until such time as the retailer
47 is able to comply with the electronic sales tracking requirement.
48 (f) The vendor of the real time stop sale system shall forward state transaction records in
49 the real-time stop sale system to the appropriate state agency weekly, and provide real-time
50 access to the real-time stop sale system information through the system’s online portal to law
51 enforcement in the state as authorized by the agency.

55 generates a stop sale alert. The system shall contain an override function that may be used by a
56 dispenser of ephedrine or pseudoephedrine who has a reasonable fear of imminent bodily harm if
57 they do not complete a sale. Each instance in which the override function is utilized shall be
58 logged by the system.
59 (h) A violation of any provision of this section is a misdemeanor, punishable by fine
60 only, not to exceed $1,000 for a first violation of this section, and not to exceed $5,000 for any
61 subsequent violation. If a product is dispensed in violation of subsection (a), the owner or
62 operator of the wholesale or retail establishment dispensing the product shall be in violation of
63 subsection (a).
64 (i) This section does not apply to a person who obtains the product pursuant to a valid
65 prescription.
66 (j) This section shall preempt and supersede any local laws or ordinances regulating sales
67 of products containing pseudoephedrine or ephedrine.
