65 be addressed.
66 Section 2. Creditor’s Conduct Pursuant to a Debtor’s Statement of Economic Abuse
67 (a) Within ten business days of receipt of a Debtor’s Statement of Debt incurred through

69 furnished adverse information about the Debtor, that the Debtor disputes the adverse
70 information.
4 of 13

74 cease all attempts to collect the Debt incurred through Economic Abuse from the Debtor;
75 refrain from filing any lawsuit to collect the Debt incurred through Economic Abuse;

79 the Debtor using the Debtor’s preferred contact method;
80 pending resolution of a motion by the Debtor to challenge the underlying judgment, cease
81 all garnishment of funds from the Debtor on the Debt incurred through Economic Abuse;

83 return all payments made by the Debtor on the Debt incurred through Economic Abuse;
84 and
85 contact any consumer reporting agency to which it furnished information about the
86 Debtor and the Debt incurred through Economic Abuse and request they delete such information.
87 (c) If the Creditor seeks a court order in a court of competent jurisdiction declaring that
88 the Debt was not incurred through Economic Abuse pursuant to Section 3(b), the actions
89 required in Section 2(b)(v), (vi), and (vii) are only required within 10 days of a final resolution of
90 the Creditor’s challenge.
5 of 13

91 (d) If the Debtor provides to a Creditor a statement including some but not all of the
92 information required of a Statement of Debt incurred through Economic Abuse, or an oral
93 Statement of Economic Abuse incurred through Economic Abuse without Adequate
94 Documentation, the Creditor shall notify the Debtor within 5 business days, using the Debtor’s
95 preferred contact method, of the additional information needed to complete the Statement of
96 Debt incurred through Economic Abuse and of the Adequate Documentation requirement. If the
97 Debtor provides a Statement of Debt incurred through Economic Abuse orally, the Creditor shall
98 inform the Debtor of the option to receive the notice in writing.
99 (e) A Creditor who provides the Debtor with Model Form A–1, in both English and
100 Spanish, complies with the requirement in Section 2(c) to notify the Debtor of the additional
101 information needed to complete the Statement of Debt incurred through Economic Abuse and of
102 the Adequate Documentation.
103 (f) Any written notices under this section must be provided to all Debtors in both English
104 and Spanish. If the Creditor provides oral interpretation services, or otherwise communicates
105 with the Debtor, whether orally or in writing, the creditor must provide the notice, orally or in
106 writing, required under this subsection to the Debtor in their preferred language.
107 (g) Not later than 180 days after the date of the enactment of this section, the
108 Massachusetts Attorney General’s Office shall publish Model Form A-1 in English and Spanish.
109 (h) The Attorney General’s Office may publish Model Form A-1 in any other language
110 the Massachusetts Attorney General’s Office determines is the first language of a significant
111 number of consumers in the State. This determination shall be, at the discretion of the
112 Massachusetts Attorney General’s Office, based on the numerical percentages of all consumers
6 of 13

113 in the State for whom English or Spanish is not a first language or in a manner consistent with
114 any regulations promulgated by the Massachusetts Attorney General’s Office for this purpose.
115 (i) If the Debtor provides a Statement of Debt incurred through Economic Abuse and
116 Adequate Documentation to the Creditor, the Creditor shall not sell the Debt or transfer it for
117 consideration. If the Creditor does not own the Debt and is collecting the Debt for another, then
118 the Creditor must notify the owner of the Debt that it has ceased collection activities against the
119 Debtor because the Debt was incurred through Economic Abuse. If the Creditor proves that the
120 debt is not a Debt incurred through Economic Abuse per section 3(b), it may then sell or transfer
121 the debt and may resume collection activity.
122 (j) In connection with any communication related to a Debtor’s Statement of Debt
123 incurred through Economic Abuse, the Creditor:
124 Shall only use the contact information the Debtor provides in the Statement of Debt
125 incurred through Economic Abuse to contact the Debtor and shall not use any other contact
126 information;
127 Shall not disclose the contact information the Debtor provides in the Statement of Debt
128 incurred through Economic Abuse to any other person, including, but not limited to, the
129 Perpetrator of Economic Abuse or joint account holders, without the Debtor's express written
130 authorization; and
131 May request that the Debtor provide the identity of the Perpetrator of Economic Abuse
132 and contact information for that person if known by the Debtor.
133 Section 3. Civil Legal Remedies
7 of 13

134 (a) A Debtor is not liable for a Debt incurred through Economic Abuse. A Debtor may
135 raise as a defense in any forum and by any allowable procedure that a particular Debt, or portion
136 thereof, is a Debt incurred through Economic Abuse, including a motion to challenge a judgment
137 based on a Debt incurred through Economic Abuse.
138 (b) The Debtor establishes a prima facie case that a debt is incurred through Economic
139 Abuse by providing a Statement of Debt incurred through Economic Abuse and Adequate
140 Documentation. If the Creditor has a good faith basis to believe that the Debt was not incurred
141 through Economic Abuse, within 10 days of receipt of the Statement of Debt incurred through
142 Economic Abuse and Adequate Documentation, the Creditor may seek a court order in a court of
143 competent jurisdiction declaring that the Debt was not incurred through Economic Abuse. In
144 such a suit, the Creditor has the burden to disprove the Debt is incurred through Economic
145 Abuse.
146 (c) A person shall not cause another to incur a debt through Economic Abuse. A person
147 who is found to be a Perpetrator of Economic Abuse by a court of competent jurisdiction shall be
148 civilly liable to the Creditor for repayment of the alleged debt or to the Debtor to the extent that
149 the Debtor made payments or incurred costs related to the Debt.
150 (d) A Creditor may use all lawful rights and remedies to collect the amounts alleged
151 owed from the Perpetrator of Economic Abuse.
152 (e) In any court action, the court shall take appropriate steps necessary to prevent abuse
153 of the Debtor or an immediate family member of the Debtor, including, but not limited to,
154 impounding or sealing court records, redacting personally identifiable information about the
8 of 13

155 Debtor and any immediate family member of the Debtor, and directing that any deposition or
156 evidentiary hearing be conducted remotely.
157 (f) Any Creditor that fails to comply with any provision of Section 2 is liable to the
158 Debtor in an amount equal to the sum of --
159 Any actual damages sustained by the Debtor as a result of such noncompliance;
160 (i) In the case of any action by an individual, such additional damages as the court may
161 allow, but not exceeding $5,000, indexed annually for inflation, or
162 (ii) In the case of a class action,
163 (A) such amount for each named plaintiff as could be recovered under subparagraph (i),
164 and
165 (B) such amount as the court may allow for all other class members, without regard to a
166 minimum individual recovery, not to exceed the lesser of $500,000, indexed annually for
167 inflation, or 50 per centum of the net worth of the Creditor;
168 (C) Court costs and a reasonable attorney’s fee as determined by the court; and
169 (D) Punitive damages if the court finds that a Creditor’s noncompliance was willful.
170 (g) No agreement between a Debtor and any other person may contain any provision that
171 constitutes a waiver of any right conferred or cause of action created by this Act, and any such
172 waiver is void.
173 (h) The provisions of this Act apply to lawsuits filed in this state, regardless of whether a
174 related contract provides that the law of another state is chosen.
