34 disclose protected information, unless a court of competent jurisdiction determines by a
35 preponderance of the evidence, after providing notice and an opportunity to be heard to the
36 covered journalist, that the disclosure of the protected information is necessary to prevent, or to
37 identify any perpetrator of, an act of terrorism against the United States, the commonwealth or its

39 threat of imminent violence, bodily harm, or death.

50 relates to a covered journalist.

61 would present an imminent risk of death or serious bodily harm. The 45-day period may be
62 extended by the court for additional periods of not more than 45 days if the court makes a

65 investigation or would present an imminent risk of death or serious bodily harm.
66 (d) The content of any testimony, document, or protected information that is compelled
67 under paragraphs (b) and (c) shall not be overbroad, unreasonable, or oppressive, and as
68 appropriate, shall be limited to the purpose of verifying published information or describing any
69 surrounding circumstances relevant to the accuracy of such published information and narrowly
70 tailored in subject matter and time period covered to avoid compelling the production of
71 peripheral, nonessential, or speculative information.
