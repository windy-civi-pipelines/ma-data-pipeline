127 activities of an establishment of a controller or a processor in the commonwealth, regardless of
128 whether the processing takes place in the commonwealth.
129 (d) This chapter shall apply to the processing of personal data of data subjects who are in
130 the commonwealth by a controller or processor not established in the commonwealth where the

132 payment of the data subject is required, to data subjects in the commonwealth; or (ii) the
133 monitoring of data subjects’ behavior as far as the behavior takes place within the
134 commonwealth.
135 Section 3. (a) Personal data shall be: (i) processed lawfully, fairly and in a transparent
136 manner in relation to the data subject; (ii) collected only for specified, explicit and legitimate

7 of 81

139 processed; (iv) accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date; (v) kept in a form that permits
140 identification of data subjects for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which the
141 personal data is processed; and (vi) processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security of
142 the personal data, including protection against unauthorized or unlawful processing and against
143 accidental loss, destruction or damage, using appropriate technical or organizational measures.
144 (b) The controller shall be responsible for, and be able to demonstrate compliance with,
145 subsection (a).
146 (c) Further processing for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical
147 research purposes or statistical purposes shall, in accordance with subsection (a) of section 62,
148 not be considered to be incompatible with the initial purposes of collection described in clause
149 (ii) of subsection (a). Personal data may be stored for longer than described in clause (v) of said
150 subsection (a) if the personal data shall be processed solely for archiving purposes in the public
151 interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes in accordance with
152 subsection (a) of section 62; provided, that the storage shall be subject to implementation of the
153 appropriate technical and organizational measures required by this chapter in order to safeguard
154 the rights and freedoms of the data subject.
155 (d) Every reasonable step shall be taken to ensure that inaccurate personal data, having
156 regard to the purposes for which it is processed, is erased or rectified without delay.
157 Section 4. (a) Processing shall be legal only if and to the extent that at least 1 of the
158 following applies:
159 (i) the data subject has given consent to the processing of the data subject’s personal data
160 for 1 or more specific purposes;
8 of 81

161 (ii) processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is
162 party or in order to take steps at the request of the data subject prior to entering into a contract;
163 (iii) processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the controller
164 is subject;
165 (iv) processing is necessary in order to protect the vital interests of the data subject or of
166 another natural person;
167 (v) processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest
168 or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller; or
169 (vi) processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the
170 controller or by a third party, except where such interests are overridden by the interests or
171 fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject that require protection of personal data, in
172 particular where the data subject is a child; provided, however, that this clause shall not apply to
173 processing carried out by public authorities in the performance of official tasks.
174 (b) State agencies may maintain or introduce more specific provisions to adapt the
175 application of the rules of this chapter with regard to processing for compliance with clauses (iii)
176 and (v) of subsection (a) by determining more precisely specific requirements for the processing
177 and other measures to ensure lawful and fair processing, including for other specific processing
178 situations as provided for in sections 85 to 91, inclusive.
179 (c) The basis for the processing described in clauses (iii) and (v) of subsection (a) shall be
180 determined by the attorney general.
9 of 81

181 The purpose of the processing shall be determined by the attorney general. The attorney
182 general shall promulgate rules and regulations necessary to implement this chapter, including but
183 not limited to regulations regarding: (i) the general conditions governing the lawfulness of
184 processing by the controller; (ii) the types of data subject to the processing; (iii) the data subjects
185 concerned; (iv) the entities to, and the purposes for which, the personal data may be disclosed;
186 (v) the purpose limitation described in clause (ii) of subsection (a) of section 3; (vi) storage
187 periods; and (vii) processing operations and processing procedures, including measures to ensure
188 lawful and fair processing such as those for other specific processing situations as provided for in
189 sections 85 to 91, inclusive. The regulations shall meet an objective of public interest and be
190 proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued.
191 Where the processing for a purpose other than that for which the personal data has been
192 collected is not based on the data subject's consent, the controller shall, in order to ascertain
193 whether processing for another purpose is compatible with the purpose for which the personal
194 data was initially collected, consider: (1) any link between the purposes for which the personal
195 data was collected and the purposes of the intended further processing; (2) the context in which
196 the personal data was collected, in particular regarding the relationship between data subjects and
197 the controller; (3) the nature of the personal data, in particular whether special categories of
198 personal data is processed, pursuant to subsections (a) to (c), inclusive, of section 6, or whether
199 personal data related to criminal convictions and offenses is processed, pursuant to subsection (d)
200 of said section 6; (4) the possible consequences of the intended further processing for data
201 subjects; and (5) the existence of appropriate safeguards, which may include encryption or
202 pseudonymization.
10 of 81

203 Section 5. (a) Where processing is based on consent, the controller shall be able to
204 demonstrate that the data subject consented to processing of the data’s subject’s personal data.
205 (b) If the data subject's consent is given in the context of a written declaration which also
206 concerns other matters, the request for consent shall be presented in a manner which is clearly
207 distinguishable from the other matters, in an intelligible and easily accessible form, using clear
208 and plain language. Any part of the declaration that constitutes a violation of this chapter shall
209 not be binding.
210 (c) A data subject shall have the right to withdraw the data subject’s consent at any time.
211 The withdrawal of consent shall not affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent before
212 the withdrawal. Prior to giving consent, the data subject shall be informed that the data subject is
213 giving consent. Withdrawing consent shall be as easy as giving consent.
214 (d) When assessing whether consent is freely given, consideration shall be given as to
215 whether the performance of a contract, including the provision of a service, is conditional on
216 consent to the processing of personal data that is not necessary for the performance of that
217 contract.
218 (e) Where clause (i) of subsection (a) of section 4 applies, in relation to the offer of
219 information society services directly to a child, the processing of the personal data of a child
220 shall be lawful where the child is at least 16 years old. Where the child is below the age of 16
221 years, such processing shall be lawful only if and to the extent that consent is given or authorized
222 by the holder of parental responsibility over the child. The controller shall make reasonable
223 efforts to verify that consent is given or authorized by the holder of parental responsibility over
224 the child, taking into consideration available technology.
11 of 81

225 Section 6. (a) Processing of personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political
226 opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership, and the processing of
227 genetic data, biometric data for the purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person, data
228 concerning health or data concerning a natural person's sex life or sexual orientation shall be
229 prohibited.
230 (b) Subsection (a) shall not apply if:
231 (i) the data subject has given explicit consent to the processing of personal data for 1 or
232 more specified purposes, except where general, special or federal law provides that the
233 prohibition referred to in subsection (a) may not be lifted by the data subject;
234 (ii) processing is necessary for the purposes of carrying out the obligations and exercising
235 specific rights of the controller or of the data subject in the field of employment and social
236 security and social protection law in so far as it is authorized by general, special or federal law or
237 a collective agreement pursuant to a general or special law providing for appropriate safeguards
238 for the fundamental rights and the interests of the data subject;
239 (iii) processing is necessary to protect the vital interests of the data subject or of another
240 natural person where the data subject is physically or legally incapable of giving consent;
241 (iv) processing is carried out in the course of legitimate processing activities with
242 appropriate safeguards by a foundation, association or other not-for-profit body with a political,
243 philosophical, religious or trade union aim; provided, that the processing relates solely to the
244 members or to former members of the body or to persons who have regular contact with the body
245 in connection with the body’s purposes and that the personal data is not disclosed outside that
246 body without the consent of the data subjects;
12 of 81

247 (v) processing relates to personal data which is manifestly made public by the data
248 subject;
249 (vi) processing is necessary for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims or
250 whenever courts are acting in their judicial capacity;
251 (vii) processing is necessary for reasons of substantial public interest, on the basis of a
252 general or special law that shall be proportionate to the aim pursued, respect the essence of the
253 right to data protection and provide for suitable and specific measures to safeguard the
254 fundamental rights and the interests of the data subject;
255 (viii) processing is necessary for the purposes of: (1) preventive or occupational
256 medicine; (2) the assessment of the working capacity of the employee; (3) medical diagnosis; (4)
257 the provision of health or social care; or (5) treatment or the management of health or social care
258 systems and services on the basis of general or special law;
259 (ix) processing is necessary pursuant to contract with a health professional and subject to
260 the conditions and safeguards described in subsection (c);
261 (x) processing is necessary for reasons of public interest in the area of public health,
262 including but not limited to protecting against serious threats to health or ensuring high standards
263 of quality and safety of health care, on the basis of a general, special or federal law that provides
264 for suitable and specific measures to safeguard the rights and freedoms of the data subject, in
265 particular professional secrecy; or
266 (xi) processing is necessary for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or
267 historical research purposes or statistical purposes in accordance with subsection (a) of section
13 of 81

268 62 based on general or special law that shall be proportionate to the aim pursued, respect the
269 essence of the right to data protection and provide for suitable and specific measures to safeguard
270 the fundamental rights and the interests of the data subject.
271 (c) Personal data referred to in subsection (a) may be processed for the purposes referred
272 to in clauses (viii) and (ix) of subsection (b) when the data is processed by or under the
273 responsibility of a professional subject to the obligation of professional secrecy pursuant to state
274 or federal law or rules established by national competent bodies or by another person also subject
275 to an obligation of secrecy under state or federal law or rules established by national competent
276 bodies.
277 State agencies may maintain or introduce further conditions, including limitations, with
278 regard to the processing of genetic data, biometric data or data concerning health.
279 (d) Processing of personal data relating to criminal convictions and offences or related
280 security measures based on subsection (a) of section 4 shall be carried out only under the control
281 of official authority or when the processing is authorized by general or special law providing for
282 appropriate safeguards for the rights and freedoms of data subjects. Any comprehensive register
283 of criminal convictions shall be kept only under the control of official authority.
284 (e) If the purposes for which a controller processes personal data do not or do no longer
285 require the identification of a data subject by the controller, the controller shall not be obliged to
286 maintain, acquire or process additional information in order to identify the data subject for the
287 sole purpose of complying with this chapter; provided, that if the controller is able to
288 demonstrate that the controller is not in a position to identify the data subject, the controller shall
289 inform the data subject accordingly, if possible; and, provided further, that sections 10 to 15,
14 of 81

290 inclusive, shall not apply except where the data subject, for the purpose of exercising the data
291 subject’s rights under said sections, provides additional information enabling the data subject’s
292 identification.
293 Section 7. (a) The controller shall take appropriate measures to provide any information
294 referred to in sections 8 and 9 and any communication pursuant to sections 10 to 17, inclusive,
295 and section 28 relating to processing to the data subject in a concise, transparent, intelligible and
296 easily accessible form, using clear and plain language, in particular for any information
297 addressed specifically to a child. The information shall be provided in writing, or by other
298 means, including, where appropriate, by electronic means. When requested by the data subject,
299 the information may be provided orally; provided, that the identity of the data subject is proven
300 by other means.
301 (b) The controller shall facilitate the exercise of data subject rights pursuant to sections
302 10 to 17. In the cases referred to in subsection (e) of section 6, the controller shall not refuse to
303 act on the request of the data subject for exercising the data subject’s rights pursuant to said
304 sections 10 to 17, unless the controller demonstrates that the controller is not in a position to
305 identify the data subject.
306 (c) The controller shall provide information on action taken on a request pursuant to
307 sections 10 to 17 to the data subject without undue delay and in any event within 1 month of
308 receipt of the request; provided, however, that the period to provide information may be
309 extended by 2 further months where necessary, taking into account the complexity and number
310 of the requests. The controller shall inform the data subject of any extension within 1 month of
311 receipt of the request, together with the reasons for the delay. Where the data subject makes the
15 of 81

312 request by electronic form means, the information shall be provided by electronic means where
313 possible, unless otherwise requested by the data subject.
314 (d) If the controller does not take action on the request of the data subject, the controller
315 shall inform the data subject without delay and at the latest within 1 month of receipt of the
316 request of the reasons for not taking action and on the possibility of lodging a complaint with the
317 attorney general and seeking a judicial remedy.
318 (e) Information provided pursuant to sections 8 and 9 and any communication and any
319 actions taken pursuant to sections 10 to 17, inclusive, and section 28 shall be provided free of
320 charge. Where requests from a data subject are manifestly unfounded or excessive, in particular
321 because of their repetitive character, the controller may: (i) charge a reasonable fee, taking into
322 account the administrative costs of providing the information or communication or taking the
323 action requested; or (ii) refuse to act on the request. The controller shall bear the burden of
324 demonstrating the manifestly unfounded or excessive character of the request.
325 (f) Notwithstanding subsection (e) of section 6, where the controller has reasonable
326 doubts concerning the identity of the natural person making the request referred to in sections 10
327 to 16, the controller may request the provision of additional information necessary to confirm the
328 identity of the data subject.
329 (g) The information to be provided to data subjects pursuant to sections 8 and 9 may be
330 provided in combination with standardized icons in order to give in an easily visible, intelligible
331 and clearly legible manner a meaningful overview of the intended processing. Where the icons
332 are presented electronically, the icons shall be machine-readable.
16 of 81

333 Section 8. (a) Where personal data relating to a data subject is collected from the data
334 subject, the controller shall, at the time when personal data is obtained, provide the data subject
335 with all of the following information:
336 (i) the identity and the contact details of the controller and, where applicable, of the
337 controller's representative;
338 (ii) the contact details of the data protection officer, where applicable;
339 (iii) the purposes of the processing for which the personal data is intended as well as the
340 legal basis for the processing;
341 (iv) where the processing is based on clause (vi) of subsection (a) of section 4, the
342 legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party; and
343 (v) the recipients or categories of recipients of the personal data, if any.
344 (vi) the period for which the personal data will be stored, or if that is not possible, the
345 criteria used to determine that period;
346 (vii) the existence of the right to request from the controller access to and rectification or
347 erasure of personal data or restriction of processing concerning the data subject or to object to
348 processing, as well as the right to data portability;
349 (viii) where the processing is based on clause (i) of subsection (a) of section 4 or clause
350 (i) of subsection (b) of section 6, the existence of the right to withdraw consent at any time,
351 without affecting the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal;

648 activities on behalf of the controller, the same data protection obligations as set out in the
649 contract or other legal act between the controller and the processor as referred to in subsection
650 (c) shall be imposed on the other processor by way of a contract or other legal act pursuant to
651 state or federal law, in particular providing sufficient guarantees to implement appropriate

732 under the authority of the controller or the processor who has access to personal data does not
733 process the personal data except on instructions from the controller, unless the person is required
734 to do so by state or federal law.
735 Section 27. (a) In the case of a personal data breach, the controller shall without undue
736 delay and, where feasible, not later than 72 hours after having become aware of it, notify the
737 personal data breach to the attorney general, unless the personal data breach is unlikely to result
738 in a risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons. Where the notification to the attorney
739 general is not made within 72 hours, the notification shall be accompanied by reasons for the
740 delay.
741 (b) The processor shall notify the controller without undue delay after becoming aware of
742 a personal data breach.
743 (c) The notification referred to in subsection (a) shall, at a minimum:
744 (i) describe the nature of the personal data breach including where possible, the
745 categories and approximate number of data subjects concerned and the categories and

817 representatives of data subjects on the intended processing, without prejudice to the protection of
818 commercial or public interests or the security of processing operations.
819 (i) Where processing pursuant to clauses (iii) or (v) of subsection (a) of section 4: (1) has
820 a legal basis in state or federal law to which the controller is subject; (2) that law regulates the
821 specific processing operation or set of operations in question; and (3) a data protection impact
822 assessment has already been carried out as part of a general impact assessment in the context of
823 the adoption of that legal basis, subsections (a) to (g), inclusive shall not apply unless the
824 attorney generals deems it to be necessary to carry out such an assessment prior to processing
825 activities.
826 (j) Where necessary, the controller shall carry out a review to assess if processing is
827 performed in accordance with the data protection impact assessment at least when there is a
828 change of the risk represented by processing operations.

1471 including the right to lodge a complaint with the attorney general pursuant to section 51, each
1472 data subject shall have the right to an effective judicial remedy where the data subject considers
1473 that the data subject’s rights under this chapter have been infringed as a result of the processing
1474 of the data subject’s personal data in non-compliance with this chapter. Proceedings against a
1475 controller or a processor shall be brought before the superior court.

1477 organization or association to lodge a complaint on behalf of the data subject, to exercise the
1478 rights referred to in sections 51 to 53, inclusive, on behalf of the data subject and to exercise the

1485 data subject's mandate, has the right to lodge a complaint with the attorney general pursuant to
72 of 81

1486 section 51 and to exercise the rights referred to in sections 52 and 53 if the body, organization or
1487 association considers that the rights of a data subject pursuant this chapter have been infringed as
1488 a result of the processing.
1489 Section 55. (a) Any person who has suffered material or non-material damage as a result

1492 (b) Any controller involved in processing shall be liable for the damage caused by
1493 processing which infringes this chapter. A processor shall be liable for the damage caused by

1495 processors or where it has acted outside or contrary to lawful instructions of the controller.
1496 (c) A controller or processor shall be exempt from liability as specified in subsection (b)
1497 if the controller or processor proves that the controller or processor is not in any way responsible

1500 involved in the same processing and where the controller and processor are responsible for any
1501 damage caused by processing, each controller or processor shall be held liable for the entire
1502 damage in order to ensure effective compensation of the data subject. Where a controller or
1503 processor has paid full compensation for the damage suffered, that controller or processor shall
1504 be entitled to claim back from the other controllers or processors involved in the same processing
1505 that part of the compensation corresponding to their part of responsibility for the damage, in
1506 accordance with the conditions set out in subsection (b).

1511 (d) to (f), inclusive, shall in each individual case be effective, proportionate and dissuasive.
1512 (b) Administrative fines shall, depending on the circumstances of each individual case, be
1513 imposed in addition to, or instead of, measures referred to in subsections (vii) to (xiv), inclusive
1514 and (xvi) of section 46. When deciding whether to impose an administrative fine and deciding on

1526 infringement and mitigate the possible adverse effects of the infringement;
74 of 81

1527 (vii) the categories of personal data affected by the infringement;

1531 have previously been ordered against the controller or processor concerned with regard to the
1532 same subject-matter, compliance with those measures;
1533 (x) adherence to approved codes of conduct pursuant to section 34 or approved
1534 certification mechanisms pursuant to section 36; and

1538 processing operations, infringes several provisions of this chapter, the total amount of the
1539 administrative fine shall not exceed the amount specified for the gravest infringement.

1570 (h) The exercise by the attorney general of powers pursuant to this section shall be
1571 subject to appropriate procedural safeguards in accordance with state and federal law, including
1572 effective judicial remedy and due process.
1573 Section 57. The general court may enact general and special laws providing rules on
1574 other penalties applicable to infringements of this chapter, in particular for infringements that are
1575 not subject to administrative fines pursuant to section 56, and shall take all measures necessary to
1576 ensure that they are implemented. The penalties shall be effective, proportionate and dissuasive.
1577 Section 58. (a) The general court shall enact general or special laws to reconcile the right
1578 to the protection of personal data pursuant to this chapter with the right to freedom of expression
1579 and information, including processing for journalistic purposes and the purposes of academic,
1580 artistic or literary expression.
1581 (b) For processing carried out for journalistic purposes or the purpose of academic artistic
1582 or literary expression, the general court shall enact general or special laws that provide for
1583 exemptions or derogations from sections 4 to 50, inclusive, and sections 59 to 64 if exemptions
1584 or derogations are necessary to reconcile the right to the protection of personal data with the
1585 freedom of expression and information.
1586 Section 59. Personal data in official documents held by a public authority or a public
1587 body or a private body for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest may be

1589 reconcile public access to official documents with the right to the protection of personal data
1590 pursuant to this chapter.
1591 Section 60. The attorney general may further determine the specific conditions for the
1592 processing of a social security number, driver’s license number or any other identifier of general
1593 application. In that case, the social security number, driver’s license number or other identifier of
1594 general application shall be used only under appropriate safeguards for the rights and freedoms
1595 of the data subject pursuant to this chapter.
1596 Section 61. The general court may, by law or by collective agreements, provide for more
1597 specific rules to ensure the protection of the rights and freedoms in respect of the processing of
1598 employees' personal data in the employment context, in particular for the purposes of:

1602 (v) protection of employer's or customer's property; (vi) the exercise and enjoyment, on an
1603 individual or collective basis, of rights and benefits related to employment; and (vii) the
1604 termination of the employment relationship. The rules shall include suitable and specific
1605 measures to safeguard the data subject's human dignity, legitimate interests and fundamental
1606 rights, with particular regard to the transparency of processing, the transfer of personal data
1607 within a group of undertakings, or a group of enterprises engaged in a joint economic activity
1608 and monitoring systems at the work place.
1609 Section 62. (a) Processing for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or
1610 historical research purposes or statistical purposes, shall be subject to appropriate safeguards, in
78 of 81

1611 accordance with this chapter, for the rights and freedoms of the data subject. The safeguards
1612 shall ensure that technical and organizational measures are in place in particular in order to
1613 ensure respect for the principle of data minimization. The measures may include
1614 pseudonymization; provided, that the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or
1615 statistical purposes can be fulfilled in with pseudonymization. Where said purposes can be
1616 fulfilled by further processing that does not permit or no longer permits the identification of data
1617 subjects, the purposes shall be fulfilled in that manner.
1618 (b) Where personal data is processed for scientific or historical research purposes or
1619 statistical purposes, general or special law may provide for derogations from the rights referred
1620 to in sections 10, 11, 13 and 16 subject to the conditions and safeguards referred to in subsection
1621 (a), in so far as the rights are likely to render impossible or seriously impair the achievement of
1622 the specific purposes and the derogations are necessary for the fulfilment of those purposes.
1623 (c) Where personal data is processed for archiving purposes in the public interest, general
1624 or special law may provide for derogations from the rights referred to in sections 10, 11, 13, 14,
1625 15 and 16, subject to the conditions and safeguards referred to in subsection (a), in so far as the
1626 rights are likely to render impossible or seriously impair the achievement of the specific purposes
1627 and the derogations are necessary for the fulfilment of those purposes.
1628 (d) Where processing referred to in subsections (b) and (c) serves at the same time
1629 another purpose, the derogations shall apply only to processing for the purposes referred to in
1630 said subsections (b) and (c).
1631 Section 63. The general court may enact general or special laws establishing specific
1632 rules to set out the powers of the attorney general described in clauses (v) and (vi) of subsection

1634 federal law or rules established by national competent bodies, to an obligation of professional
1635 secrecy or other equivalent obligations of secrecy; provided, that the rules are necessary and
1636 proportionate to reconcile the right of the protection of personal data with the obligation of
1637 secrecy. The rules shall apply only with regard to personal data which the controller or processor
1638 has received as a result of or has obtained in an activity covered by that obligation of secrecy.
1639 Section 64. Churches and religious associations or communities that apply
1640 comprehensive rules relating to the protection of natural persons with regard to processing may
1641 continue to apply said rules; provided, that the rules are brought into line with this chapter; and,
1642 provided further, that the churches and religious associations or communities shall be subject to
1643 the supervision of the attorney general.

1650 destinations, with particular regard to decisions adopted pursuant to subsection (c) of section 39.
1651 The attorney general shall take into account the positions and findings of state agencies and other
1652 relevant bodies or sources. The attorney general shall, if necessary, submit drafts of legislation to
1653 amend this chapter, in particular taking into account of developments in information technology

80 of 81

1655 (b) The attorney general shall, if appropriate, submit legislative proposals with a view to
1656 amending other general or special laws on the protection of personal data, in order to ensure

1658 limited to, the rules relating to the protection of natural persons with regard to processing by
1659 state institutions, bodies, offices and agencies and the free movement of data.
1660 SECTION 2. Notwithstanding chapter 93M of the General Laws, agreements involving
1661 the transfer of personal data to foreign destinations which were in place prior to the effective date
1662 of this act, and which comply with state and federal law as applicable prior to the effective date
1663 of this act, shall remain in force until amended, replaced or revoked.
