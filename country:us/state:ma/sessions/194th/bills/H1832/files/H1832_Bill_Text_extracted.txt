271 faith provides information or records including personnel records about a current or former
272 employee’s job performance and professional conduct to a prospective school employer or to the
273 Department of Elementary of Secondary Education shall be immune from criminal and civil
274 liability for the disclosure or any consequences of the disclosure, unless the information or
275 records were provided with the knowledge that they were false . Such immunity shall be in
