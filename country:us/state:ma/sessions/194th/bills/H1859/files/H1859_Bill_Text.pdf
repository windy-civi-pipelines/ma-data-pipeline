14 decision to follow the recommended treatment of a licensed medical or mental health provider. A
15 parent or legal guardian has the right to follow the advice and treatment plan of a licensed
16 medical or mental health provider over a contrary opinion or recommended treatment plan of
17 another licensed medical or mental health provider when the decision does not involve
18 immediate life-threatening conditions. Even in the case of life-threatening conditions, the
19 decision of the parent or legal guardian to follow the advice or treatment plan of a licensed
20 medical or mental health provider shall not be overridden unless there is clear and convincing
21 evidence to the contrary.
