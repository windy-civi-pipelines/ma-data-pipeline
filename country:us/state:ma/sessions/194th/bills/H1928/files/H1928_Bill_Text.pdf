7 b. The person had specific intent to facilitate or promote the criminal act.
8 c. The person committed an act that was substantial and directly connected to the

10 Physical presence at the scene of the crime shall not, by itself, establish accomplice
11 liability unless the individual’s presence:
12 a. Was intended to aid, abet, or encourage the principal offender.
13 b. Provided substantial assistance to the commission of the crime.
14 Constructive presence (e.g., serving as a lookout or getaway driver) shall suffice only if
15 the individual had prior knowledge of the principal’s intent and their actions were integral to the
16 crime.
17 SECTION 2. Chapter 265 of the General Laws, as appearing in the 2020 Official Edition,
18 is hereby amended by striking out Section 1 and inserting in place thereof the following section:
19 Section 1. Where a killing occurs during the commission or attempted commission of a
20 crime punishable with imprisonment for life, the killing shall amount to first-degree murder only
21 for a principal perpetrator who is personally and directly responsible for committing the killing
22 and acts with malice aforethought.
23 Accomplices who aid in the commission of a killing or are accessories before the fact but
24 are not personally and directly responsible for the killing shall face imprisonment of 2.5 to 25
25 years.
26 SECTION 3. Judges shall consider the following factors when sentencing accomplices:
27 a. The level of involvement in the crime.
28 b. Whether the accomplice’s actions resulted in harm or were peripheral to the offense.

32 of a felony, with the intent to hinder arrest or prosecution, shall be charged as an accessory after
33 the fact and face imprisonment for up to 10 years or a fine of up to $5,000.
34 Penalties for accessories after the fact shall be reduced if:
35 a. The individual’s actions did not involve violence or obstruction of justice.
36 b. Their assistance was minor or coerced.

38 individuals charged or convicted of murder or aiding in the commission of a killing before, on, or
39 after the effective date of this Act.

41 convicted as accessories after the fact.
