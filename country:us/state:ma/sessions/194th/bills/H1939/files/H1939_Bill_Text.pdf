5 affecting or purporting to affect his title thereto or an interest therein, and the instrument,
6 whether or not entitled to record or registration, is recorded or registered and indexed in the
7 registry of deeds or registered land district for the district wherein such land is situated, and a
8 period of ten years elapses after the instrument is accepted for record or registration, and the
9 instrument or the record or registration thereof because of defect, irregularity or omission fails to
10 comply in any respect with any requirement of law relating (1) to seals, corporate or individual,
11 (2) to the form of grantor clause in which a person purports to grant, mortgage, assign, release or
12 discharge an interest in real property as representative of or on behalf of a person, trust or entity

13 who owns or holds such interest and is also named in the grantor clause, (3) to the form or
14 validity of an acknowledgment or a certificate of acknowledgment, (4) to witnesses, attestation,
15 proof, method or form of execution, or the time of execution, (5) to recitals of consideration,
16 residence, address, or date, (6) to the authority of a person executing such an instrument on
17 behalf of an individual under a power of attorney, (7) to the method or form by which a person
18 acting under a power of attorney executes such an instrument on behalf of the principal, (8) to
19 the authority of a person executing such an instrument on behalf of a trust or entity and
20 purporting to hold the office or position of trustee, manager, partner, president, vice president,

23 power of attorney on behalf of such trust or entity, or (9) to the method or form by which such
24 person executes such an instrument on behalf of a trust or entity, such instrument and the record
25 thereof shall, notwithstanding any or all of such defects, irregularities and omissions, be effective
26 for all purposes to the same extent as though the instrument and the record thereof had originally
27 not been subject to the defect, irregularity or omission, or to the form of grantor clause in which
28 a person purports to grant, mortgage, assign, release or discharge an interest in real property in a
29 capacity other than that in which such person actually owns or holds such interest, unless within
30 said period of ten years a proceeding is commenced on account of the defect, irregularity or
31 omission, and notice thereof pursuant to section 15 of this chapter is duly recorded or registered
32 as appropriate and indexed and noted on the margin thereof under the name of the signer of the
33 instrument, the owner or holder of the affected interest at the time of the recording or registration

35 notice and, in the event of such proceeding, unless relief is thereby in due course granted.

37 recorded or registered before, on or after the effective date, except as to any such instruments or
38 documents for which a court proceeding challenging the effectiveness or validity of any such
39 instrument or document and the title derived therefrom has been commenced pursuant to this
40 section as in effect prior to said effective date.
