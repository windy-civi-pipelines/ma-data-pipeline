94 some or all of the user’s digital assets, including the content of electronic communications. If the
95 online tool allows the user to modify or delete a direction at all times, a direction regarding
96 disclosure using an online tool overrides a contrary direction by the user in a will, trust, power of
97 attorney or other record made prior to the date of the direction made by the user using an online
98 tool.
99 (b) The user may allow or prohibit in a will, trust, power of attorney, or other record,

102 record shall override a contrary direction by the user using an online tool that was made prior to
103 the date of such will or other record.
104 (c) A user’s direction under subsection (a) or (b) overrides (i) a contrary provision in a
105 terms-of-service agreement that does not require the user to act affirmatively and distinctly from
106 the user’s assent to the terms of service and (ii) a contrary prior direction from the user under
107 subsection (a) or (b).
108 (d) If the online tool has not been utilized by the user or if the custodian has not provided
109 an online tool and, in either case, if no direction regarding some or all of the digital assets is
110 provided to the fiduciary in a will or other record, the fiduciary may petition a court for access to
6 of 19
111 some or all of the user’s digital assets. The court shall grant such access unless it finds that the
112 fiduciary is not acting in good faith or that such access is prohibited by applicable federal law.

118 new or expanded rights other than those held by the user for whom, or for whose estate, the
119 fiduciary acts or represents.
120 (c) A fiduciary’s access to digital assets may be modified or eliminated by a user, by
121 federal law, or, subject to Section 4, by a terms-of-service agreement if the user has not provided

123 issued under Section 4(d).
124 Section 6. Procedure for disclosing digital assets
125 (a) When disclosing digital assets of a user under this chapter, the custodian shall, in
126 accordance with the direction provided under Section 4(a) or Section 4(b) or a court order issued
127 under Section 4(d):

129 recipient full access to the user’s account;
7 of 19
130 (2) subject to Section 6(d), grant a fiduciary or designated recipient partial access to the
131 user’s account to the extent that such partial access is requested by a fiduciary or designated
132 recipient; or
133 (3) at the option of the custodian, provide a fiduciary or designated recipient a copy in a
134 record of any digital asset that, on the date the custodian received the request for disclosure, the
135 user could have accessed if the user were alive and had full capacity and access to the account.
136 (b) A custodian may assess a reasonable administrative charge for the cost of disclosing
137 digital assets under this chapter.
138 (c) A custodian need not disclose under this chapter a digital asset deleted by a user.
139 (d) If a user directs or a fiduciary requests a custodian to disclose under this chapter
140 some, but not all, of the user’s digital assets, the custodian need not disclose the assets if
141 segregation of the assets would impose an undue burden on the custodian. If the custodian
142 believes the direction or request imposes an undue burden, the custodian or fiduciary may seek
143 an order from the court to disclose:
144 (1) a subset limited by date of the user’s digital assets;
145 (2) all of the user’s digital assets to the fiduciary or designated recipient;
146 (3) none of the user’s digital assets; or

159 electronic communications, (ii) a court order acknowledging that the user consented to the
160 disclosure of the content of electronic communications to the personal representative under the

94 some or all of the user’s digital assets, including the content of electronic communications. If the
95 online tool allows the user to modify or delete a direction at all times, a direction regarding
96 disclosure using an online tool overrides a contrary direction by the user in a will, trust, power of
97 attorney or other record made prior to the date of the direction made by the user using an online
98 tool.
99 (b) The user may allow or prohibit in a will, trust, power of attorney, or other record,

103 the date of such will or other record.
104 (c) A user’s direction under subsection (a) or (b) overrides (i) a contrary provision in a
105 terms-of-service agreement that does not require the user to act affirmatively and distinctly from
106 the user’s assent to the terms of service and (ii) a contrary prior direction from the user under
107 subsection (a) or (b).
108 (d) If the online tool has not been utilized by the user or if the custodian has not provided
109 an online tool and, in either case, if no direction regarding some or all of the digital assets is
110 provided to the fiduciary in a will or other record, the fiduciary may petition a court for access to
6 of 19

111 some or all of the user’s digital assets. The court shall grant such access unless it finds that the
112 fiduciary is not acting in good faith or that such access is prohibited by applicable federal law.

118 new or expanded rights other than those held by the user for whom, or for whose estate, the
119 fiduciary acts or represents.
120 (c) A fiduciary’s access to digital assets may be modified or eliminated by a user, by
121 federal law, or, subject to Section 4, by a terms-of-service agreement if the user has not provided

123 issued under Section 4(d).
124 Section 6. Procedure for disclosing digital assets
125 (a) When disclosing digital assets of a user under this chapter, the custodian shall, in
126 accordance with the direction provided under Section 4(a) or Section 4(b) or a court order issued
127 under Section 4(d):

129 recipient full access to the user’s account;
7 of 19

130 (2) subject to Section 6(d), grant a fiduciary or designated recipient partial access to the
131 user’s account to the extent that such partial access is requested by a fiduciary or designated
132 recipient; or
133 (3) at the option of the custodian, provide a fiduciary or designated recipient a copy in a
134 record of any digital asset that, on the date the custodian received the request for disclosure, the
135 user could have accessed if the user were alive and had full capacity and access to the account.
136 (b) A custodian may assess a reasonable administrative charge for the cost of disclosing
137 digital assets under this chapter.
138 (c) A custodian need not disclose under this chapter a digital asset deleted by a user.
139 (d) If a user directs or a fiduciary requests a custodian to disclose under this chapter
140 some, but not all, of the user’s digital assets, the custodian need not disclose the assets if
141 segregation of the assets would impose an undue burden on the custodian. If the custodian
142 believes the direction or request imposes an undue burden, the custodian or fiduciary may seek
143 an order from the court to disclose:
144 (1) a subset limited by date of the user’s digital assets;
145 (2) all of the user’s digital assets to the fiduciary or designated recipient;
146 (3) none of the user’s digital assets; or

150 communications of the user, the custodian shall disclose to the personal representative of the

159 electronic communications, (ii) a court order acknowledging that the user consented to the
160 disclosure of the content of electronic communications to the personal representative under the
161 user’s will, trust or other record or (iii) a court order issued under Section 4(d); and
162 (5) if requested by the custodian:

167 custodian, identifiable by the information specified in subparagraph (A).

170 otherwise, a custodian shall disclose to the personal representative of the estate of a deceased
