4 (a) As used in this section, the following words shall have the following meanings:

12 persons acting on behalf of a law enforcement officers, in relation to an investigation, under
13 circumstances where a reasonable juvenile would consider themselves to be in custody, and that
14 questioning is likely to elicit an incriminating response.
15 (b) A statement made by a juvenile during a custodial interrogation shall be presumed to
16 be involuntary, and therefore inadmissible in any court where such statement is offered as
17 evidence, if during the custodial interrogation a law enforcement officer, or person acting on
18 behalf of a law enforcement officer, knowingly engages in deception.
19 A statement that is involuntary, as described in the above paragraph, shall not form the
20 basis of any further investigative activities; any evidence that flows from that statement shall be

22 (c) The presumption that such statement, as described in subsection (b), is inadmissible,
23 may be overcome if the Commonwealth proves, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the statement
24 was voluntary and not made due to any deception. A failure to create and save an audiovisual

40 iv. “Place of Detention” means a vehicle or fixed location under the control of law
41 enforcement, including a police or sheriff’s station, holding cell, jail, correctional or detention
42 facility, or any other place where a juvenile is held in order to conduct a custodial interrogation.
43 v. “Recording” means an authentic, accurate, and unaltered audiovisual record, created
44 by an electronic or digital device, that captures the entirety of what transpired during a custodial
45 interrogation, including all parties involved in the custodial interrogation, and a fair and accurate

47 enforcement, or their representative(s), begins speaking with, or otherwise interacting with, a
48 juvenile in said space, including any recitation of the juvenile’s constitutional rights, and ending
49 when law enforcement, or their representative(s), stops speaking to, or otherwise interacting

55 evidence is offered as evidence.
56 (c) The presumption that such a statement or evidence, as described in subsection (b), is
57 inadmissible, may be overcome if the Commonwealth proves, by clear and convincing evidence,
58 that creating and saving a recording was not reasonably possible under the circumstances.
59 (d) Lack of economic resources relative to the implementation of recording shall not be
60 considered grounds to conclude that recording was not reasonably possible under subsection (c).
61 (e) If the Commonwealth seeks to offer as evidence a statement, or evidence derived
62 there from, made during a custodial interrogation outside of a place of detention, as defined in
63 subsection (a), for which there is no recording, as defined by subsection (a), then the
64 Commonwealth must prove, by clear and convincing evidence, that conducting the custodial
65 interrogation in a place of detention was not reasonably possible.
66 (f) Subsection (b) and (e) shall apply to all statements, as described in subsection (b) and
67 (e), made on or after the effective date of this statute.
