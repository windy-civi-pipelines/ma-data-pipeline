Resolutions Providing for the Ratification of the Child Labor Amendment to the Constitution of
the United States of America.
1 WHEREAS, in 1924, the Sixty-eighth Congress of the United States of America, at its
2 first session, passed House Joint Resolution 184 in both houses, by a constitutional majority of
3 two-thirds of each house, that the following article should be proposed as an amendment to the
4 Constitution of the United States: Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the
5 United States of America in Congress assembled (two-thirds of each House concurring therein),
6 that the following article is proposed as an amendment to the Constitution of the United States,
7 which, when ratified by the legislatures of three-fourths of the several states, shall be valid to all
8 intents and purposes as a part of the Constitution:
9 "ARTICLE ____
10 Section 1. The Congress shall have power to limit, regulate and prohibit the labor of
11 persons under eighteen years of age.
12 Sec. 2. The power of the several States is unimpaired by this article except that the
13 operation of State laws shall be suspended to the extent necessary to give effect to legislation
14 enacted by the Congress."; and
1 of 2

15 WHEREAS, the proposal for the constitutional amendment is still outstanding since
16 Congress did not set a time limit for ratification, and ratification by ten more states is required to
17 add the amendment proposed by House Joint Resolution 184 to the United States Constitution;
18 and
19 WHEREAS, in February of 1925, the voters of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts
20 rejected ratification of House Joint Resolution 184 via ballot measure; and
21 WHEREAS, the current General Court desires to correct the mistake of its rejection 100
22 years ago; and
23 WHEREAS, Regulating the labor of persons under the age of 18 years is necessary to
24 protect their health, welfare, and ability to obtain a quality education;
25 THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, BY THE GENERAL COURT OF THE
26 COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS, that said proposed amendment to the
27 Constitution of the United States is hereby ratified; BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the
28 Secretary of the Commonwealth forward certified copies of this resolution to the Archivist of the
29 United States, President of the United States, the President, President Pro Tempore and clerk of
30 the United States Senate, the Speaker and clerk of the United States House of Representatives,
31 each member of the Massachusetts congressional delegation and the clerks and presiding officers
32 of each house of the legislatures in states that have not yet ratified this amendment on the date of
33 adoption of this resolution by the General Court.
