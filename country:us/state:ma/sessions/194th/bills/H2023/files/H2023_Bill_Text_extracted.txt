_______________
An Act restoring judicial discretion in controlled substance cases.
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives in General Court assembled, and by the authority
of the same, as follows:
1 1. Whereas, the deferred operation of this act would tend to defeat its purpose, which is to
2 forthwith make certain changes in laws relative to the administration of justice in the
3 Commonwealth, to permit fair sentencing of non-violent drug offenders, to reduce the rate of
4 incarceration in the Commonwealth occasioned, in large part, by minimum mandatory drug laws,
5 to prevent the application of equally severe penalties for both the more and the less culpable
6 offenders, and to eliminate the disproportionate impact minimum mandatory drug laws have on
7 minority communities, therefore, it is hereby declared to be an emergency law, retroactive in
8 application, as necessary for the immediate preservation of the public convenience.
