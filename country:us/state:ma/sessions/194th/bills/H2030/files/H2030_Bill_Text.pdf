11 amended by inserting after the second paragraph the following paragraph:-
12 At all times, at least 3 members of the parole board shall have at least 5 years of
13 experience in the fields of psychiatry, psychology, social work or the treatment of substance use
14 disorders. One of those 3 members shall be a licensed mental health professional, as defined in
15 section 1 of chapter 123. At all times, 1 of the 9 members of the board shall be someone who has
16 been incarcerated and successfully completed the parole process; a minimum of 3 years shall
17 have passed since the individual completed the parole process and they shall have a professional
18 or volunteer background in at least 1 of the following areas: psychology, mental health or
19 substance use, transitional housing, re-entry after incarceration, public safety or law. If the

28 serve a legitimate public safety goal based on current criminal recidivism and
29 rehabilitation research with clear and convincing evidence.
