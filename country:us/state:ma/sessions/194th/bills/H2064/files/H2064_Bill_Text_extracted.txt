1 SECTION 1. Chapter 149 of the General Laws is hereby amended by inserting after
2 section 52E the following section:-
3 Section 52F. (a) For the purposes of this section, the following words shall, unless the
4 context clearly requires otherwise, have the following meanings:
5 “Bereavement leave”, leave from employment taken to grieve, make arrangements or
6 attend services necessitated by the death of a child.
7 “Child”, a biological, adopted or foster child or stepchild who is less than 18 years of age.
8 “Employee”, an individual hired by an employer for lawful employment, on either a part-
9 time or full-time basis.
10 “Employer”, as defined in section 1 of chapter 151A.
1 of 3
11 (b) An employer shall permit an employee to take up to 10 days of bereavement leave,
12 used consecutively or non-consecutively, within 12 months following the death of an employee’s
13 child.
14 (c) Leave taken pursuant to this section shall be paid by the employer at the employee’s
15 regular rate of pay, and the employee’s regular employment benefits shall continue to accrue
16 during this period. For part-time workers, the employer shall calculate the average hours worked
17 per day by the employee during the preceding 12 months to determine the employee’s
18 compensation for their bereavement leave.
19 (d) (1) An employee seeking leave from work under this section shall, if possible, provide
20 appropriate advance notice of the leave to the employer as required by the employer's leave
21 policy; provided, that if an unscheduled absence occurs, an employer shall not take any negative
22 action against the employee if the employee, within 30 days from the unauthorized absence or
23 within 30 days from the last unauthorized absence in the instance of consecutive days of
24 unauthorized absences, provides documentation that the absence was the result of the death of
25 the employee’s child.
26 (2) An employer may require documentation from an employee taking bereavement leave

31 documentation designated by the employer as acceptable.

32 (e) Nothing in this section shall limit an employer’s bereavement leave policy to a
33 maximum of 10 days. Nothing in this section shall be construed as to affect any bargaining
34 agreement, company policy, law or regulation that provides for rights to bereavement leave
35 greater than those provided by this section.
36 (f) Employers shall notify each employee of the rights and responsibilities provided for
37 by this section.
38 (g) The attorney general shall enforce this section and may seek injunctive relief or other
