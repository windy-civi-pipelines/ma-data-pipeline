24 (b) Each contractor or subcontractor to a utility company shall pay not less than the
25 prevailing rate of wages and benefits in the same trade occupation in the locality within the state
26 where such covered excavation project is situated to each laborer, worker or mechanic in the
27 employ of the contractor or subcontractor to a utility company performing work on the project.
28 No permit shall be issued for a covered excavation project until an agreement confirming the
