[SIMILAR MATTER FILED IN PREVIOUS SESSION
SEE HOUSE, NO. 1943 OF 2023-2024.]
The Commonwealth of Massachusetts
_______________
In the One Hundred and Ninety-Fourth General Court
(2025-2026)
_______________
An Act relative to compliance with the prevailing wage laws of the Commonwealth.
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives in General Court assembled, and by the authority
of the same, as follows:
1 SECTION 1. Section 27D of chapter 149 of the General Laws is hereby amended by
2 inserting at the end thereof the following new paragraphs:-
3 For the purposes of this section, the words “construction” and “constructed” shall include
4 offsite fabrication work for any project covered by this section. In such cases, the wage required
5 under this chapter shall be paid for such work and the requirements of Section 27B of chapter
6 149 shall apply to such work, including, but not limited to, weekly submission of certified
7 payroll records and an accompanying statement made under penalties of perjury. Penalties
8 provided under Section 27C of chapter 149 shall apply to such work.
1 of 2

9 The term “offsite fabrication” means products or items that are: (a) produced specifically
10 for a qualified project; (b) considered to be non-standard items; and (c) produced at an offsite
11 location, including, but not limited to those made or consisting of fabricated pipe, piping
12 materials or fixtures, electrical wiring, sheet metal materials, or any systems, components or
13 modular units made of any of the foregoing. Nothing in the foregoing definition of “offsite
14 fabrication” is intended to restrict application of Section 26 of chapter 149 of the General Laws
15 or to prevent the Commonwealth, or a county, town, authority or district thereof contracting for
16 the construction of public works from giving preference to offsite fabrication performed at an
17 offsite location within a specific geographical area.
18 SECTION 2. Section 27B of chapter 149 of the General Laws is hereby amended by
19 inserting at the end thereof the following new paragraph:
20 For any offsite fabrication work subject to this section, the contractor, subcontractor or
21 public body shall include a section in their weekly certified prevailing wage records that
22 provides: (a) the name and address of the manufacturer, shop or other type of prefabrication
23 facility where the fabrication work was performed; and (b) the name, address, and occupational
24 classifications of each mechanic, apprentice, laborer or other employee employed in the
25 performance of such work, the hours worked by, and wages paid to, each such employee.
26 SECTION 3. This act shall take effect upon its passage.
