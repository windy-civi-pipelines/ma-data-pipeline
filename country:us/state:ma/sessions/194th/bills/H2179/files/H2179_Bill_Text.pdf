16 under the influence of drugs or alcohol could lead to a lapse of attention that could cause actual,
17 immediate, and permanent physical injury or loss of life to self or others.
18 Section 2. Restriction on pre-employment marijuana testing and employment conditional
19 on marijuana testing.
20 (a) An employer may only test a prospective employee for marijuana use after a
21 conditional offer of employment has been extended, unless otherwise required by law. Further,
22 no employer or agent of an employer may directly or indirectly solicit or require an employee or
23 prospective employee to submit to testing for the presence of marijuana in his or her system as a
24 condition of employment
25 (b) Nothing in this act shall be construed to:

28 (2) Require an employer to permit or accommodate the use, consumption, possession,
29 transfer, display, transportation, sale, or growing of marijuana in the workplace or at any time
30 during employment; or
31 (3) Interfere with federal employment contracts
32 (b) Subsection (a) of this section shall not apply to safety sensitive positions or if
33 compliance would cause the public employer to commit a violation of a federal law, regulation,

35 Section 3. Patient protections.
36 "(a)(1) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, except as provided in subsection (b)
37 of this section, an employer may not refuse to hire, terminate from employment, penalize, fail to

39 individual's status as a qualifying patient unless the individual used, possessed, or was impaired
40 by marijuana at the individual's place of employment or during the hours of employment.
41 "(2) A qualifying patient's failure to pass an employer-administered drug test for
42 marijuana components or metabolites may not be used as a basis for employment-related
43 decisions unless reasonable suspicion exists that the qualified patient was impaired by marijuana
44 at the qualifying patient's place of employment or during the hours of employment.
45 "(b) Subsection (a) of this section shall not apply to safety sensitive positions or if
46 compliance would cause the public employer to commit a violation of a federal law, regulation,
47 contract, or funding agreement."
