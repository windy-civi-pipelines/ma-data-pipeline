13 (b) There shall be established and set up on the books of the commonwealth a
14 fund to address diaper insufficiency that shall be administered by the commissioner. The fund
15 shall be credited with: (i) revenue from appropriations or other money authorized by the general
16 court and specifically designated to the fund; (ii) interest earned on such revenues; and (iii) funds
17 from public and private sources such as gifts, grants and donations to further the pilot program.
18 Amounts credited to the fund shall not be subject to further appropriation and any money
19 remaining in the fund at the end of the fiscal year shall not revert to the General Fund.
20 (c) The department shall distribute resources from the fund by issuing a request
21 for proposal through which an organization or organizations may apply. Funds received shall be
22 used for one or more of the following purposes: (i) acquiring diapers, (ii) storing diapers, (iii)

31 Amounts received from private sources shall be approved by the commissioner of

33 funds are not accompanied by conditions, explicit or implicit, on distributing diapers.
34 (d) Not later than one year after the implementation of each pilot program said
35 department shall provide a report to the joint committee on children, families and persons with
36 disabilities and to the house and senate committees on ways and means. The report shall include,
