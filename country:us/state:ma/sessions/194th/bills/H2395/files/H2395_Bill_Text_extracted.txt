194 found, the provisions of law relied upon, and the period prescribed for correction, which shall be
195 reasonable and, except in an emergency declared by the commissioner, not less than 30 days
196 after receipt of such order. Within 10 days of receipt, the affected licensee may file a written
197 request with the department for administrative reconsideration of the order or any portion
198 thereof. Failure by the department to grant, deny, or otherwise act upon a written request within
199 10 days after filing shall be deemed a denial.
200 SECTION 10. Said chapter 111D is hereby further amended by striking out section 10, as

202 Section 10. Whenever the department finds upon inspection, or through information in its

206 reports of examinations. Every license modification order shall include a statement of the reasons

210 Except in the case of a license modification imposed as a sanction after hearing under

212 provisions of chapter 30A. If after hearing the licensee establishes that the order, or any portion
213 thereof, is not warranted, the department shall rescind or qualify such order, as appropriate. The
214 filing of a request for a hearing shall not operate as a stay of the compliance date of a license
215 modification order, but the department shall stay the compliance date upon written request,
216 except to the extent that a stay would jeopardize the public health or public safety.
217 SECTION 11. Said chapter 111D is hereby further amended by striking out section 11, as
218 appearing in the 2022 Official Edition, and inserting in place thereof the following section:-

220 impose other appropriate administrative sanction upon a license, or both, for conduct by or
221 chargeable to the licensee as follows:
222 (1) failure to observe any term of such license;

230 charges against such licensee, the provisions of law relied upon, and the proposed sanction, and
231 shall afford the licensee the opportunity for a hearing under the provisions of chapter 30A.
232 Where, after hearing, the department finds that cause exists for imposition of a sanction, it need
233 not impose the sanction proposed but may instead impose a lesser sanction if, in its judgment, a
234 lesser sanction is appropriate in the circumstances. In the event revocation is imposed, the
235 licensee shall be permitted a reasonable period in which to cease operation, but in no case less
236 than 30 days after notice of the decision of the department.
237 Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the commissioner may, at any time
238 upon notice to the licensee, whether a hearing has been first commenced or not, suspend such
239 licensee’s license or issue such other preliminary order as the commissioner considers
240 appropriate for the protection of the health or safety of the public if the commissioner should find
241 that either is in jeopardy; provided, that a hearing shall be commenced within 5 days after such
242 notice in any case of suspension without a prior hearing unless the licensee shall request a
243 postponement. The finding of the commissioner shall be included in such notice.
244 SECTION 12. Said chapter 111D is hereby further amended by striking out section 14, as
245 appearing in the 2022 Official Edition, and inserting in place thereof the following section:-
246 Section 14. All clinical laboratories shall disclose ownership interests in writing to the
247 Attorney General’s office upon initial licensure and thereafter every 2 years. The disclosure shall
248 contain the name and ownership interest of the disclosing person or company, as well as the
249 names and ownership interests of all other parties with an ownership interest in the clinical
250 laboratory.

194 found, the provisions of law relied upon, and the period prescribed for correction, which shall be
195 reasonable and, except in an emergency declared by the commissioner, not less than 30 days
196 after receipt of such order. Within 10 days of receipt, the affected licensee may file a written
197 request with the department for administrative reconsideration of the order or any portion
198 thereof. Failure by the department to grant, deny, or otherwise act upon a written request within
199 10 days after filing shall be deemed a denial.
200 SECTION 10. Said chapter 111D is hereby further amended by striking out section 10, as
201 appearing in the 2020 Official Edition, and inserting in place thereof the following section:-
202 Section 10. Whenever the department finds upon inspection, or through information in its

204 providing reliable reports of examinations pursuant to the terms of such license, it may by order
205 modify any term of such license as it deems necessary to enable the laboratory to provide reliable
206 reports of examinations. Every license modification order shall include a statement of the reasons

208 shall be reasonable and, except in an emergency declared by the commissioner, not less than 30
209 days after receipt of such order.
210 Except in the case of a license modification imposed as a sanction after hearing under
211 section 11, a licensee in receipt of an order shall have the opportunity for a hearing under the
212 provisions of chapter 30A. If after hearing the licensee establishes that the order, or any portion
213 thereof, is not warranted, the department shall rescind or qualify such order, as appropriate. The
214 filing of a request for a hearing shall not operate as a stay of the compliance date of a license
215 modification order, but the department shall stay the compliance date upon written request,
216 except to the extent that a stay would jeopardize the public health or public safety.
217 SECTION 11. Said chapter 111D is hereby further amended by striking out section 11, as

230 charges against such licensee, the provisions of law relied upon, and the proposed sanction, and
231 shall afford the licensee the opportunity for a hearing under the provisions of chapter 30A.
232 Where, after hearing, the department finds that cause exists for imposition of a sanction, it need
233 not impose the sanction proposed but may instead impose a lesser sanction if, in its judgment, a
234 lesser sanction is appropriate in the circumstances. In the event revocation is imposed, the
235 licensee shall be permitted a reasonable period in which to cease operation, but in no case less
236 than 30 days after notice of the decision of the department.
237 Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the commissioner may, at any time
238 upon notice to the licensee, whether a hearing has been first commenced or not, suspend such
239 licensee’s license or issue such other preliminary order as the commissioner considers
240 appropriate for the protection of the health or safety of the public if the commissioner should find
241 that either is in jeopardy; provided, that a hearing shall be commenced within 5 days after such
242 notice in any case of suspension without a prior hearing unless the licensee shall request a
243 postponement. The finding of the commissioner shall be included in such notice.
244 SECTION 12. Said chapter 111D is hereby further amended by striking out section 14, as
245 appearing in the 2022 Official Edition, and inserting in place thereof the following section:-
246 Section 14. All clinical laboratories shall disclose ownership interests in writing to the
247 Attorney General’s office upon initial licensure and thereafter every 2 years. The disclosure shall
248 contain the name and ownership interest of the disclosing person or company, as well as the
249 names and ownership interests of all other parties with an ownership interest in the clinical
250 laboratory.
