(2025-2026)
_______________
An Act to protect Massachusetts public health from PFAS.
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives in General Court assembled, and by the authority
of the same, as follows:
1 SECTION 1. Chapter 10 of the General Laws is hereby amended by inserting after
2 section 35SSS the following section:-

12 Commonwealth having the usual powers and duties of the board of health of a city or town.
13 “Commissioner”, the commissioner of the department of environmental protection
14 “Department”, the department of environmental protection
15 “Fund”, the PFAS Remediation Trust Fund established in this section.
16 “Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances” or “PFAS”, as defined and regulated by the
17 department or identified, on the basis of a health assessment conducted pursuant to the
18 department’s drinking water regulations, as posing an unacceptable health risk to consumers.
19 “Regional system”, any system established by mutual agreement of two or more
20 municipalities or a county in which all municipalities of said county have an agreement where
21 such system provides drinking water or wastewater services, or both, through shared facilities,
22 sources or distribution networks.
23 (b) (1) There shall be a PFAS Remediation Trust Fund. Expenditures from the
24 fund shall be made by the department, without further appropriation and consistent with this
25 section, the terms of settlements, judgments, and awards made in connection with claims arising
26 from the manufacture, marketing or sale of PFAS and PFAS-containing products, and consistent
27 with the terms of other allocations and monies transferred to this fund, as applicable. The
28 commissioner shall administer the fund, shall prioritize expenditures to communities with
29 vulnerable environmental justice populations, and may make expenditures from the fund to
2 of 30

30 develop and implement a multilingual outreach and education program pursuant to section 29 of
31 chapter 21A of the General Laws.
32 (2) The fund shall be expended to mitigate the impacts of PFAS contamination in the
33 commonwealth, including PFAS contamination in drinking water, groundwater, soil, sediment,
34 surface water, wastewater, sludge or sludge products, landfills, and other media as appropriate.
35 Such mitigation may include, but is not limited to, projects to assist counties municipalities,
36 private well owners, and public water systems with the cost of PFAS treatment and remediation,
37 including but not limited to remediation projects, treatment, and mitigation. The commissioner
38 shall make necessary expenditures from this account for the shared administrative costs of the
39 operations and programs of the department related to the fund. The commissioner shall further
40 direct that monies from the fund shall be expended to provide services in an amount reasonably
41 related to such administrative costs. No expenditure shall be made from the fund that would

47 Laws.
48 (3) There shall be credited to the fund: (i) amounts recovered by the commonwealth and
49 credited thereto in connection with claims arising from the manufacture and associated
50 processes, distribution, marketing, or sale of PFAS and other PFAS-containing products; (ii)
51 transfers from other funds authorized by the general court and so designated; (iii) funds from
52 public or private sources, including, but not limited to, gifts, grants, donations, rebates,

58 municipal and county use, including, but not limited to, establishing connections to regional
59 systems and funds necessary to address the reasonable administrative costs of the municipality;
60 (ii) boards of health for use in assisting private well users; (iii) community water systems for use
61 on an existing system or to expand a system to assist additional water users; (iv) non-transient
62 non-community water systems; and (v) transient non-community water systems.
63 (d) The department shall adopt regulations, rules, or policies for the use of monies in the
64 fund, and shall include conditions in grant documents to require that that applicants disclose any
65 funds recovered from liable third parties or other sources to cover any costs eligible to be
66 reimbursed by said grant programs and to deduct said recovered funds from the total costs in the
67 grant application. The department shall also require any person awarded a grant for cost
68 reimbursement to report the recovery of any such costs in the future and to reimburse the fund by
69 reimbursing such recovered costs to the department. The department shall further adopt
70 regulations, rules, or policies establishing criteria to ensure that an applicant shall not be eligible
71 for grants for any project or portion of a project to the extent the negligence of the applicant
72 caused the contamination that resulted in the exceedance of applicable state or federal standards
73 for PFAS in drinking water, groundwater, soil, and other environmental media.

74 (e) If the department provides a grant related to costs for a project for which a third party
75 might otherwise be liable, the right to recover payment from such third party, excluding public
76 sector fire departments for the use of Class B firefighting foam in emergency responses, shall be
77 subrogated to the department to the extent of such grant. Any money recovered by the
78 department from such third parties shall be deposited in the fund. Notwithstanding any other
79 general or special law to the contrary, the superior court shall have jurisdiction for subrogation
80 claims brought pursuant to this chapter, and civil actions brought by the attorney general for
81 subrogated claims to recover costs pursuant to this chapter shall be commenced within five years
82 from the date the commonwealth is assigned the rights to recover all such costs or five years
83 from the date the commonwealth discovers that the person against whom the action is being
84 brought is a person liable pursuant to law, whichever is later.
85 (f)(1) The department may consult with the department of public health to provide
86 funding from the fund for boards of health to establish rebate and grant programs for the
87 reimbursement of private well users and owners for the costs of private well water sampling,
88 installation, and operation and maintenance of PFAS treatment systems. Eligible spending for
89 rebate shall include, but is not limited to, sampling of private well water for those PFAS that are
90 regulated for public water systems by the department’s drinking water regulations and
91 installation of permanent treatment systems to remove PFAS from drinking water
92 (2) Boards of health may elect to receive funding from the fund pursuant to any program
93 established pursuant to paragraph (1), and may apply for and receive grants from the fund
94 necessary to cover reasonable administrative costs related to implementation of said paragraph
95 (1). Boards of health that elect to participate shall amend their codes to require private well water
