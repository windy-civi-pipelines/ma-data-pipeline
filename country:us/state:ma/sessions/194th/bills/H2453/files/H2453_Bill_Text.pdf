In the One Hundred and Ninety-Fourth General Court
(2025-2026)

An Act exempting barber shops from certain system sewage flow design criteria.
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives in General Court assembled, and by the authority
of the same, as follows:
1 Section 13 of Chapter 21A of the General Laws, as appearing in the 2022 Official
2 Edition, is hereby amended by adding after the first paragraph, the following paragraph:-
3 The department shall not classify barber shops and beauty salons together so as to require
4 the same system sewage flow design criteria for on-site subsurface sewage disposal. Until such
5 time as the department classifies barber shops and beauty salons as two distinct types of
6 commercial uses, businesses that operate exclusively as barber shops pursuant to Section 87T of
7 Chapter 112, shall be exempt from any rule related to the system sewage flow design criteria for
8 beauty salons; provided further, that any qualified barber shop as described herein shall apply to
9 the department for a unique determination of system sewage design flow.
