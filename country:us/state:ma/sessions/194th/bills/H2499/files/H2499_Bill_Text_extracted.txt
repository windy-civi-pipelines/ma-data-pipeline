_______________
An Act pertaining to women’s health at midlife and public, medical and workplace awareness of
the transitional stage of menopause and related chronic conditions.
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives in General Court assembled, and by the authority
of the same, as follows:
1 SECTION 1. The General Court hereby declares and finds that:
2 (i) by 2030, the world population of menopausal and postmenopausal women is
3 projected to increase to 1.2 billion, with 27 million new entrants each year;
4 (ii) each year, women in the United States enter the menopausal transition with little
5 clinical guidance on what to expect during and after this transition;
6 (iii) according to the United States Department of Health and Human Services, at least 3
7 out of 4 women experience hot flashes, the most common menopause symptom, and other
8 symptoms including memory loss, urinary problems, sleep disturbances, depression and anxiety;
9 (iv) menopausal symptoms can be severe and affect daily activities and quality of life
10 for an extended period, with hot flashes lasting an average of 7 to 9 years, and a third of women
11 experiencing vasomotor symptoms for a decade or longer;
1 of 5
12 (v) studies show that Black and Hispanic women may experience menopause earlier,
13 with more intense menopausal symptoms, and for a longer period of time;
14 (vi) as many as 40 per cent of menopausal women say their symptoms interfered with
15 their work performance or productivity weekly, and nearly 1 in 5 say they have left or considered
16 leaving the workforce because of their symptoms;
17 (vii) many women are unsure what accommodations their employers offer for
18 menopause and are unsure about workplace culture regarding menopause;
19 (viii) menopause symptoms cost American women an estimated $1.8 billion in lost
20 working time per year;
21 (ix) due to medical innovation, a variety of effective treatments for symptoms are
22 available to help address symptoms during perimenopause and menopause, including, but not
23 limited to, hormone therapy and nonhormone medication;
24 (x) according to the United States Department of Health and Human Services,
25 menopause may increase the risk of osteoporosis, heart disease and stroke;
26 (xi) there is a need for additional clinical research and treatment options to manage
27 menopause symptoms;
28 (xii) many physicians, including obstetricians and gynecologists, have limited time to
29 assess menopause symptoms during visits with patients; and
30 (xiii) many physicians have limited training on menopause, and only approximately 30
31 per cent of obstetrician and gynecology residency program directors report that menopause
32 curriculum is part of resident training.

33 SECTION 2. For the purposes of this act, the following terms shall, unless the context
