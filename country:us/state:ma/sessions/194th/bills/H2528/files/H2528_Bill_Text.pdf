7 is hereby authorized to execute a compact in substantially the following form with any one or
8 more of the states of the United States and the General Assembly hereby signifies in advance its
9 approval and ratification of the compact.
1 of 39

10 Section 3. Whereas, states license psychologists, in order to protect the public through
11 verification of education, training and experience and ensure accountability for professional
12 practice; and
13 Whereas, this compact is intended to regulate the day-to-day practice of telepsychology
14 by psychologists across state boundaries in the performance of their psychological practice as
15 assigned by an appropriate authority; and
16 Whereas, this compact is intended to regulate the temporary in-person, face-to-face
17 practice of psychology by psychologists across state boundaries for 30 days within a calendar
18 year in the performance of their psychological practice as assigned by an appropriate authority;
19 Whereas, this compact is intended to authorize state psychology regulatory authorities to
20 afford legal recognition, in a manner consistent with the terms of the compact, to psychologists
21 licensed in another state;
22 Whereas, this compact recognizes that states have a vested interest in protecting the
23 public's health and safety through their licensing and regulation of psychologists and that such
24 state regulation will best protect public health and safety;
25 Whereas, this compact does not apply when a psychologist is licensed in both the home
26 state and receiving states; and
27 Whereas, this compact does not apply to permanent in-person, face-to-face practice, it
28 does allow for authorization of temporary psychological practice.
29 Consistent with these principles, this compact is designed to achieve the following
30 purposes and objectives:
2 of 39

31 (a) Increase public access to professional psychological services by allowing for
32 telepsychological practice across state lines as well as temporary in-person, face-to-face services
33 into a state which the psychologist is not licensed to practice psychology;
34 (b) Enhance the states' ability to protect the public's health and safety, especially
35 client/patient safety;
36 (c) Encourage the cooperation of compact states in the areas of psychology licensure and

38 (d) Facilitate the exchange of information between compact states regarding psychologist
39 licensure, adverse actions and disciplinary history;

319 commission.
320 (d) A home state’s psychology regulatory authority shall investigate and take appropriate
321 action with respect to reported inappropriate conduct engaged in by a licensee which occurred in
322 a receiving state as it would if such conduct had occurred by a licensee within the home state. In
323 such cases, the home state’s law shall control in determining any adverse action against a
324 psychologist’s license.
325 (e) A distant state’s psychology regulatory authority shall investigate and take
326 appropriate action with respect to reported inappropriate conduct engaged in by a psychologist

330 authorization to practice.
331 (f) Nothing in this compact shall override a compact state’s decision that a psychologist’s
332 participation in an alternative program may be used in lieu of adverse action and that such
333 participation shall remain non-public if required by the compact state’s law. Compact states must
334 require psychologists who enter any alternative programs to not provide telepsychology services

346 production of evidence from another compact state shall be enforced in the latter state by any
347 court of competent jurisdiction, according to that court’s practice and procedure in considering
348 subpoenas issued in its own proceedings. The issuing state psychology regulatory authority shall
349 pay any witness fees, travel expenses, mileage and other fees required by the service statutes of
350 the state where the witnesses or evidence are located; and
351 (2) Issue cease and desist or injunctive relief orders to revoke a psychologist's authority
352 to practice interjurisdictional telepsychology or temporary authorization to practice.
353 (3) During the course of any investigation, a psychologist may not change his or her
354 home state licensure. A home state psychology regulatory authority is authorized to complete
355 any pending investigations of a psychologist and to take any actions appropriate under its law.
356 The home state psychology regulatory authority shall promptly report the conclusions of such
357 investigations to the commission. Once an investigation has been completed, and pending the
358 outcome of said investigation, the psychologist may change his or her home state licensure. The
359 commission shall promptly notify the new home state of any such decisions as provided in the
360 rules of the commission. All information provided to the commission or distributed by compact
361 states pursuant to the psychologist shall be confidential, filed under seal and used for
18 of 39

362 investigatory or disciplinary matters. The commission may create additional rules for mandated
363 or discretionary sharing of information by compact states.

366 licensure information system and reporting system containing licensure and disciplinary action
367 information on all psychologists individuals to whom this compact is applicable in all compact

373 (2) Licensure data;
374 (3) Significant investigatory information;

384 adverse action taken against, or significant investigative information on, any licensee in a
385 compact state.
386 (d) Compact states reporting information to the coordinated database may designate
387 information that may not be shared with the public without the express permission of the
388 compact state reporting the information.
389 (e) Any information submitted to the coordinated database that is subsequently required
390 to be expunged by the law of the compact state reporting the information shall be removed from
391 the coordinated database.
392 Section 12.

684 means of securing compliance have been exhausted. Notice of intent to suspend or terminate
