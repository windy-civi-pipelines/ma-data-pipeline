An Act establishing a Naloxone Purchase Trust fund.
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives in General Court assembled, and by the authority
of the same, as follows:
1 SECTION X. Chapter 111 of the General Laws is hereby amended by inserting the
2 following section:-
3 Section XX.
4 (a) As used in this section the following words shall, unless the context clearly requires
5 otherwise, have the following meanings:-
6 “Estimated cost'', a projection of funds needed during a fiscal year for the purchase,
7 storage and distribution of opioid antagonists.
8 ''Opioid antagonist'', naloxone or any other drug approved by the federal Food and Drug
9 Administration as a competitive narcotic antagonist used in the reversal of overdoses caused by
10 opioids.
1 of 3

11 “Opioid antagonist distribution”, the distribution of opioid antagonists to healthcare
12 facilities including but not limited to:
13 (i) acute care hospitals;
14 (ii) emergency departments;
15 (iii) substance use disorder treatment facilities; and
16 (iv) community health centers;
17 provided that, opioid antagonists shall be offered to a patient who has (i) a history of
18 using opioids; (ii) been diagnosed with opioid use disorder; or (iii) experienced an opioid-related
19 overdose.
20 “Substance use disorder treatment facilities”, a facility licensed or approved by the
21 department or the department of mental health to offer treatment for substance use disorder,
22 including, but not limited to: (i) withdrawal management services; (ii) clinical stabilization
23 services; (iii) transitional support services; (iv) residential support services; (v) community
24 behavioral health center services; (vi) office-based opioid or addiction treatment services; or (vii)
25 inpatient or outpatient substance use disorder services.
26 (b) There shall be established in the commonwealth a separate trust fund to be known as
27 the Naloxone Purchase Trust Fund to support a universal purchase system for opioid antagonist
28 distribution in the commonwealth. The fund shall be expended to cover the costs of opioid
29 antagonist distribution. The fund shall consist of all monies transferred from the executive office
30 of health and human services pursuant to section 66 of chapter 118E, all money received as
31 voluntary contributions to the fund, including but not limited to contributions from third party
2 of 3

32 payers or third party administrators, as defined in section 1 of chapter 12C and any interest
33 earnings on such monies. The fund shall be maintained by the commissioner of the department or
34 a designee. The monies shall be expended under the direction of the department, without prior
35 appropriation, solely to cover opioid antagonist distribution program costs; provided, however,
36 that the amount to be expended for storing and distributing opioid antagonists, if such costs are
37 not covered by federal contribution, shall not exceed 10 per cent of the total amount of the fund
38 expended for the purchase of naloxone needed for opioid agonist distribution in the
39 commonwealth. The department may incur expenses and the comptroller may certify for
40 payment amounts in anticipation of the most recent estimate of expected receipts, as certified by
41 the secretary of administration and finance; provided, however, that no expenditure shall be
42 made from the fund which shall cause the fund to be in deficit at the close of a fiscal year. Any
43 balance in the fund at the close of a fiscal year shall be available for expenditure in subsequent
44 fiscal years and shall not be transferred to any other fund or revert to the General Fund. The
45 commissioner of the department or a designee shall annually report the amount of funds
46 collected and any expenditures made from the fund to the clerks of the house of representatives
47 and senate to be forwarded on to the house and senate committees on ways and means, the house
48 and senate chairs of the joint committee on public health and the house and senate chairs of the
49 joint committee on health care financing.
50 (c) The department may adopt rules and regulations as necessary to implement the
51 universal purchase and distribution system under this chapter and other applicable state and
52 federal laws.
