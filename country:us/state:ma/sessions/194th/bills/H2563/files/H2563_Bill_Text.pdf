In the One Hundred and Ninety-Fourth General Court

_______________
An Act establishing the dentist and dental hygienist compact.
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives in General Court assembled, and by the authority
of the same, as follows:
1 The General Laws are hereby amended by inserting after chapter 112A the following
2 chapter:-
3 Chapter 112B. Dentist and Dental Hygienist Compact
4 Section 1. This chapter shall be known and cited as the Dentist and Dental Hygienist
5 Compact. The purposes of this compact are to facilitate the interstate practice of dentistry and
6 dental hygiene and improve public access to dentistry and dental hygiene services by providing
7 dentists and dental hygienists licensed in a participating state the ability to practice in
8 participating states in which they are not licensed. The compact does this by establishing a
9 pathway for dentists and dental hygienists licensed in a participating state to obtain a compact
10 privilege that authorizes them to practice in another participating state in which they are not
11 licensed. The compact enables participating states to protect the public health and safety with
1 of 36

12 respect to the practice of such dentists and dental hygienists, through the state’s authority to
13 regulate the practice of dentistry and dental hygiene in the state. The compact:
14 (i) enables dentists and dental hygienists who qualify for a compact privilege to practice
15 in other participating states without satisfying burdensome and duplicative requirements
16 associated with securing a license to practice in those states;
17 (ii) promotes mobility and addresses workforce shortages through each participating
18 state’s acceptance of a compact privilege to practice in that state;
19 (iii) increases public access to qualified, licensed dentists and dental hygienists by
20 creating a responsible, streamlined pathway for licensees to practice in participating states.
21 (iv) enhances the ability of participating states to protect the public’s health and safety;
22 (v) does not interfere with licensure requirements established by a participating state;
23 (vi) facilitates the sharing of licensure and disciplinary information among participating
24 states;
25 (vii) requires dentists and dental hygienists who practice in a participating state pursuant
26 to a compact privilege to practice within the scope of practice authorized in that state;
27 (viii) extends the authority of a participating state to regulate the practice of dentistry and
28 dental hygiene within its borders to dentists and dental hygienists who practice in the state
29 through a compact privilege;
30 (ix) promotes the cooperation of participating state in regulating the practice of dentistry
31 and dental hygiene within those states;
2 of 36

32 (x) facilitates the relocation of military members and their spouses who are licensed to
33 practice dentistry or dental hygiene;

184 compact privilege in the remote state. If those requirements are met, the compact privilege will
185 continue as long as the licensee maintains a qualifying license in the state through which the
186 licensee applied for the compact privilege and pays any applicable compact privilege renewal
187 fees.
188 (c) A licensee providing dentistry or dental hygiene in a remote state under the compact
189 privilege shall function within the scope of practice authorized by the remote state for a dentist or
190 dental hygienist licensed in that state.
191 (d) A licensee providing dentistry or dental hygiene pursuant to a compact privilege in a
192 remote state is subject to that state’s regulatory authority. A remote state may, in accordance
193 with due process and that state’s laws, by adverse action revoke or remove a licensee’s compact
10 of 36

194 privilege in the remote state for a specific period of time and impose fines or take any other
195 necessary actions to protect the health and safety of its citizens. If a remote state imposes an
196 adverse action against a compact privilege that limits the compact privilege, that adverse action
197 applies to all compact privileges in all remote states. A licensee whose compact privilege in a
198 remote state is removed for a specified period of time is not eligible for a compact privilege in
199 any other remote state until the specific time for removal of the compact privilege has passed and
200 all encumbrance requirements are satisfied.
201 (e) If a license in a participating state is an encumbered license, the licensee shall lose the
202 compact privilege in a remote state and shall not be eligible for a compact privilege in any
203 remote state until the license is no longer encumbered.
204 (f) Once an encumbered license in a participating state is restored to good standing, the
205 licensee must meet the requirements of subsection (a) to obtain a compact privilege in a remote
206 state.
207 (g) If a licensee’s compact privilege in a remote state is removed by the remote state, the
208 individual shall lose or be ineligible for the compact privilege in any remote state until the
209 following occur:
210 (1) the specific period of time for which the compact privilege was removed has ended;
211 and
212 (2) all conditions for removal of the compact privilege have been satisfied.
213 (h) Once the requirements of subsection (g) have been met, the licensee must meet the
214 requirements in subsection (a) to obtain a compact privilege in a remote state.
11 of 36

215 Section 5. An active military member and their spouse shall not be required to pay to the
216 commission for a compact privilege the fee otherwise charged by the commission. If a remote
217 state chooses to charge a fee for a compact privilege, it may choose to charge a reduced fee or no
218 fee to an active military member and their spouse for a compact privilege.
219 Section 6. (a) A participating state in which a licensee is licensed shall have exclusive
220 authority to impose adverse action against the qualifying license issued by that participating
221 state.
222 (b) A participating state may take adverse action based on the significant investigative
223 information of a remote state, so long as the participating state follows its own procedures for
224 imposing adverse action.
225 (c) Nothing in this compact shall override a participating state’s decision that
226 participation in an alternative program may be used in lieu of adverse action and that such
227 participation shall remain non-public if required by the participating state’s laws. Participating
228 states must require licensees who enter any alternative program in lieu of discipline to agree not
229 to practice pursuant to a compact privilege in any other participating state during the term of the
230 alternative program without prior authorization from such other participating state.
231 (d) Any participating state in which a licensee is applying to practice or is practicing
232 pursuant to a compact privilege may investigate actual or alleged violations of the statutes and
233 regulations authorizing the practice of dentistry or dental hygiene in any other participating state
234 in which the dentist or dental hygienist holds a license or compact privilege.
235 (e) A remote state shall have the authority to:
12 of 36

236 (1) take adverse actions under subsection (d) of section 4 against a licensee’s compact
237 privilege in the state;
238 (2) in furtherance of its rights and responsibilities under the compact and the
239 commission’s rules issue subpoenas for both hearings and investigations that require the
240 attendance and testimony of witnesses, and the production of evidence. Subpoenas issued by a
241 state licensing authority in a participating state for the attendance and testimony of witnesses, or
242 the production of evidence from another participating state, shall be enforced in the latter state by
243 any court of competent jurisdiction, according to the practice and procedure of that court
244 applicable to subpoenas issued in proceedings pending before it. The issuing authority shall pay
245 any witness fees, travel expenses, mileage, and other fees required by the service statutes of the
246 state where the witnesses or evidence are located; and
247 (3) if otherwise permitted by state law, recover from the licensee the costs of
248 investigations and disposition of cases resulting from any adverse action taken against that
249 licensee.
250 (f)(1) In addition to the authority granted to a participating state by its dentist or dental
251 hygienist licensure act or other applicable state law, a participating state may jointly investigate
252 licensees with other participating states.
253 (2) Participating states shall share any significant investigative information, litigation, or
254 compliance materials in furtherance of any joint or individual investigation initiated under the
255 compact.
13 of 36

256 (g) (1) After a licensee's compact privilege in a remote state is terminated, the remote
257 state may continue an investigation of the licensee that began when the licensee had a compact
258 privilege in that remote state.
259 (2) If the investigation yields what would be significant investigative information had the
260 licensee continued to have a compact privilege in that remote state, the remote state shall report
261 the presence of such information to the data system as required by paragraph (6) of subsection
262 (b) of section 8 as if it was significant investigative information.
263 Section 7. (a) The compact participating states hereby create and establish a joint
264 government agency whose membership consists of all participating states that have enacted the
265 compact. The commission is an instrumentality of the participating states acting jointly and not
266 an instrumentality of any one state. The commission shall come into existence on or after the
267 effective date of the compact as set forth in subsection (a) of section 11.
268 (b) (1) Each participating state shall have and be limited to 1 commissioner selected by
269 that participating state’s state licensing authority or, if the state has more than 1 state licensing
270 authority, selected collectively by the state licensing authorities.
271 (2) The commissioner shall be a member or designee of such authority or authorities.
272 (3) The commission may by rule or bylaw establish a term of office for commissioners
273 and may by rule or bylaw establish term limits.
274 (4) The commission may recommend to a state licensing authority or authorities, as
275 applicable, removal or suspension of an individual as the state’s commissioner.
14 of 36

276 (5) A participating state’s state licensing authority, or authorities, as applicable, shall fill
277 any vacancy of its commissioner on the commission within 60 days of the vacancy.
278 (6) Each commissioner shall be entitled to 1 vote on all matters that are voted upon by the
279 commission.
280 (7) The commission shall meet at least once during each calendar year. Additional
281 meetings may be held as set forth in the bylaws. The commission may meet by
282 telecommunication, video conference or other similar electronic means.
283 (c) The commission shall have the following powers:
284 (1) establish the fiscal year of the commission;
285 (2) establish a code of conduct and conflict of interest policies;
286 (3) adopt rules and bylaws;
287 (4) maintain its financial records in accordance with the bylaws;
288 (5) meet and take such actions as are consistent with the provisions of this compact, the
289 commission’s rules, and the bylaws;
290 (6) initiate and conclude legal proceedings or actions in the name of the commission;
291 provided, that the standing of any state licensing authority to sue or be sued under applicable law
292 shall not be affected;
293 (7) maintain and certify records and information provided to a participating state as the
294 authenticated business records of the commission, and designate a person to do so on the
295 commission's behalf;

305 compact privilege in a remote state and thereafter, as may be established by commission rule,
306 charge the licensee a compact privilege renewal fee for each renewal period in which that
307 licensee exercises or intends to exercise the compact privilege in that remote state. Nothing
308 herein shall be construed to prevent a remote state from charging a licensee a fee for a compact
309 privilege or renewals of a compact privilege, or a fee for the jurisprudence requirement if the
310 remote state imposes such a requirement for the grant of a compact privilege;
311
312 (13) accept any and all appropriate gifts, donations, grants of money, other sources of
313 revenue, equipment, supplies, materials, and services, and receive, utilize, and dispose of the

443 capacity, for any claim for damage to or loss of property or personal injury or other civil liability
444 caused by or arising out of any actual or alleged act, error, or omission that occurred, or that the
445 person against whom the claim is made had a reasonable basis for believing occurred within the
446 scope of commission employment, duties or responsibilities; provided that nothing in this
447 paragraph shall be construed to protect any such person from suit or liability for any damage,
448 loss, injury, or liability caused by the intentional or willful or wanton misconduct of that person.
449 The procurement of insurance of any type by the commission shall not in any way compromise
450 or limit the immunity granted hereunder.
451 (2) The commission shall defend any member, officer, executive director, employee, and
452 representative of the commission in any civil action seeking to impose liability arising out of any
453 actual or alleged act, error, or omission that occurred within the scope of commission
454 employment, duties, or responsibilities, or as determined by the commission that the person

457 construed to prohibit that person from retaining their own counsel at their own expense; and
23 of 36

458 provided further, that the actual or alleged act, error, or omission did not result from that
459 person’s intentional or willful or wanton misconduct.
460 (3) Notwithstanding paragraph (1), should any member, officer, executive director,
461 employee, or representative of the commission be held liable for the amount of any settlement or
462 judgment arising out of any actual or alleged act, error, or omission that occurred within the

464 person to whom that individual is liable had a reasonable basis for believing occurred within the
465 scope of the individual's employment, duties, or responsibilities for the commission, the
466 commission shall indemnify and hold harmless such individual, provided that the actual or
467 alleged act, error, or omission did not result from the intentional or willful or wanton misconduct
468 of the individual.
469 (4) Nothing herein shall be construed as a limitation on the liability of any licensee for
470 professional malpractice or misconduct, which shall be governed solely by any other applicable
471 state laws.
472 (5) Nothing in this compact shall be interpreted to waive or otherwise abrogate a
473 participating state’s state action immunity or state action affirmative defense with respect to
474 antitrust claims under the Sherman Act, Clayton Act, or any other state or federal antitrust or
475 anticompetitive law or regulation.

513 from the data system.
514 Section 9. (a) The commission shall promulgate reasonable rules in order to effectively
515 and efficiently implement and administer the purposes and provisions of the compact. A
516 commission rule shall be invalid and have no force or effect only if a court of competent
517 jurisdiction holds that the rule is invalid because the commission exercised its rulemaking
518 authority in a manner that is beyond the scope and purposes of the compact, or the powers
519 granted hereunder, or based upon another applicable standard of review.
26 of 36

520 (b) The rules of the commission shall have the force of law in each participating state,
521 provided however that where the rules of the commission conflict with the laws of the
522 participating state that establish the participating state’s scope of practice as held by a court of
523 competent jurisdiction, the rules of the commission shall be ineffective in that state to the extent
524 of the conflict.
525 (c) The commission shall exercise its rulemaking powers pursuant to the criteria in this
526 section and the rules adopted thereunder. Rules shall become binding as of the date specified by
527 the commission for each rule.
528 (d) If a majority of the legislatures of the participating states rejects a commission rule or
529 portion of a commission rule, by enactment of a statute or resolution in the same manner used to
530 adopt the compact, within 4 years of the date of adoption of the rule, then such rule shall have no
531 further force and effect in any participating state or to any state applying to participate in the
532 compact.
533 (e) Rules shall be adopted at a regular or special meeting of the commission.
534 (f) Prior to adoption of a proposed rule, the commission shall hold a public hearing and
535 allow persons to provide oral and written comments, data, facts, opinions, and arguments.
536 (g) Prior to adoption of a proposed rule by the commission, and at least 30 days in
537 advance of the meeting at which the commission will hold a public hearing on the proposed rule,
538 the commission shall provide a notice of proposed rulemaking:
539 (1) on the website of the commission or other publicly accessible platform;
27 of 36

540 (2) to persons who have requested notice of the commission’s notices of proposed
541 rulemaking, and
542 (3) in such other ways as the commission may by rule specify.
543 (h) The notice of proposed rulemaking shall include:
544 (1) the time, date, and location of the public hearing at which the commission will hear
545 public comments on the proposed rule and, if different, the time, date, and location of the
546 meeting where the commission will consider and vote on the proposed rule;
547 (2) if the hearing is held via telecommunication, video conference, or other electronic
548 means, the commission shall include the mechanism for access to the hearing in the notice of
549 proposed rulemaking;
550 (3) the text of the proposed rule and the reason therefor;
551 (4) a request for comments on the proposed rule from any interested person; and
552 (5) the manner in which interested persons may submit written comments.
553 (i) All hearings shall be recorded. A copy of the recording and all written comments and
554 documents received by the commission in response to the proposed rule shall be available to the
555 public.
556 (j) Nothing in this section shall be construed as requiring a separate hearing on each
557 commission rule. Rules may be grouped for the convenience of the commission at hearings
558 required by this section.
28 of 36

559 (k) The commission shall, by majority vote of all commissioners, take final action on the
560 proposed rule based on the rulemaking record.
561 (1) The commission may adopt changes to the proposed rule provided the changes do not
562 enlarge the original purpose of the proposed rule.
563 (2) The commission shall provide an explanation of the reasons for substantive changes
564 made to the proposed rule as well as reasons for substantive changes not made that were
565 recommended by commenters.
566 (3) The commission shall determine a reasonable effective date for the rule. Except for an
567 emergency as provided in subsection (l), the effective date of the rule shall be no sooner than 30
568 days after the commission issuing the notice that it adopted or amended the rule.
569 (l) Upon determination that an emergency exists, the commission may consider and adopt
570 an emergency rule with 24 hours’ notice, with opportunity to comment, provided that the usual
571 rulemaking procedures provided in the compact and in this section shall be retroactively applied
572 to the rule as soon as reasonably possible, in no event later than 90 days after the effective date
573 of the rule. For the purposes of this provision, an emergency rule is one that must be adopted
574 immediately in order to:
575 (1) meet an imminent threat to public health, safety, or welfare;
576 (2) prevent a loss of commission or participating state funds;
577 (3) meet a deadline for the promulgation of a rule that is established by federal law or
578 rule; or

29 of 36

581 to a previously adopted rule for purposes of correcting typographical errors, errors in format,
582 errors in consistency, or grammatical errors. Public notice of any revisions shall be posted on the
583 website of the commission. The revision shall be subject to challenge by any person for a period
584 of 30 days after posting. The revision may be challenged only on grounds that the revision
585 results in a material change to a rule. A challenge shall be made in writing and delivered to the
586 commission prior to the end of the notice period. If no challenge is made, the revision will take
587 effect without further action. If the revision is challenged, the revision may not take effect
588 without the approval of the commission.
589 (n) No participating state’s rulemaking requirements shall apply under this compact.
590 Section 10. (a) (1) The executive and judicial branches of state government in each
591 participating state shall enforce this compact and take all actions necessary and appropriate to
592 implement the compact.
593 (2) Venue is proper and judicial proceedings by or against the commission shall be
594 brought solely and exclusively in a court of competent jurisdiction where the principal office of
595 the commission is located. The commission may waive venue and jurisdictional defenses to the
596 extent it adopts or consents to participate in alternative dispute resolution proceedings. Nothing
597 herein shall affect or limit the selection or propriety of venue in any action against a licensee for
598 professional malpractice, misconduct or any such similar matter.
599 (3) The commission shall be entitled to receive service of process in any proceeding
600 regarding the enforcement or interpretation of the compact or commission rule and shall have
601 standing to intervene in such a proceeding for all purposes. Failure to provide the commission
30 of 36

602 service of process shall render a judgment or order void as to the commission, this compact, or
603 promulgated rules.
604 (b) (1) If the commission determines that a participating state has defaulted in the
605 performance of its obligations or responsibilities under this compact or the promulgated rules,
606 the commission shall provide written notice to the defaulting state. The notice of default shall
607 describe the default, the proposed means of curing the default, and any other action that the
608 commission may take, and shall offer training and specific technical assistance regarding the
609 default.
610 (2) The commission shall provide a copy of the notice of default to the other participating
611 states.
612 (c) If a state in default fails to cure the default, the defaulting state may be terminated
613 from the compact upon an affirmative vote of a majority of the commissioners, and all rights,
614 privileges and benefits conferred on that state by this compact may be terminated on the effective
615 date of termination. A cure of the default does not relieve the offending state of obligations or
616 liabilities incurred during the period of default.
617 (d) Termination of participation in the compact shall be imposed only after all other
618 means of securing compliance have been exhausted. Notice of intent to suspend or terminate
619 shall be given by the commission to the governor, the majority and minority leaders of the
620 defaulting state’s legislature, the defaulting state’s state licensing authority or authorities, as
621 applicable, and each of the participating states’ state licensing authority or authorities, as
622 applicable.
31 of 36

623 (e) A state that has been terminated is responsible for all assessments, obligations, and
624 liabilities incurred through the effective date of termination, including obligations that extend
625 beyond the effective date of termination.
626 (f) Upon the termination of a state’s participation in this compact, that state shall
627 immediately provide notice to all licensees of the state, including licensees of other participating
628 states issued a compact privilege to practice within that state, of such termination. The
629 terminated state shall continue to recognize all compact privileges then in effect in that state for a
630 minimum of 180 days after the date of said notice of termination.
631 (g) The commission shall not bear any costs related to a state that is found to be in default
632 or that has been terminated from the compact, unless agreed upon in writing between the
633 commission and the defaulting state.
634 (h) The defaulting state may appeal the action of the commission by petitioning the U.S.
635 District Court for the District of Columbia or the federal district where the commission has its
636 principal offices. The prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, including
637 reasonable attorney’s fees.
638 (i) (1) Upon request by a participating state, the commission shall attempt to resolve
639 disputes related to the compact that arise among participating states and between participating
640 states and non-participating states.
641 (2) The commission shall promulgate a rule providing for both mediation and binding
642 dispute resolution for disputes as appropriate.
32 of 36

643 (j) (1) The commission, in the reasonable exercise of its discretion, shall enforce the
644 provisions of this compact and the commission’s rules.
645 (2) By majority vote, the commission may initiate legal action against a participating
646 state in default in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia or the federal
647 district where the commission has its principal offices to enforce compliance with the provisions
648 of the compact and its promulgated rules. The relief sought may include both injunctive relief
649 and damages. In the event judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party shall be
650 awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorney’s fees. The remedies herein
651 shall not be the exclusive remedies of the commission. The commission may pursue any other
652 remedies available under federal or the defaulting participating state’s law.
653 (3) A participating state may initiate legal action against the commission in the U.S.
654 District Court for the District of Columbia or the federal district where the commission has its
655 principal offices to enforce compliance with the provisions of the compact and its promulgated
656 rules. The relief sought may include both injunctive relief and damages. In the event judicial
657 enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation,
658 including reasonable attorney’s fees.
659 (4) No individual or entity other than a participating state may enforce this compact
660 against the commission.
661 Section 11. (a) The compact shall come into effect on the date on which the compact
662 statute is enacted into law in the seventh participating state.
663 (1) On or after the effective date of the compact, the commission shall convene and
664 review the enactment of each of the states that enacted the compact prior to the commission
33 of 36

665 convening, referred to as charter participating states, to determine if the statute enacted by each
666 such charter participating state is materially different than the model compact.
667 (a) A charter participating state whose enactment is found to be materially different from
668 the model compact shall be entitled to the default process in section 10.
669 (b) If any participating state is later found to be in default, or is terminated or withdraws
670 from the compact, the commission shall remain in existence and the compact shall remain in
671 effect even if the number of participating states is less than 7.
672 (2) Participating states enacting the compact subsequent to the charter participating states
673 shall be subject to the process in paragraph 23 of subsection (c) of section 7 to determine if their
674 enactments are materially different from the model compact and whether they qualify for
675 participation in the compact.
676 (3) All actions taken for the benefit of the commission or in furtherance of the purposes
677 of the administration of the compact prior to the effective date of the compact or the commission
678 coming into existence shall be considered to be actions of the commission unless specifically
679 repudiated by the commission.
680 (4) Any state that joins the compact subsequent to the commission’s initial adoption of
681 the rules and bylaws shall be subject to the commission’s rules and bylaws as they exist on the
682 date on which the compact becomes law in that state. Any rule that has been previously adopted
683 by the commission shall have the full force and effect of law on the day the compact becomes
684 law in that state.
34 of 36

685 (b) Any participating state may withdraw from this compact by enacting a statute
686 repealing that state’s enactment of the compact.
687 (1) A participating state’s withdrawal shall not take effect until 180 days after enactment
688 of the repealing statute.
689 (2) Withdrawal shall not affect the continuing requirement of the withdrawing state’s
690 licensing authority or authorities to comply with the investigative and adverse action reporting
691 requirements of this compact prior to the effective date of withdrawal.
692 (3) Upon the enactment of a statute withdrawing from this compact, the state shall
693 immediately provide notice of such withdrawal to all licensees within that state. Notwithstanding
694 any subsequent statutory enactment to the contrary, such withdrawing state shall continue to
695 recognize all compact privileges to practice within that state granted pursuant to this compact for
696 a minimum of 180 days after the date of such notice of withdrawal.
697 (c) Nothing contained in this compact shall be construed to invalidate or prevent any
698 licensure agreement or other cooperative arrangement between a participating state and a non-
699 participating state that does not conflict with the provisions of this compact.
700 (d) This compact may be amended by the participating states. No amendment to this
701 compact shall become effective and binding upon any participating state until it is enacted into
702 the laws of all participating states.
703 Section 12. (a) This compact and the commission’s rulemaking authority shall be
704 liberally construed so as to effectuate the purposes, and the implementation and administration of
705 the compact. Provisions of the compact expressly authorizing or requiring the promulgation of
35 of 36

706 rules shall not be construed to limit the commission’s rulemaking authority solely for those
707 purposes.
708 (b) The provisions of this compact shall be severable and if any phrase, clause, sentence
709 or provision of this compact is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be contrary to the
710 constitution of any participating state, a state seeking participation in the compact, or of the
711 United States, or the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or circumstance is
712 held to be unconstitutional by a court of competent jurisdiction, the validity of the remainder of
713 this compact and the applicability thereof to any other government, agency, person or
714 circumstance shall not be affected thereby.
715 (c) Notwithstanding subsection (b), the commission may deny a state’s participation in
716 the compact or, in accordance with the requirements of subsection (b) of section 10, terminate a
717 participating state’s participation in the compact, if it determines that a constitutional
718 requirement of a participating state is a material departure from the compact. Otherwise, if this
719 compact shall be held to be contrary to the constitution of any participating state, the compact
720 shall remain in full force and effect as to the remaining participating states and in full force and
721 effect as to the participating state affected as to all severable matters.
722 Section 13. (a) Nothing herein shall prevent or inhibit the enforcement of any other law
723 of a participating state that is not inconsistent with the compact.
724 (b) Any laws, statutes, regulations, or other legal requirements in a participating state in
725 conflict with the compact are superseded to the extent of the conflict.
726 (c) All permissible agreements between the commission and the participating states are
727 binding in accordance with their terms.
