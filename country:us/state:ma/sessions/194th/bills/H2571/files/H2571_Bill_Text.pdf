40 secured by or payable from amounts held in the fund, the sums to be credited to the fund are
41 hereby impressed with a trust for the benefit of the trust and the holders from time to time of the
42 bonds or notes, and in consideration of the acceptance of payment for the bonds or notes, the
43 commonwealth covenants with the purchasers and all subsequent holders and transferees of the

266 eligible applicant undertakes construction before approval is obtained, the eligible applicant shall
267 remain subject to the authority's approval process as if the construction were not undertaken.
268 Section 8. (a) Upon receipt of an application under section 7, from time to time, the

286 financial obligations of the authority, the authority's long term capital plan, the results of needs
287 surveys, and standards under section 9 and otherwise as prescribed by law and regulation.
288 (b) Within a reasonable time after receipt of the application the authority shall notify the
289 applicant of its approval or rejection of the application, and, in the event of its rejection, of the
290 reasons for the decision. The notice of approval shall be accompanied by a statement of the
14 of 18

291 estimated approved cost as determined by the authority, and an estimate of the amount of total
292 assistance amount which the applicant may be eligible to receive, based on approved costs
