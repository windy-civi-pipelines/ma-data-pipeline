In the One Hundred and Ninety-Fourth General Court
(2025-2026)
_______________
An Act to improve public safety and security.
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives in General Court assembled, and by the authority
of the same, as follows:
1 SECTION I. The Massachusetts General Laws are hereby amended by inserting the
2 following new chapter:
3 State Immigration Processing & Waiver Act
4 An Act to Improve Public Safety and Security
5 SECTION II. – PURPOSE
6 The complex variety of problems relating to immigration, processing of new immigrants,
7 and various clearances relating to residence, employment, and a variety of legal issues, has
8 grown in recent years. – Federal Policy of The United States Government, has become
1 of 2

9 increasingly confusing, and frustrating to state policy, employers, and local communities, further
10 confusing, and complicating state, and local community services, and communities.
11 Thus, this legislation authorizes exploration by the Executive Office of Public Safety and
12 Security (EOPSS), of establishing a:
13 Commonwealth of Massachusetts – State Immigration Processing & Waiver Office
14 SECTION III. – PURPOSES OF STATE IMMIGRATION PROCESSING & WAIVER
15 OFFICE
16 A Pilot Program, is authorized to be established by the EOPSS, to develop a database of
17 legal visitors, and residents; and to explore relevant Status Guidelines for all non-citizen entrants
18 to The Commonwealth of Massachusetts.
19 This Pilot Program, shall explore the creation of Employer Sponsorship Agreements
20 (ESAs), by which Massachusetts based employers, needing appropriately credentialed, or
21 standard capable employees, may offer such positions, through the State Immigration Processing
22 Services (SIPS).
23 As this Pilot Program, develops, it shall explore, with Federal authorities, how
24 Commonwealth of Massachusetts Law Enforcement, might assume state jurisdiction of
25 immigrant screening; of some number of employable non-citizen individuals; with possible
26 Federal reimbursement.
27 In setting forth these standards, it is hoped that a pathway, for stabilization of immigrant
28 lives, and families, and our state economy, might be accomplished for some number of
29 individuals in Massachusetts.
