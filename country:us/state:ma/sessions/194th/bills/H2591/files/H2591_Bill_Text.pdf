_______________
An Act to build restorative family and community connection.
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives in General Court assembled, and by the authority
of the same, as follows:
1 Section 36C of chapter 127 of the General Laws of 2022, is hereby amended by striking
2 out the section in its entirety and inserting in place thereof the following:
3 Section 36C.
4 (a) The Commissioner of Correction and administrators of state prisons and county
5 correctional facilities shall establish a policy to maximize visitation. The Commissioner of
6 Correction and administrators of state prisons and county correctional facilities shall not: (1)
7 prohibit, eliminate, or unreasonably limit in-person visitation of incarcerated people; or (2)
8 coerce, compel, or otherwise pressure an incarcerated person to forego or limit in-person
9 visitation. A complaint process shall be established for visitors to report any complaints related
10 to the conduct of correctional staff during or related to visitation, appealable to Commissioner of
11 Correction and Sheriffs.
1 of 9

12 (b) The Commissioner of Correction and administrators of state prisons and county
13 correctional facilities shall provide all incarcerated people with: (1) at least two visiting periods
14 per day, at least one of which shall be at least four hours in length; (2) at least one eight-hour
15 visiting period each weekend; and (3) at least one four-hour visiting period on every state and
16 federal holiday. For purposes of this section “visiting period” includes time spent with visitors
17 and does not include time that visitors spend processing in and out of the institution. No
18 institution shall restrict or limit visiting area capacity below that which may be required by
19 building or occupancy codes. If the visiting area capacity is too small to accommodate the
20 visiting periods required by this section, then any reduction in visiting periods shall be
21 documented in writing and reported publicly with all personal identifying information redacted.
22 The Commissioner of Correction and administrators of state prisons and county correctional
23 facilities shall exhaust all available means of increasing visitation capacity to meet the
24 requirements of this section. Visitation shall not be decreased below that which is offered on
25 January 1, 2025.
26 (c) The Commissioner of Correction and administrators of state prisons and county
27 correctional facilities shall not place limitations on the number of individuals who may be
28 eligible to visit an incarcerated person.
29 (d) The Commissioner of Correction and administrators of state prisons and county
30 correctional facilities may require pre-approval for visitors. Any pre-approval system shall (1)
31 require only the personal information that is included on state issued identification or passport;
32 (2) allow people to update their pre-approved visitor list on request and ensure a response to such
33 update requests within 7 calendar days; (3) allow exceptions to the pre-approval process for first
34 time visitors traveling from further than 75 miles away; and (4) ensure that visitors pre-approved
2 of 9

35 to visit an incarcerated person at one prison, jail, or house of correction may visit that same
36 person if they are transferred to a different prison, jail, or house of correction. The Commissioner
37 of Correction and administrators of state prisons and county correctional facilities shall comply
38 with all applicable statutes, regulations, and orders governing the protection of sensitive and/or
39 private personal information.
40 (e) The Commissioner of Correction and administrators of state prisons and county
41 correctional facilities shall permit individuals to visit more than one incarcerated person in
42 correctional custody, including in the same facility, unless there is an individual determination
43 that such visitation would pose a threat to security or orderly running of the facility. The
44 incarcerated person and the visitor shall be provided with a written explanation of the basis for
45 any such determination, including the objective reasoning and all evidence that was relied upon
46 for the determination. Any such determination may be challenged by an action under Mass.
47 General Laws chapter 249 section 4.
48 (f) The Commissioner of Correction and administrators of state prisons and county
49 correctional facilities shall not exclude a visitor from eligibility for any of the following reasons:
50 (1) solely on the basis of their history of criminal conviction, status as formerly incarcerated, or
51 parole or probation status; (2) solely on the basis of their role, past or present, as a volunteer in a
52 state or federal prison, jail or house of correction; or (3) solely because of their participation in
53 community functions, organizations, events, or meetings.
54 (g) The Commissioner of Correction and administrators of state prisons and county
55 correctional facilities shall not exclude a visitor from eligibility or bar an existing visitor unless
56 there is a reasonable individualized suspicion that their visitation poses a threat to institutional
3 of 9

57 security. The reasonable individualized suspicion shall be articulated in writing, including
58 objective reasoning and all evidence relied upon, to the excluded or barred person and to the
59 incarcerated person they visited or attempted to visit within 5 days of the determination to
60 exclude or bar them, including an expiration date for the exclusion or barring as soon as is
61 reasonable to address the articulated threat and further providing the excluded or barred person
62 the right to appeal their exclusion or barring as well as to have their exclusion or barring re-
63 evaluated after no more than one month has passed. Any determination to exclude or bar a
64 person from visitation under this section may be challenged in an action under Mass. General
65 Laws chapter 249 section 4.
66 (h) The Commissioner of Correction and administrators of state prisons and county
67 correctional facilities shall permit all incarcerated people to hold, play with, and instruct their

69 under the age of 18 equipped with games and educational activities. Children under the age of 18
70 shall be permitted to bring homework, subject to search, to visitation periods to work on with
71 their incarcerated loved one.

88 hair styling, and other items related to any religious practices, such as head coverings, wedding
89 bands worn on the right hand, crescent moon jewelry, or double layer clothing for religious
90 purposes, shall be permitted. Children ages 12 and under shall not be required to follow the adult
91 dress code. Visitors shall be permitted to wear coats with hoods in facilities where visitors must
92 walk outside to enter the visitation area during inclement weather. Clothing or accessories that
93 cannot be shown to pose a threat to security or the orderly running of the facility shall be

95 basis to exclude or bar a visitor. Cultural or ethnic hairstyles including but not limited to box
96 braids, cornrows, Bantu knots, locs, twists, and other natural and protective hairstyles protected
97 under the Massachusetts “Crown Act”, St. 2022, c.117, shall be permitted. A visitor whose dress
98 was deemed unacceptable shall be permitted to return during a designated visiting period on the
99 same day with alternate clothing. No visitor shall be turned away on the basis of a dress code
100 violation without consulting the superintendent, shift commander, or designee, and if a visitor is
101 turned away for a dress code violation the specific reason must be in writing, photographic

111 in critical condition or in imminent danger of death, the Commissioner of Correction and
112 administrators of state prisons and county correctional facilities shall permit them daily access to
113 visitation during all facility or hospital visiting hours.
114 (q) Should an incarcerated person experience the death, or imminent danger of death, of
115 an immediate family member, the Commissioner of Correction and administrators of state

141 Video or other such electronic communication with visitors shall comply with the
142 provisions of Chapter 127 Section 36C. Video and electronic communication with visitors may
143 be less restrictive than in person visitation and shall not be more restrictive than in person
