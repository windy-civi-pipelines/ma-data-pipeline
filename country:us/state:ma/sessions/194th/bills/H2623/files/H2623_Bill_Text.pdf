13 paragraphs:-
14 Any person who performs work without a valid license, certificate, or registration

21 Official Edition is hereby amended by striking out the figure “$1,000” in line 7 and inserting in
22 place thereof, “$1,500”.

27 SECTION 7. Chapter 148 of the General Laws, as appearing in the 2020 Official Edition,
28 is hereby amended by inserting after section 33 of said chapter the following new section:
29 Section 33A. Suspension or Revocation of License; Notice
30 The marshal may suspend or revoke without a hearing any license, permit or certificate
31 issued under this chapter whenever the holder thereof has committed a violation of any law,
2 of 3

32 ordinance or bylaw relating to the subject matter of this chapter, or of any rule or regulation of
33 the board of fire prevention regulations established under section four of chapter 22D, in this
34 chapter referred to as the board or any order of the marshal or the head of the fire department, the
35 nature of which would give the marshal reason to believe that the continuing operation by such
36 holder is and will be so seriously improper as to constitute an immediate threat to the public
37 safety.
38 Upon such suspension or revocation, the marshal shall forthwith send written notice
39 thereof to the holder. Such notice shall specify the time and place of the violation. The marshal,
40 or any person to whom he has delegated his authority, may order the license, permit or certificate
41 of such holder to be delivered to him; and the license, permit or certificate shall not be reissued
42 unless, upon examination or investigation, or after a hearing, the marshal, or his designee
43 determines that the holder shall again be permitted to operate. Said holder shall be entitled to a
44 hearing within thirty days of the suspension or revocation.
