1 of 8
8 "Decision-maker" means an adult who seeks to execute, or has executed, a supported
9 decision-making agreement with one or more supporters under this chapter.
10 "Supported decision-making" means the process of supporting and accommodating the
11 decision-maker, without impeding the self-determination of the decision-maker, in making life
12 decisions, including, but not limited to, decisions related to where the decision-maker wants to
13 live; the services, supports, financial decisions, and medical care the decision-maker wants to
14 receive; whom the decision-maker wants to live with; or where the decision-maker wants to
15 work.
16 "Supported decision-making agreement" is an agreement a decision-maker enters into
17 with one or more supporters under this section to use supported decision-making.
18 "Supporter" means an adult who has entered into a supported decision-making agreement
19 with a decision-maker.
20 (b) A decision-maker may voluntarily, without undue influence or coercion, enter into a
21 supported decision-making agreement with a supporter or supporters. The decision-maker may
22 change or terminate a supported decision-making agreement at any time, per the procedure(s)
23 outlines in section (e).
24 (c) Except as limited by a supported decision-making agreement, a supporter may
25 provide to the decision-maker the following decision-making assistance with the decision-
26 maker’s affairs with the consent of the individual with the disability:
27 (1) assisting with making decisions, communicating decisions, and understanding
28 information about, options for, the responsibilities of, and the consequences of decisions;
2 of 8
29 (2) accessing, obtaining, and understanding information that is relevant to decisions
30 necessary for the decision-maker to manage his or her affairs, including medical, psychological,
31 financial, and educational information; and medical and other records;
32 (3) ascertaining the wishes and decisions of the decision-maker; assisting in
33 communicating those wishes and decisions to other persons; and advocating to ensure their
34 implementation; and
35 (4) accompanying the decision-maker and participating in discussions with other persons
36 when the decision-maker is making decisions or attempting to obtain information for decisions.
37 (d) A supporter may exercise only the authority granted to the supporter in the supported

57 supporter or supporters, the court may revoke, terminate, or suspend for a time to be determined
58 by the court, the supported decision-making agreement. The agreement may survive if one or
59 more supporters who were not found to have abused, neglected, or exploited the adult with a
60 disability continues to be willing to serve as a supporter and the decision-maker agrees. If the

64 or obtaining information that is relevant to a decision authorized under the supported decision-
65 making agreement and to which the decision-maker agrees that the supporter should have access.
66 (2) If a supporter assists the decision-maker in accessing, collecting, or obtaining
67 personal information, including protected health information under the Health Insurance

69 the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (20 U.S.C. section 1232g), the supporter
4 of 8
70 shall ensure the information is kept privileged and confidential, as applicable, and is subject to
71 neither unauthorized access, nor use, nor disclosure.
72 (g) The existence of a supported decision-making agreement does not preclude a
73 decision-maker from seeking personal information without the assistance of a supporter.
74 (h) A supported decision-making agreement must be signed voluntarily, without coercion
75 or undue influence, by the decision-maker and the supporter or supporters in the presence of two
76 or more witnesses who are at least 18 years of age, and unrelated to the decision-maker and who
77 are not supporters of the decision-maker, or a notary public.

87 (iv) indicate that the decision-maker may change, amend, or revoke the supported
88 decision-making agreement at any time for any reason subject to the requirements of section (g);
5 of 8
89 (v) include a statement that if any person suspects the decision-maker has been abused,
90 neglected or exploited by a supporter or supporters, the person may report the suspicion to, as

92 and shall include the contact information for the disabled persons protection commission, the
93 elder abuse hot line, and, the human rights officer of any program providing services to the
94 decision-maker; and
95 (vi) be signed by the decision-maker and the supporters, the decision-maker’s signature
96 to be attested to by a notary public or, in the alternative, by two witnesses who are unrelated to
97 the decision-maker and who are not supporters of the decision-making.
98 (j)(A) A person who receives the original or a copy of a supported decision-making
99 agreement shall rely on the agreement and recognize a decision or request made or
100 communicated with the decision-making assistance of a supporter under this chapter as the
101 decision or request of the decision-maker.
102 (B) A person who, in good faith, acts in reliance on an authorization in a supported
103 decision-making agreement is not subject to civil or criminal liability or to discipline for
104 unprofessional conduct for relying on a decision made in accordance with a supported decision-
105 making agreement.
106 (k) Execution of a supported decision-making agreement may not be a condition of
107 participation in any activity, service, or program.
