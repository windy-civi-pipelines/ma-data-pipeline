41 of the effective date of this act, the public fund shall make its best efforts to facilitate the
42 identification of all scrutinized companies in which the public fund has direct or indirect
43 holdings, excluding those companies that are providing humanitarian assistance to Myanmar.
44 The identification of scrutinized companies shall be the responsibility of an independent, third-
45 party research firm, as identified by the public fund, and based on the criteria set forth in this act.
46 By the first meeting of the public fund following the 90-day period, the public fund shall
47 assemble all scrutinized companies in which it has direct or indirect holdings into a scrutinized
48 companies list. The public fund shall update the scrutinized companies list on a quarterly basis
49 based on evolving information from the independent, third-party research firm.
50 SECTION 3. Notwithstanding any general or special law to the contrary, the public fund
51 shall adhere to the following procedure for companies on the scrutinized companies list:
3 of 7
52 (a)(1) The public fund shall determine the companies on the scrutinized companies list,
53 created under section 2, in which the public fund owns direct or indirect holdings.
54 (2) The public fund shall sell, redeem, divest or withdraw all publicly-traded securities of
55 each company identified in paragraph (1) with active business operations with Myanmar, except
56 as provided in subsection (c) and section 5, according to the following schedule: (i) at least 50
57 per cent of such assets shall be removed from the public fund’s assets under management within
58 6 months after the company’s most recent appearance on the scrutinized companies list; and (ii)

62 scrutinized active business operations with Myanmar.
63 (3) During the time period outlined in paragraph (2), the public fund may sign onto
64 engagement letters or participate in shareholder resolutions regarding the scrutinized business
65 operations of companies identified in paragraph (1) with active or inactive business operations
66 with Myanmar in which the public fund still owns direct or indirect holdings.
67 (4) If a company identified in paragraph (1) with only inactive business operations with
68 Myanmar converts such operations to active business operations with Myanmar, paragraph (2)
69 shall immediately apply. The company shall also be immediately placed onto the scrutinized
70 companies list.
71 (b) At no time shall the public fund acquire securities of companies on the scrutinized
72 companies list that have active business operations with Myanmar, except as provided in
73 subsections (c) and (d).

75 excluded from its present or future federal sanctions regime relating to the government of
76 Myanmar shall be subject to divestment or an investment prohibition under subsections (a) and
77 (b).
78 (d) Notwithstanding anything in this act to the contrary, subsections (a) and (b) shall not
79 apply to indirect holdings in actively managed investment funds; provided, however, that the
80 public fund shall submit letters to the managers of such investment funds containing companies
81 with scrutinized active business operations with Myanmar requesting that they consider
82 removing such companies from the investment fund or create a similar actively managed fund
83 with indirect holdings devoid of such companies. If the manager creates a similar fund, the
84 public fund shall replace all applicable investments with investments in the similar fund in an
85 expedited timeframe consistent with prudent investing standards. For the purposes of this
86 section, private equity funds shall be deemed to be actively managed investment funds.
87 SECTION 4. Notwithstanding any general or special law to the contrary, with respect to
88 actions taken in compliance with this act, the public fund shall be exempt from any conflicting
89 statutory or common law obligations, including any such obligations with respect to the choice
90 of asset managers, investment funds or investments for the public fund’s securities portfolios and
91 all good faith determinations regarding companies as required by this act.
92 SECTION 5. Notwithstanding any general or special law to the contrary, the public fund
93 shall be permitted to cease divesting from certain scrutinized companies under subsection (a) of
94 section 3, reinvest in certain scrutinized companies from which it divested under said subsection
95 (a) of said section 3 or continue to invest in certain scrutinized companies from which it has not
5 of 7
96 yet divested upon clear and convincing evidence showing that the total and aggregate value of all
97 assets under management by, or on behalf of, the public fund becomes: (i) equal to or less than
98 99.5 per cent; or (ii) 100 per cent less 50 basis points of the hypothetical value of all assets under
99 management by, or on behalf of, the public fund assuming no divestment for any company had
100 occurred under said subsection (a) of said section 3. Cessation of divestment, reinvestment or
101 any subsequent ongoing investment authorized by this section shall be strictly limited to the
102 minimum steps necessary to avoid the contingency set forth in the preceding sentence.
103 For any cessation of divestment, and in advance of such cessation, authorized by this
104 subsection, the public fund shall provide a written report to the attorney general, the senate and
105 house committees on ways and means and the joint committee on public service, updated semi-
106 annually thereafter as applicable, setting forth the reasons and justification, supported by clear
107 and convincing evidence, for its decisions to cease divestment of holdings in companies on the
108 scrutinized companies list or to reinvest or remain invested in companies with scrutinized active
109 business operations with Myanmar.
110 SECTION 6. The public fund shall file a copy of the scrutinized companies list with the
111 clerks of the senate and the house of representatives and the attorney general within 30 days after
112 the list is created. Annually thereafter, the public fund shall file a report with the clerks of the
113 senate and the house of representatives and the attorney general that includes: (1) the most recent
114 scrutinized companies list; (2) all investments sold, redeemed, divested or withdrawn in
115 compliance with subsection (a) of section 3; (3) all prohibited investments from which the public
116 fund has not yet divested under subsection (b) of said section 3; and (4) any progress made under
117 subsection (d) of said section 3.
