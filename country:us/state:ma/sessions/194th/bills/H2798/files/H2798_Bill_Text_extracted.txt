An Act establishing a sick leave bank for Kendra Winner.
Whereas, The deferred operation of this act would tend to defeat its purpose, which is to
establish forthwith a sick leave bank for a certain employee of the Massachusetts Department of
Elementary and Secondary Education, therefore it is hereby declared to be an emergency law,
necessary for the immediate preservation of the public convenience.
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives in General Court assembled, and by the authority
of the same, as follows:
1 Notwithstanding any general or special law to the contrary, the Massachusetts
2 Department of Elementary and Secondary Education shall establish a sick leave bank for Kendra
3 Winner, an employee of the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education. Any employee
4 of the Department may voluntarily contribute 1 or more sick, personal or vacation days to the
5 sick leave bank for use by Kendra Winner. If Kendra Winner terminates employment with the
6 Department of Elementary and Secondary Education or requests to dissolve the sick leave bank,
7 any remaining time in the sick leave bank shall be transferred to the extended illness leave bank.

8 Sick leave bank days shall not be used for absences unrelated to the illness or disability that
