176 investment criteria and consistent with the fund's fiduciary obligations, take into account that
177 carbon investments have financial risks to pension beneficiaries and take appropriate action
178 pursuant to this section.

180 fund of the city, town, district or county that is not subject to chapter 32 of the General Laws nor
