of the public peace.

of the same, as follows:
1 SECTION 1. Paragraph (f) of subdivision 2 of section 5 of chapter 32 of the general laws,
2 as appearing in the 2018 official edition, is hereby amended in line 211 by adding after the word
3 “law,” the following: “arises for a member otherwise subject to this paragraph where the member
4 has a final separate period of creditable service of thirty-six consecutive months or sixty
5 consecutive months, and which period was last immediately preceded by a period of creditable
6 service that concluded more than twenty years prior to the start of the final period of creditable
7 service,”.
