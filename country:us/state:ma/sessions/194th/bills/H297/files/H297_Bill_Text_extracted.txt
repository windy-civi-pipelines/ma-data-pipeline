An Act relative to neighborhood stabilization and economic development.
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives in General Court assembled, and by the authority
of the same, as follows:
1 SECTION 1. Section 3 of chapter 70B of the General Laws, as appearing in the 2022
2 Official Edition, is hereby amended by inserting after the colon, in line 21, the following words:
3 “neighborhood stabilization,”.
4 SECTION 2. Section 1 of chapter 121A, as so appearing, is hereby amended by replacing
5 the definitions of “decadent area”, “sub-standard area”, and “project” with the below definitions
6 of those terms, and inserting the following additional definitions after the definition of “project”-
7 “Decadent area”, an area, including a spot rehabilitation property, which is detrimental to
8 safety, health, morals, welfare or sound growth of a community because of the existence of a
9 building or buildings which are out of repair, physically deteriorated, unfit for human habitation,
1 of 11
10 or obsolete, or in need of major maintenance or repair, or because much of the real estate in
11 recent years has been sold or taken for non-payment of taxes or upon foreclosure of mortgages,
12 or because a building or buildings have been torn down and not replaced and in which under
13 existing conditions it is improbable that the building or buildings will be replaced, or because of
14 a substantial change in business or economic conditions, or because of inadequate light, air, or
15 open space, or because of excessive land coverage, or because diversity of ownership, irregular
16 lot sizes or obsolete street patterns make it improbable that the area will be redeveloped by the
17 ordinary operations of private enterprise, or by reason of any combination of the foregoing
18 conditions.
19 “Sub-standard area”, an area, including a spot rehabilitation property, upon which there is
20 a dwelling or wherein dwellings predominate which, by reason of dilapidation, overcrowding,
21 faulty arrangement or design, lack of ventilation, light, or sanitation facilities, or any
22 combination of these factors, are detrimental to safety, health, morals, welfare or sound growth
23 of a community.
24 “Project”, any undertaking consisting of the construction in one or more specified
25 blighted open, decadent or sub-standard areas of decent, safe and sanitary residential,
26 commercial, industrial, institutional, recreational or governmental buildings and such
27 appurtenant or incidental facilities as shall be in the public interest, and the operation and

35 sub-standard area or areas; and (d) installation, construction, and reconstruction of public and

40 chapter 40H; a bona-fide non-profit organization, established under chapter 180 that has, in the

44 neighborhoods, or a similar purpose; a redevelopment authority established under chapter 121B;
45 or a partnership of two or more of any of the foregoing; that is approved under this chapter to
46 rehabilitate a spot rehabilitation property.

55 distressed, upon consideration of the following: the building or buildings are out of repair,
3 of 11
56 physically deteriorated, unfit for human habitation, or obsolete, or in need of major maintenance
57 or repair, or because the building has been sold or taken for non-payment of taxes or upon
58 foreclosure of mortgages.
59 “Spot Rehabilitation Project”, any project, the subject of which consists exclusively of
60 spot rehabilitation properties.
