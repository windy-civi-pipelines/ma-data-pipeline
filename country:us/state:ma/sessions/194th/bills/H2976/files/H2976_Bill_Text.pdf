In the One Hundred and Ninety-Fourth General Court
(2025-2026)

An Act relative to creditable service for Eileen Mullen, a member of the Massachusetts
Teachers’ retirement system.
Whereas, The deferred operation of this act would tend to defeat its purpose, which is to
authorize the Massachusetts Teachers’ retirement board to grant creditable service to Eileen
Mullen, therefore it is hereby declared to be an emergency law, necessary for the immediate
preservation of the public convenience.
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives in General Court assembled, and by the authority
of the same, as follows:
1 Notwithstanding section 4 of chapter 32 of the General Laws or any other general or
2 special law to the contrary, the Massachusetts Teachers’ retirement board shall credit Eileen
3 Mullen, a member of the Massachusetts Teachers’ retirement system, with creditable service for
4 the service she rendered as a teacher in the pilot program for criminal justice at the Greater New
5 Bedford Regional Vocational Technical High School in the city of New Bedford from August
6 2010 to June 2013 for the purpose of determining her superannuation retirement allowance under
1 of 2

7 subsection (a) of paragraph (2) of section 5 of said chapter 32. Before the date that any
8 retirement allowance becomes effective in the case of Eileen Mullen, she shall pay into the
9 annuity savings fund of the Massachusetts teachers’ retirement system, in 1 sum or installments,
10 upon such terms and conditions as the Massachusetts teachers’ retirement system may prescribe,
11 an amount equal to that which would have been withheld as regular deductions from her regular
12 compensation for such previous service, together with buyback interest, as defined in section 1 of
13 said chapter 32. This act shall not affect any other retirement benefits that Eileen Mullen may
14 otherwise be entitled to.
