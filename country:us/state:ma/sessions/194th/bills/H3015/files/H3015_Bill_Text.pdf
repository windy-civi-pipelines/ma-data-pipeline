13 withdrawal at any time. The monies shall be expended by the state treasurer without further
14 appropriation for the purposes of funding the YMCA’s Youth & Government program and any
15 funds remaining at the end of any fiscal year shall not revert to the General Fund and shall be
16 available for use in subsequent fiscal years.
17 SECTION 2. Chapter 62 of the General Laws is hereby amended by inserting after

22 this section may be made with respect to any taxable year at the time of filing a return of the tax
23 established by this chapter for such taxable year. The commissioner shall prescribe the manner in
24 which the contribution shall be made on the face of the return required by section 5 of chapter
25 62C; provided, however, that the commissioner shall assure that taxpayers filing any such forms
26 are made clearly aware of their ability to make the contributions provided for by this section. The
27 commissioner shall annually report the total amount designated under this section to the state
28 treasurer, who shall credit such amount to the YMCA’s Youth & Government Fund.
