10 Said MFVC shall be a tax return-enabled contribution option for the purposes of chapter
11 62 and shall be authorized to receive and hold for transfer to the UN LCDF all monies (i)
12 received by the commonwealth pursuant to section 6O of chapter 62, and (ii) received from
13 public and private sources as gifts, grants, and donations to the UN LDCF.
14 The state treasurer shall deposit monies in said MFVC in accord with state law and in
15 such manner as will secure the highest interest rate available consistent with the safety of the
16 fund; provided, that all amounts on deposit shall thereafter be available for transfer to (i) the UN

20 support.
21 SECTION 2. Chapter 62 of the General Laws, as so appearing, is hereby amended by
22 inserting in section 1 the following definition:
23 “Tax return-enabled contribution option”, any account or fund appearing on a personal
24 income tax return form prescribed and furnished by the commissioner, and to which a person

26 jointly, may voluntarily contribute all or part of a refund due from the commonwealth or an
27 amount of money over and above any tax owed to the commonwealth.

37 income tax return jointly, may make a voluntary contribution to the MFVC with respect to any
38 tax year at the time of the filing of a return of a tax established by this chapter for such year. All
39 personal income tax forms prescribed by and furnished by the commissioner shall include a clear
40 indication of, and a convenient opportunity to exercise, the option to contribute to the MFVC;
41 provided, further, that said forms and public materials and documents related thereto shall refer

51 prescribed and furnished by the commissioner without express legislative authorization.
52 (b) Notwithstanding any statute or administrative action to the contrary, each tax return-
53 enabled contribution option appearing on the personal income tax return form for the immediate
3 of 6
54 past year and for five or more total years to which total dollar contributions have not, in any of
55 the five most recent years, equaled or exceeded eighty percent of the average of total dollar
56 contributions made in the respective tax year to all tax return-enabled contribution options
57 included on said form for said year, shall not appear on personal income tax return forms for a
58 minimum of five tax years thereafter; provided, further, that each tax return-enabled contribution
59 option appearing on the personal income tax return form for a total of four or fewer years shall,
60 as a condition of continuing to appear on the form after the fifth year of so appearing, have
61 received, in at least one of the initial five years, total dollar contributions equal to, or in excess
62 of, eighty percent of the average of total dollar contributions made in the respective tax year to
63 all tax return-enabled contribution options included on said form for said year; provided, further,
64 that in the event of the failure of a tax return-enabled contribution option to satisfy said
65 condition, said contribution option shall not appear on personal income tax return forms for a
66 minimum of five tax years thereafter; and, provided, further, that the commissioner may depart
67 from the requirements of this paragraph only to the extent of ensuring that no fewer than three
68 tax return-enabled contribution options, consisting of any combination of (i) new contribution
69 options and (ii) contribution options previously authorized and receiving the highest total dollar
70 contributions for the five most recent years, shall appear on the personal income tax return forms
71 of the commonwealth for each tax year.
72 (c) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this section, no more than nine, and no fewer
73 than three, tax return-enabled contribution options shall appear on personal income tax return
74 forms of the commonwealth for any one tax year.
4 of 6
75 (d) The text of each tax return-enabled contribution option printed on a personal income
76 tax return form shall indicate the principal entity or entities authorized to assume possession of,
77 or expend or disburse, monies in the account or fund associated with said contribution option.
78 (e) The administrator of each entity that assumes possession of, or disburses, monies
79 maintained in an account or fund associated with a tax return-enabled contribution option shall
80 compile an annual report on the account’s or fund’s expenditures and disbursements during the
81 previous tax year. Said annual report shall include, except as is necessary to comply with
82 privacy laws: (i) the identity of each individual, organization, agency or program in receipt of
83 expenditures or disbursements of two thousand dollars or more from the fund together with the
84 dollar amount received; and (ii) a description of the process or criteria according to which said
85 recipients were identified and selected. Said report shall be submitted to the commissioner, joint
86 house and senate committee on revenue, and house and senate committees on ways and means.
87 (f) The administrator of each entity that assumes possession of, or disburses, monies
88 maintained in an account or fund associated with a tax return-enabled contribution option shall
89 provide, except as is necessary to comply with privacy laws, any information requested by the
90 attorney general, state auditor, inspector general, senate or house committees on post audit and
91 oversight, the commissioner, or any department, agency or law enforcement body investigating
92 suspected financial abuse. The superior court shall have jurisdiction over disputed requests for
93 information.
94 (g) The state auditor, pursuant to section 12 of chapter 11, shall audit any accounts or
95 funds associated with each tax return-enabled contribution option once every 5 years at a
96 minimum and more often as the state auditor determines necessary. Following an audit, the
5 of 6
97 auditor shall make recommendations to the commissioner, the senate and house committees on
98 ways and means and the joint committee on revenue about changes in law or regulation that may
99 improve the efficiency and effectiveness of tax return-enabled contribution options and any
100 associated accounts or funds, decrease their costs, or prevent waste, fraud or abuse. If the auditor
101 finds substantial waste, fraud or abuse on the part of an administrator of any entity that assumes
102 possession of, or disburses, monies maintained in an account or fund associated with a tax
103 return-enabled contribution option, the auditor may recommend to the commissioner, in a writing
104 that shall include such findings, that said contribution option be removed from the tax form for a
105 number of tax years or that said administrator be barred from future involvement with said
106 contribution option. Upon receipt of such a recommendation, the commissioner may,
107 notwithstanding any general or special law to the contrary, remove said tax return-enabled
108 contribution option from the tax form for a number of tax years or bar said administrator from
109 future involvement with the contribution option.
110 (h) The attorney general or the commissioner may independently investigate allegations
111 of waste, fraud or abuse by an administrator of any entity authorized to assume possession of, or
112 expend or disburse, monies contributed to an account or fund associated with a tax return-
113 enabled contribution option, including allegations referred by the auditor. The attorney general
114 may initiate an action in superior court to enjoin the deposit of monies by the state treasurer in
115 any such account or fund or the expenditure of monies by said administrator. The attorney
116 general or the commissioner may initiate an action in superior court to recover any monies
117 alleged to have been lost because of said waste, fraud or abuse.
