63 participating municipality by a majority vote of the city or town council, by a majority vote of
64 the board of selectmen or by resolution of its legislative body, as may be appropriate, pursuant to
65 which the municipality shall assess, collect, remit and assign betterment assessments, in return
66 for qualifying improvements for a benefitted property owner located within such municipality
67 and for costs reasonably incurred in performing such acts.
68 (2) A program administrator may only offer a program for financing qualifying
69 improvements to residential property within the jurisdiction of a municipality if the municipality
70 has authorized the program administrator to administer the program for financing qualifying
71 improvements to residential property by a majority vote of the city or town council, by a
72 majority vote of the board of selectmen or by resolution of its legislative body, as may be
73 appropriate. The authorized program must, at a minimum, meet the requirements of this section.
74 (3) Pursuant to this section or as otherwise provided by law, a municipality may enter
75 into an interlocal agreement providing for a partnership between one or more municipalities for
76 the purpose of facilitating a program to finance qualifying improvements to residential property
77 located within the jurisdiction of the municipalities that are party to the agreement.
4 of 17
78 (4) A municipality may deauthorize a program administrator through repeal of the vote
79 or the resolution adopted pursuant to paragraph (b) or other action. Any recorded financing
80 agreements at the time of deauthorization shall continue, except as otherwise provided herein.
81 (5) An authorized program administrator may contract with one or more third-party
82 administrators to implement the program as provided herein.
83 (6) An authorized program administrator may levy betterment assessments to facilitate
84 repayment of financing qualifying improvements. Costs incurred by the program administrator
85 for such purpose may be collected as a betterment assessment.
86 (7) In accordance with Chapter 80, betterment assessments levied pursuant to this section
87 and the interest, fees and any penalties thereon shall constitute a lien against the qualifying
88 residential property until they are paid, notwithstanding the provisions of section 12 of chapter
89 80, and shall continue notwithstanding any alienation or conveyance of the qualifying residential
90 property by one property owner to a new property owner. Betterment assessments have fixed
91 interest rates based on market conditions and those rates are not capped by statutes or regulations
92 intended to cover the interest rates of unsecured, credit-based finance options, neither are they
93 limited by restrictions on other betterment financings. A new property owner shall take title to
94 the qualifying residential property subject to the betterment assessment and related lien. The lien
95 shall be levied and collected in the same manner as the property taxes of the participating
96 municipality on real property, including, in the event of default or delinquency, with respect to
97 any penalties, fees and lien priorities. Each lien may be continued, recorded and released upon
98 repayment in full of the betterment assessment in the manner provided for property tax liens.
99 Each lien shall take precedence over all other liens or encumbrances, except a lien for taxes of
5 of 17
100 the municipality on real property. If a lien for property taxes of the municipality is foreclosed,
101 the betterment assessment lien shall be extinguished solely with regard to any installments that
102 were due and owing on the date of foreclosure of such tax lien, but the betterment assessment
103 lien shall otherwise survive the foreclosure. To the extent betterment assessments are paid in
104 installments and any such installment is not paid when due, the betterment assessment lien may
105 be foreclosed to the extent of any unpaid installment payments and any penalties, interest and
106 fees related thereto. In the event such betterment assessment lien is foreclosed, such lien shall
107 survive the foreclosure to the extent of any unpaid installment payments of the betterment
108 assessment secured by such lien that were not the subject of such foreclosure.
109 (8) A program administrator may incur debt for the purpose of providing financing for
110 qualifying improvements, which debt is payable from revenues received from the improved
111 property or any other available revenue source authorized by law.
112 (b) The owner of record of the residential property within the jurisdiction of an
113 authorized program may apply to the authorized program administrator to finance a qualifying
114 improvement. The program administrator may only enter into a financing agreement with the
115 property owner.

117 must make each of the following findings based on a review of public records derived from a
118 commercially accepted source and the property owner’s statements, records, and credit reports:

120 does not exceed 20 percent of the fair market value of the property as determined by customary
121 methods; (2)the financing agreement does not utilize a negative amortization schedule, a balloon
6 of 17
122 payment, or prepayment fees or fines other than nominal administrative costs; (3) capitalized
123 interest included in the original balance of the assessment financing agreement does not
124 constitute negative amortization; (4) all property taxes and any other assessments, including

130 on the residential property; (7) no notices of default or other evidence of property based debt
131 delinquency have been recorded and not released during the preceding 3 years or the property

133 debt on the residential property; (9) the property owner has not been subject to a bankruptcy

136 subject to an existing home equity conversion mortgage or reverse mortgage product; (11) the
137 term of the financing agreement does not exceed the weighted average useful life of the qualified

140 life of a qualifying improvement using established standards, including certification criteria from
141 government agencies or nationally recognized standards and testing organizations; (13) the total
142 estimated annual payment amount for all betterment assessments entered into under this section
143 on the residential property does not exceed 10 percent of the property owner’s annual household
144 income; (14) income must be confirmed using reasonable evidence and not solely by a property
7 of 17
145 owner’s statement; and (15) if the qualifying improvement is for the conversion of an onsite
146 sewage treatment and disposal system to a central sewerage system, the property owner has
147 utilized all available local government funding for such conversions and is unable to obtain
148 financing for the improvement on more favorable terms through a local government program
149 designed to support such conversions.
150 (b) A property owner and the program administrator may agree to include in the
151 financing agreement provisions for allowing change orders necessary to complete the qualifying
152 improvement. Any financing agreement or contract for qualifying improvements which includes
153 such provisions must meet the requirements of this paragraph. If a proposed change order on a
154 qualifying improvement will increase the original cost of the qualifying improvement by 20
155 percent or more or will expand the scope of the qualifying improvement by more than 20
156 percent, before the change order may be executed which would result in an increase in the
157 amount financed through the program administrator for the qualifying improvement, the program
158 administrator must notify the property owner, provide an updated written disclosure form as
159 described in section 4 to the property owner, and obtain written approval of the change from the
160 property owner.
161 (c) A financing agreement may not be entered into if the total cost of the qualifying
162 improvement, including program fees and interest, is less than $5,000.

190 result in penalties, fees, including attorney fees, court costs, and the issuance of a tax certificate
191 that could result in the property owner losing the property and a judgment against the property
192 owner, and may affect the property owner’s credit rating.
193 (b) Prior to the financing agreement being approved, the program administrator must
194 conduct an oral, recorded telephone call with the property owner during which the program
195 administrator must confirm each finding or disclosure required in section 3 and this section.
196 Section 5. At least 5 business days before entering into a financing agreement, the
197 property owner must provide to the holders or loan servicers of any existing mortgages

200 including the amount of any fees and interest, and the maximum annual assessment necessary to
201 repay the total. A verified copy or other proof of such notice must be provided to the program
202 administrator. A provision in any agreement between a mortgagor or other lienholder and a
203 property owner, or otherwise now or hereafter binding upon a property owner, which allows for
204 acceleration of payment of the mortgage, note, or lien or other unilateral modification solely as a
205 result of entering into a financing agreement as provided for in this section is unenforceable. This

214 administrator within 10 business days after execution of the agreement and the 3-day
215 cancellation period. A notice of lien for the full amount of the financing may be recorded in the
216 public records of the county where the property is located. Such lien is not enforceable in a
217 manner that results in the acceleration of the remaining nondelinquent unpaid balance under the
218 assessment financing agreement.
219 Section 8. At or before the time a seller executes a contract for the sale of any residential
220 property for which a betterment assessment has been levied under this section and has an unpaid
221 balance due, the seller shall give the prospective purchaser a written disclosure statement in the
222 following form, which must be set forth in the contract or in a separate writing:

226 property. You are encouraged to contact the property appraiser’s office to learn more about this
227 and other assessments that may be provided by law.
228 Section 9. Before disbursing any funds to a qualifying improvement contractor for a

266 betterment assessments.
267 The program administrator must include in any contract with the third-party administrator
268 the right to perform annual reviews of the administrator to confirm compliance with the

274 assistance program; (2)that qualifying improvements are free or provided at no cost, or that the
13 of 17
275 financing related to a betterment assessment authorized under the provisions of this legislation is
276 free or provided at no cost; or (3) that the financing of a qualifying improvement using the
277 program authorized pursuant to this legislation does not require repayment of the financial
278 obligation.

280 improvement contractor, or third-party administrator may not (1) make any representation as to
281 the tax deductibility of a betterment assessment; (2) provide to a qualifying improvement
282 contractor any information that discloses the amount of financing for which a property owner is

63 participating municipality by a majority vote of the city or town council, by a majority vote of
64 the board of selectmen or by resolution of its legislative body, as may be appropriate, pursuant to
65 which the municipality shall assess, collect, remit and assign betterment assessments, in return
66 for qualifying improvements for a benefitted property owner located within such municipality
67 and for costs reasonably incurred in performing such acts.
68 (2) A program administrator may only offer a program for financing qualifying
69 improvements to residential property within the jurisdiction of a municipality if the municipality
70 has authorized the program administrator to administer the program for financing qualifying
71 improvements to residential property by a majority vote of the city or town council, by a
72 majority vote of the board of selectmen or by resolution of its legislative body, as may be
73 appropriate. The authorized program must, at a minimum, meet the requirements of this section.
74 (3) Pursuant to this section or as otherwise provided by law, a municipality may enter
75 into an interlocal agreement providing for a partnership between one or more municipalities for
76 the purpose of facilitating a program to finance qualifying improvements to residential property
77 located within the jurisdiction of the municipalities that are party to the agreement.
4 of 17

78 (4) A municipality may deauthorize a program administrator through repeal of the vote
79 or the resolution adopted pursuant to paragraph (b) or other action. Any recorded financing
80 agreements at the time of deauthorization shall continue, except as otherwise provided herein.
81 (5) An authorized program administrator may contract with one or more third-party
82 administrators to implement the program as provided herein.
83 (6) An authorized program administrator may levy betterment assessments to facilitate
84 repayment of financing qualifying improvements. Costs incurred by the program administrator
85 for such purpose may be collected as a betterment assessment.
86 (7) In accordance with Chapter 80, betterment assessments levied pursuant to this section
87 and the interest, fees and any penalties thereon shall constitute a lien against the qualifying
88 residential property until they are paid, notwithstanding the provisions of section 12 of chapter
89 80, and shall continue notwithstanding any alienation or conveyance of the qualifying residential
90 property by one property owner to a new property owner. Betterment assessments have fixed
91 interest rates based on market conditions and those rates are not capped by statutes or regulations
92 intended to cover the interest rates of unsecured, credit-based finance options, neither are they
93 limited by restrictions on other betterment financings. A new property owner shall take title to
94 the qualifying residential property subject to the betterment assessment and related lien. The lien
95 shall be levied and collected in the same manner as the property taxes of the participating
96 municipality on real property, including, in the event of default or delinquency, with respect to
97 any penalties, fees and lien priorities. Each lien may be continued, recorded and released upon
98 repayment in full of the betterment assessment in the manner provided for property tax liens.
99 Each lien shall take precedence over all other liens or encumbrances, except a lien for taxes of
5 of 17

100 the municipality on real property. If a lien for property taxes of the municipality is foreclosed,
101 the betterment assessment lien shall be extinguished solely with regard to any installments that
102 were due and owing on the date of foreclosure of such tax lien, but the betterment assessment
103 lien shall otherwise survive the foreclosure. To the extent betterment assessments are paid in
104 installments and any such installment is not paid when due, the betterment assessment lien may
105 be foreclosed to the extent of any unpaid installment payments and any penalties, interest and
106 fees related thereto. In the event such betterment assessment lien is foreclosed, such lien shall
107 survive the foreclosure to the extent of any unpaid installment payments of the betterment
108 assessment secured by such lien that were not the subject of such foreclosure.
109 (8) A program administrator may incur debt for the purpose of providing financing for
110 qualifying improvements, which debt is payable from revenues received from the improved
111 property or any other available revenue source authorized by law.
112 (b) The owner of record of the residential property within the jurisdiction of an
113 authorized program may apply to the authorized program administrator to finance a qualifying
114 improvement. The program administrator may only enter into a financing agreement with the
115 property owner.
116 Section 3. (a) Before entering into a financing agreement, the program administrator
117 must make each of the following findings based on a review of public records derived from a
118 commercially accepted source and the property owner’s statements, records, and credit reports:
119 (1) he total amount of any betterment assessment for a residential property under this section
120 does not exceed 20 percent of the fair market value of the property as determined by customary
121 methods; (2)the financing agreement does not utilize a negative amortization schedule, a balloon
6 of 17

122 payment, or prepayment fees or fines other than nominal administrative costs; (3) capitalized
123 interest included in the original balance of the assessment financing agreement does not
124 constitute negative amortization; (4) all property taxes and any other assessments, including

128 violations issued by a municipality, unless the qualifying improvement will remedy the zoning or
129 code violation; (6) there are no involuntary liens, including, but not limited to, construction liens
130 on the residential property; (7) no notices of default or other evidence of property based debt
131 delinquency have been recorded and not released during the preceding 3 years or the property
132 owner’s period of ownership, whichever is less; (8) the property owner is current on all mortgage
133 debt on the residential property; (9) the property owner has not been subject to a bankruptcy
134 proceeding within the last 5 years unless it was discharged or dismissed more than 2 years before

136 subject to an existing home equity conversion mortgage or reverse mortgage product; (11) the
137 term of the financing agreement does not exceed the weighted average useful life of the qualified
138 improvements to which the greatest portion of funds disbursed under the assessment contract is

140 life of a qualifying improvement using established standards, including certification criteria from
141 government agencies or nationally recognized standards and testing organizations; (13) the total
142 estimated annual payment amount for all betterment assessments entered into under this section
143 on the residential property does not exceed 10 percent of the property owner’s annual household
144 income; (14) income must be confirmed using reasonable evidence and not solely by a property
7 of 17

145 owner’s statement; and (15) if the qualifying improvement is for the conversion of an onsite
146 sewage treatment and disposal system to a central sewerage system, the property owner has
147 utilized all available local government funding for such conversions and is unable to obtain
148 financing for the improvement on more favorable terms through a local government program
149 designed to support such conversions.
150 (b) A property owner and the program administrator may agree to include in the
151 financing agreement provisions for allowing change orders necessary to complete the qualifying
152 improvement. Any financing agreement or contract for qualifying improvements which includes
153 such provisions must meet the requirements of this paragraph. If a proposed change order on a
154 qualifying improvement will increase the original cost of the qualifying improvement by 20
155 percent or more or will expand the scope of the qualifying improvement by more than 20
156 percent, before the change order may be executed which would result in an increase in the
157 amount financed through the program administrator for the qualifying improvement, the program
158 administrator must notify the property owner, provide an updated written disclosure form as
159 described in section 4 to the property owner, and obtain written approval of the change from the
160 property owner.
161 (c) A financing agreement may not be entered into if the total cost of the qualifying
162 improvement, including program fees and interest, is less than $5,000.

164 buildings or facilities under new construction or construction for which a certificate of
165 occupancy or similar evidence of substantial completion of new construction or improvement has
166 not been issued.
8 of 17

167 Section 4. (a) In addition to the requirements of sections 3 and 4 , a financing agreement
168 may not be executed unless the program administrator first provides, including via electronic
169 means, a written financing estimate and disclosure to the property owner which includes all of

180 agreement may be canceled within 3 business days after signing the financing agreement without

189 not reduce the assessment amount; and (14) a disclosure that failure to pay the assessment may
9 of 17

190 result in penalties, fees, including attorney fees, court costs, and the issuance of a tax certificate
191 that could result in the property owner losing the property and a judgment against the property
192 owner, and may affect the property owner’s credit rating.
193 (b) Prior to the financing agreement being approved, the program administrator must
194 conduct an oral, recorded telephone call with the property owner during which the program
195 administrator must confirm each finding or disclosure required in section 3 and this section.
196 Section 5. At least 5 business days before entering into a financing agreement, the
197 property owner must provide to the holders or loan servicers of any existing mortgages

200 including the amount of any fees and interest, and the maximum annual assessment necessary to
201 repay the total. A verified copy or other proof of such notice must be provided to the program
202 administrator. A provision in any agreement between a mortgagor or other lienholder and a
203 property owner, or otherwise now or hereafter binding upon a property owner, which allows for
204 acceleration of payment of the mortgage, note, or lien or other unilateral modification solely as a
205 result of entering into a financing agreement as provided for in this section is unenforceable. This
206 subsection does not limit the authority of the holder or loan servicer to increase the required
207 monthly escrow by an amount necessary to pay the annual assessment.

213 records of the municipality within which the residential property is located by the program
214 administrator within 10 business days after execution of the agreement and the 3-day
215 cancellation period. A notice of lien for the full amount of the financing may be recorded in the
216 public records of the county where the property is located. Such lien is not enforceable in a
217 manner that results in the acceleration of the remaining nondelinquent unpaid balance under the
218 assessment financing agreement.
219 Section 8. At or before the time a seller executes a contract for the sale of any residential
220 property for which a betterment assessment has been levied under this section and has an unpaid
221 balance due, the seller shall give the prospective purchaser a written disclosure statement in the
222 following form, which must be set forth in the contract or in a separate writing:

226 property. You are encouraged to contact the property appraiser’s office to learn more about this
227 and other assessments that may be provided by law.
228 Section 9. Before disbursing any funds to a qualifying improvement contractor for a

262 party administrator for itself or for another program administrator.
263 (c) The contract must provide for the entity to administer the program according to the
264 requirements set forth herein and the terms of the vote or resolution by which the municipality
265 authorized the program. However, only the program administrator may levy or administer
266 betterment assessments.
267 The program administrator must include in any contract with the third-party administrator
268 the right to perform annual reviews of the administrator to confirm compliance with the
269 requirements set forth herein, the terms of the vote or resolution by which the municipality
270 authorized the program, and the contract with the program administrator.

272 qualifying improvement contractor, or third-party administrator may not suggest or imply: (1)
273 that a betterment assessment authorized under the provisions of this legislation is a government
274 assistance program; (2)that qualifying improvements are free or provided at no cost, or that the
13 of 17

275 financing related to a betterment assessment authorized under the provisions of this legislation is
276 free or provided at no cost; or (3) that the financing of a qualifying improvement using the
277 program authorized pursuant to this legislation does not require repayment of the financial
278 obligation.

280 improvement contractor, or third-party administrator may not (1) make any representation as to
281 the tax deductibility of a betterment assessment; (2) provide to a qualifying improvement
282 contractor any information that discloses the amount of financing for which a property owner is

330 property owner may retain any chattel or fixtures provided pursuant to a contract deemed
331 unenforceable under this section.
332 (e) A contract that is otherwise unenforceable under this section remains enforceable if
333 the property owner waives his or her right to cancel the contract or cancels the financing
334 agreement pursuant to the provisions of this legislation, but allows the qualifying improvement
335 contractor to proceed with the installation of the qualifying improvement.
336 Section 14. (a) Each program administrator that is authorized to administer a program for
337 financing qualifying improvements to residential property under the provisions of this
338 legislation shall post on its website an annual report within 45 days after the end of its fiscal year
