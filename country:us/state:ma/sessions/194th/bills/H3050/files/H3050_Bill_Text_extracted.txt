19 surcharge.
20 “Transportation project”, a project or program involving the planning, design or
21 construction of public or mass transportation transit systems, transit-oriented development,
22 roads, bridges, bikeways, pedestrian pathways, and other transportation-related projects.
23 Section 2. (a) This chapter shall take effect in any city or town upon the approval of its
24 governing body and its acceptance by the voters of any city or town by a ballot question as set
25 forth in section 3.
26 (b) A city or town may impose any tax surcharge within its city or town on a single
27 subject of taxation subject only to the condition that such tax is a surcharge on a tax then
28 authorized by state law; provided, however, that no tax surcharge shall be imposed within the
29 city or town unless it has first been approved by the governing body of such city and town and

10 of 14
206 from the fund shall be limited to implementing the recommendations of the transportation
207 committees, to providing administrative and operating expenses to the committees, and in
208 accordance with the ballot initiative. The city or town, or the municipality treasurer or regional

214 separate fund, to be known as the Massachusetts local and regional transportation trust fund, for
215 the benefit of cities, towns, or districts that have accepted the provisions of this chapter and have
216 imposed a tax surcharge on a tax collected by the commonwealth, subject to any exemptions
217 adopted by a municipality or district. The fund shall consist of all revenues received by the

221 law.
222 (b) The state treasurer shall deposit revenues received by any such tax surcharge into the
223 fund in accordance with section 9 in such manner as will secure the highest interest rate available
224 consistent with the safety of the fund and with the requirement that all amounts on deposit be
225 available for withdrawal without penalty for such withdrawal at any time. All interest accrued
226 and earnings shall be deposited into the fund. The fund shall be administered in a manner to
227 separately account for revenues raised by each city, town, or district, shall be held for the benefit
11 of 14
228 of such city, town, or district, and expenditures from the fund shall be made solely administration

232 without further appropriation, as directed by the commissioner of revenue in accordance with
233 section 9. The department of revenue shall report by source all amounts credited to said fund and
234 all expenditures from said fund. The commissioner of revenue shall assign personnel of the
235 department as it may need to administer and manage the fund disbursements and any expense
236 incurred by the department shall be deemed an operating and administrative expense of the
237 program. The operating and administrative expenses shall not exceed 5 percent of the annual
238 total revenue deposited into the fund.
239 Section 9. (a) All sums received by the commissioner under this chapter shall, not less
240 than quarterly, be distributed, credited, and paid by the state treasurer upon certification of the
241 commissioner to each city or town or the municipality treasurer or regional planning agency of
242 the district and notified the commissioner of their acceptance.
243 (b) The state treasurer, upon certification of the commissioner, shall distribute the funds
244 to the city or town, or the municipality treasurer or regional planning agency of the district based
245 on the proportional amount the city, town or district has raised by imposing the surcharge. The
246 total distribution of funds shall include all sources of revenue raised in the previous year as set
247 forth in subsection (a) of section 8, less not more than 5 per cent of the annual total revenue of
248 the fund, as set forth in subsection (c) of section 8. Any city, town or district seeking to dispute
249 the commissioner's calculation of its distribution under this subsection shall notify the
12 of 14
250 commissioner, in writing, not later than 1 year from the date the tax was distributed by the
251 commissioner to the city, town or district.
252 (c) The commissioner shall be prohibited from diverting revenues derived from the tax
253 surcharge into any other fund created by law.
254 (d) Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary, the commissioner may make available
255 to cities, towns and districts any information necessary for administration of the tax surcharge
256 imposed by this chapter including, but not limited to, a report of the amount of the surcharge on
257 tax collected in the aggregate by each city, town or district under this chapter in the preceding
258 fiscal year, and the identification of each individual vendor collecting the surcharge on sales tax
259 collected under this chapter.
260 Section 10. (a) At any time after imposition of the tax surcharge, the governing body of
261 each city or town may approve and the voters may accept an amendment to the amount and
262 computation of the tax surcharge in the same manner and subject to the same requirements set
263 forth in this chapter.
264 (b) At any time after imposition of the tax surcharge, a district under section 4, with the
265 approval of the majority of voters in the district may accept an amendment to the amount and
266 computation of the tax surcharge in the same manner and subject to the same requirements set
267 forth in this chapter so that the surcharge becomes uniform in all municipalities of the district.
268 Section 11. The commissioner of revenue shall promulgate rules and regulations to
269 implement this chapter.
13 of 14
270 SECTION 12. The regulations required by section 11 of chapter 64O of the General
271 Laws shall be promulgated not later than 1 year after the effective date of this act.
