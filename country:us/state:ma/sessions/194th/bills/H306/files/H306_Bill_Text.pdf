164 marketability of title, and appraisal contingencies;
165 (iv) the earnest money deposit shall be refundable for not less than 90 days from the date
166 of execution of the purchase contract or such greater period as provided for in the third-party

169 refundable for an additional period of one day for every day beyond 30 days that the owner has
170 not complied with the provisions of subsection (5) (ii) above. After the expiration of the
171 specified time period, the earnest money deposit shall become non-refundable but shall continue
172 to be a deposit toward the full purchase price; and
173 (v) real estate broker commissions or fees that are associated with the third-party
174 purchase transaction shall be payable upon the closing of the purchase.

179 its Designee. The 160 day period may be extended by agreement of both parties.
180 (7) If the Tenant Association, its Designee or Successor, do not exercise their purchase

193 regulations necessary for enforcement. The Department shall provide municipalities with sample

10 of 18

204 (2) No mortgagee may accept any third-party offers or deem the owner's application for

206 approved by the attorney general demonstrating that the tenants of the commercial or mixed-use
207 property have been informed of the owner's intent to seek a short-sale or deed in lieu and the
208 tenants have had the opportunity to express their interest in exercising a right of first refusal
209 within 60 days or the opportunity to assigned their right of first refusal, or the tenants have
210 waived those rights. If tenants have not affirmatively expressed their interest in exercising a right
211 of first refusal or in assigning that right within 60 days, or have not affirmatively waived that
212 right within 60 days, the tenants' rights are deemed waived.
213 (3) Before a commercial or mixed-use property may be transferred by short-sale or deed-
214 in-lieu, the owner shall notify each tenant, with a simultaneous copy to the attorney general and
215 the municipality adopting this section, by regular and certified mail, of any bona fide offer that
216 the mortgagee intends to accept. Before any short-sale or transfer by deed-in-lieu, the owner
217 shall give each tenant such a notice of the offer only if non-residential units constituting at least
218 51 per cent of the non-residential units occupying the commercial or mixed-use property notify
219 the owner, in writing, that they collectively desire to receive information relating to the proposed
220 sale. Tenants may indicate this desire within the same notice described in paragraph (2). Any
221 notice of the offer required to be given under this subsection shall include the price, calculated as
222 a single lump sum amount and of any promissory notes offered in lieu of cash payment.
223 (4) A Tenant Association representing at least 51 per cent of the non-residential units
224 occupying the commercial or mixed-use property that are entitled to notice under the preceding

238 closing on a purchase and sale with tenants who have made a bona fide offer to meet the price
239 and substantially equivalent terms and conditions of an offer for which notice is required to be
240 given pursuant to paragraph (3). Failure of the tenants to submit such a purchase and sale
241 agreement within the first 60-day period, to obtain a binding commitment for financing within
242 the additional 90-day period or to close on the purchase within the second 90-day period, shall
243 serve to terminate the rights of such tenants to purchase. The time periods herein provided may
244 be extended by agreement. Nothing herein shall be construed to require an owner to provide
245 financing to such tenants. A Tenant Association that has the right to purchase hereunder, at its

251 use property as permanently affordable rental commercial property.
252 (5) The right of first refusal created herein shall inure to the tenants for the time periods
253 hereinbefore provided, beginning on the date of notice to the tenants under paragraph (1). The
254 effective period for such right of first refusal shall begin anew for each different offer to
255 purchase that the mortgagee intends to accept. The right of first refusal shall not apply with
256 respect to any offer received by the owner for which a notice is not required pursuant to said
257 paragraph (3).
258 (6) In any instance where the tenants are not the successful purchaser of the commercial
259 or mixed-use property, the mortgagee shall provide evidence of compliance with this section by
260 filing an affidavit of compliance with the attorney general, , and the registry of deeds for the
261 county and district where the property is located within 7 days of the sale.
262 (7) The attorney general shall enforce this subsection (e) and shall promulgate rules and
263 regulations necessary for enforcement. The attorney general may seek injunctive, declaratory,
264 and compensatory relief on behalf of tenants and the Commonwealth in a court of competent
265 jurisdiction. The attorney general shall post a sample intent to sell notice, sample proof of notice
266 to tenants, sample notice of offer, and other necessary documents.
267 (f) Foreclosures. In any city or town that adopts the provisions of this Section:
268 (1) When a mortgagee seeks to foreclose, the mortgagee shall provide copies of all

270 foreclosure law, , by regular and certified mail to the tenants of the commercial or mixed-use
13 of 18

271 property and to the municipality adopting this Section. The mortgagee shall also provide tenants
272 and the municipality, by regular and certified mail, with a copy of any Complaint filed in Land

276 by regular and certified mail, a copy of any and all Notices of Sale published pursuant to Section
277 14 of chapter 244. (3) No later than 5 business days before the foreclosure auction of a
278 commercial or mixed-use property, the tenants shall inform the mortgagee, in writing, if a
279 Tenants Association representing at least fifty-one percent of the non-residential units occupying
280 the commercial or mixed-use property or an entity to which they have assigned their right of first
281 refusal intend to exercise their right of first refusal at auction and desire to receive information
282 relating to the proposed auction.
283 (4) A Tenants Association representing at least fifty-one percent of the non-residential
284 units occupying the commercial or mixed-use property or their assignee may exercise their
285 collective right to purchase the commercial or mixed-use property, in the event of a third-party
286 offer at auction that the mortgagee receives, provided that the Tenants Association
287 (i) submits to the mortgagee reasonable evidence that the tenants of at least fifty-one
288 percent of the occupied units in the commercial or mixed-use property have approved the
289 purchase of the commercial or mixed-use property,
290 (ii) submits to the mortgagee a proposed purchase and sale agreement on substantially
291 equivalent terms and conditions to that received by the mortgagee in the third-party offer within

300 Failure of the tenants to submit such a purchase and sale agreement within the first sixty day
301 period, to obtain a binding commitment for financing within the additional ninety day period or
302 to close on the purchase within the second ninety-day period, shall serve to terminate the rights
303 of such tenants to purchase. The time periods herein provided may be extended by agreement.
304 Nothing herein shall be construed to require a mortgagee to provide financing to such
305 tenants. A Tenant Association which has the right to purchase hereunder, at its election, may
306 assign its purchase right hereunder to the city, town, housing authority, or agency of the
307 commonwealth, nonprofit, community development corporation, affordable property developer,
308 or land trust; a right to purchase hereunder shall be for the purpose of maintaining the use of the
309 commercial or mixed-use property as permanently affordable rental commercial property.
310 If there are no third-party bids at auction for the commercial or mixed-use property, the
311 tenants shall have a right of first refusal whenever the mortgagee seeks to sell the commercial or
312 mixed-use property. The tenants shall be notified of any offers the mortgagee intends to accept
313 and shall be given an opportunity to meet the price and substantially the terms of a third-party
314 offer based on the same time line described in paragraph (4).

322 to tenants, sample notice of offer, and other necessary documents.
