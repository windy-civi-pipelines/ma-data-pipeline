An Act for a COVID-19 vaccination tax credit.
Whereas, The deferred operation of this act would tend to defeat its purpose, which is to
promote public health, therefore it is hereby declared to be an emergency law, necessary for the
immediate preservation of the public health.

of the same, as follows:
1 SECTION 1. The Massachusetts General Laws are hereby amended by inserting the
2 following new chapter:
3 Chapter of Massachusetts General Laws â€“ COVID-19 Vaccination Tax Credit
4 Section 1. An Act to create a COVID-19 Vaccination Tax Credit (VTC), under the Laws
5 of Massachusetts, providing for a Tax Credit, to certain qualified individuals, for specific
6 assistance in encouraging vaccination.
7 Section 2. It is in the interest of Public Health, and Public Safety, that as many residents
8 of Massachusetts, be vaccinated, as much, and as soon as it is possible, based on availability of
9 vaccine, and logistics to administer such vaccine; and vaccines relating to COVID.

10 Section 3. It being understandable, that many individuals, have realistic concern, about
11 the safety of vaccines, and should be encouraged to have the vaccines administered, as long as
12 the vaccines have been determined by scientific authorities, to be safe.
13 It is in the economic interests of all persons in Massachusetts, that as wide, an appropriate
14 vaccination campaign, can lead to a high percentage of vaccination of the population, that our
15 Commonwealth, may be freed, and/or reduced of the tyranny of COVID-19, in particular; so as
16 to improve the overall health of our people, and the strength of our economy.
17 Therefore, this legislation authorizes a COVID-19 Vaccination Tax Credit (VTC), of at
18 least $100, to each individual, who attaches to their Massachusetts Individual Income Tax, the
19 Medical Documentation, of having received the available, and required doses, of approved
20 COVID-19 vaccines.
