13 embarkation fee for the purpose of crediting the embarkation fee revenues in accordance with
14 this section.

16 25 per cent to a fire district that provides fire or public safety services to a port within a
17 city or town that provides ferry service;

20 62.5 per cent to a city or town which contains a port and provides ferry service.
21 (c) All sums received by the commissioner under this section as embarkation fees,

23 the state treasurer at least quarterly upon certification of the commissioner to each city, town, or

25 (d) Any city, town or fire district which is credited revenues pursuant to this section shall
26 deposit such funds in a special fund which shall be appropriated solely for operations to mitigate
27 the impacts of ferry service on the city, town or fire district including, but not limited to, harbor
28 services, public safety services, emergency services or infrastructure improvements within and
29 around the harbor of such city, town or fire district.
