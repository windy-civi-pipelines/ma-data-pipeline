28 annually, beginning January 1, 2018, under this section, together with section 31O of chapter 63,

30 eligibility for the credit, such criteria to be set forth in regulations promulgated under this
31 section.
32 (i) Any single municipality shall not be eligible to receive a more than fifty percent of the
33 total amount of awarded credits in a given calendar year.
34 (1) This restriction may be waived by the Secretary. Such a waiver must be made in

69 but, the carryover period shall not exceed 5 taxable years after the close of the taxable year
70 during which the qualified historic structure received final certification and was placed in service
71 as provided for in this section.
