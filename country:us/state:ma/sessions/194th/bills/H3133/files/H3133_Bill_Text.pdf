In the One Hundred and Ninety-Fourth General Court
(2025-2026)
_______________
An Act relative to a sewage line tax credit.
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives in General Court assembled, and by the authority
of the same, as follows:
1 Subsection (h) paragraph (2) of Section 6 of Chapter 62 of the General Laws, as so
2 appearing in the 2022 Official Edition, is hereby amended by adding after clause (i) the
3 following new clause:
4 (ii) Any owner of residential property located in the commonwealth who is not a
5 dependent of another taxpayer and who occupies said property as his principal residence, shall be
6 allowed a credit for expenditures for design and construction expenses for the connection to
7 newly installed municipal sewage lines. For the purposes of this clause a “newly installed”
8 sewage line shall mean sewage line installed by municipality in the year 2019 or later. Such
9 credit under this clause shall be equal to 40 per cent of said expenditure for connection to the
10 sewage line. Said expenditures shall be the actual cost to the taxpayer or $25,000, whichever is
1 of 2

11 less; provided, however, that said credit shall be available to eligible taxpayers beginning in the
12 tax year in which the repair or replacement of said cesspool or septic system was completed; and
13 provided, further, that said credit shall not exceed $4,000 in any tax year and any excess credit
14 may be applied over the following five subsequent tax years up to an aggregate maximum of
15 $10,000. The amount of any such credit shall be reduced by an amount equal to the total interest
16 subsidy or grant received from the commonwealth, whether directly or indirectly, toward the cost
17 of said expenditures. The department shall promulgate such rules and regulations as are
18 necessary to administer the credit afforded by this subsection, including, but not limited to, a
19 notification system by the commonwealth to recipients of said interest subsidy or grant of the
20 amount of the total subsidy provided by the commonwealth.
