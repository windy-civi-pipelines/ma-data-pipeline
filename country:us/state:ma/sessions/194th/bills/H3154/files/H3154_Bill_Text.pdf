13 (b) A food business that donates food, meals or crops grown, manufactured, packaged or
14 prepared by the food business in the commonwealth to a nonprofit food distribution organization
15 shall be allowed a non-refundable credit from its net taxable income for the taxable year of the
16 donation. The credit shall be equal to the fair market value of the food, meals or crops donated
17 by the business during the taxable year but not to exceed an aggregate credit of $25,000
18 annually.
19 (c) A credit shall be allowed under this section only if the donated food, meals or crops
20 are distributed or served by the donee nonprofit food distribution organization without charge or
21 at a charge sufficient only to cover the cost of handling such food; and are not (i) transferred for
22 use outside the commonwealth; (ii) used by the donee nonprofit food distribution organization as
23 consideration for services performed or personal property purchased; or (iii) sold by the donee

29 identify the donee nonprofit food distribution organization, the business donating food, the date
30 of the donation, the number of pounds of food donated and the fair market value of the food
31 donated. The certification shall also include a statement by the donee nonprofit food distribution
32 organization that its use and disposition of the food complies with the requirements under this

53 shall be liable for civil damages for any injury arising out of the condition of such food. Any

63 violation of regulations of the department of public health; or (iii) causes an injury arising out of
