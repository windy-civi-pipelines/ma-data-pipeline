6 affordable housing surcharge on real property at a rate up to, but not exceeding, 2 per cent of the

8 amount of the surcharge shall not be included in a calculation of total taxes assessed for purposes
9 of section 21C of chapter 59.
10 (b) This chapter shall only take effect upon approval by a two-thirds vote of the local
11 appropriating authority of the city or town, as defined by section 21C of chapter 59, and

17 receiving an exemption of real property under a clause of section 5 of chapter 59 specifically
18 listed in section 59 of chapter 59 shall be exempt from any surcharge on real property established
19 under this chapter. The surcharge to be paid by a taxpayer receiving any other exemption or
20 abatement of tax on real property authorized by chapter 59 or any other law shall be reduced in
21 proportion to the amount of such exemption or abatement.
22 (d) Any amount of the surcharge not paid by the due date shall bear interest at the rate per
23 annum provided in section 57 of chapter 59.

38 chapter shall be open for inspection only as provided in section 60 of chapter 59.

42 chapter 44 or special legislation.
43 (h) Upon acceptance of this chapter and upon the assessors' warrant to the tax collector,
44 the accepted surcharge shall be imposed.
45 (i) After receipt of the warrant, the tax collector shall collect the surcharge in the amount
46 and according to the computation specified in the warrant and shall pay the amounts so collected,
47 quarterly or semi-annually, according to the schedule for collection of property taxes for the tax
48 on real property, to the affordable housing trust. The tax collector shall cause appropriate books
49 and accounts to be kept with respect to the surcharge, which shall be subject to public
50 examination upon reasonable request.
