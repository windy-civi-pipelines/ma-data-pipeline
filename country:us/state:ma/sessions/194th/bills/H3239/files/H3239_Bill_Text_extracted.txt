5 executive officer of the city or town, may, on behalf of the city or town, enter into an agreement
6 with 1 or more cities or towns to form a regional board of assessors. The regional board of
7 assessors shall have all the powers and responsibilities outlined in general law for local boards of
8 assessors and will assume all the activities and undertakings of the local board of assessors for

12 the parties;
1 of 7
13 (ii) the financing of the joint undertaking;
14 (iii) the rights and responsibilities of the parties with respect to the direction and
15 supervision of the work to be performed and with respect to the administration of the regional
16 board of assessors office, including the receipt and disbursement of funds, the maintenance of
17 accounts and records and the auditing of accounts;
18 (iv) annual reports of the regional board of assessors to the constituent parties;
19 (v) the duration of the agreement and procedures for amendment, withdrawal or
20 termination thereof; and

22 of the city or town.
23 With the approval of the member cities and towns, the regional board of assessors may
24 appoint assistant assessors pursuant to section 25A of chapter 41. Member cities and towns may,
25 in their individual capacity, employ a local assessor and support staff who shall be responsible
26 for estimating the value of the real and personal estate for such city or town and who shall report
27 to the regional board of assessors. Otherwise, member cities and towns may permit the regional
28 board of assessors to hire a regional assessor or assessors and support staff who shall be
29 responsible for estimating the value of the real and personal estate in each such city or town and
30 who shall report to the regional board of assessors. A city or town may become a party to an
31 existing agreement with the approval of a majority of the other members.
32 An agreement under this section may also provide for the employment of necessary staff
33 to perform administrative functions. Any joint costs associated with the regional board of
2 of 7
34 assessors shall be identified in the agreement and subject to appropriation by each member city

41 the agreement shall pay a proportionate share of the current and future costs of benefits
42 associated with the appointment or employment of all persons performing services for them
43 during the duration of the agreement. A city or town who is a party to such an agreement shall
44 include employees under the agreement in such programs in accordance with the terms of the
45 agreement.

51 municipalities if so agreed and such an agreement shall provide for the appointment of such
52 additional board members. Any vacancies shall be filled by the applicable member municipality
53 forthwith, who may also appoint a temporary board member until such time that a permanent
54 replacement is appointed unless a different process is agreed to by all member municipalities.
