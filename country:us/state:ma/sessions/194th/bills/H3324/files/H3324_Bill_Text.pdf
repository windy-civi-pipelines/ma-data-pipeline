An Act authorizing the Division of Capital Asset Management and Maintenance to dispose of
certain parcels of land in the city of Brockton.
Whereas, The deferred operation of this act would tend to defeat its purpose, which is to
authorize forthwith the transfer of certain parcels of land for the purposes of providing affordable
housing and a multi-service facility, therefore it is hereby declared to be an emergency law,
necessary for the immediate preservation of the public convenience.
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives in General Court assembled, and by the authority
of the same, as follows:
1 SECTION 1. (a) As used in this act, the term “affordable housing”, shall mean the
2 development of multi-family housing, of which either: (i) not less than 25 per cent shall be
3 affordable to households with incomes at or below 80 per cent of the area median income,
4 adjusted for household size; or (ii) not less than 20 per cent shall be affordable to households
5 with incomes at or below 50 per cent of the area median income, adjusted for household size
6 with a restriction for affordable housing purposes.
7 (b) Notwithstanding sections 33 through 37, inclusive, of chapter 7C of the General
8 Laws, sections 121 to 123, inclusive, of chapter 150 of the acts of 2024 or any general or special

10 certain parcels of land located within the city of Brockton as set forth in subsection (c) to
11 Catholic Charitable Bureau of the Archdiocese of Boston, Inc. (“Catholic Charities Boston”), or
12 an affiliate of Catholic Charities Boston, for nominal consideration, solely for the purpose of
13 Catholic Charities Boston developing a community multi-services center in the city of Brockton
14 that includes the provision of affordable housing. The parcels shall be conveyed by deed without
15 warranties or representations by the commonwealth.

24 Boston pursuant to section 1 shall provide that the parcels shall be used solely to provide for

26 or instrument shall include a reversionary clause that stipulates that if the parcels cease at any
27 time to be used for those allowed purposes, title to the parcels shall, at the election of the
28 commonwealth, revert to the commonwealth and the reversionary clause shall be enforceable
29 notwithstanding the time limit set forth in section 7 of chapter 184A of the General Laws. The
30 reversionary clause shall contain provisions requiring that Catholic Charities Boston receive
2 of 4

31 reasonable notice of and a reasonable time to cure any allegation that the parcel is not being used
32 for the purposes set forth in this act.
33 (b) No agreement for the sale or other disposition of the parcels shall be valid unless
34 Catholic Charities Boston has executed and filed with the commissioner the statement required
35 by section 38 of chapter 7C of the General Laws.
36 SECTION 3. Catholic Charities Boston shall be responsible for all costs and expenses of
37 any transaction authorized by this act as determined by the commissioner of capital asset
