_______________
In the One Hundred and Ninety-Fourth General Court
(2025-2026)
_______________
An Act protecting transportation network driver data privacy and integrity.
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives in General Court assembled, and by the authority
of the same, as follows:
1 SECTION 1. Subsection (b)(1) of Section 4 of chapter 150F of the General Laws is
2 hereby amended by striking out the second sentence and inserting in place thereof the following
3 sentence:-
4 Since the obligation to negotiate in good faith includes an obligation to provide requested
5 information that relates to the bargaining process, it is also an unfair work practice for a certified
6 or recognized transportation network driver organization to refuse to provide information
7 requested by a transportation network company that is relevant to the bargaining process.
8 SECTION 2. Chapter 150F of the General Laws is hereby amended by adding the
9 following section:-
10 Section 13. Any record furnished to the board or other state agency by a transportation
11 network company pursuant to this chapter including, but not limited to, transportation network
12 driver records, shall not be considered a public record as defined in clause twenty-sixth of
1 of 3

13 section 7 of Chapter 4 or Chapter 66. Such records are confidential and shall not be disclosed by
14 the board or by any persons who may be authorized by the board to control or process them
15 solely for purposes of this chapter.
16 SECTION 3. The board, as defined by section 2 of Chapter 150F, shall promulgate
17 regulations to implement Chapter 150F no later than December 31, 2025. The board shall
18 implement such regulations no later than June 30, 2026. Chapter 150F shall take effect upon the
19 board’s implementation of the regulations required by this section. The regulations shall: (a)
20 establish the obligations and procedures for the board and transportation network driver
21 organizations to protect transportation network driver data from public disclosure and
22 unauthorized use, including: (i) minimization of data collected to what is necessary under
23 Chapter 150F; (ii) encryption standards adhering to recognized security protocols; (iii) access
24 controls to ensure that only authorized persons can view or process driver data; (iv) data
25 retention policy; (v) auditing and compliance monitoring; (vi) data breach protocol; (vii) driver
26 notification of data sharing; (viii) driver consent and driver opt-out of data sharing; and (ix)
27 limitations on data use; (x) limiting the disclosure of driver personal identifying information to
28 the confidential uses necessary to effectuate Chapter 150F and not for the purpose of enforcing
29 federal immigration law or provided to an agency that primarily enforces immigration law,
30 unless the Board is provided with a lawful court order or judicial warrant signed by a judge
31 appointed pursuant to Article III of the United States Constitution, a federal grand jury or trial
32 subpoena, or as otherwise required by federal law; (b) establish authorization card requirements,
33 including the specific form and content of authorization cards and authorization revocation cards,
34 receipt records, language access and limited English proficiency protections, authentication
35 standards for both electronic and non-electronic authorization cards, data security, submission
2 of 3

36 requirements, and the board’s audit review authority; (c) establish procedures for verifying
37 transportation network driver organization representation evidence; (d) establish procedures for
38 verifying that “active transportation network drivers,” as defined in section 2 of Chapter 150F,
39 includes only those independent contractors currently authorized to provide Transportation
40 Network Company services by the Transportation Network Company Division of the
41 Department of Public Utilities (DPU), who hold a current Background Check Clearance
42 Certificate, meet all safety and suitability standards required by DPU regulations, are affiliated
43 with an entity holding a current DPU permit, and use non-commercial vehicles to provide
44 transportation network company services; (e) establish how the median number of rides by
45 authorized transportation network drivers will be determined to set the quarterly active
46 transportation network driver thresholds; (f) establish the specific subjects of bargaining under
47 terms and conditions of work; (g) establish election procedures for exclusive bargaining
48 representations; specify how and when transportation network companies must share driver data
49 with transportation network driver organizations while protecting drivers’ privacy and complying
50 with data security laws; (h) establish complaint and grievance processes; (i) establish mediation
51 and arbitration rules; and (j) establish standards and procedures for board oversight of bargaining
52 agreements.
