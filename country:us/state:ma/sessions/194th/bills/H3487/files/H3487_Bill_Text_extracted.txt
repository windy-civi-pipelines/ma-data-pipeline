8 removal of double poles, investigate whether the current timeline for removing such poles is
9 reasonable and adequate, investigate how to address barriers to remove such poles, investigate

12 communication issues among all parties, unlicensed attachments on utility poles and
1 of 2
13 requirements that providers promptly register such attachments, the legal liability and potential
14 use of indemnification agreements to facilitate the removal of abandoned attachments, whether
15 or not certain costs may be recovered from ratepayers, and the promulgation of regulations by
16 the Department of Public Utilities and Department of Telecommunications and Cable to
17 effectively regulate double utility poles.
