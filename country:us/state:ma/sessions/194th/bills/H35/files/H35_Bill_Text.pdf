Mr. Steven T. James, House Clerk
Office of the Clerk of the House
State House, Room 145
Boston, MA 02133
Dear Mr. Clerk:
I am pleased to present for the consideration of the General Court the attached legislative
recommendations from the Office of the Treasurer and Receiver General, pursuant to the
provisions of section 33 of chapter 30 of the General Laws. These recommendations reaffirm my
commitment to protecting and enhancing Massachusetts’ strong financial standing, promoting
policies that support the long-term economic needs of working families and retirees, and
advocating for equitable access to capital for generations to come.
My recommendations proactively seek to modernize our governing statutes across our 13
departments. These reforms are aimed at updating outdated provisions, improving operational
efficiency, and enhancing the overall effectiveness of our services. In doing so, my office will be
better positioned to meet the economic needs of our constituents. We also endeavor to champion
policies that will ensure every individual can achieve their full economic potential. Collectively,
these recommendations reflect my commitment to fostering a more inclusive and financially
secure Massachusetts.
Building an economy that works for all, thereby strengthening the Massachusetts economy, is
foundational to the work I do. I believe the recommendations I am filing today would serve to do
just that, and I take this opportunity to respectfully request that the Legislature act on these matters:
1. An Act modernizing the Massachusetts alcohol laws
2. An Act authorizing charity alcohol auctions
3. An Act relative to treasury operations
4. An Act relative to the SMART Plan
5. An Act relative to the 401(k) CORE Plan
6. An Act expanding access to retirement savings

7. An Act relative to the Massachusetts State Employees Retirement System
8. An Act relative to the Massachusetts Turnpike Authority Employees’ Retirement System
9. An Act relative to non-Commonwealth entities
10.An Act updating judicial retirement benefits
11.An Act requiring financial education in schools
12.An Act establishing an Office of Economic Empowerment
13.An Act establishing a Massachusetts Baby Bonds program
14.An Act requiring public pension fund divestment from ammunition and firearms
15.An Act relative to the Veterans’ Bonus Division
The Treasurer’s Office has always been and will continue to be a partner and reliable resource for
the Legislature. Our successes are built on this collaborative effort. I would like to thank members
of the Legislature for our longstanding partnership, and I look forward to working with you all
now and in the future as we work to enrich the lives of every resident in Massachusetts.
Sincerely,
Deborah B. Goldberg
Treasurer & Receiver General
