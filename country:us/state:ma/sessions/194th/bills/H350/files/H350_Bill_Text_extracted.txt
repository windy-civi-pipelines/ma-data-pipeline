19 (b) A retailer offering for sale any private or control label brand shall disclose in writing
20 to its customers where the product is displayed, both in-store as well as in any solicitation,
21 advertising or online offering or promotion, that the private or control label brand is the retailer’s
22 private or control label brand. Such disclosure shall be clear and conspicuous.
23 A private or control label brand shall not contain any statement, design, device, or
24 pictorial representation, including, but not limited to, bottle design, trade dress, packaging, or
