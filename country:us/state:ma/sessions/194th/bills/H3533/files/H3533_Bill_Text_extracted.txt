An Act for field safety in gas infrastructure.
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives in General Court assembled, and by the authority
of the same, as follows:
1 SECTION 1. Chapter 164 of the General Laws is hereby amended by striking section
2 144, as appearing in the 2016 Official Edition, and inserting in its place the following:
3 Section 144. (a) There shall be uniform natural gas leaks classification for all gas
4 companies.
5 (b)(1) Gas companies shall assess a grade to all reported natural gas leaks based on the
6 system provided in this section.
7 (2) A Grade 1 leak shall be a leak that represents an existing or probable hazard to
8 persons or property. Grade 1 leaks require repair as immediately as possible and continuous
9 action until the conditions are no longer hazardous. The gas company shall immediately schedule
10 a completion of repairs and the condition shall be kept under continuous surveillance until the
1 of 10
11 hazard or source of the leak is eliminated. Whenever appropriate and feasible, a gas company
12 shall notify the fire department and chief law enforcement officer in each city or town where a
13 Grade 1 leak is identified.
14 (3) A Grade 2 leak shall be a leak that is recognized as non-hazardous to persons or
15 property at the time of detection, but justifies scheduled repair based on probable future hazard.
16 The gas company shall repair Grade 2 leaks or replace the main within 6 months from the date
17 the leak was classified; provided, however, that said repair or replacement may take place later
18 than six months from the date the leak is classified, but no later than 12 months from the date the
19 leak is classified, if any required permits for such repair or replacement are temporarily withheld
20 consistent with a seasonal moratorium. All Grade 2 leaks shall be reevaluated by a gas company
21 at least once every 6 months until eliminated; provided, however, that the frequency of
22 reevaluation shall be determined by the location and magnitude of the leakage condition.
23 (4) A Grade 3 leak shall be a leak that is recognized as non-hazardous to persons or
24 property at the time of detection and can be reasonably expected to remain non-hazardous. The
25 gas company shall reevaluate Grade 3 leaks during the next scheduled survey, or within 12
26 months from the date last evaluated, whichever occurs first, until the leak is eliminated or the
27 main is replaced. A municipal or state public safety official may request a reevaluation of a
28 Grade 3 leak prior to the next scheduled survey, or sooner than 12 months of the date last
29 evaluated, if the official reasonably believes that the Grade 3 leak poses a threat to public safety.
30 (c)(1) Upon the undertaking of a significant project on a public way exposing confirmed
31 natural gas infrastructure, and with sufficient notice, a municipality or the commonwealth shall
32 submit written notification of the project to a gas company. The gas company shall survey the
2 of 10
33 project area for the presence of Grade 1 or Grade 2 leaks and set repair and replacement
34 schedules for all known or newly detected Grade 1 or Grade 2 leaks. The gas company shall
35 ensure that any shut off valve in the significant project area has a gate box installed upon it or a
36 reasonable alternative that would otherwise ensure continued public safety and that any critical
37 valve that has not been inspected and tested within the past 12 months is verified to be
38 operational and accessible. The gas company shall provide the repair and replacement schedule
39 of gas leaks to the municipality or the commonwealth.
40 (2) Upon the undertaking of any planned project involving excavation for purposes of
41 performing maintenance on or construction involving any gas mains or services by gas company
42 employees, or any blasting work, the gas company shall ensure that its employees first locate and
43 identify and mark all gas gates and valves, and verify that all are cleared, operational and
44 accessible in clear sight at ground level in advance of any excavation; and that said gas gates and
45 valves are left cleared, and operational following any such project.
46 (3) The gas company shall ensure that any shut off valve in the significant project area
47 has a gate box installed upon it by its employees to ensure continued public safety.
48 (4) Failure to undertake verification that gas gates and valves have been cleared, and are
49 both operational and accessible prior to the start of and following an excavation, or blasting
50 work, shall be subject to a fine of up to $10,000.
51 (d) Gas companies shall prioritize any pipeline repairs required under this section for gas
52 leaks detected within a school zone. For the purposes of this section, ''school zone'' shall mean on
53 or within 50 feet of the real property comprising a public or private accredited preschool,
54 accredited Head Start facility, elementary, vocational or secondary school.
3 of 10
55 (e) As part of the annual service quality standards report required by section 1I, each gas
56 company shall report to the department the location of each Grade 1, Grade 2 and Grade 3 leak
57 existing as of the date of the report, the date each Grade 1, Grade 2 and Grade 3 leak was
58 classified and the dates of repairs performed on each Grade 1, Grade 2 and Grade 3 leak. A gas
59 company shall specify any reclassification of previously identified leaks in its annual report. Gas
60 leak information shall be made available to any municipal or state public safety official upon
61 written request to the department.
62 (f) The department shall promulgate regulations necessary to implement the uniform
63 natural gas leak classifications as specified in this section and shall oversee and monitor
64 company response and reporting.
65 (g) Each LDC will maintain an accurate and timely record of any Grade 3 leaks that,
66 upon re-inspection, are upgraded to a Grade 1 or 2 leak. The DPU shall establish a service
67 quality metric for the same, and each LDC will report any upgrades of Grade 3 leaks to the DPU
68 on a monthly basis.
69 (h) As a condition of receiving Chapter 90 funding for any project on a public way, a gas
70 LDC shall undertake an inspection of the areas surrounding the gas infrastructure through a
71 mobile survey to determine whether any gas leaks exist prior to embarking on the road project.
72 (i) The DPU shall promulgate regulations establishing requirements for the maintenance,
73 timely updating, accuracy, and security of gas LDC maps and records. Such regulations shall be
74 promulgated and implemented no later than January 1, 2026.
75 (j) Disruptions in the provision of electronic data, including but not limited to, maps and
76 records relevant to inspections, maintenance, repairs, and construction to its in-house workforce
