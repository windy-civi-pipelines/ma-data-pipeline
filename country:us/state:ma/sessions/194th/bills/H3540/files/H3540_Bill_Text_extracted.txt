8 communities designated by the undersecretary for inclusion based on previously developed
9 criteria. The undersecretary, in consultation with a defined working group of environmental

28 the definition and framework shall detail the amount and allocation of said benefits, and identify
29 any barriers to participation as well as any measures to reduce said barriers, including but not
30 limited to community organization partnerships, streamlined application processes, multilingual
31 options, and no-cost or low cost financing.The level of benefits shall be reviewed and updated
32 every 5 years beginning in 2025. The undersecretary may adopt regulations as deemed necessary
33 for implementation of this section and shall consult with the energy efficiency advisory council
34 as established under section 22 of chapter 25 and the grid modernization advisory council as
35 established under section 92C of chapter 164 to ensure alignment of the definition of benefits
2 of 3
36 and to develop comprehensive guidelines across all programs to address specific challenges for
37 rental properties including but not limited to protections against rent increases or other
38 detrimental impacts after clean energy resources are installed in the property.
