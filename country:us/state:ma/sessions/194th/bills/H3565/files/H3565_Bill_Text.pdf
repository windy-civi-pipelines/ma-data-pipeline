6 (h) The administrators of the programs established pursuant to section 19 of this chapter
7 shall (i) offer to a customer at no cost a zero-carbon assessment of such customer’s building,
8 including a heat load calculation, that identifies measures that a customer must take to heat or
9 cool such building without the use of combustible fuels and (ii) identify rebates and incentives
10 available under such programs to assist a customer in implementing measures identified by such
11 assessment. Measures identified in a zero-carbon assessment may include, but shall not be
12 limited to: improving building shell insulation; air sealing; air duct sealing; improving air

13 exchange and indoor air quality; upgrading windows, doors, and cladding systems; electric
14 wiring and service upgrades; on site solar generation; electrical or thermal storage; electric peak
15 load management equipment and software; and replacing fossil fuel appliances and equipment
16 with electric or otherwise non-combusting appliances and equipment. A zero-carbon assessment
17 shall include a safety evaluation including a combustion safety test of existing fossil fuel
18 appliances, an instrumented test for ambient gas and particularly for gas leaks at the gas meter,
19 and a test of existing carbon monoxide alarms. A customer whose building has undergone a zero-
20 carbon assessment shall be provided with a zero-carbon report that identifies for each measure
21 that reduces emissions additional benefits including, but not limited to: (i) improvements in
22 comfort, safety, and health, including indoor air quality; (ii) cost savings; and (iii) any other
23 information the program administrators determine to be necessary to include. The zero-carbon

25 replacement of gas appliances with non-emitting appliances, on site solar energy and electrical
26 storage which takes advantage of available promotional electric rates, income eligible electric
27 rates and utility offerings for off peak and peak avoiding incentives to reduce projected client
28 energy expenditures. The Massachusetts energy technology center shall develop the zero-carbon
29 assessment and the zero-carbon report in consultation with the program administrators and the
30 energy efficiency advisory council established pursuant to section 22 of this chapter. The
31 commonwealth shall retain rights to the use of the zero-carbon assessment, the zero-carbon
32 report, and any associated data and software for use by Mass Save or any successor organization.
33 The zero-carbon assessment shall be the standard assessment service available to all customers
34 receiving services provided pursuant to this section.
