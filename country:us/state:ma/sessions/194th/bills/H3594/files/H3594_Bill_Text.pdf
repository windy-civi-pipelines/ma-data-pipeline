_______________
An Act regarding free expression.
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives in General Court assembled, and by the authority
of the same, as follows:
1 SECTION 1. The general court finds and declares that:
2 (i) attempts to ban, remove or otherwise restrict access to books or other materials in
3 public libraries and school libraries of the commonwealth undermines the public good and
4 restrict academic growth;
5 (ii) librarians should be protected from personal attacks and threats directed at them due
6 to work performed in good faith within their role and position;
7 (iii) library materials should not be proscribed or removed because of personal, political
8 or doctrinal views, and materials should not be excluded because of the origin, background or
9 views of those contributing to their creation; and
10 (iv) access to state-funded shared library resources requires public libraries to be in
11 compliance with the General Laws.
1 of 7

12 SECTION 2. Section 82 of chapter 71 of the General Laws, as appearing in the 2022
13 Official Edition, is hereby amended by striking out, in lines 4 to 11, inclusive, the words
14 “Freedom of expression shall include without limitation, the rights and responsibilities of
15 students, collectively and individually, (a) to express their views through speech and symbols,
16 (b) to write, publish and disseminate their views, (c) to assemble peaceably on school property
17 for the purpose of expressing their opinions. Any assembly planned by students during regularly
18 scheduled school hours shall be held only at a time and place approved in advance by the school
19 principal or his designee.” and inserting in place thereof the following sentence:- Freedom of
20 expression shall include, without limitation, the rights and responsibilities of students,
21 collectively and individually, to: (a) express their views through speech and symbols; (b) write,
22 publish and disseminate their views; (c) assemble peaceably on school property for the purpose
23 of expressing their opinions; provided, that assembly planned by students during regularly
24 scheduled school hours shall be held only at a time and place approved in advance by the school
25 principal or their designee; and (d) receive information, including through materials determined
26 to be educational and age-appropriate for inclusion in a school library by the school library

29 library materials and facilities.
30 SECTION 3. Said chapter 71 is hereby further amended by inserting after said section 82
31 the following 4 sections: -
32 Section 82A. Any determination by a school library teacher licensed by the department,

34 selection and display of library materials, that materials are appropriate for inclusion in a school
2 of 7

37 Section 82B. The school committee or other administrative authority of a school library

45 The written policy pursuant to section 82B shall include a process for responding to
46 complaints and challenges and other attempts to remove or restrict library materials based upon

49 the school committee during the process for responding to challenges; provided, that the
50 challenged material was selected for inclusion in the school library by a school library teacher
51 licensed by the department, or in the absence of a school library teacher, by the school official
52 responsible for the selection of library materials. Districts shall include information on book
53 challenges annually to the department.
54 Section 82C. (a) The selection of materials for inclusion in a collection shall not be
55 overruled except upon a determination and vote by the school committee, after notice and public
56 hearing and recommendation by a review committee of school personnel, appointed by the
3 of 7

57 school committee, and the superintendent, that, based on clear and convincing evidence, the
58 material is devoid of any educational, literary, artistic, personal or social value or is not age
59 appropriate for any child who attends the school.
60 (b) A decision of the school committee to remove materials from a school library may be
61 challenged by any student, parent or guardian pursuant to section 5 of chapter 249, including on
62 the grounds that the decision was not supported by clear and convincing evidence.
63 (c) Nothing in this section precludes personnel responsible for school library content
64 from deciding to remove materials that have become outdated or to accommodate new materials;
65 provided, that the decision is not made based on personal, political or doctrinal views.
66 Section 82D. No employee shall lose their librarian licensure or certification or be
67 dismissed, disciplined, placed on probation, involuntarily transferred, fined or imprisoned for the
68 selection of library materials when the selection is made in good faith and in accordance with the
69 approved policy adopted pursuant to section 82B.
