355 other property interests prior to the publication of a final environmental impact report pursuant to
356 this section and section 62C of said chapter 30; provided, however, that MassDOT shall not
357 record a notice of taking with respect to any lands or other property by eminent domain as
358 provided in this section until the secretary of energy and environmental affairs has issued a
359 notice of availability of a report submitted to said secretary in accordance with said section 62C
360 which demonstrates to the satisfaction of said secretary that a project may be carried out with
361 appropriate mitigation measures as may be necessary to minimize and prevent damage to the
362 environment.
363 (f) MassDOT shall be excluded from the definition of an owner or operator of a project
364 with respect to releases of hazardous materials that occur before MassDOT acquires ownership
365 of any portion of a site pursuant to this chapter upon or from which such a release may occur as
366 if MassDOT were a city or town that has purchased or taken such land for the nonpayment of
18 of 28

367 taxes, in accordance with the definition of "owner" or "operator" contained in paragraph (d) of
368 section 2 of chapter 21E of the General Laws; provided, however, that MassDOT complies with
369 all of the requirements set forth in paragraphs (d)(2) and (d)(3) of said section 2 of said chapter
370 21E, except that MassDOT shall have no obligation to comply with subsection (d)(3)(F) of said
371 section 2 of said chapter 21E.
372 Section 11. MassDOT Requirements.
373 (a) No person shall be precluded by chapters 7 or 268A of the General Laws from
374 participating by contract or otherwise in the activities of the commonwealth or MassDOT with

376 chapter solely by reason of a financial interest, direct or indirect, in any contract or extension
377 thereof for services with respect to the project report or otherwise with respect to the
378 development of the project executed by such person with the commonwealth or MassDOT prior
379 to the effective date hereof. For purposes of the foregoing, MassDOT shall have all of the powers
380 granted to it by General Law or special law not inconsistent with this chapter. Each project shall
381 be exempt from compliance with applicable zoning codes and any regulations promulgated
382 thereunder.
383 (b) MassDOT shall prepare quarterly reports for each project described by this chapter.
384 Said quarterly reports shall be submitted to the secretary of the executive office for
385 administration and finance, the house ways and means committee, the senate ways and means
386 committee, the clerk of the house and the clerk of the senate and posted on line on the MassDOT
387 website and shall include—
388 (1) the total dollars expended on the project to date,
19 of 28

389 (2) the number of contracts entered into to date;
390 (3) the number of contracts entered into with minority businesses;
391 (4) the number of contracts entered into with women-owned businesses;

394 (7) the total number of employees working on the project; and
395 (8) the total number of employees working on the project, broken down by race, ethnicity
396 and gender.
397 Section 12. Upon the secretary’s certification of receipt of a determination made pursuant
398 to section 6, the state treasurer shall issue bonds in such amounts and at such time as the state
399 treasurer determines, after consultation with the secretary and MassDOT, necessary to meet the
400 expenditures required for the project which is the subject of said determination. Any such bonds
401 shall be special obligations of the commonwealth payable first from the project funds created
402 pursuant to section 7 to the extent available and second from the unsegregated funds described in
403 section 3.
404 Section 13. The administration of the fees imposed under section 6 is hereby vested in the
405 commissioner of revenue. Said fees shall be collected by the municipal tax officials and remitted
406 to the department of revenue on a quarterly basis. All provisions of this chapter relative to
407 assessment, collection, payment, abatement, verification and administration, including penalties
408 and interest, shall, so far as pertinent, be applicable to the fees imposed by this chapter as though
409 they were taxes enumerated in section 2 of chapter 62C.
20 of 28

410 Section 14. MassDOT or its successor shall pursue any Federal funds for which the
411 projects, or any portions thereof, are eligible and to seek or coordinate with partners where
412 warranted.
413 Section 15. Regional Planning Agencies.
414 (a) MassDOT shall choose a regional planning agency or agencies established pursuant to
415 chapter 40B to conduct corridor land use planning for the projects. Each regional planning
416 agency or agencies shall work with municipalities, state agencies and other stakeholders to
417 complete land use corridor plans. Each land use corridor plan shall include the necessary actions
418 to be taken by municipal or state government, including zoning and other bylaw changes, in
419 order to maximize the long term benefit of the expansion, preserve capacity added by the project,
420 promote sustainable economic and residential development, protect critical open space and other
421 natural resources, and mitigate environmental and neighborhood impacts, including sprawl and
422 gentrification.
423 (b) MassDOT or its successor shall not begin construction on new rail stations to be
424 completed pursuant to chapter 161E until the secretary finds that the municipality in which the
425 station would be located has taken substantial actions to implement the applicable provisions and
426 requirements of the corridor land use plan and have taken actions to reasonably ensure ongoing
427 implementation of the plan after construction is complete.
428 (c) One-tenth of one per cent of the cost of each project shall be used for corridor land
429 use planning pursuant to this section, and shall be allocated from the Fund to the regional
430 planning agencies identified by MassDOT for the purposes of corridor land use planning
21 of 28

431 pursuant to this section. Each regional planning agency receiving funds shall file a report with
432 MassDOT and the house and senate committees on ways and means detailing their activities.
433 Section 16. The provisions of this chapter shall be deemed to provide an exclusive,
434 additional, alternative and complete method for the doing of the things authorized hereby and
435 shall be deemed and construed to be supplemental and additional to, and not in derogation of,
436 powers conferred upon MassDOT or its successor; provided, however, that insofar as the
437 provisions of this chapter are inconsistent with the provisions of any General Law or special law,
438 administrative order or regulation or any limitation imposed by a corporate or municipal charter,
439 the provisions of this chapter shall be controlling.
440 Section 17. Bonding Authority.
441 (a) To meet the expenditures necessary to carry out the provisions of section 2, the state
442 treasurer may issue and sell bonds of the commonwealth in any amount. Any such bonds shall be
443 special obligations of the commonwealth payable first from the project funds described in
444 section 7 to the extent available and second from the receipts described in section 3 to the extent
445 available.
446 (b) Bonds of the commonwealth may be issued under authority of this section in such
447 manner and on such terms and conditions as the state treasurer, with the concurrence of the
448 secretary of administration and finance, may determine in accordance with the provisions of this
449 subsection and, to the extent not inconsistent with the provisions hereof, provisions of General
450 Law for the issuance of bonds of the commonwealth. Bonds may be secured by a trust agreement
451 or other security agreement entered into by the state treasurer, with the concurrence of the
452 secretary of administration and finance, on behalf of the commonwealth, which trust agreement
22 of 28

453 or other security agreement may pledge or assign all or any part of the local project receipts
454 credited to the fund pursuant to sections 3 and 6, and any other pledged funds as hereinafter
455 provided, and rights to receive the same, whether existing or coming into existence and whether
456 held or thereafter acquired, and the proceeds thereof. The state treasurer is further authorized,
457 with the concurrence of the secretary of administration and finance, to enter into additional
458 security, insurance or other forms of credit enhancement which may be secured on a parity or
459 subordinate basis with the bonds. A pledge in any such trust or other security agreement or credit
460 enhancement agreement shall be valid and binding from the time such pledge shall be made
461 without any physical delivery or further act, and the lien of such pledge shall be valid and
462 binding as against all parties having claims of any kind in tort, contract or otherwise, irrespective
463 of whether such parties have notice thereof. Any such pledge shall be perfected by filing of the
464 trust or other security agreement or credit enhancement agreement in the records of the state
465 treasurer, and no filing need be made under chapter 106 of the General Laws. Any such trust
466 agreement, security agreement or credit enhancement agreement may establish provisions
467 defining defaults and establishing remedies and other matters relating to the rights and security
468 of the holders of the bonds or other secured parties as determined by the state treasurer, including
469 provisions relating to the establishment of reserves, the issuance of additional or refunding
470 bonds, whether or not secured on a parity basis, the application of the moneys and funds pledged
471 pursuant to such agreement, in this chapter referred to as pledged funds, and other matters
472 deemed necessary or desirable by the state treasurer for the security of such bonds, and may also
473 regulate the custody, investment and application of moneys.
474 (c) As additional security for bonds of the commonwealth issued under authority of this
475 section, the state treasurer, with the concurrence of the secretary of administration and finance,
23 of 28

476 shall create and establish a special fund for each project, herein referred to as the Capital Reserve
477 Funds, within the Fund established under section 3 or otherwise under a trust or other security
478 agreement securing such bonds, and shall pay into the capital reserve funds any receipts
479 available for such purpose pursuant to section 3 and any other moneys appropriated and made
480 available for the purposes of such fund, any proceeds of such bonds to the extent determined by
481 the state treasurer, with the concurrence of the secretary of administration and finance, or as may
482 be provided in any such trust or other security agreement, and any other moneys available for
483 purposes of such fund as provided in this section, all of which shall be pledged funds for
484 purposes of this chapter.
485 (d) All moneys held in the Capital Reserve Funds, except as hereinafter provided, shall be
486 used solely for the payment of the principal of bonds of the commonwealth issued under
487 authority of this section as the same mature, the purchase of such bonds, the payment of interest
488 on such bonds or the payment of any redemption premium required to be paid when such bonds
489 are redeemed prior to maturity; provided, however, that, moneys in the Capital Reserve Funds
490 shall not be withdrawn therefrom at any time in such amount as would reduce the amount of any
491 such fund to less than the maximum amount of principal and interest maturing and becoming due
492 in any succeeding fiscal year on all such bonds outstanding or such lesser amount as shall be
493 established by the state treasurer, with the concurrence of the secretary of administration and
494 finance, as necessary or appropriate to secure such bonds, in this chapter referred to as the
495 “capital reserve fund requirements”, except for the purpose of paying the principal of and interest
496 on such bonds maturing and becoming due and for the payment of which other receipts held in
497 the funds are not available.
24 of 28

498 (e) Notwithstanding any provision of this chapter, the state treasurer may not issue bonds
499 of the commonwealth under authority of this section at any time if following such issuance the
500 balance on deposit in the Capital Reserve Funds would be less than the capital reserve fund
501 requirements with respect to all such bonds then outstanding.
502 (f) If on the last day of any fiscal year during which any bonds of the commonwealth
503 issued under authority of this section are outstanding, the balance on deposit in the Capital
504 Reserve Funds shall be less than the capital reserve fund requirements as then calculated, after
505 deposit therein of all amounts available therefore in the funds or otherwise under the trust or
506 other security agreement securing such bonds, the motor fuel excise tax shall be increased and all
507 newly created revenue directed into the Fund until the balance of said capital reserve fund shall
508 again equal the capital reserve fund requirement as so certified by the secretary of administration
509 and finance; provided, however, that the total amount of the excise imposed pursuant to sections
510 3 and 3A of chapter 64G of the General Laws and section 22 of chapter 546 of the acts of 1969
511 shall not exceed 14 per cent.
512 (g) In order to increase the marketability of any bonds issued by the commonwealth
513 under authority of this section, and in consideration of the acceptance of payment for any such
514 bonds, the commonwealth covenants with the purchasers, and all subsequent holders and
515 transferees of any such bonds, that until all such bonds, including all bonds issued to refund such
516 bonds, and the interest thereon, shall be paid or, if earlier, shall be deemed paid within the
517 meaning of any trust or other security agreement or credit enhancement agreement securing the
518 same, that—
519 (1) the receipts shall not be diverted from the purposes identified in this chapter;
25 of 28

520 (2) no pledged funds shall be diverted from the funds established by section 3 or the
521 Capital Reserve Funds, except as provided in this chapter;
522 (3) in any fiscal year of the commonwealth, unless and until an appropriation has been
523 made which is sufficient to pay the principal, including sinking fund payments, of and interest on
524 all such bonds and to provide for or maintain any reserves, additional security, insurance or other
525 form of credit enhancement required or provided for in any trust or other security agreement or
526 credit enhancement agreement securing any such bonds or notes, no pledged funds shall be
527 applied to any other use; and
528 (4) so long as such revenues are necessary, as determined by the state treasurer in
529 accordance with any applicable trust or other security agreement or credit enhancement
530 agreement, for the purposes for which they have been pledged, the rate of any fees imposed by
531 this chapter or which may constitute pledged funds under this section shall not be reduced below
532 the amount in effect at the time of issuance of any such bond.
533 (h) Any bonds issued under authority of this section, and any notes of the commonwealth
534 issued in anticipation thereof as hereinafter provided, shall be deemed to be investment securities
535 under chapter 106 of the General Laws, shall be securities in which any public officer, fiduciary,
536 insurance company, financial institution or investment company may properly invest funds and
537 shall be securities which may be deposited with any public custodian for any purpose for which
538 the deposit of bonds is authorized by law. Any such bonds and notes, their transfer and the
539 income therefrom, including profit on the sale thereof, shall at all times be exempt from taxation
540 by and within the commonwealth.
26 of 28

541 Section 18. The state treasurer may borrow on the credit of the commonwealth such sums
542 of money as may be necessary for the purposes of meeting payments as authorized by chapter
543 161E in anticipation of the receipt of proceeds of special obligation bonds of the commonwealth
544 issued under the authority of section 17, and may issue and renew notes of the commonwealth
545 therefore, bearing interest payable at such time and at such rate as shall be fixed by the state
546 treasurer. Such notes shall be issued and may be renewed one or more times for such maximum
547 term of years, not exceeding 7 years, as the governor may recommend to the general court in
548 accordance with Section 3 of Article LXII of the Amendments to the Constitution; provided,
549 however, that all such notes shall be payable no later than 7 years after issuance. Notes and the
550 interest thereon issued under MassDOT of this section, notwithstanding any other provisions of
551 this chapter, shall be general obligations of the commonwealth.
552 Section 19. This chapter shall be construed in all respects so as to meet all constitutional
553 requirements. In carrying out the purposes and provisions of this act, all steps shall be taken
554 which are necessary to meet constitutional requirements whether or not such steps are required
555 by statute.
556 SECTION 4. Effective Date for Section 3. The provisions of section 3 shall take effect on
557 the first day of the first full calendar month following 30 days after the enactment this Act.
558 SECTION 5. North South Rail Link.
559 (a) Section 1 of chapter 161C of the General Laws, as appearing in the 2018 Official
560 Edition, is hereby amended by adding the following sentence:–
561 “Furthermore, to carry out the purposes of this section, the Commonwealth of
562 Massachusetts shall preserve intact the right-of-way for the proposed North South Rail Link.
27 of 28

563 This right-of-way is extremely vulnerable to the impact of development and redevelopment
564 around the existing rail tracks and terminals. In addition, rail projects already in the planning and
565 construction phases will exceed the capacity of the South Station terminal. Preservation of the
566 right-of-way for the North-South Rail Link will assure that rail transportation can be enhanced or
567 expanded in our region.”.
568 (b) Chapter 161C of the General Laws is hereby amended by inserting after section 8 the
569 following section:–
570 “Section 9. The Massachusetts department of transportation, or its successor, shall
571 perform a study to specifically identify and map the necessary right-of-way to allow for the
572 construction of the proposed North South Rail Link connecting North Station to South Station.
573 This study must include particular reference to the Major Investment Study/Draft Environmental
574 Impact Report (EOEA#10270), prepared under the aegis of the executive office of environmental
575 affairs, which was concluded on March 31, 2003. A plan to preserve said right-of-way, once
576 identified, shall be determined and implemented immediately.”.
