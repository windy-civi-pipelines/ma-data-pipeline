44 Automation Systems for On-Road Motor Vehicles" published by SAE International on June 15,
45 2018, as revised.
46 SECTION 2. A person may operate on the highways in the commonwealth a fully
47 autonomous vehicle or a motor vehicle equipped with an automated driving system capable of
48 performing the entire dynamic driving task with the automated driving system engaged without a
49 human driver if the vehicle meets the following conditions: i.the vehicle meets the requirements
50 of this chapter and has been issued an autonomous operation license by the Department; ii. if a
51 failure of the automated driving system occurs that renders that system unable to perform the
52 entire dynamic driving task relevant to its intended operational design domain, the vehicle will
53 achieve a minimal risk condition and, if there is a human driver physically present in the vehicle,
54 issue a request to intervene with the expectation that the human driver will respond appropriately
3 of 7

55 to such request; iii. the vehicle is capable of operating in compliance with the applicable traffic
56 and motor vehicle safety laws and regulations of the Commonwealth when it is reasonable to do
57 so unless an exemption has been granted by the Department; iv. when required by federal law,
58 the vehicle bears the required manufacturer's certification label indicating that at the time of its
59 manufacture it has been certified to be in compliance with all applicable federal motor vehicle
60 safety standards, including any exemptions granted by the National Highway Traffic Safety
61 Administration.
62 A fully autonomous vehicle for which the declared gross weight of the vehicle and any
63 towed unit is 10,000 pounds or heavier shall have a human driver, with the appropriate
64 credentials to operate the vehicle, physically present in the vehicle to monitor the performance of
65 the vehicle and intervene if necessary. Prior to operating a fully autonomous vehicle in the
66 Commonwealth without a human driver, a person shall submit a law-enforcement interaction
67 plan to the Department of Transportation, Department of Public Safety and the police department
68 of the city, town or jurisdiction where a vehicle will be operating that describes (i) how to
69 communicate with a fleet support specialist who is available during the times the vehicle is in
70 operation, (ii) how to safely remove the fully autonomous vehicle from the highway and steps to
71 safely tow the vehicle, (iii) how to recognize whether the automated driving system is engaged
72 on the fully autonomous vehicle, and (iv) any additional information the manufacturer or owner
73 deems necessary regarding hazardous conditions or public safety risks associated with the
74 operation of the fully autonomous vehicle. In the event of a crash the fully autonomous vehicle
75 shall remain on the scene in accordance with state law. The owner of the fully autonomous
76 vehicle, or a person on behalf of the vehicle owner, shall report any crashes or collisions in
77 accordance with state law.
