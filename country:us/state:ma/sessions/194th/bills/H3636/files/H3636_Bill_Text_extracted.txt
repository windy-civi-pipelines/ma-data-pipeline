168 21C of chapter 59.
169 Section 5A. (a) A property owner subject to an exemption pursuant to clause Third or
170 clause Eleventh of section 5 of chapter 59 shall not be subject to the fee provided for in section
171 5; provided, however, that such property owner shall have all the rights and privileges as any

173 payment program set forth in subsection (b).
174 (b) A property owner of property located within a TID and subject to an exemption in
175 clause Third or clause Eleventh of section 5 of chapter 59 may enter into an agreement with the

185 however, that such regional transit authority or property owner shall have all the rights and
186 privileges as any other property owner pursuant to this chapter if such property owner
187 participates in the voluntary payment program set forth in subsection (b).
188 (b) Any regional transit authority or property owner of property located within a TID and
189 subject to an exemption under Chapter 161B Section 13 may enter into an agreement with the
190 municipal executive body in which such property is located for voluntary payments to such
191 municipality for the purposes of this chapter.
192 Section 6. The municipality or group of municipalities participating in the establishment
193 of a TID shall provide a minimum of 25 per cent of the TID’s program costs from funds not
194 generated by the fees authorized under section 5. The Massachusetts department of
195 transportation shall provide 25 per cent in matching funds, subject to appropriation. Users of the
196 new transit improvement program shall be required to pay a fee for service, which shall, in the
10 of 12
197 aggregate, be no more than 5 per cent of the total program costs. Property owners located within
198 a TID shall provide a minimum of 25 per cent of the transit improvement program costs.
199 Section 7. The municipal executive body authorized to manage a TID under paragraph
200 (1) of subsection (c) of section 2 shall conduct a review of the program plan 12 months prior to
201 the completion of the duration of the transit improvement programs within a TID to determine if
202 the program is desired to be continued, and if so, complete a program assessment that includes a
203 review of the anticipated costs to continue said service. If continuance is sought, a public hearing
204 shall be conducted on the TID’s desire to continue service and a renewal of the authorization
205 shall be approved by the relevant municipal legislative body or bodies in a manner consistent
206 with the authorization set forth in section 2.
207 Section 8. A TID may be dissolved by petition to the local municipal executive body and
208 a subsequent decision by its legislative body to authorize dissolution, or a TID may be dissolved
209 upon request by the chief elected or chief executive official of the lead municipality for a
210 dissolution vote by the local municipal legislative body.
211 In order to be considered by a municipal legislative body, a petition to dissolve a TID
212 shall contain the signatures of the fee-paying property owners whose properties represent at least
213 51 per cent of the total assessed value within the TID and at least 51 per cent of the fee-paying
214 property owners within the TID.
215 The municipal executive body shall hold a public hearing within 30 days of receipt of a
216 completed dissolution petition.
217 Following the public hearing, the municipal executive body shall refer the matter to its
218 legislative body, which may determine, by a majority vote, to dissolve the TID; provided,
11 of 12
219 however, that no TID shall be dissolved until it has satisfied or paid in full all of its outstanding
220 indebtedness, obligations, and liabilities, or until funds are on deposit and available therefor, or
221 until a repayment schedule has been formulated and municipally approved therefor. The TID
222 shall be prohibited from incurring any new or increased financial obligations after its dissolution.
223 Upon the dissolution of a TID, any remaining revenues derived from the sale of assets
224 acquired with fees collected shall be refunded to the property owners in the TID in which fees
225 were charged by applying the same formula used to calculate the fee in the fiscal year in which
226 the TID is dissolved.
227 In the event a municipality participating in a TID containing more than 1 municipality
228 desires to withdraw from the TID, such municipality may, by petition containing the signatures
229 of the fee-paying owners whose properties represent at least 51 per cent of the assessed value
230 within the TID and at least 51 per cent of the fee-paying property owners within the district, seek
231 a dissolution vote from its municipal legislative body. Upon such approval from a municipal
232 legislative body, the withdrawing municipality shall then also receive an affirmative vote of the
233 lead municipality’s legislative body, in order to effectuate the withdrawal.
234 SECTION 2. Notwithstanding any general or special law to the contrary, upon passage of
235 this act, the Massachusetts department of transportation shall identify and set aside funding to be
236 used to meet its responsibilities under section 6 of chapter 40X, and shall establish a fund to
237 assist any municipality or group of municipalities in establishing a transit improvement district,
238 as defined in section 1 of chapter 40X; provided, that at least 35 per cent of the funds disbursed
239 from said fund shall be used over a 5 year period to fund projects in Environmental Justice areas.

169 Section 5A. (a) A property owner subject to an exemption pursuant to clause Third or
170 clause Eleventh of section 5 of chapter 59 shall not be subject to the fee provided for in section

185 however, that such regional transit authority or property owner shall have all the rights and
186 privileges as any other property owner pursuant to this chapter if such property owner
187 participates in the voluntary payment program set forth in subsection (b).
188 (b) Any regional transit authority or property owner of property located within a TID and
189 subject to an exemption under Chapter 161B Section 13 may enter into an agreement with the
190 municipal executive body in which such property is located for voluntary payments to such
191 municipality for the purposes of this chapter.
192 Section 6. The municipality or group of municipalities participating in the establishment
193 of a TID shall provide a minimum of 25 per cent of the TID’s program costs from funds not
194 generated by the fees authorized under section 5. The Massachusetts department of
195 transportation shall provide 25 per cent in matching funds, subject to appropriation. Users of the
196 new transit improvement program shall be required to pay a fee for service, which shall, in the
10 of 12

197 aggregate, be no more than 5 per cent of the total program costs. Property owners located within
198 a TID shall provide a minimum of 25 per cent of the transit improvement program costs.
199 Section 7. The municipal executive body authorized to manage a TID under paragraph
200 (1) of subsection (c) of section 2 shall conduct a review of the program plan 12 months prior to
201 the completion of the duration of the transit improvement programs within a TID to determine if
202 the program is desired to be continued, and if so, complete a program assessment that includes a
203 review of the anticipated costs to continue said service. If continuance is sought, a public hearing
204 shall be conducted on the TID’s desire to continue service and a renewal of the authorization
205 shall be approved by the relevant municipal legislative body or bodies in a manner consistent
206 with the authorization set forth in section 2.
207 Section 8. A TID may be dissolved by petition to the local municipal executive body and
208 a subsequent decision by its legislative body to authorize dissolution, or a TID may be dissolved
209 upon request by the chief elected or chief executive official of the lead municipality for a
210 dissolution vote by the local municipal legislative body.
211 In order to be considered by a municipal legislative body, a petition to dissolve a TID
212 shall contain the signatures of the fee-paying property owners whose properties represent at least
213 51 per cent of the total assessed value within the TID and at least 51 per cent of the fee-paying
214 property owners within the TID.
215 The municipal executive body shall hold a public hearing within 30 days of receipt of a
216 completed dissolution petition.
217 Following the public hearing, the municipal executive body shall refer the matter to its
218 legislative body, which may determine, by a majority vote, to dissolve the TID; provided,
11 of 12

219 however, that no TID shall be dissolved until it has satisfied or paid in full all of its outstanding
220 indebtedness, obligations, and liabilities, or until funds are on deposit and available therefor, or
221 until a repayment schedule has been formulated and municipally approved therefor. The TID
222 shall be prohibited from incurring any new or increased financial obligations after its dissolution.
223 Upon the dissolution of a TID, any remaining revenues derived from the sale of assets
224 acquired with fees collected shall be refunded to the property owners in the TID in which fees
225 were charged by applying the same formula used to calculate the fee in the fiscal year in which
226 the TID is dissolved.
227 In the event a municipality participating in a TID containing more than 1 municipality
228 desires to withdraw from the TID, such municipality may, by petition containing the signatures
229 of the fee-paying owners whose properties represent at least 51 per cent of the assessed value
230 within the TID and at least 51 per cent of the fee-paying property owners within the district, seek
231 a dissolution vote from its municipal legislative body. Upon such approval from a municipal
232 legislative body, the withdrawing municipality shall then also receive an affirmative vote of the
233 lead municipality’s legislative body, in order to effectuate the withdrawal.
234 SECTION 2. Notwithstanding any general or special law to the contrary, upon passage of
235 this act, the Massachusetts department of transportation shall identify and set aside funding to be
236 used to meet its responsibilities under section 6 of chapter 40X, and shall establish a fund to
237 assist any municipality or group of municipalities in establishing a transit improvement district,
238 as defined in section 1 of chapter 40X; provided, that at least 35 per cent of the funds disbursed
239 from said fund shall be used over a 5 year period to fund projects in Environmental Justice areas.
