Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives in General Court assembled, and by the authority

3 by authorized stores, establishments and any other entities legally allowed to sell such products
4 in the Commonwealth and within the existing by-laws of the community, wholesale or retail,
5 without receiving the approval of town meeting or city council to create such a by-law within the
6 city or town. This provision shall not interfere with a Board of Healthâ€™s ability to take action for
7 an emergency and immediate health concern for a specific consumer product or from a specific
8 location if a health code violation has otherwise occurred or some other emergency health issue
9 should arise so long as such action is not to ban the legal sale for the sake of doing so.
