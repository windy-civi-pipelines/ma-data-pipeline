42 implied warranties created by law, any rights created by section 7N, 7N1/4 7N1/2 or chapter 93A
43 or any rules and regulations promulgated pursuant thereto, or express warranties given by a
44 private seller in connection with the sale of a vehicle or any other rights or remedies available to
45 consumers under applicable law. Nothing in this section shall be construed as creating any cause
46 of action by a buyer against a private seller under the provisions of this section; provided,
47 however, that in any subsequent action by a buyer under section 7N1/4, the court may take the
