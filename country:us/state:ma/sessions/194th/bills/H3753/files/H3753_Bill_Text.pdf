13 intergovernmental coordinating council established by the Acts of 2022, chapter 179, section 81
14 shall develop and enforce targets for public transit electrification across all modes of travel. Said
15 targets shall be included and updated in all roadmap plans required under this chapter at the same
16 intervals of sublimits required under section 3.
17 (b) The Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority and its commuter rail contractor

19 ensure sufficient zero-emission transit infrastructure is in place to accomplish said timeline.
20 SECTION 3. (a) The Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority shall develop and
21 implement short-term, medium-term and long-term electrification and performance improvement
22 plans for each line of the commuter rail system ensuring that the line is fully integrated into the

24 equitable, and decarbonized. Each plan shall maximize the ridership returns on investment and
25 shall be designed to meet statewide greenhouse gas emissions limits and sublimits established in
26 chapter 21N of the General Laws.
27 (b)(1) The authority shall include in the short-term plan immediate action items to run
28 fully electrified service as defined under chapter 21N of the General Laws along the

42 and specific plan to provide fully electrified service on the remainder of the commuter rail fleet
