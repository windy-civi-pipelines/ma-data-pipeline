114 “creditor” and “secured creditor” shall include the lessor of a motor vehicle; and

116 (a) In any consumer credit transaction involving, or loan that is secured by, a non-
117 possessory security interest in consumer goods a provision relating to default is enforceable only
6 of 11
118 to the extent that the default is material and consists of the debtor’s failure to make one or more
119 payments as required by the agreement, or the occurrence of an event which substantially
120 impairs the value of the collateral.
121 (b) After a default under a consumer credit transaction by a debtor the secured creditor
122 may not bring an action against the debtor or proceed against the collateral until he gives the
123 debtor the notice required by this section. Said notice shall be deemed to be delivered when
124 delivered to the debtor or when mailed to the debtor at the debtor’s address last known to the
125 creditor. If a debtor cures a default after receiving such notice and again defaults, the creditor
126 shall give another notice before bringing action or proceeding against the collateral with respect
127 to the subsequent default, but no notice is required in connection with a subsequent default if,
128 within the period commencing on the date of the consumer credit transaction subject to this

136 enabling debtor to identify it) by paying to (name and address of lessor or creditor) (amount due)
137 before (date which is at least twenty-one days after notice is mailed).
138 If you pay this amount within the time allowed you are no longer in default and may
139 continue with the transaction (lease or loan) as though no default had occurred.
7 of 11
140 (d) No court shall enter a deficiency judgment against a debtor which includes a finance
141 charge or insurance premiums allocable to installments due after repossession. A debtor whose
142 goods have been repossessed shall not be liable in a civil action for a deficiency unless the
143 secured party files an affidavit signed either by the purchaser at the sale or by the secured party
144 stating the price for which the goods were sold and the date and place of sale. Such affidavit
145 shall be filed with the complaint.
146 (e) Unless the secured creditor has first notified the debtor that he has elected to
147 accelerate the unpaid balance of the obligation because of default, brought action against the
148 debtor, or proceeded against the collateral, the debtor may cure a default consisting of a failure to
149 pay money by tendering the amount of all unpaid sums due at the time of tender, without
150 acceleration, plus any unpaid delinquency or deferral charges. Cure shall restore the debtor to his
151 rights under the agreement as though the defaults cured have not occurred, subject to the
152 provisions of subsection (b).
153 SECTION 12. Chapter 255 of the general laws, as so appearing in the 2014 edition, shall
154 be amended by striking out section 13J and replacing it with the following section:-
155 Section 13J. (a) Subject to the provisions of this section and section 13I, a secured
156 creditor under a consumer credit transaction may take possession of collateral. In taking
157 possession the secured creditor under a consumer credit transaction may proceed without a prior
158 hearing only if the default is material and consists of the debtor’s failure to make one or more
159 payments as required by the agreement or the occurrence of an event which substantially impairs
160 the value of the collateral, and only if possession can be obtained without use of force, without a
8 of 11
161 breach of peace and, unless the debtor consents to an entry, at the time of such entry, without
162 entry upon property owned by, or rented to the debtor.
163 (b) Except as provided in subsection (a), a creditor under a consumer credit transaction
164 may proceed against collateral only after a prior hearing. In any proceeding where possession of
165 the collateral is part of the relief sought by a creditor no court shall allow a secured creditor or
166 lessor to take possession of collateral until the right of the creditor or lessor to take possession
167 has been determined at a hearing at which the consumer has an opportunity to be heard, having
168 been notified in writing of such hearing at least seven days in advance thereof.
169 (c) The consumer under a secured consumer credit transaction may redeem the collateral
170 from the creditor or lessor at any time within twenty days of the creditor or lessor’s taking
171 possession of the collateral, or thereafter until the creditor or lessor has either disposed of the
172 collateral, entered into a contract for its disposition, or gained the right to retain the collateral.
173 (d) The creditor or lessor may after gaining possession sell or otherwise dispose of the
174 collateral. Unless displaced by the provisions of this section and section thirteen I, the rights and
175 obligations of the parties, including redemption and disposition of the collateral shall be
176 governed by the provisions of Part 6 of Article 9 of chapter 106, including consumer leases of
177 motor vehicles, to the extent applicable. Notwithstanding the provisions in Part 6 of Article 9 of
178 chapter 106, if, in connection with a consumer credit transaction which involves an unpaid
179 balance of two thousand dollars or less and which is at the time of default secured by a non-
180 possessory security interest in consumer goods, the creditor or lessor takes possession of or
181 accepts surrender of the collateral, the consumer shall not be liable for any deficiency. If the
182 agreement between the creditor or lessor and consumer provides that the consumer is to obtain
9 of 11
183 insurance protecting the collateral against fire, theft, collision or other hazards and naming the
184 creditor or lessor as loss payee and if, prior to the repossession or surrender of the collateral, loss
185 or damage occurs which would give rise to insurance proceeds under the terms of the policy in
186 force, then nothing in this section shall be deemed to limit the creditor or lessor’s rights to so
187 much of the insurance proceeds as does not exceed the fair market value of the collateral existing
188 just prior to the loss or damage and, if insurance as required by the agreement is not in force at
189 the time of the loss or damage, nothing in this section shall be deemed to limit the creditor or
190 lessor’s rights in proceeding against any third party who is responsible for the loss or damage in
191 the name of the consumer or otherwise. For the purposes of this section the unpaid balance of a
192 consumer credit transaction shall be that amount which the consumer would have been required
193 to pay upon prepayment.
194 (e) (1) If the unpaid balance of the consumer credit transaction at the time of default was
195 two thousand dollars or more the creditor or lessor shall be entitled to recover from the consumer
196 the deficiency, if any, resulting from deducting the fair market value of the collateral from the
197 unpaid balance due and shall also be entitled to any reasonable repossession and storage costs,
198 provided he has complied with all provisions of this section.
199 (2) In a proceeding for a deficiency the fair market value of the collateral shall be a
200 question for the court to determine. Periodically published trade estimates of the retail value of
201 goods shall, to the extent they are recognized in the particular trade or business, be presumed to
202 be the fair market value of the collateral.
203 (f) Any secured creditor or lessor obtaining possession of a motor vehicle under the
204 provisions of this section shall, within one hour after obtaining such possession, notify the police
10 of 11
205 department of the city or town in which such possession occurred, giving such police department
206 a description of the vehicle involved.
207 SECTION 13: Sections 1 through 9 shall not apply to leases in existence before the
208 effective date of this Act. However, such sections shall apply when, after the effective date of
209 this Act, a consumer lease is renegotiated by the same lessee for the same motor vehicle.
210 SECTION 14. Sections 10 and 11 shall not apply to leases in default before the effective
211 date of this Act. However, such sections shall apply where a lease in default before the effective
212 date of this Act at is cured, and then goes into default again after the effective date of this Act.

103 SECTION 10: Chapter 231 of the general laws, amended by striking out section 85J and
104 replacing it with the following section:-
105 Whoever, by deceit or fraud, sells or leases personal property shall be liable in tort to a
106 purchaser or lessee in treble the amount of damages sustained by such purchaser or lessee.
107 SECTION 11. Chapter 255 of the general laws, as so appearing in the 2014 edition, shall
108 be amended by striking out section 13I and replacing it with the following section:-
109 Section 13I. For the purposes of this section and section 13J
110 “Collateral” shall mean consumer goods secured or motor vehicles leased by a consumer
111 credit transaction which are located in commonwealth at the time of default.
112 “Consumer credit transaction” shall include a consumer lease of motor vehicle for a term
113 of more than one year;
114 “creditor” and “secured creditor” shall include the lessor of a motor vehicle; and
115 “debtor” shall include a consumer lessee of a motor vehicle.
116 (a) In any consumer credit transaction involving, or loan that is secured by, a non-
117 possessory security interest in consumer goods a provision relating to default is enforceable only
6 of 11

118 to the extent that the default is material and consists of the debtor’s failure to make one or more
119 payments as required by the agreement, or the occurrence of an event which substantially
120 impairs the value of the collateral.
121 (b) After a default under a consumer credit transaction by a debtor the secured creditor
122 may not bring an action against the debtor or proceed against the collateral until he gives the
123 debtor the notice required by this section. Said notice shall be deemed to be delivered when
124 delivered to the debtor or when mailed to the debtor at the debtor’s address last known to the
125 creditor. If a debtor cures a default after receiving such notice and again defaults, the creditor
126 shall give another notice before bringing action or proceeding against the collateral with respect
127 to the subsequent default, but no notice is required in connection with a subsequent default if,
128 within the period commencing on the date of the consumer credit transaction subject to this
129 section and the date of the subsequent default, the debtor has cured a default after notice three or
130 more times.
131 (c) The notice shall be in writing and shall be given to the debtor ten days or more after
132 the default. The notice shall conspicuously state the rights of the debtor upon default in
133 substantially the following form:
134 The heading shall read:' 'Rights of Defaulting Consumer under Massachusetts Law.'' The
135 body of the notice shall read: ''You may cure your default in (describe transaction in a manner
136 enabling debtor to identify it) by paying to (name and address of lessor or creditor) (amount due)
137 before (date which is at least twenty-one days after notice is mailed).
138 If you pay this amount within the time allowed you are no longer in default and may
139 continue with the transaction (lease or loan) as though no default had occurred.
7 of 11

140 (d) No court shall enter a deficiency judgment against a debtor which includes a finance
141 charge or insurance premiums allocable to installments due after repossession. A debtor whose
142 goods have been repossessed shall not be liable in a civil action for a deficiency unless the
143 secured party files an affidavit signed either by the purchaser at the sale or by the secured party
144 stating the price for which the goods were sold and the date and place of sale. Such affidavit
145 shall be filed with the complaint.
146 (e) Unless the secured creditor has first notified the debtor that he has elected to
147 accelerate the unpaid balance of the obligation because of default, brought action against the
148 debtor, or proceeded against the collateral, the debtor may cure a default consisting of a failure to
149 pay money by tendering the amount of all unpaid sums due at the time of tender, without
150 acceleration, plus any unpaid delinquency or deferral charges. Cure shall restore the debtor to his
151 rights under the agreement as though the defaults cured have not occurred, subject to the
152 provisions of subsection (b).
153 SECTION 12. Chapter 255 of the general laws, as so appearing in the 2014 edition, shall
154 be amended by striking out section 13J and replacing it with the following section:-
155 Section 13J. (a) Subject to the provisions of this section and section 13I, a secured
156 creditor under a consumer credit transaction may take possession of collateral. In taking
157 possession the secured creditor under a consumer credit transaction may proceed without a prior
158 hearing only if the default is material and consists of the debtor’s failure to make one or more
159 payments as required by the agreement or the occurrence of an event which substantially impairs
160 the value of the collateral, and only if possession can be obtained without use of force, without a
8 of 11

161 breach of peace and, unless the debtor consents to an entry, at the time of such entry, without
162 entry upon property owned by, or rented to the debtor.
163 (b) Except as provided in subsection (a), a creditor under a consumer credit transaction
164 may proceed against collateral only after a prior hearing. In any proceeding where possession of
165 the collateral is part of the relief sought by a creditor no court shall allow a secured creditor or
166 lessor to take possession of collateral until the right of the creditor or lessor to take possession
167 has been determined at a hearing at which the consumer has an opportunity to be heard, having
168 been notified in writing of such hearing at least seven days in advance thereof.
169 (c) The consumer under a secured consumer credit transaction may redeem the collateral
170 from the creditor or lessor at any time within twenty days of the creditor or lessor’s taking
171 possession of the collateral, or thereafter until the creditor or lessor has either disposed of the
172 collateral, entered into a contract for its disposition, or gained the right to retain the collateral.
173 (d) The creditor or lessor may after gaining possession sell or otherwise dispose of the
174 collateral. Unless displaced by the provisions of this section and section thirteen I, the rights and
175 obligations of the parties, including redemption and disposition of the collateral shall be
176 governed by the provisions of Part 6 of Article 9 of chapter 106, including consumer leases of
177 motor vehicles, to the extent applicable. Notwithstanding the provisions in Part 6 of Article 9 of
178 chapter 106, if, in connection with a consumer credit transaction which involves an unpaid
179 balance of two thousand dollars or less and which is at the time of default secured by a non-
180 possessory security interest in consumer goods, the creditor or lessor takes possession of or
181 accepts surrender of the collateral, the consumer shall not be liable for any deficiency. If the
182 agreement between the creditor or lessor and consumer provides that the consumer is to obtain
9 of 11

183 insurance protecting the collateral against fire, theft, collision or other hazards and naming the
184 creditor or lessor as loss payee and if, prior to the repossession or surrender of the collateral, loss
185 or damage occurs which would give rise to insurance proceeds under the terms of the policy in
186 force, then nothing in this section shall be deemed to limit the creditor or lessor’s rights to so
187 much of the insurance proceeds as does not exceed the fair market value of the collateral existing
188 just prior to the loss or damage and, if insurance as required by the agreement is not in force at
189 the time of the loss or damage, nothing in this section shall be deemed to limit the creditor or
190 lessor’s rights in proceeding against any third party who is responsible for the loss or damage in
191 the name of the consumer or otherwise. For the purposes of this section the unpaid balance of a
192 consumer credit transaction shall be that amount which the consumer would have been required
193 to pay upon prepayment.
194 (e) (1) If the unpaid balance of the consumer credit transaction at the time of default was
195 two thousand dollars or more the creditor or lessor shall be entitled to recover from the consumer
196 the deficiency, if any, resulting from deducting the fair market value of the collateral from the
197 unpaid balance due and shall also be entitled to any reasonable repossession and storage costs,
198 provided he has complied with all provisions of this section.
199 (2) In a proceeding for a deficiency the fair market value of the collateral shall be a
200 question for the court to determine. Periodically published trade estimates of the retail value of
201 goods shall, to the extent they are recognized in the particular trade or business, be presumed to
202 be the fair market value of the collateral.
203 (f) Any secured creditor or lessor obtaining possession of a motor vehicle under the
204 provisions of this section shall, within one hour after obtaining such possession, notify the police
10 of 11

205 department of the city or town in which such possession occurred, giving such police department
206 a description of the vehicle involved.
207 SECTION 13: Sections 1 through 9 shall not apply to leases in existence before the
208 effective date of this Act. However, such sections shall apply when, after the effective date of
209 this Act, a consumer lease is renegotiated by the same lessee for the same motor vehicle.
210 SECTION 14. Sections 10 and 11 shall not apply to leases in default before the effective
211 date of this Act. However, such sections shall apply where a lease in default before the effective
212 date of this Act at is cured, and then goes into default again after the effective date of this Act.
