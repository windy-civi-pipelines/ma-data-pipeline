55 SECTION 10. Said chapter 255B is hereby further amended by striking out section 20A,
56 and inserting in place thereof the following section:-
57 Section 20A. (a) An agreement of the parties in a retail installment contract or lease
58 agreement defining default is enforceable only to the extent that the default is material and
59 consists of the buyer’s or lessee’s failure to make 1 or more installments as required by the
60 agreement; or the occurrence of an event which substantially impairs the value of the collateral.
61 (b) After a default by a buyer or lessee under a consumer credit transaction or lease
62 agreement, the secured creditor or lessor may not bring an action against the buyer or lessee or
63 proceed against the collateral until he gives the buyer or lessee the notice described in this
64 section. The notice so required shall be deemed to be delivered when delivered to the debtor or
65 when mailed to the debtor at the debtor’s address last known to the creditor. If a buyer or lessee
66 cures a default after receiving notice and again defaults, the creditor or lessor shall give another
67 notice before bringing an action or proceeding against the collateral with respect to the
68 subsequent default, but no notice is required in connection with a subsequent default if, within
69 the period commencing on the date of the consumer credit transaction or lease agreement subject
70 to this section and the date of the subsequent default, the debtor has cured a default after notice 3
71 or more times.
4 of 7
72 (c) The notice shall be in writing and shall be given to the buyer or lessee 10 days or
73 more after the default. The notice shall conspicuously state the rights of the buyer or lessee upon
74 default in substantially the following form:—
75 The heading shall read:—“Rights of Defaulting Buyer or Lessee under the Massachusetts
76 Motor Vehicle Installment Sales Act.” The body of the notice shall read:—“You may cure your
77 default in (describe transaction in a manner enabling buyer or lessee to identify it) by paying to
78 (name and address of creditor or lessor) (amount due) before (date which is at 21 days after
79 notice is mailed). If you pay this amount within the time allowed, you are no longer in default
80 and may continue on with the transaction as though no default had occurred.
81 If you do not cure your default by the date stated above, the said creditor or lessor may
82 sue you to obtain a judgment for the amount of the debt or, if applicable, may take possession of
83 the collateral.
84 If the creditor or lessor takes possession of the collateral, if any, you may get it back by
85 paying the full amount of your debt plus any reasonable expenses incurred by the said creditor or
86 lessor if you make the required payment within 20 days after he takes possession.''
87 (d) During the 21-day period after delivery of the notice required by this section the
88 creditor or lessor may not because of that default accelerate the unpaid balance of the obligation,
89 bring action against the buyer or lessee, or proceed against the collateral.
90 (e) Unless the secured creditor or lessor has first notified the buyer or lessee that he has
91 elected to accelerate the unpaid balance of the obligation because of default, brought action
92 against the buyer or lessee, or proceeded against the collateral, the buyer or lessee may cure a
93 default consisting of a failure to pay money by tendering the amount of all unpaid sums due at
5 of 7
94 the time of tender, without acceleration, plus any unpaid delinquency or deferral charges. Such a
95 cure shall restore the buyer or lessee to his rights under the agreement as though the defaults had
96 not occurred subject to the provisions of subsection (b).
97 SECTION 11. Section 20B of said chapter 255B is hereby amended by striking out
98 subsections (a) to (c), inclusive, and inserting in place thereof the following 3 subsections:-
99 (a) Subject to the provisions of this section and section 20A a secured creditor or lessor
100 under a consumer credit transaction or lease agreement may take possession of collateral. In
101 taking possession the secured creditor or lessor under a consumer credit transaction or lease
102 agreement may proceed without a prior hearing only if the default is material and consists of the
103 debtor’s failure to make 1 or more payments as required by the agreement or the occurrence of
104 an event which substantially impairs the value of the collateral and only if possession can be
105 obtained without use of force, without breach of peace and unless the debtor consents to an entry,
106 at the time of such entry, without entry on property owned by or rented to the debtor.
107 (b) Except as provided in subsection (a) a creditor or lessor under a consumer credit
108 transaction or lease agreement may proceed against collateral only after a prior hearing. In any
109 proceeding where possession of the collateral is part of the relief sought by a holder no court
110 shall allow a secured creditor or lessor to take possession of collateral until the right of the
111 creditor or lessor to take possession has been determined at a hearing at which the buyer or
112 lessee has an opportunity to be heard having been notified in writing of said hearing at least 7
113 days in advance thereof.
114 (c) The buyer or lessee under a consumer credit transaction or lease agreement may
115 redeem the collateral from the holder at any time within 20 days of the creditor’s or lessor’s
6 of 7
116 taking possession of the collateral, or thereafter until the creditor or lessor has either disposed of
117 the collateral, entered into a contract for its disposition, or gained the right to retain the collateral
118 in satisfaction of the buyer’s or lessee’s obligation.
