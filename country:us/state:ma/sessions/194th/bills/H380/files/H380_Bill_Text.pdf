253 Section 7. (a) A licensee can hold a multistate license, issued by their home state, in only
254 one member state at any given time.
255 (b) If a licensee changes their home state by moving between two member states:
256 (1) the licensee shall immediately apply for the reissuance of their multistate license in
257 their new home state. The licensee shall pay all applicable fees and notify the prior home state in
258 accordance with the rules of the commission.

262 home state will be deactivated and all member states notified in accordance with the applicable
263 rules adopted by the commission.
264 (3) prior to the reissuance of the multistate license, the new home state shall conduct
265 procedures for considering the criminal history records of the licensee. Such procedures shall

277 subject to the state requirements for the issuance of a single state license in the new home state.
278 (d) Nothing in this compact shall interfere with a licensee’s ability to hold a single state
279 license in multiple states; however, for the purposes of this compact, a licensee shall have only
280 one home state, and only one multistate license.
281 (e) Nothing in this compact shall interfere with the requirements established by a member
282 state for the issuance of a single state license.

287 have the authority, in accordance with existing state due process law, to:
288 (1) take adverse action against a regulated social worker’s multistate authorization to
289 practice only within that member state, and issue subpoenas for both hearings and investigations
290 that require the attendance and testimony of witnesses as well as the production of evidence.
291 Subpoenas issued by a licensing authority in a member state for the attendance and testimony of
15 of 40

292 witnesses or the production of evidence from another member state shall be enforced in the latter
293 state by any court of competent jurisdiction, according to the practice and procedure of that court
294 applicable to subpoenas issued in proceedings pending before it. The issuing licensing authority
295 shall pay any witness fees, travel expenses, mileage, and other fees required by the service
296 statutes of the state in which the witnesses or evidence are located.
297 (2) only the home state shall have the power to take adverse action against a regulated
298 social worker’s multistate license.
299 (b) For purposes of taking adverse action, the home state shall give the same priority and
300 effect to reported conduct received from a member state as it would if the conduct had occurred
301 within the home state. In so doing, the home state shall apply its own state laws to determine
302 appropriate action.
303 (c) The home state shall complete any pending investigations of a regulated social worker
304 who changes their home state during the course of the investigations. The home state shall also
305 have the authority to take appropriate action(s) and shall promptly report the conclusions of the

313 action.
16 of 40

318 furtherance of any joint or individual investigation initiated under the compact.
319 (g) If adverse action is taken by the home state against the multistate license of a
320 regulated social worker, the regulated social worker’s multistate authorization to practice in all
321 other member states shall be deactivated until all encumbrances have been removed from the
322 multistate license. All home state disciplinary orders that impose adverse action against the
323 license of a regulated social worker shall include a statement that the regulated social worker’s
324 multistate authorization to practice is deactivated in all member states until all conditions of the
325 decision, order or agreement are satisfied.
326 (h) If a member state takes adverse action, it shall promptly notify the administrator of
327 the data system. The administrator of the data system shall promptly notify the home state and all
328 other member state’s of any adverse actions by remote states.
329 (i) Nothing in this compact shall override a member state’s decision that participation in
330 an alternative program may be used in lieu of adverse action.
331 (j) Nothing in this compact shall authorize a member state to demand the issuance of
332 subpoenas for attendance and testimony of witnesses or the production of evidence from another
333 member state for lawful actions within that member state.

334 (k) Nothing in this compact shall authorize a member state to impose discipline against a
335 regulated social worker who holds a multistate authorization to practice for lawful actions within
336 another member state.
337 Section 10. (a) The compact member states hereby create and establish a joint
338 government agency whose membership consists of all member states that have enacted the
339 compact known as the social work licensure compact commission. The commission is an
340 instrumentality of the compact states acting jointly and not an instrumentality of any one state.
341 The commission shall come into existence on or after the effective date of the compact as set
342 forth in section (14).
343 (b) (1) Each member state shall have and be limited to one (1) delegate selected by that
344 member state’s state licensing authority.
345 (2) The delegate shall be either:
346 (i) a current member of the state licensing authority at the time of appointment, who is a
347 regulated social worker or public member of the state licensing authority; or

25 of 40

491 state and impose fees on licensees of member states to whom it grants a multistate license to
492 cover the cost of the operations and activities of the commission and its staff, which must be in a

508 caused by or arising out of any actual or alleged act, error, or omission that occurred, or that the
509 person against whom the claim is made had a reasonable basis for believing occurred within the
510 scope of commission employment, duties or responsibilities; provided that nothing in this
511 paragraph shall be construed to protect any such person from suit or liability for any damage,
26 of 40

512 loss, injury, or liability caused by the intentional or willful or wanton misconduct of that person.
513 The procurement of insurance of any type by the commission shall not in any way compromise
514 or limit the immunity granted hereunder.
515 (2) The commission shall defend any member, officer, executive director, employee, and
516 representative of the commission in any civil action seeking to impose liability arising out of any
517 actual or alleged act, error, or omission that occurred within the scope of commission
518 employment, duties, or responsibilities, or as determined by the commission that the person
519 against whom the claim is made had a reasonable basis for believing occurred within the scope
520 of commission employment, duties, or responsibilities; provided that nothing herein shall be
521 construed to prohibit that person from retaining their own counsel at their own expense; and
522 provided further, that the actual or alleged act, error, or omission did not result from that
523 person’s intentional or willful or wanton misconduct.
524 (3) The commission shall indemnify and hold harmless any member, officer, executive
525 director, employee, and representative of the commission for the amount of any settlement or
526 judgment obtained against that person arising out of any actual or alleged act, error, or omission
527 that occurred within the scope of commission employment, duties, or responsibilities, or that
528 such person had a reasonable basis for believing occurred within the scope of commission
529 employment, duties, or responsibilities, provided that the actual or alleged act, error, or omission
530 did not result from the intentional or willful or wanton misconduct of that person.
531 (4) Nothing herein shall be construed as a limitation on the liability of any licensee for
532 professional malpractice or misconduct, which shall be governed solely by any other applicable
533 state laws.
27 of 40

534 (5) Nothing in this compact shall be interpreted to waive or otherwise abrogate a member
535 state’s state action immunity or state action affirmative defense with respect to antitrust claims
536 under the Sherman Act, Clayton Act, or any other state or federal antitrust or anticompetitive law
537 or regulation.
538 (6) Nothing in this compact shall be construed to be a waiver of sovereign immunity by

544 (c) Notwithstanding any other provision of state law to the contrary, a member state shall
545 submit a uniform data set to the data system on all individuals to whom this compact is
546 applicable as required by the rules of the commission, including:
547 (1) identifying information;
548 (2) licensure data;

28 of 40

554 (6) the presence of current significant investigative information; and

556 protection of the public, as determined by the rules of the commission.
557 (d) The records and information provided to a member state pursuant to this compact or
558 through the data system, when certified by the commission or an agent thereof, shall constitute
559 the authenticated business records of the commission, and shall be entitled to any associated
560 hearsay exception in any relevant judicial, quasi-judicial or administrative proceedings in a
561 member state.
562 (e) Current significant investigative information pertaining to a licensee in any member
563 state will only be available to other member states.
564 (1) It is the responsibility of the member states to report any adverse action against a
565 licensee and to monitor the database to determine whether adverse action has been taken against
566 a licensee. Adverse action information pertaining to a licensee in any member state will be
567 available to any other member state.
568 (f) Member states contributing information to the data system may designate information
569 that may not be shared with the public without the express permission of the contributing state.

572 from the data system.
573 Section 12. (a) The commission shall promulgate reasonable rules in order to effectively
574 and efficiently implement and administer the purposes and provisions of the compact. A rule
29 of 40

575 shall be invalid and have no force or effect only if a court of competent jurisdiction holds that the
576 rule is invalid because the commission exercised its rulemaking authority in a manner that is
577 beyond the scope and purposes of the compact, or the powers granted hereunder, or based upon
578 another applicable standard of review.
579 (b) The rules of the commission shall have the force of law in each member state,
580 provided however that where the rules of the commission conflict with the laws of the member
581 state that establish the member state’s laws, regulations, and applicable standards that govern the
582 practice of social work as held by a court of competent jurisdiction, the rules of the commission
583 shall be ineffective in that state to the extent of the conflict.
584 (c) The commission shall exercise its rulemaking powers pursuant to the criteria set forth
585 in this section and the rules adopted thereunder. Rules shall become binding on the day following
586 adoption or the date specified in the rule or amendment, whichever is later.
587 (d) If a majority of the legislatures of the member states rejects a rule or portion of a rule,
588 by enactment of a statute or resolution in the same manner used to adopt the compact within four
589 (4) years of the date of adoption of the rule, then such rule shall have no further force and effect
590 in any member state.
591 (e) Rules shall be adopted at a regular or special meeting of the commission.
592 (f) Prior to adoption of a proposed rule, the commission shall hold a public hearing and
593 allow persons to provide oral and written comments, data, facts, opinions, and arguments.
30 of 40

594 (g) Prior to adoption of a proposed rule by the commission, and at least thirty (30) days in
595 advance of the meeting at which the commission will hold a public hearing on the proposed rule,
596 the commission shall provide a notice of proposed rulemaking:
597 (1) on the website of the commission or other publicly accessible platform;
598 (2) to persons who have requested notice of the commission’s notices of proposed
599 rulemaking, and
600 (3) in such other way(s) as the commission may by rule specify.
601 (h) The notice of proposed rulemaking shall include:
602 (1) the time, date, and location of the public hearing at which the commission will hear
603 public comments on the proposed rule and, if different, the time, date, and location of the
604 meeting where the commission will consider and vote on the proposed rule;
605 (2) if the hearing is held via telecommunication, video conference, or other electronic
606 means, the commission shall include the mechanism for access to the hearing in the notice of
607 proposed rulemaking;
608 (3) the text of the proposed rule and the reason therefor;
609 (4) a request for comments on the proposed rule from any interested person; and
610 (5) the manner in which interested persons may submit written comments.
611 (i) All hearings will be recorded. A copy of the recording and all written comments and
612 documents received by the commission in response to the proposed rule shall be available to the
613 public.
31 of 40

614 (j) Nothing in this section shall be construed as requiring a separate hearing on each rule.
615 Rules may be grouped for the convenience of the commission at hearings required by this
616 section.
617 (k) The commission shall, by majority vote of all members, take final action on the
618 proposed rule based on the rulemaking record and the full text of the rule.
619 (1) The commission may adopt changes to the proposed rule provided the changes do not
620 enlarge the original purpose of the proposed rule.
621 (2) The commission shall provide an explanation of the reasons for substantive changes
622 made to the proposed rule as well as reasons for substantive changes not made that were
623 recommended by commenters.
624 (3) The commission shall determine a reasonable effective date for the rule. Except for an
625 emergency as provided in subsection (12) of section (l), the effective date of the rule shall be no
626 sooner than 30 days after issuing the notice that it adopted or amended the rule.
627 (l) Upon determination that an emergency exists, the commission may consider and adopt
628 an emergency rule with 48 hours’ notice, with opportunity to comment, provided that the usual
629 rulemaking procedures provided in the compact and in this section shall be retroactively applied
630 to the rule as soon as reasonably possible, in no event later than ninety (90) days after the
631 effective date of the rule. For the purposes of this provision, an emergency rule is one that must
632 be adopted immediately in order to:
633 (1) meet an imminent threat to public health, safety, or welfare;
634 (2) prevent a loss of commission or member state funds;
32 of 40

635 (3) meet a deadline for the promulgation of a rule that is established by federal law or
636 rule; or
637 (4) protect public health and safety.
638 (m) The commission or an authorized committee of the commission may direct revisions
639 to a previously adopted rule for purposes of correcting typographical errors, errors in format,
640 errors in consistency, or grammatical errors. Public notice of any revisions shall be posted on the
641 website of the commission. The revision shall be subject to challenge by any person for a period
642 of thirty (30) days after posting. The revision may be challenged only on grounds that the
643 revision results in a material change to a rule. A challenge shall be made in writing and delivered
644 to the commission prior to the end of the notice period. If no challenge is made, the revision will
645 take effect without further action. If the revision is challenged, the revision may not take effect
646 without the approval of the commission.
647 (n) No member state’s rulemaking requirements shall apply under this compact.
648 Section 13. (a)(1) The executive and judicial branches of state government in each
649 member state shall enforce this compact and take all actions necessary and appropriate to
650 implement the compact.
651 (2) Except as otherwise provided in this compact, venue is proper and judicial
652 proceedings by or against the commission shall be brought solely and exclusively in a court of
653 competent jurisdiction where the principal office of the commission is located. The commission
654 may waive venue and jurisdictional defenses to the extent it adopts or consents to participate in
655 alternative dispute resolution proceedings. Nothing herein shall affect or limit the selection or
33 of 40

656 propriety of venue in any action against a licensee for professional malpractice, misconduct or
657 any such similar matter.
658 (3) The commission shall be entitled to receive service of process in any proceeding
659 regarding the enforcement or interpretation of the compact and shall have standing to intervene
660 in such a proceeding for all purposes. Failure to provide the commission service of process shall
661 render a judgment or order void as to the commission, this compact, or promulgated rules.
662 (b)(1) If the commission determines that a member state has defaulted in the performance
663 of its obligations or responsibilities under this compact or the promulgated rules, the commission
664 shall provide written notice to the defaulting state. The notice of default shall describe the
665 default, the proposed means of curing the default, and any other action that the commission may
666 take, and shall offer training and specific technical assistance regarding the default.
667 (2) The commission shall provide a copy of the notice of default to the other member
668 states.
669 (c) If a state in default fails to cure the default, the defaulting state may be terminated
670 from the compact upon an affirmative vote of a majority of the delegates of the member states,
671 and all rights, privileges and benefits conferred on that state by this compact may be terminated
672 on the effective date of termination. A cure of the default does not relieve the offending state of
673 obligations or liabilities incurred during the period of default.
674 (d) Termination of membership in the compact shall be imposed only after all other
675 means of securing compliance have been exhausted. Notice of intent to suspend or terminate
676 shall be given by the commission to the governor, the majority and minority leaders of the
34 of 40

677 defaulting state’s legislature, the defaulting state’s state licensing authority and each of the
678 member states’ state licensing authority.
679 (e) A state that has been terminated is responsible for all assessments, obligations, and
680 liabilities incurred through the effective date of termination, including obligations that extend
681 beyond the effective date of termination.
682 (f) Upon the termination of a state’s membership from this compact, that state shall
683 immediately provide notice to all licensees within that state of such termination. The terminated
684 state shall continue to recognize all licenses granted pursuant to this compact for a minimum of
685 six (6) months after the date of said notice of termination.
686 (g) The commission shall not bear any costs related to a state that is found to be in default
687 or that has been terminated from the compact, unless agreed upon in writing between the
688 commission and the defaulting state.
689 (h) The defaulting state may appeal the action of the commission by petitioning the U.S.
690 District Court for the District of Columbia or the federal district where the commission has its
691 principal offices. The prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, including
692 reasonable attorney’s fees.
693 (i)(1) Upon request by a member state, the commission shall attempt to resolve disputes
694 related to the compact that arise among member states and between member and non-member
695 states.
696 (2) The commission shall promulgate a rule providing for both mediation and binding
697 dispute resolution for disputes as appropriate.
35 of 40

698 (j)(1) By majority vote as provided by rule, the commission may initiate legal action
699 against a member state in default in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia
700 or the federal district where the commission has its principal offices to enforce compliance with
701 the provisions of the compact and its promulgated rules. The relief sought may include both
702 injunctive relief and damages. In the event judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party
703 shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorney’s fees. The remedies
704 herein shall not be the exclusive remedies of the commission. The commission may pursue any
705 other remedies available under federal or the defaulting member state’s law.
706 (2) A member state may initiate legal action against the commission in the U.S. District
707 Court for the District of Columbia or the federal district where the commission has its principal
708 offices to enforce compliance with the provisions of the compact and its promulgated rules. The
709 relief sought may include both injunctive relief and damages. In the event judicial enforcement is
710 necessary, the prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable
711 attorney’s fees.
712 (3) No person other than a member state shall enforce this compact against the
713 commission.
714 Section 14. (a) The compact shall come into effect on the date on which the compact
715 statute is enacted into law in the seventh member state.
716 (1) On or after the effective date of the compact, the commission shall convene and
717 review the enactment of each of the first seven member states (“charter member states”) to
718 determine if the statute enacted by each such charter member state is materially different than the
719 model compact statute.
36 of 40

720 (i) A charter member state whose enactment is found to be materially different from the
721 model compact statute shall be entitled to the default process set forth in section (13).
722 (ii) If any member state is later found to be in default, or is terminated or withdraws from
723 the compact, the commission shall remain in existence and the compact shall remain in effect
724 even if the number of member states should be less than seven.
725 (2) Member states enacting the compact subsequent to the seven initial charter member
726 states shall be subject to the process set forth in subsection (21) of subsection (c) of section 10 to
727 determine if their enactments are materially different from the model compact statute and
728 whether they qualify for participation in the compact.
729 (3) All actions taken for the benefit of the commission or in furtherance of the purposes
730 of the administration of the compact prior to the effective date of the compact or the commission
731 coming into existence shall be considered to be actions of the commission unless specifically
732 repudiated by the commission.
733 (4) Any state that joins the compact subsequent to the commission’s initial adoption of
734 the rules and bylaws shall be subject to the rules and bylaws as they exist on the date on which
735 the compact becomes law in that state. Any rule that has been previously adopted by the
736 commission shall have the full force and effect of law on the day the compact becomes law in
737 that state.
738 (b) Any member state may withdraw from this compact by enacting a statute repealing
739 the same.

762 or provision of this compact is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be contrary to the

764 States, or the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or circumstance is held to

766 compact and the applicability thereof to any other government, agency, person or circumstance
767 shall not be affected thereby.

773 the compact shall remain in full force and effect as to the remaining member states and in full
774 force and effect as to the member state affected as to all severable matters.
