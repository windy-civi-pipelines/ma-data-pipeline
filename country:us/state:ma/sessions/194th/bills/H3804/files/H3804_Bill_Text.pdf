In the One Hundred and Ninety-Fourth General Court

An Act to improve pedestrian safety.
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives in General Court assembled, and by the authority
of the same, as follows:
1 SECTION 1. Chapter 85 Section 2 of the General Laws, as appearing in the 2024 Official
2 Edition, is hereby amended by inserting in line 61 after the word “prohibited” the following: -
3 “The department’s manual must indicate that where pedestrians who walk slower, use
4 mobility aids, or who walk at slower speeds resulting from transporting, assisting, or conveying
5 another person, routinely use the crosswalk, these factors should be considered in determining
6 the pedestrian clearance time. The department will be responsible for promulgating regulations
7 that direct a municipality to:
8 (a.) create a list of locations within their boundaries that are heavily used by pedestrians
9 who are likely to have: (i.) a slower than average walking speed resulting due to age, (ii.) a
10 slower than average walking speed due to a physical mobility issue, and (iii.) slower walking
11 speeds resulting from transporting, assisting, or conveying another person through a signalized
12 crosswalk.
1 of 2

13 (b.) require that locations contained in said list, where there are signalized crosswalks
14 regularly in use, account for the slower walking speed of pedestrians by adjusting signal walk
15 clearance times to a reasonable degree to allow for pedestrians to safely compete a crossing.”
16 SECTION 2. The administrator of the department of highways will promulgate
17 regulations for the implementation of Section 1 not later than January 1, 2026. Municipalities
18 must be in compliance with said regulations not later than January 1, 2027
