13 of 19

263 action related to the conversion to a mutual bank or as an inducement to vote on the plan of
264 conversion.
265 (j) The provisions on notice to members and voting procedures in this section shall
266 govern the process for converting to a mutual bank notwithstanding other provisions of this
267 chapter or a by-law of the converting credit union to the contrary.

272 those materials considered satisfactory by the commissioner.
273 (l) If the commissioner disapproves of the methods by which the membership votes were
274 taken or the procedures applicable to the votes, the commissioner may direct that a new vote be
275 taken. If the commissioner does not disapprove of the methods by which the membership vote
276 was taken within 10 days after the notification is given, the vote shall be considered approved.

278 credit union members or if the conversion to a credit union is approved by the boards of a mutual
279 savings or co-operative bank and the commissioner receives notification from the converting
280 mutual savings bank, co-operative bank or credit union that approvals required under state and
