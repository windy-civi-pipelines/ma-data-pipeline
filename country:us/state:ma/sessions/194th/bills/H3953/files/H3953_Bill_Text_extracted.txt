Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives in General Court assembled, and by the authority
of the same, as follows:
1 SECTION 1. The inspector of buildings or building commissioner, as defined in section 3
2 of chapter 143 of the General Laws, of the town of Hanson, or their designee, the planning board
3 of the town of Hanson, or the zoning board of the town of Hanson, each hereinafter the licensing
4 authority, may deny, revoke or suspend any license or permit, including renewals and transfers,
5 of any applicant for any license or permit, hereinafter an applicant, or any licensee or permit
6 holder, who has been determined by any public official or body entitled to set or enforce orders
7 of conditions for properties located within the town, hereinafter the conditioning authority, to
8 have not completed or complied with conditions of approvals for any other projects licensed or
9 permitted by the town. The licensing authority shall provide written notice to the applicant or
1 of 3
10 licensee or permit holder, within 14 days of the decision to deny, revoke or suspend, and shall
11 grant the applicant or licensee or permit holder a hearing, to be held not earlier than 14 days after
12 said notice.
13 SECTION 2. Any findings made by the licensing authority with respect to such license or
14 permit denial, revocation or suspension under this act shall be made only for the purpose of such
15 proceeding and shall not be relevant to or introduced in any other proceeding at law, except for

17 or revoked under this act shall not be reissued or renewed until the licensing authority receives a
18 certificate issued by the conditioning authority that the applicant or licensee or permit holder
19 complied with such conditions as of the date of issuance of said certificate.
20 SECTION 3. Any applicant or licensee or permit holder may enter into an agreement for
21 a limitation to a license or permit, which may include a bond, escrow or other source of

24 upon the satisfactory compliance with said agreement. Failure to comply with said agreement
25 shall be grounds for the suspension or revocation of said license or permit; provided, however,
26 that the applicant or licensee or permit holder be given notice and a hearing as required pursuant
27 to this act.
28 SECTION 4. The board of selectmen may waive such denial, suspension or revocation if
29 it finds there is no direct or indirect business interest by the property owner, its officers or
30 stockholders, if any, or members of their immediate family, as defined in section 1 of chapter
2 of 3
31 268A of the General Laws, in the business or activity conducted in or on said property that is the

34 burning pursuant to section 13 of chapter 48 of the General Laws; (ii) bicycle permits pursuant to
35 section 11B of chapter 85 of the General Laws; (iii) sales of articles for charitable purposes
