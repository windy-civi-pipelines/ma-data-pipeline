120 incentivize the reduction of toxics and resources including energy and water associated with
121 mattress production; (B) incentivize the use of post-consumer recycled content in mattress; and
122 (C) discourage the use of mattress materials that pose challenges for the recycling of discarded
123 mattresses; and (ii) the scope of discarded mattresses in the commonwealth that are not being
124 collected as part of the mattress recycling program and recommendations on how to direct the
125 discarded mattresses to, and include them, in the mattress recycling program.

131 (3) The study shall review how the department shall expand the employment social
132 enterprise impact program established in subsection (e), including recommendations for
133 continued social enterprise involvement with the statewide mattress recycling program including
134 a review of opportunities to increase additional community impacts through preferred
135 partnerships with local non-profit social enterprises and organizations that recycle mattresses and
7 of 12

136 policy recommendations to reduce potential barriers to entry in the statewide mattress recycling
137 program for social enterprise organizations.
138 (4) Results of the study will be used to establish any changes to the fee structure or
139 overall mattress recycling program design. The department shall maintain all records relating to
140 the mattress recycling program for a period of not less than 3 years.
141 (f) The department shall include in its plan a new innovation grant program to provide
142 funding to support eligible entities to carry out research and new pilot projects, including the
143 purchase of equipment and capital building expenses, aimed at advancing the goal of increased
144 sustainability for the field of mattress recycling. Through this grant program, the department
145 shall focus on supporting innovations that particularly advance recycling related to materials
146 within the mattress that are most challenging to recycle. Eligible services shall include research
147 and implementation related to material processing innovations or the creation of new products
148 made from recycled mattress materials.
149 (g) The department shall include in its plan and all future plans, the establishment of a
150 new employment social enterprise impact pilot program based on written recommendations
151 provided by the commissioner. The goal of the program shall be to foster the sustainability of

153 economic development and environmental justice through the provision of work opportunities in
154 mattress recycling for individuals facing significant barriers to employment. The department
155 shall include in its plan the most recent language for the employment social enterprise capital
156 grant program pursuant to line item 7002-0083 of section 2 of chapter 238 of the acts of 2024.
