In the One Hundred and Ninety-Fourth General Court
(2025-2026)
_______________
An Act to protect workers from extreme temperatures.
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives in General Court assembled, and by the authority
of the same, as follows:
1 Chapter 149 of the General Laws is hereby amended by adding the following section:-
2 Section 204. (a) The general court hereby finds and declares that:
3 (i) Workers who are exposed to extreme heat or cold or work in extreme temperature
4 environments may be at risk of heat or cold stress.
5 (ii) Exposure to extreme heat can result in occupational illnesses, injuries and death,
6 including heat stroke, heat exhaustion, heat cramps or heat rashes.
7 (iii) Exposure to extreme cold can result in occupational illness, injuries and death,
8 including hypothermia, frostbite or trench foot.
9 (iv) Each year, thousands of workers become sick from occupational heat and cold
10 exposure, and too many of those illnesses result in fatalities.
1 of 17

11 (v) Employees new to working in the heat are most vulnerableâ€”nearly 3 out of 4
12 workers who die from heat-related causes die in their first week on the job.
13 (vi) Under the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act, employers are responsible
14 for providing workplaces free of known safety and health hazards. This includes protecting
15 workers from temperature-related hazards including evaluating the temperature and all
16 contributing factors to heat and cold stress, metabolic workloads, radiant and conductive heat
17 sources, humidity, air movement and wearing of protective equipment. Employers must ensure a
18 safe workplace by implementing a plan to reduce exposure to hazardous temperatures through
19 providing paid rest breaks, adequate shade or warmth, adequate drinking water, training for
20 supervisors and staff and other key elements to protect workers.
21 (b) For the purposes of this section, the following words shall, unless the context clearly
22 requires otherwise, have the following meanings:-
23 "Acclimatization", the temporary physiological adaptation of the body to work in hot
24 environments that occurs gradually; provided that, during an acclimatization period, no person
25 shall be exposed to no more than 20 per cent of the usual duration of work in the hot
26 environment on day 1 and no more than a 20 per cent increase each day; and provided further,
27 that most people acclimatize within 7 to 14 workdays.
28 "Administrative control", a method to limit exposure to a hazard by adjustment of work
29 procedures, practices, or schedules. Examples of administrative controls that may be effective at
30 minimizing the risk of heat or cold illness in a particular work area include but are not limited to:
31 acclimatizing employees, rotating employees, scheduling work earlier or later in the day,
32 organizing work location and tasks at certain times of the day to avoid direct sunlight, using
2 of 17

33 work and rest schedules, reducing work intensity or speed, reducing work hours and changing
34 required work clothing.
35 "Cold illness", a serious medical condition resulting from the body's inability to cope
36 with cold temperatures including but not limited to trench foot, frostbite, hypothermia and
37 chilblains.
38 "Cold wave", any day in which there is a rapid fall in temperature within a 24-hour period
39 requiring substantially increased protection to agriculture, industry, commerce and social
40 activities.
41 "Cool-down area", an indoor or outdoor area blocked from direct sunlight and shielded
42 from other high radiant heat sources and is either open to the air or provided with ventilation or
43 cooling. One indicator that blockage is sufficient is when objects do not cast a shadow in the area
44 of blocked sunlight. A cool-down area does not include a location where: (i) environmental risk
45 factors defeat the purpose of allowing the body to cool; (ii) employees are exposed to unsafe or
46 unhealthy conditions; or (iii) employees are deterred or discouraged from accessing or using the
47 cool-down area.
48 "Drinking water", fresh, pure, cool potable water, less than 75 degrees Fahrenheit,
49 provided free of charge to employees. The term drinking water includes electrolyte-replenishing
50 beverages that do not contain caffeine.
51 "Employee", any person providing labor or services within the scope of this section for
52 remuneration for a private entity or business within the commonwealth, without regard to an
53 individual's immigration status including but not limited to private and public sector workers,
54 part-time workers, independent contractors, day laborers, farmworkers and other temporary and
3 of 17

55 seasonal workers. The term employee shall also include individuals working for staffing
56 agencies, contractors or subcontractors on behalf of the employer at any individual worksite, as
57 well as any individual delivering goods or transporting people at, to or from the worksite on
58 behalf of the employer, regardless of whether delivery or transport is conducted by an individual
59 or entity that would otherwise be deemed an employer under this section.
60 "Employer", any individual, partnership, association, corporation, limited liability
61 company, business trust, legal representative, public entity or any organized group acting as
62 employer within the scope of this section.
63 "Engineering control", the use of substitution, isolation, ventilation and equipment
64 modification to reduce exposure to heat illness related workplace hazards and job tasks.
65 Examples of engineering controls that may be effective at minimizing the risk of heat illness in a
66 particular work area include but are not limited to isolation of hot processes, isolation of
67 employees from sources of heat, air conditioning, cooling fans, cooling mist fans, evaporative
68 coolers, natural ventilation where the outdoor temperature and heat index is lower than the
69 indoor temperature and heat index, local exhaust ventilation, shielding from a radiant heat source
70 and insulation of hot surfaces.
71 "Heat illness", a serious medical condition resulting from the body's inability to cope with
72 a particular heat load including but not limited to heat cramps, heat exhaustion, heat syncope and
73 heat stroke.
74 "Heat wave", any day in which the predicted high temperature for the day will be at least
75 10 degrees Fahrenheit higher than the average high daily temperature in the preceding 5 days.
4 of 17

76 "Indoor temperature stress threshold", a heat stress threshold of 80 or more degrees
77 Fahrenheit and a cold threshold of 60 or below degrees Fahrenheit. In cases of offices, schools or
78 other indoor temperature regulated environments, the indoor temperature shall fall between 68.5
79 and 75 degrees when the outdoor temperature is below 55 degrees, and when the outdoor
80 temperature is above 85 degrees, the indoor temperature shall fall between 75 and 80.5 degrees.
81 "Indoor worksite", any enclosed work vehicles and any space between a floor and ceiling
82 bound on all sides by walls except where noted in the definition of outdoor worksite. A wall
83 includes any door, window, retractable divider, garage door or other physical barrier that is
84 permanent, open or closed.
85 "Outdoor temperature stress threshold", a heat stress threshold of 80 or more degrees
86 Fahrenheit and a cold threshold of 60 or below degrees Fahrenheit.
87 "Outdoor worksite", all employers with employees performing work in an outdoor
88 environment. The term outdoor worksite includes locations such as sheds, tents, greenhouses or
89 other structures where work activities are conducted inside, but the temperature is not managed
90 by devices that reduce heat or cold exposure and aid in heating or cooling, such as air
91 conditioning systems or heaters; provided, that having only fans or humidifiers may still qualify
92 worksites as outdoor. The term outdoor worksite does not apply to incidental exposure, which
93 exists when an employee is required to perform a work activity outdoors for not longer than 15
94 minutes in any 60-minute period.
95 "Personal protective equipment" or "PPE", the protective gear, uniforms and clothing to
96 withstand temperatures at or exceeding the stress thresholds. Where feasible engineering controls
97 and administrative controls are not sufficient to reduce and maintain the temperature and heat
5 of 17

98 index to below 87 degrees Fahrenheit when employees are present or the temperature to below
99 82 degrees Fahrenheit where employees wear clothing that restricts heat removal or work in high
100 radiant heat areas, personal heat protective equipment shall be used to minimize the risk of heat
101 illness, except to the extent that the employer demonstrates that use of such equipment is
102 infeasible.
103 "Preventative cool-down rest", a rest taken in a cool-down area to prevent overheating.
104 "Temperature", the temperature measured by a globe thermometer, which is a type of
105 apparent temperature used to estimate the effect of temperature, humidity, wind speed and
106 visible and infrared radiation on humans. The globe thermometer may not be shielded from
107 direct exposure to radiant heat while the globe temperature is being measured.
108 "Union representative", a recognized or certified collective bargaining agent representing
109 a group of employees.
110 (c)(1) The employer shall fulfill the following requirements when employees are in an
111 outdoor or indoor worksite and experiencing conditions at or exceeding a heat stress threshold of
112 80 or more degrees Fahrenheit:
113 (i) The employer shall develop a written program to mitigate heat-related illnesses and
114 injuries experienced by employees. The written program shall identify and incorporate work
