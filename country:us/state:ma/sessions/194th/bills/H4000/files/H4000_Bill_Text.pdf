The Commonwealth of Massachusetts
_______________
In the One Hundred and Ninety-Fourth General Court
(2025-2026)
_______________
An Act making appropriations for the fiscal year 2026 for the maintenance of the departments,
boards, commissions, institutions, and certain activities of the commonwealth, for interest,
sinking fund, and serial bond requirements, and for certain permanent improvements.
Whereas, The deferred operation of this act would tend to defeat its purpose, which is
immediately to make appropriations for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2025, and to make
certain changes in law, each of which is immediately necessary or appropriate to effectuate said
appropriations or for other important public purposes, therefore it is hereby declared to be an
emergency law, necessary for the immediate preservation of the public convenience.
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives in General Court assembled, and by the authority
of the same, as follows:
SECTION 1. To provide for the operations of the several departments, boards,
commissions and institutions of the commonwealth and other services of the commonwealth and
for certain permanent improvements and to meet certain requirements of law, the sums set forth
in this act, for the several purposes and subject to the conditions specified, are hereby
appropriated from the General Fund unless specifically designated otherwise, subject to the
provisions of law regulating the disbursement of public funds and the approval thereof for the
fiscal year ending June 30, 2026. All sums appropriated under this act, including supplemental
and deficiency budgets, shall be expended in a manner reflecting and encouraging a policy of
nondiscrimination and equal opportunity for members of minority groups, women and persons
with a disability. All officials and employees of an agency, board, department, commission or
division receiving funds under this act shall take affirmative steps to ensure equality of
opportunity in the internal affairs of state government and in their relations with the public,
including those persons and organizations doing business with the commonwealth. Each agency,
board, department, commission and division of the commonwealth, in spending appropriated
sums and discharging its statutory responsibilities, shall adopt measures to ensure equal
opportunity in the areas of hiring, promotion, demotion or transfer, recruitment, layoff or
termination, rates of compensation, in-service or apprenticeship training programs and all other
terms and conditions of employment.

SECTION 1A. In accordance with Articles LXIII and CVII of the Articles of Amendment to the Constitution of the
Commonwealth and section 6D of chapter 29 of the General Laws, it is hereby declared that the amounts of revenue set
forth in this section by source for the respective funds of the commonwealth for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2026 are
necessary and sufficient to provide the means to defray the appropriations and expenditures from such funds for said
fiscal year as set forth and authorized in this act. The comptroller shall keep a distinct account of actual receipts from
each such source by each such fund to furnish the executive office for administration and finance and the house and
senate committees on ways and means with quarterly statements comparing such receipts with the projected receipts
set forth in this section, and include a full statement comparing such actual and projected receipts in the annual report
for said fiscal year pursuant to section 12 of chapter 7A of the General Laws. The quarterly and annual reports shall also

Fiscal Year 2026 Budget Recommendations
SECTION 3 LOCAL AID DISTRIBUTIONS.
SECTION 3. Notwithstanding any general or special law to the contrary, for the fiscal year ending
June 30, 2026 the distribution of unrestricted general government aid to cities and towns of the balance of
the State Lottery and Gaming Fund, as paid from the General Fund in accordance with clause (c) of the
second paragraph of section 35 of chapter 10 of the General Laws, and additional funds from the General
Fund and the Gaming Local Aid Fund, shall be $1,308,713,668 and shall be apportioned to cities and towns
in accordance with this section.
For fiscal year 2026 the total amounts to be distributed and paid to each city, town and regional
school district from item 7061-0008 of section 2 and item 1596-2438 of section 2F, shall be as set forth in
the following lists. If there is conflict between the language of this section and the distribution listed below,
the distribution below shall control. The specified amounts distributed from said item 7061-0008 of said
section 2 and said item 1596-2438 of said section 2F shall be deemed in full satisfaction of the amounts
due under chapter 70 of the General Laws.
For fiscal year 2026, a district’s school aid shall be calculated according to the provisions of said
chapter 70. The foundation budget category of “low-income enrollment” for the purpose of calculating
foundation enrollment shall be determined by financial eligibility for certain federal programs, as defined by
the provisions of section 2 of said chapter 70, and including a number of students identified and approved
as low income through the supplemental claiming system established and posted by the department for
that purpose, as well as students identified and approved as homeless for purposes of calculating the
McKinney-Vento homelessness grant program administered by the department, consistent with the
conditions provided for in said section 2. The assumed special education enrollment percentage for
vocational school students shall be set at 4.90 per cent and the assumed special education enrollment
percentage for non-vocational school students shall be set at 3.90 per cent.
The per-pupil rates for the employee benefits and fixed charges allotments shall be adjusted by the
foundation employee benefits inflation rate and the per-pupil rates for all other foundation allotments shall
be adjusted by the foundation inflation index. Foundation increments shall be the additional resources
provided for the education of students designated as English learners or low-income; provided, however,
that for low-income students the amount of the foundation increment shall be determined by the low-income
group into which each district is assigned. Foundation budget rates for employee benefits and fixed
charges, guidance and psychological services, special education out-of-district tuition, English learners and
low-income students shall be increased by three-sixths of the gap between the rates used in fiscal year
2021 and the rates established in tables 1 and 2 of section 3 of said chapter 70, consistent with adjustments
prescribed in said section 3 and set at the rates identified in the table below. Required local contributions
shall be calculated pursuant to said chapter 70; provided, that municipal revenue growth factors shall be
calculated in a manner consistent with calculations made in fiscal year 2025; provided further, that the total
statewide target local contribution shall be 59 percent and the effort reduction percentage shall be 100
percent; and provided further that the minimum aid per pupil dollar amount shall be $150.
Chapter 70 aid for fiscal year 2026 shall be the greater of: (i) foundation aid, or (ii) the sum of base
aid and minimum aid. No non-operating district shall receive chapter 70 aid in an amount greater than the
district’s foundation budget.
The department of elementary and secondary education shall not consider health care costs for
retired teachers to be part of net school spending for any district in which such costs were not considered
part of net school spending in fiscal year 1994 and for any district that has not accepted the provisions of
section 260 of chapter 165 of the acts of 2014; provided, however, that any district for whom such costs
are not so considered shall have included as part of net school spending an amount equal to the increase
in the foundation budget for the district associated with health care costs of retired teachers.
No payments to cities, towns or counties maintaining an agricultural school under this section shall
be made after November 30 of the fiscal year until the commissioner of revenue certifies acceptance of the
prior fiscal year’s annual financial reports submitted under section 43 of chapter 44 of the General Laws.
Advance payments shall be made for some or all of periodic local reimbursement or assistance programs
to any city, town, regional school district or independent agricultural school that demonstrates an
242

emergency cash shortfall, as certified by the commissioner of revenue and approved by the secretary of
administration and finance, under guidelines established by the secretary.

194 commonwealth; and (ii) the value of any real or tangible property: (A) not included in the federal
