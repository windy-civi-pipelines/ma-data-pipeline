MAURA T. HEALEY KIMBERLEY DRISCOLL
GOVERNOR LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR
April 2, 2025
I am filing for your consideration a bill entitled An Act Making Appropriations for Fiscal
Year 2025 to Provide for Supplementing Certain Existing Appropriations and for Certain Other
Activities and Projects.
This legislation provides additional resources for our most time-sensitive deficiencies to
ensure the continuation of critical state services and programs. The Administration continues to
prioritize good fiscal management of the budget, which has been even more important during
these times of high inflation and federal uncertainty.
The bill appropriates $756.3 million gross ($544.7 million net cost to the state) to ensure
the maintenance of vital programs, pay for our obligations in a timely manner, and keep our
commitments to key priorities.
I am recommending $189.6 million for our child care financial assistance programs to
support the significant progress that we have made in helping families access affordable care.
This investment will ensure that our providers receive the aid needed to offer our children the
best care possible.
This budget also includes $60 million ($0 net cost to the state) for the Executive Office of
Aging & Independence’s most vital direct care services, including home care services. This
additional funding will ensure continued access for our aging residents in need of acute care.
In addition, I am proposing $42.9 million for the Residential Assistance for Families in
Transition (RAFT) Program, which provides resources to keep families at risk of eviction in their
homes. This bill also provides $15.5 million ($7.8 million net cost to the state) for the
1 of 2
replacement of electronic benefits transfer cards with more secure cards to help combat food
benefit theft.
I am also seeking $10 million to provide enhanced support for our local and regional
emergency medical services providers. This new funding will reimburse providers for
extraordinary costs incurred to provide services.
Other key appropriations include:
• $240 million for state employee health care costs under the Group Insurance
Commission
• $134.5 million for supplemental payments to safety net hospitals through the
Medical Assistance Trust Fund, which are wholly offset by federal reimbursements
• $15 million for grants and marketing supports related to the 250th anniversary of
the American Revolution
• $5.8 million for annuity payments to veterans, recently increased under the HERO
Act
• $4.2 million for the State Police Crime Lab to ensure the timely review of
evidence
Additionally, notable outside sections include:
• Permitting MEMA vehicles to use red and blue lights when responding to
emergency situations
• Increasing construction procurement thresholds for DCAMM projects in line with
recent recommendations from the Public Construction Working Group
• Makes technical corrections to recently passed legislation
I want to reiterate my support for this legislation and the funding recommendations
contained within. Sufficient revenues are available to finance the appropriations and other
proposed measures, and I urge you to promptly consider and enact this legislation.
Respectfully submitted,
Maura T. Healey,
Governor

_______________
An Act making appropriations for fiscal year 2025 to provide for supplementing certain existing

of the same, as follows:
1 SECTION 1. To provide for supplementing certain items in the general appropriation act

79 (b) The assessed amount for acute hospitals and ambulatory surgical centers shall be not less

81 the expenses of the commission minus amounts collected from: (i) filing fees; (ii) fees and
82 charges generated by the commission; and (iii) federal matching revenues received for these
83 expenses or received retroactively for expenses of predecessor agencies. Each acute hospital and
84 ambulatory surgical center shall pay such assessed amount multiplied by the ratio of the acute
85 hospital’s and ambulatory surgical center's gross patient service revenues to the total gross
86 patient service revenues of all such hospitals and ambulatory surgical centers. Each acute
87 hospital and ambulatory surgical center shall make a preliminary payment to the commission on
88 October 1 of each year in an amount equal to 1/2 of the previous year’s total assessment.
89 Thereafter, each acute hospital and ambulatory surgical center shall pay, within 30 days’ notice
90 from the commission, the balance of the total assessment for the current year based upon its most
91 current projected gross patient service revenue. The commission shall subsequently adjust the
92 assessment for any variation in actual and estimated expenses of the commission and for changes
93 in acute hospital and ambulatory surgical center gross patient service revenue. Such estimated
94 and actual expenses shall include an amount equal to the cost of fringe benefits and indirect

105 than 10 per cent of the amount appropriated by the general court for the expenses of the
106 commission minus amounts collected from: (i) filing fees; (ii) fees and charges generated by the
107 commission; and (iii) federal matching revenues received for these expenses or received
108 retroactively for expenses of predecessor agencies. Each pharmaceutical manufacturing company

123 commonwealth for whom they manage pharmaceutical benefits on behalf of carriers.
124 (e) Each pharmaceutical manufacturing company and each pharmacy benefit manager shall make

174 minus amounts collected from: (i) filing fees; (ii) fees and charges generated by the center’s
175 publication or dissemination of reports and information; and (iii) federal matching revenues

179 Commonwealth to the total outpatient prescription drug revenue of all manufacturers derived
180 from sales within the Commonwealth.

HOUSE DOCKET, NO. 4540 FILED ON: 4/2/2025
HOUSE . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . No. 4003
OFFICE OF THE GOVERNOR
COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS
STATE HOUSE · BOSTON, MA 02133
(617) 725-4000
MAURA T. HEALEY KIMBERLEY DRISCOLL
GOVERNOR LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR
April 2, 2025
To the Honorable Senate and House of Representatives,
I am filing for your consideration a bill entitled An Act Making Appropriations for Fiscal
Year 2025 to Provide for Supplementing Certain Existing Appropriations and for Certain Other
Activities and Projects.
This legislation provides additional resources for our most time-sensitive deficiencies to
ensure the continuation of critical state services and programs. The Administration continues to
prioritize good fiscal management of the budget, which has been even more important during
these times of high inflation and federal uncertainty.
The bill appropriates $756.3 million gross ($544.7 million net cost to the state) to ensure
the maintenance of vital programs, pay for our obligations in a timely manner, and keep our
commitments to key priorities.
I am recommending $189.6 million for our child care financial assistance programs to
support the significant progress that we have made in helping families access affordable care.
This investment will ensure that our providers receive the aid needed to offer our children the
best care possible.
This budget also includes $60 million ($0 net cost to the state) for the Executive Office of
Aging & Independence’s most vital direct care services, including home care services. This
additional funding will ensure continued access for our aging residents in need of acute care.
In addition, I am proposing $42.9 million for the Residential Assistance for Families in
Transition (RAFT) Program, which provides resources to keep families at risk of eviction in their
homes. This bill also provides $15.5 million ($7.8 million net cost to the state) for the
1 of 2

replacement of electronic benefits transfer cards with more secure cards to help combat food
benefit theft.
I am also seeking $10 million to provide enhanced support for our local and regional
emergency medical services providers. This new funding will reimburse providers for
extraordinary costs incurred to provide services.
Other key appropriations include:
• $240 million for state employee health care costs under the Group Insurance
Commission
• $134.5 million for supplemental payments to safety net hospitals through the
Medical Assistance Trust Fund, which are wholly offset by federal reimbursements
• $15 million for grants and marketing supports related to the 250th anniversary of
the American Revolution
• $5.8 million for annuity payments to veterans, recently increased under the HERO
Act
• $4.2 million for the State Police Crime Lab to ensure the timely review of
evidence
Additionally, notable outside sections include:
• Permitting MEMA vehicles to use red and blue lights when responding to
emergency situations
• Increasing construction procurement thresholds for DCAMM projects in line with
recent recommendations from the Public Construction Working Group
• Makes technical corrections to recently passed legislation
I want to reiterate my support for this legislation and the funding recommendations
contained within. Sufficient revenues are available to finance the appropriations and other
proposed measures, and I urge you to promptly consider and enact this legislation.
Respectfully submitted,
Maura T. Healey,
Governor

76 Section 6. (a) Each acute hospital, ambulatory surgical center, pharmaceutical manufacturing

78 estimated expenses of the commission.
79 (b) The assessed amount for acute hospitals and ambulatory surgical centers shall be not less
80 than 30 per cent nor more than 40 per cent of the amount appropriated by the general court for
81 the expenses of the commission minus amounts collected from: (i) filing fees; (ii) fees and
82 charges generated by the commission; and (iii) federal matching revenues received for these
83 expenses or received retroactively for expenses of predecessor agencies. Each acute hospital and
84 ambulatory surgical center shall pay such assessed amount multiplied by the ratio of the acute
85 hospital’s and ambulatory surgical center's gross patient service revenues to the total gross
86 patient service revenues of all such hospitals and ambulatory surgical centers. Each acute
87 hospital and ambulatory surgical center shall make a preliminary payment to the commission on
88 October 1 of each year in an amount equal to 1/2 of the previous year’s total assessment.
89 Thereafter, each acute hospital and ambulatory surgical center shall pay, within 30 days’ notice
90 from the commission, the balance of the total assessment for the current year based upon its most
91 current projected gross patient service revenue. The commission shall subsequently adjust the
92 assessment for any variation in actual and estimated expenses of the commission and for changes
93 in acute hospital and ambulatory surgical center gross patient service revenue. Such estimated
94 and actual expenses shall include an amount equal to the cost of fringe benefits and indirect
95 expenses, as established by the comptroller under section 5D of chapter 29. In the event of late

99 to such assessments and the commission shall reimburse the treasurer for such advances upon
100 receipt of such revenues. This section shall not apply to any state institution or to any acute
101 hospital which is operated by a city or town.
102 (c) To the maximum extent permissible under federal law, and provided that such assessment
103 will not result in any reduction of federal financial participation in Medicaid, the assessed
104 amount for pharmaceutical manufacturing companies shall be not less than 5 per cent nor more
105 than 10 per cent of the amount appropriated by the general court for the expenses of the
106 commission minus amounts collected from: (i) filing fees; (ii) fees and charges generated by the
107 commission; and (iii) federal matching revenues received for these expenses or received
108 retroactively for expenses of predecessor agencies. Each pharmaceutical manufacturing company
109 shall pay such assessed amount multiplied by the ratio of the manufacturer’s total outpatient
110 prescription drug revenue derived from the sales within the Commonwealth to the total
111 outpatient prescription drug revenue of all manufacturers derived from sales within the

113 (d) To the maximum extent permissible under federal law, and provided that such assessment

116 cent of the amount appropriated by the general court for the expenses of the commission minus
117 amounts collected from: (i) filing fees; (ii) fees and charges generated by the commission; and

6 of 40

122 total of all such claims paid by all pharmacy benefit managers attributed to residents of the
123 commonwealth for whom they manage pharmaceutical benefits on behalf of carriers.
124 (e) Each pharmaceutical manufacturing company and each pharmacy benefit manager shall make
125 a preliminary payment to the commission annually on October 1 in an amount equal to 1/2 of the
126 previous year's total assessment. Thereafter, each pharmaceutical manufacturing company and

174 minus amounts collected from: (i) filing fees; (ii) fees and charges generated by the center’s
175 publication or dissemination of reports and information; and (iii) federal matching revenues
176 received for these expenses or received retroactively for expenses of predecessor agencies. Each

179 Commonwealth to the total outpatient prescription drug revenue of all manufacturers derived
180 from sales within the Commonwealth.
181 (d) To the maximum extent permissible under federal law, and provided that such assessment
