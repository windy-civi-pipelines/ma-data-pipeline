Pursuant to the provisions of Article II, Section 8, Paragraph 1, Clause (2) of the
Amendments to the Constitution, as appearing in Article LXXXIX of said Amendments, I am
filing for your consideration the attached legislation entitled “An Act Validating the Results of
the Special Election Held in the Town of Hardwick on January 18, 2025.”
I am filing this special legislation at the request of the Town of Hardwick’s Select Board.
The legislation ratifies all acts and proceedings taken by the Town at its special election
held on January 18, 2025. The ratification serves to resolve any question that might arise from
the fact that the election was inadvertently held more than ninety days after the October 17,
2024, town meeting at which the preceding Proposition 2 ½ borrowing authorization and
appropriation vote was adopted. Through the ballot question, the voters of Hardwick approved a
debt exclusion for an $860,000 bond to pay for the costs of a new fire truck. Hardwick’s current
fire truck is thirty-seven years old, past the end of its useful life. The Town has already
contracted for a replacement, which is ready for delivery.
Although the election was inadvertently held three days after the statutory deadline, the
Town otherwise complied with all statutory requirements. Timely ratification of the results of
the election is necessary to permit the Town to proceed with issuing the bond and purchasing a
new fire truck. I therefore urge your prompt consideration of this bill.
Respectfully submitted,
Maura T. Healey,
Governor
