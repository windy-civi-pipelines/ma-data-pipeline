An Act establishing a sick leave bank for Dana Johnson.
Whereas, The deferred operation of this act would tend to defeat its purpose, which is to
establish forthwith a sick leave bank for a certain employee of the Massachusetts Department of
Children and Families, therefore it is hereby declared to be an emergency law, necessary for the
immediate preservation of the public convenience.
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives in General Court assembled, and by the authority
of the same, as follows:
1 Notwithstanding any general or special law to the contrary, the Massachusetts
2 Department of Children and Families shall establish a sick leave bank for Dana Johnson, an
3 employee of the Department of Children and Families. Any employee of the Department may
4 voluntarily contribute 1 or more sick, personal or vacation days to the sick leave bank for use by
5 Dana Johnson. If Dana Johnson terminates employment with the Department of Children and
6 Families or requests to dissolve the sick leave bank, any remaining time in the sick leave bank
7 shall be transferred to the extended illness leave bank. Sick leave bank days shall not be used for
8 absences unrelated to the illness or disability that necessitated the establishment of the sick leave
9 bank as determined by the Department.
