260 possession in excess of the allowable amount if it is stored in a locked container within their
261 residence for adult use. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, personal cultivation does not
262 permit commercial sales or rights granted by a cultivation license.

264 the psilocybin is a noncommercial transaction and a psilocybin permit is provided to demonstrate

282 (b) No support services certification establishes any licensure, certification or other
283 authority to provide therapy, coaching or treatment in connection with adult use of psilocybin,

11 of 28

222 $200 and the permit application shall not exceed $80 for the first year of the programs
223 implemented under this chapter and may not be increased more than 2 per cent each year. A

260 possession in excess of the allowable amount if it is stored in a locked container within their
261 residence for adult use. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, personal cultivation does not
262 permit commercial sales or rights granted by a cultivation license.
263 (24) A psilocybin permit holder may provide psilocybin to other permit holders only if
264 the psilocybin is a noncommercial transaction and a psilocybin permit is provided to demonstrate
13 of 28

265 authorization under this chapter. A permit holder is prohibited from the transfer of psilocybin as
266 a remunerated commercial transaction unless authorized to do so as a licensed cultivator as
267 contemplated in section 5 of this chapter.
268 (25) A licensed healthcare provider may, within scope of practice, offer professional

279 to training and satisfaction of requirements to provide non-medical, non-therapeutic and non-
280 directive risk reduction support services to increase the health and safety of a permit holder
281 during adult use of psilocybin.
282 (b) No support services certification establishes any licensure, certification or other
283 authority to provide therapy, coaching or treatment in connection with adult use of psilocybin,
284 but support services providers are not precluded from contracting or providing separately for
285 such services.
14 of 28

326 (p) A support services provider shall require confirmation of a valid psilocybin permit
327 and review the health screening form provided by the permit holder engaging support services
328 prior to provision of services during the adult use of psilocybin authorized under this chapter. A
16 of 28

329 permit holder shall confirm accuracy of responses on the health screening form before each
330 instance of support services.
331 (q) The department shall allocate a portion of the proceeds and tax revenue generated in
332 connection with the programs provided under this chapter to subsidize compensation for support
333 services providers engaged by low-income individuals with psilocybin permits seeking

353 (u) This chapter allows the licensed professionals to share patient-approved information
354 with support service providers through lawful disclosures and agreements, such as consistent
355 with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, as applicable.
356 Section 6. (a) For the purposes of this chapter, psilocybin-containing fungi shall not
357 constitute a "food" or "food product," as defined by chapter 94, to be distinguished from fungi
358 that do not contain psilocybin that are cultivated under controlled conditions.
359 (b) The department may issue a cultivator license to a cultivator of psilocybin-containing
360 fungi to cultivate and engage in commercial transactions of psilocybin-containing fungi
361 consistent with this chapter to psilocybin permit holders. Cultivation of psilocybin-containing
