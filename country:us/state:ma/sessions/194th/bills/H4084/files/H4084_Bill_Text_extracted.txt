An Act relative to a surcharge on the 988 system.
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives in General Court assembled, and by the authority
of the same, as follows:
1 SECTION 1. Section 18A of chapter 6A of the General Laws, as appearing in the 2022
2 Official Edition, is hereby amended by inserting after the definition of “Enhanced 911 systems”
3 the following 2 definitions:-
4 “Enhanced 988 service”, a service consisting of communication network, database and
5 equipment features provided for subscribers or end users of communication services enabling
6 such subscribers or end users to reach a PSAP by dialing the digits 988, or by other means
7 approved by the 988 crisis hotline center established in section 16EE, that directs calls to
8 appropriate PSAPs based on selective routing and provides the capability for automatic number
9 identification and automatic location identification.
10 “Enhanced 988 systems”, a distinct entity or geographical segment that enhanced 911
11 service is provided, consisting of network routing elements serving as a control office and
1 of 7
12 trunking connecting all central offices within a geographical segment, and including PSAPs and
13 network used to deliver location data to PSAPs from a data base.
14 SECTION 2. Said chapter 6A is hereby further amended by inserting, after section
15 18H½, the following section:-
16 Section 18H¾. (a)(1) There shall be imposed on each subscriber or end user whose
17 communication services are capable of accessing and utilizing an enhanced 988 system, a
18 surcharge in the amount of 75 cents per month for expenses associated with services provided
19 under section 16EE. For wireline enhanced 988 service, the charge shall be imposed on each
20 voice grade exchange telephone line of business and residence customers within the
21 commonwealth, but the surcharge applicable to centrex service and ISDN primary rate interface
22 service shall be based on an equivalency ratio provided to each private branch exchange trunk.
23 For wireless enhanced 988 service, the charge shall be imposed per wireless mobile telephone
24 number, based on the area code chosen by the subscriber or end user. With the approval of the
25 department, a wireless carrier may impose this surcharge based on the subscriber's or end user's
26 billing address or other manner consistent with federal law. For interconnected VoIP provider
27 service, the charge shall be imposed on each voice grade telephone line of business and residence
28 customers within the commonwealth, but the surcharge applicable to such interconnected VoIP
29 provider service that is comparable to centrex service and ISDN primary rate interface service
30 associated with wireline enhanced 988 service shall be based on an equivalency ratio similar to
31 that used for wireline enhanced 988 service. For IP–enabled service, the charge shall be imposed
32 based on the subscriber's or end user's billing address in the commonwealth except for
33 interconnected VoIP provider service, unless a different method is approved by the department.
34 For prepaid wireless service, the department shall promulgate regulations establishing an
2 of 7
35 equitable and reasonable method for the remittance and collection of the surcharge or surcharge
36 amounts for such service. For all other services not identified above, the surcharge shall be
37 imposed based on the subscriber's billing address in the commonwealth, unless a different
38 method is approved by the department.
39 (2) The surcharge shall be collected by the communication service provider and shall be
40 shown on the subscriber's or end user's bill as 988 Service Surcharge or an appropriate
41 abbreviation. The surcharge shall not be subject to sales or use tax. The subscriber or end user
42 shall be liable for the surcharge imposed under this section and the communication service
43 provider shall not be financially liable for surcharges billed on behalf of the commonwealth, but
44 not collected from subscribers or end users. Partial subscriber or end user payments shall be first
45 applied to outstanding communication service provider charges.
46 (b) The department may petition the department of telecommunications and cable for an
47 adjustment in the surcharge established in subsection (a). The department of telecommunications
48 and cable shall be responsible for establishing the new surcharge, and all future surcharges, upon
49 petition of the department. The department of telecommunications and cable, at its discretion but
50 not more than once per calendar year, may investigate the prudence of the department's revenue
51 and expenditures for the purpose of recalculating the surcharge, and may hire experts to assist in
52 its investigation. The reasonable cost of such experts shall be charged to the Enhanced 988 Fund
53 established by section 35 JJ½ of chapter 10, but in no event shall such cost exceed $200,000,
54 which may be adjusted to reflect changes in the consumer price index. The department of
55 telecommunications and cable shall conduct its review and issue a decision within 90 days of the
56 date of the commencement of the investigation, but the surcharge shall be deemed approved if
57 the department of telecommunications and cable does not issue its decision within such 90 days.
3 of 7
58 The department of telecommunications and cable shall adopt rules that provide for the funding of
59 prudently incurred expenses associated with services provided by section 16EE, by means of the
60 surcharge. The department shall report annually to the department of telecommunications and
61 cable on the financial condition of the Enhanced 988 Fund and on the department's assessment of
62 new developments affecting the enhanced 988 system. The report shall be submitted to the
63 department of telecommunications and cable within 60 days of the end of each fiscal year. The
64 department of telecommunications and cable shall file an annual report with the clerks of the
65 house of representatives and the senate relative to the financial condition of the Enhanced 988
66 Fund.
67 (c) The department shall seek the approval of the department of telecommunications and
68 cable for projected total expenditures that exceed total expenditures of the previous fiscal year by
69 10 per cent or more. The department of telecommunications and cable may investigate the
70 reasonableness of the expenditures and shall conduct its review and issue a decision within 90
71 days from the date the department files its request for approval, but the request for approval shall
72 be deemed approved if the department of telecommunications and cable does not issue its
73 decision within such 90 days. The department of telecommunications and cable shall notify the
74 department of its intent to investigate within 20 days of the date the department files its request
75 for approval. The department's request for approval shall be deemed approved in the absence of
76 the department of telecommunication and cable's notification to the department of its intent to
77 investigate. If the department of telecommunication and cable notifies the department that it
78 intends to investigate an expenditure, the department of telecommunications and cable may hire
79 experts to assist in its investigation. The reasonable cost of the experts shall be charged to the
4 of 7
80 Enhanced 988 Fund, but in no event shall such cost exceed $200,000, which may be adjusted to
81 reflect changes in the consumer price index.

83 from its subscribers or end users to the state treasurer for deposit in the Enhanced 988 Fund. The
84 surcharge revenues shall be expended for the administration and programs of the department
85 including, but not limited to, salaries, enhanced 988 training programs, enhanced 988 public
86 education programs and maintenance of the programs mandated by section 16EE and for the
87 implementation and administration of enhanced 988 service in the commonwealth.
88 (e) Each communication service provider required to remit surcharge revenues shall
89 submit to the department and the department of telecommunications and cable information on its
90 business entity including, but not limited to, name, business address, contact person and their
91 business telephone number, fax number and e-mail address of such contact person. Each such
92 provider shall update this information annually.
93 (f) Each communication service provider shall report to the department on a monthly
94 basis the total surcharge revenues collected from its subscribers or end users during the
95 preceding month, the total uncollected surcharge revenues from subscribers or end users during
96 the preceding month, the total amount billed to the department for administration costs to cover
97 the expenses of billing, collecting and remitting the surcharge during the preceding month and
98 the total amount billed to the department for non-recurring and recurring costs associated with
99 any service, operation, administration or maintenance of enhanced 988 service during the
100 preceding month. Such monthly report shall not be a public record under clause Twenty-sixth of
101 section 7 of chapter 4 or section 10 of chapter 66.

103 for enhanced 988 service, or upon request consistent with federal law, to a municipal, state or
104 federal law enforcement agency, the department of telecommunications and cable, the FCC or
105 the department, the telephone number and street address or location of any telephone used to
106 place a 988 call, and any other call data or information required by the FCC to be transmitted to a
107 PSAP.

109 shall be used, consistent with federal law, only for the purpose of responding to emergency calls,
110 administering and operating the enhanced 988 system and providing enhanced 988 service or for
111 use in any ensuing investigation or prosecution, including the investigation of false or

113 service provider or officers, directors, employees, vendors or agents shall be liable in any action
114 to any person for releases of information authorized by this section or for civil action resulting
115 from or caused by such providers for participation or omissions in the development, installation,
116 operation, maintenance, performance or provision of enhanced 988 service except for wanton or
117 willful misconduct. Release to or use by any person of a communication service provider's
118 subscriber or end user information or data for any use other than the purposes enumerated in this
119 subsection shall be prohibited. Notwithstanding any general or special law to the contrary, such
120 information or data shall not be a public record under clause Twenty-sixth of section 7 of chapter
121 4 or section 10 of chapter 66, except that aggregated information that does not identify or
