In the One Hundred and Ninety-Fourth General Court
(2025-2026)
_______________
An Act making appropriations for the fiscal year 2025 to provide for supplementing certain
existing appropriations and for certain other activities and projects.
Whereas, The deferred operation of this act would tend to defeat its purposes, which are
forthwith to make supplemental appropriations for fiscal year 2025 and to make certain changes
in law, each of which is immediately necessary to carry out those appropriations or to
accomplish other important public purposes, therefore it is hereby declared to be an emergency
law, necessary for the immediate preservation of the public convenience.
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives in General Court assembled, and by the authority
of the same, as follows:
1 SECTION 1. To provide for supplementing certain items in the general appropriation act
2 and other appropriation acts for fiscal year 2025, the sums set forth in section 2 are hereby
3 appropriated from the General Fund unless specifically designated otherwise in this act or in
4 those appropriation acts, for the several purposes and subject to the conditions specified in this
5 act or in those appropriation acts, and subject to the laws regulating the disbursement of public
6 funds for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2025. These sums shall be in addition to any amounts
7 previously appropriated and made available for the purposes of those items. These sums shall be
8 made available through the fiscal year ending June 30, 2025.
