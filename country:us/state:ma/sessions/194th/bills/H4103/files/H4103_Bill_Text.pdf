By Representative Higgins of Leominster and Senator Cronin, a joint petition (subject to Joint
Rule 12) of Natalie M. Higgins and John J. Cronin for legislation to establish a sick leave bank
for Steven Forget, an employee of the Worcester County Sheriff’s Office. Public Service.

_______________
In the One Hundred and Ninety-Fourth General Court
(2025-2026)
_______________
An Act establishing a sick leave bank for Steven Forget, an employee of the Worcester County
Sheriff’s Office.
Whereas, The deferred operation of this act would tend to defeat its purpose, which is to
establish forthwith a sick leave bank for a certain employee of the Worcester County Sheriff’s
Office, therefore it is hereby declared to be an emergency law, necessary for the immediate
preservation of the public convenience.
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives in General Court assembled, and by the authority
of the same, as follows:
1 Notwithstanding any general or special law to the contrary, the Worcester County
2 Sheriff’s Office shall establish a sick leave bank for Steven Forget, an employee of the office.
3 Any employee of the office may voluntarily contribute 1 or more sick, personal or vacation days
4 to the sick leave bank for use by Steven Forget. If Steven Forget terminates employment with the
5 office or requests to dissolve the sick leave bank, any remaining time in the sick leave bank shall
6 be transferred to the extended illness leave bank. Sick leave bank days shall not be used for
7 absences unrelated to the illness or disability that necessitated the establishment of the sick leave
8 bank as determined by the office.
