An Act to establish an emergency medical services treatment-in-place (TIP) pilot program.
Whereas, The deferred operation of this act would tend to defeat its purpose, which is to
establish a pilot program to improve emergency medical services in the commonwealth,
therefore it is hereby declared to be an emergency law, necessary for the immediate preservation
of the public convenience.
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives in General Court assembled, and by the authority
of the same, as follows:
1 (a) For the purpose of this act, the following terms shall, unless the context clearly

4 General Laws.
5 “Department”, the department of public health.
6 “Emergent medical condition”, a medical condition manifesting itself by acute symptoms
7 of sufficient severity, including severe pain that a prudent layperson, who possesses an average
8 knowledge of health and medicine, could reasonably expect the absence of immediate medical
9 attention to result in: (i) placing the health of the individual or, with respect to a pregnant
1 of 4

10 woman, the health of the woman or her unborn child in serious jeopardy; (ii) serious impairment
11 to bodily functions; or (iii) serious dysfunction of any bodily organ or part. With respect to a
12 pregnant woman who is having contractions that: (A) there is inadequate time to effect a safe
13 transfer to another hospital before delivery; (B) transfer may pose a threat to the health or safety
14 of the woman or the unborn child; or (C) an urgent, unexpected and usually dangerous situation
15 that poses an immediate risk to health, life, property or environment and requires immediate
16 action.
17 “Emergency medical services”, the pre-hospital assessment and treatment and other
18 services utilized in responding to an emergency or provided during the transport of patients to
19 appropriate health care facilities as defined in regulations promulgated by the department.
20 “EMS”, emergency medical services.

22 organizations, including municipal fire departments and private ambulance services, delivering

28 this act.
2 of 4

29 “Treat-in-place”, a model of emergency medical care that allows emergency medical
30 technicians and paramedics to treat patients at the scene or through telehealth services without
31 requiring transport to an emergency department for non-emergent medical conditions.
32 (b) The department, in collaboration with the board, shall establish a 3-year pilot program
33 to test, evaluate and advance treat-in-place models for EMS in the commonwealth. The program
34 shall: (i) improve access to EMS for aging residents; (ii) enhance patient care; (iii) reduce
35 unnecessary emergency department visits; and (iv) create innovative financial models to support
36 EMS systems in the commonwealth.
37 (c) Emergency medical services providers within the commonwealth shall be allowed to

39 service providers serving populations with high percentages of Medicare and Medicaid
40 beneficiaries or communities with limited access to emergency departments in hospitals.
41 (d) Emergency medical service providers participating in the program may: (i) administer
42 medical care at the scene of an emergency or through telehealth consultations for non-emergent
43 conditions; (ii) coordinate follow-up care with primary care providers or urgent care clinics; or
44 (iii) refer patients to community health resources or other appropriate services.
45 (e) The department shall develop and test alternative payment models for emergency
46 medical service providers that incorporate reimbursement for treat-in-place services, in lieu of
47 payment solely based on patient transport to an emergency department in a hospital.
48 (f) The department shall collaborate with the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid
49 Services to align the program’s reimbursement structures with existing federal programs.
3 of 4

50 (g) Emergency medical service providers participating in the program shall receive

56 and patient advocacy groups to ensure the program addresses the needs of patients, providers and
57 communities in the commonwealth.
58 (j) Subject to appropriation, the department shall allocate funding necessary to support
59 the implementation and evaluation of the program.
60 (k) The department shall prepare an annual report that shall include: (i) an evaluation of
61 the program’s effectiveness in improving access to EMS care; (ii) analysis of cost savings and
62 financial sustainability; (iii) collected data by emergency medical service providers pursuant to
63 subsection (h); and (iv) any recommendations for expansion of the treat-in-place model or the
64 program. The annual report shall be submitted, not later than December 31 of each year, to the

66 health care financing and the clerks of the house of representatives and senate.
