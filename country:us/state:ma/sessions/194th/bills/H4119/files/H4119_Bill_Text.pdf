389 contributing state.
390 (e) Any information submitted to the coordinated database that is subsequently required
391 to be expunged by the laws of the member state contributing the information shall be removed
392 from the coordinated database.

20 of 28

394 (a) The commission shall exercise its rulemaking powers pursuant to the criteria set forth
395 in this section and the rules adopted thereunder. Rules and amendments shall become binding as
396 of the date specified in each rule or amendment.
397 (b) If a majority of the legislatures of the member states rejects a rule, by enactment of a
398 statute or resolution in the same manner used to adopt the compact, then such rule shall have no
399 further force and effect in any member state.
400 (c) Rules or amendments to the rules shall be adopted at a regular or special meeting of
401 the commission.
402 (d) Prior to promulgation and adoption of a final rule or rules by the commission and at
403 least 60 days in advance of the meeting at which the rule will be considered and voted upon, the
404 commission shall file a notice of proposed rulemaking:

414 their intention to attend the public hearing and any written comments.
415 (f) Prior to adoption of a proposed rule, the commission shall allow persons to submit
416 written data, facts, opinions and arguments, which shall be made available to the public.
417 (g) The commission shall grant an opportunity for a public hearing before it adopts a rule
418 or amendment if a hearing is requested by:

422 (h)(1) If a hearing is held on the proposed rule or amendment, the commission shall
423 publish the place, time and date of the scheduled public hearing.
424 (2) All persons wishing to be heard at the hearing shall notify the executive director of
425 the commission or other designated member in writing of their desire to appear and testify at the
426 hearing not less than 5 business days before the scheduled date of the hearing.
427 (3) Hearings shall be conducted in a manner providing each person who wishes to
428 comment a fair and reasonable opportunity to comment orally or in writing.
429 (4) No transcript of the hearing is required, unless a written request for a transcript is
430 made, in which case the person requesting the transcript shall bear the cost of producing the
431 transcript. A recording may be made in lieu of a transcript under the same terms and conditions
22 of 28

432 as a transcript. This subsection shall not preclude the commission from making a transcript or
433 recording of the hearing if it so chooses.
434 (5) Nothing in this section shall be construed as requiring a separate hearing on each rule.
435 Rules may be grouped for the convenience of the commission at hearings required by this
436 section.
437 (6) Following the scheduled hearing date or by the close of business on the scheduled
438 hearing date if the hearing was not held, the commission shall consider all written and oral
439 comments received.
440 (j) The commission shall, by majority vote of all members, take final action on the
441 proposed rule and shall determine the effective date of the rule, if any, based on the rulemaking
442 record and the full text of the rule.
443 (k) If no written notice of intent to attend the public hearing by interested parties is
444 received, the commission may proceed with promulgation of the proposed rule without a public
445 hearing.
446 (l) Upon determination that an emergency exists, the commission may consider and adopt
447 an emergency rule without prior notice, opportunity for comment or hearing, provided that the
448 usual rulemaking procedures provided in the compact and in this section shall be retroactively
449 applied to the rule as soon as reasonably possible, in no event later than 90 days after the
450 effective date of the rule. For the purposes of this subsection, an emergency rule is one that must

460 posted on the website of the commission. The revision shall be subject to challenge by any
461 person for a period of 30 days after posting. The revision may be challenged only on grounds
462 that the revision results in a material change to a rule. A challenge shall be made in writing and
463 delivered to the chair of the commission prior to the end of the notice period. If no challenge is
464 made, the revision shall take effect without further action. If the revision is challenged, the
465 revision may not take effect without the approval of the commission.

467 (a)(1) The executive, legislative and judicial branches of state government in each
468 member state shall enforce this compact and take all actions necessary and appropriate to
469 effectuate the compact's purposes and intent. The provisions of this compact and the rules
470 promulgated hereunder shall have standing as statutory law.
471 (2) All courts shall take judicial notice of the compact and the rules in any judicial or
472 administrative proceeding in a member state pertaining to the subject matter of this compact that
473 may affect the powers, responsibilities or actions of the commission.
24 of 28

474 (3) The commission may receive service of process in any such proceeding and shall
475 have standing to intervene in such a proceeding for all purposes. Failure to provide service of
476 process to the commission shall render a judgment or order void as to the commission, this
477 compact or promulgated rules.
478 (b)(1) If the commission determines that a member state has defaulted in the performance
479 of its obligations or responsibilities under this compact or the promulgated rules, the commission
480 shall:
481 (i) Provide written notice to the defaulting state and other member states of the nature of
482 the default, the proposed means of curing the default or any other action to be taken by the
483 commission; and
484 (ii) Provide remedial training and specific technical assistance regarding the default.
485 (2) If a state in default fails to cure the default, the defaulting state may be terminated
486 from the compact upon an affirmative vote of a majority of the member states and all rights,
487 privileges and benefits conferred by this compact may be terminated on the effective date of
488 termination. A cure of the default does not relieve the offending state of obligations or liabilities
489 incurred during the period of default.
490 (3) Termination of membership in the compact shall be imposed only after all other
491 means of securing compliance have been exhausted. Notice of intent to suspend or terminate
492 shall be given by the commission to the governor, the majority and minority leaders of the
493 defaulting state's legislature and each of the member states.
25 of 28

494 (4) A state that has been terminated is responsible for all assessments, obligations and
495 liabilities incurred through the effective date of termination, including obligations that extend
496 beyond the effective date of termination.
497 (5) The commission shall not bear any costs related to a state that is found to be in default
498 or that has been terminated from the compact, unless agreed upon in writing between the
499 commission and the defaulting state.
500 (6) The defaulting state may appeal the action of the commission by petitioning the U.S.
501 District Court for the District of Columbia or the federal district where the commission has its
502 principal offices. The prevailing member shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, including
503 reasonable attorney's fees.
504 (c)(1) Upon request by a member state, the commission shall attempt to resolve disputes
505 related to the compact that arise among member states and between member and non-member
506 states.
507 (2) The commission shall promulgate a rule providing for both mediation and binding
508 dispute resolution for disputes as appropriate.
509 (d)(1) The commission, in the reasonable exercise of its discretion, shall enforce the
510 provisions and rules of this compact.
511 (2) By majority vote, the commission may initiate legal action in the United States
512 District Court for the District of Columbia or the federal district where the commission has its
513 principal offices against a member state in default to enforce compliance with the provisions of
514 the compact and its promulgated rules and bylaws. The relief sought may include both injunctive
26 of 28

515 relief and damages. In the event judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing member shall
516 be awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorney's fees.
517 (3) The remedies provided in this chapter shall not be the exclusive remedies of the
518 commission. The commission may pursue any other remedies available under federal or state
519 law.
520 Section 14. Date of implementation of the interstate commission for EMS personnel
521 practice and associated rules, withdrawal and amendment.
522 (a) The compact shall come into effect on the date on which the compact statute is
523 enacted into law in the 10th member state. The provisions, which become effective at that time,
524 shall be limited to the powers granted to the commission relating to assembly and the
525 promulgation of rules. Thereafter, the commission shall meet and exercise rulemaking powers
526 necessary to the implementation and administration of the compact.
527 (b) Any state that joins the compact subsequent to the commission's initial adoption of
528 the rules shall be subject to the rules as they exist on the date on which the compact becomes law
529 in that state. Any rule that has been previously adopted by the commission shall have the full
530 force and effect of law on the day the compact becomes law in that state.
531 (c)(1) Any member state may withdraw from this compact by enacting a statute repealing
532 the same.
533 (2) A member state's withdrawal shall not take effect until 6 months after enactment of
534 the repealing statute.
27 of 28

535 (3) Withdrawal shall not affect the continuing requirement of the withdrawing state's
536 EMS authority to comply with the investigative and adverse action reporting requirements of this
537 act prior to the effective date of withdrawal.
538 (d) Nothing contained in this compact shall be construed to invalidate or prevent any
539 EMS personnel licensure agreement or other cooperative arrangement between a member state
540 and a non-member state that does not conflict with the provisions of this compact.
541 (e) This compact may be amended by the member states. No amendment to this compact
542 shall become effective and binding upon any member state until it is enacted into the laws of all
543 member states.
544 Section 15. Construction.
545 This compact shall be liberally construed so as to effectuate the purposes thereof. If this
546 compact shall be held contrary to the constitution of any state member thereto, the compact shall
547 remain in full force and effect as to the remaining member states. Nothing in this compact
548 supersedes state law or rules related to licensure of EMS entities.
