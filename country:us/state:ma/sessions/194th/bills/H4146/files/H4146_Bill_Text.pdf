6 government so that it is accountable, transparent, innovative, stable, ethical, representative, and
7 responsible, and wishing to participate fully in exercising the rights and responsibilities of local

701 there shall be printed on the ballots the names of candidates exceeding twice the number to be
702 elected. If at the expiration of the time for filing statements of candidates to be voted for at any

707 board of election commissioners shall not print those names on the ballot to be used at the
708 preliminary election and no other nomination to the office shall be made.

766 following receipt of a proposed petition, deliver a copy of the petition to the city solicitor. The
767 city solicitor shall, not more than 15 days following receipt of a copy of the petition, advise the
768 city council or the school committee in writing as to whether the measure as proposed may
769 lawfully be proposed by the initiative process. If the opinion of the city solicitor is that the
37 of 54

770 measure is not in proper form, the reply shall state the reasons for this opinion in full. A copy of
771 the opinion of the city solicitor shall be mailed to the members of the petitioners’ committee.
772 (c) If the opinion of the city solicitor is that the petition is in a proper form, the board
773 of election commissioners shall provide blank forms for the use of subsequent signers and shall

786 number of voters as of the date of the most recent city election. The board of election
787 commissioners of voters shall attach to the petition a certificate showing the results of its
788 examination and shall return the petition to the city clerk or to the secretary of the school
789 committee, depending on how the petition is addressed. A copy of the board of election

795 without change; (ii) passing a measure stated to be in lieu of the initiative measure; or (iii)
796 rejecting it. The passage of a measure in lieu of an initiative measure shall be considered a
797 rejection of the initiative measure. If the city council or the school committee does not act with
798 respect to an initiative measure that is presented to it not more than 30 days following the date
799 the measure is returned to it, the measure shall be deemed to have been rejected on the thirtieth

806 supplemental initiative petition shall be signed by a number of additional voters that is not less
807 than 7 per cent of the total number of voters as of the date of the most recent city election. The
808 signatures on the initial petition filed under subsection (c) and the signatures on the supplemental
809 petition filed under this subsection, taken together, shall contain the signatures of not less than 12
810 percent of the total number of voters in the city. If the number of signatures to this supplemental
811 petition is found to be sufficient by the city clerk, the city council shall call a special election to
812 be held on a date fixed by it not less than 35 days nor more than 90 days following the date of the
813 certificate of the city clerk that a sufficient number of voters have signed the supplemental
814 initiative petition and shall submit the proposed measure, without alteration, to the voters for
39 of 54

815 determination; provided, however, that if another city election is to be held not more than 180
816 days following the date of the certificate of the city clerk that a sufficient number of voters have
817 signed the supplemental initiative petition, the city council may omit the calling of such special
818 election and cause the question to appear on the election ballot at such regular city election for
819 determination by the voters.
820 (f) The full text of an initiative measure that is to be submitted to the voters shall be
821 published in at least 1 local newspaper not less than 7 days but not more than 14 days before the
