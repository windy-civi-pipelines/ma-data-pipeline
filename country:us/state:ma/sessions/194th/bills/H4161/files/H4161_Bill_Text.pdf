The Commonwealth of Massachusetts
_______________
In the One Hundred and Ninety-Fourth General Court
(2025-2026)
_______________
An Act relative to a sick leave bank for Mark Kratman, an employee of the Massachusetts
Department of Transportation.
Whereas, The deferred operation of this act would tend to defeat its purpose, which is to
establish forthwith a sick leave bank for a certain employee of the Massachusetts Department of
Transportation, therefore it is hereby declared to be an emergency law, necessary for the
immediate preservation of the public convenience.
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives in General Court assembled, and by the authority
of the same, as follows:
1 Notwithstanding any general or special law to the contrary, the Massachusetts
2 Department of Transportation shall establish a sick leave bank for Mark Kratman, an employee
3 of the Massachusetts Department of Transportation. Any employee of the Massachusetts
4 Department of Transportation may voluntarily contribute 1 or more sick, personal, or vacation
5 days to the sick leave bank for use by Mark Kratman. If Mark Kratman terminates employment
6 with the Massachusetts Department of Transportation or requests to dissolve the sick leave bank,
7 any remaining time in the sick leave bank shall be transferred to the Massachusetts Department
8 of Transportation paid leave bank. Sick leave bank days shall not be used for absences unrelated
9 to the illness or disability that necessitated the establishment of the sick leave bank as determined
10 by the Massachusetts Department of Transportation.
