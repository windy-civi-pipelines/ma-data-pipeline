27 (b) There shall be an accessory dwelling unit local initiative, hereafter referred to as

29 accessory dwelling units that increase housing diversity, create affordable housing options and
30 foster supportive living arrangements among residents in participating municipalities. The

31 program shall allow for diverse occupancy relationships between residents of primary dwellings
32 and accessory dwelling units, including but not limited to:

34 (ii) family care arrangements, where a family member resides in the accessory dwelling

44 shall include, at minimum, the following requirements:
45 (i) no less than a 10-year term during which the accessory dwelling unit shall be rented to
46 a household earning not more than 80 per cent of the area median income in the form of an
47 affordable housing restriction;
48 (ii) provisions for the agreement to be recorded at the registry of deeds as a restriction
49 running with the land pursuant to the fifth paragraph of section 31 of chapter 184;
3 of 6

50 (iii) provisions for yearly income certification of tenants, to be reported to the
51 municipality;
52 (iv) pursuant to section 95 of chapter 59, a requirement that a property with an accessory

55 (v) provisions that if the income restrictions are violated, the property shall be assessed at
56 full market value until compliance with the agreement is restored;

58 agreement;
59 (7) a requirement that the accessory dwelling unit comply with all applicable state
60 building and sanitary codes; and
61 (8) a statement that discrimination based on race, color or national origin is prohibited in
62 an owner-occupied dwelling and ADU.
63 (d) A municipality that establishes an ADU-LI under this section shall submit its
64 proposed agreement to the executive office for approval. Upon the executive office's approval of
65 a municipality's agreement, any local initiative unit created under the program shall be eligible
66 for inclusion in the municipality's subsidized housing inventory.
67 (e) There shall be established a grant program to encourage the municipal creation and
68 preservation of ADU-LI units and participation by homeowners and occupants. The executive
69 office shall administer the grant program and may award grants, subject to appropriation,
70 covering up to 20 per cent of the development costs for an accessory dwelling unit where the
4 of 6

71 property owner commits to maintaining affordable housing for occupancy by persons at or below
72 80 per cent of area median income for a period of at least 10 years. The executive office shall
73 establish eligibility criteria, application procedures and verification methods for the ADU-LI
74 grant program.
75 (f) Notwithstanding any general or special law to the contrary, a municipality may award
76 grants or loans from any municipal affordable housing trust, community preservation fund or
77 other dedicated funding for the preservation or development of local initiative units.
78 (g) The executive office shall establish a statewide resident matching service to connect
79 homeowners with potential compatible residents for local initiative units. The service shall:
80 (i) provide screening and verification services;
81 (ii) offer model agreements for home owners and residents; and
82 (ii) provide ongoing support services to facilitate successful long-term relationships.
83 (h) The executive office shall, pursuant to chapter 30A, promulgate regulations to
84 implement this section.
85 SECTION 2. Chapter 59 of the General Laws is hereby amended by adding the following
86 section:-

88 chapter 23B shall be determined under section 38 solely based on its participation in the ADU-LI
89 program as set forth in said section 31. The board of assessors shall assess such land at
90 valuations based upon the guidelines established under the provisions of chapter 58, but in no
5 of 6
