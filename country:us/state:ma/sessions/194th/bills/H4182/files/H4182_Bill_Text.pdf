An Act establishing a sick leave bank for Jato Charlotin, an employee of Massachusetts
Department of Transportation.
Whereas, The deferred operation of this act would tend to defeat its purpose, which is to
establish forthwith a sick leave bank for a certain employee of the Massachusetts Department of
Transportation, therefore it is hereby declared to be an emergency law, necessary for the
immediate preservation of the public convenience.
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives in General Court assembled, and by the authority
of the same, as follows:
1 Notwithstanding any general or special law to the contrary, Massachusetts Department of
2 Transportation shall establish a sick leave bank for Jato Charlotin, an employee of the
3 Massachusetts Department of Transportation. Any employee of the Massachusetts Department of
4 Transportation may voluntarily contribute 1 or more sick, personal or vacation days to the sick
5 leave bank for use by Jato Charlotin. If Jato Charlotin terminates employment with the
6 Massachusetts Department of Transportation or requests to dissolve the sick leave bank, any
7 remaining time in the sick leave bank shall be transferred to the extended illness leave bank. Sick
8 leave bank days shall not be used for absences unrelated to the illness or disability that
