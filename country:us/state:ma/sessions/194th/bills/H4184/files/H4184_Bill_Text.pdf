May 30, 2025
To the Honorable Senate and House of Representatives,
Pursuant to the provisions of Article II, Section 8, Paragraph 1, Clause (2) of the
Amendments to the Constitution, as appearing in Article LXXXIX of said Amendments, I am
filing for your consideration the attached legislation entitled, “An Act Authorizing the Town of
Scituate to Grant Four Additional Licenses for the Sale of All Alcoholic Beverages to be Drunk
on the Premises.”
At the request of the Select Board of the Town of Scituate, I am filing this special
legislation to allow the Town to grant four additional licenses for the sale of all alcoholic
beverages to be drunk on premises. Two new restaurants in the Town are currently operating
under seasonal liquor licenses set to expire in January 2026, while a third location permitted for
development is awaiting a license before moving forward with the construction of a restaurant.
The Town has also been approached by multiple businesses seeking to open new restaurants if
and when additional liquor licenses become available.
This uptick in economic activity centers around two MBTA community districts located
adjacent to commuter rail stations, the North Scituate and Greenbush neighborhoods, where
mixed use development projects are underway. A varied and active restaurant scene will be
essential to attracting people to live in and visit these districts and to patronize local businesses.
Scituate recognizes the need to act expeditiously to support growth in these communities.
Due to the timing of these requests for liquor licenses, this petition was not included in
the Warrant for Scituate’s most recent Annual Town Meeting, and the Town will not be able to
take up the matter until their next Town Meeting in the Spring of next year. This legislation will
allow the Town to grant the additional liquor licenses in a timely manner, providing a critical

foundation for transit-oriented development in the area to succeed. I therefore urge your prompt
consideration of this bill.
Respectfully submitted,
Maura T. Healey,
Governor
