555 available to them for the collection of the indebtedness and shall be contingent on such terms and
556 conditions as the commission shall determine.

573 licensee from the delinquent list under this section, except for approval of court-appointed
574 receivers or trustees under a voluntary assignment for the benefit of creditors; provided, that
575 prior approval of such assignment shall be obtained from the commission after notice to all
576 creditors has been given and reasonable time allowed for objections by all creditors.
