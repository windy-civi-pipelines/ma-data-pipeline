6 and is enrolled in Medicare or MassHealth, irrespective of any health plan or provider network
7 limitation and subject to all others terms and conditions of the memberâ€™s benefit plan. In such
8 situations where an existing contractual relationship between the health plan and the hospital or
9 specialist provider does not exist, the provider shall be reimbursed by the One Care or SCO plan

13 (1) To ensure continued access to primary, specialist, and hospital care for our most
14 vulnerable members MassHealth shall require any One Care or SCO plan and provider that has
15 terminated a contract that includes the provision of health care services to One Care or SCO
16 members, to allow impacted members to continue to receive services from their primary care,
17 specialist provider, or any inpatient or outpatient hospital subject to the termination, under the
18 terms of the pre-existing contract, for twelve months following the expiration of any continuity
19 of care requirements that may follow the contractual termination. During this period, plans shall
20 be required to maintain all contractual terms and conditions that were in effect with the provider
21 prior to the notice of termination being sent by either party, including but not limited to
22 reimbursement, unless mutually agreed upon by the plan and the provider. Plans and providers
23 shall be prohibited from using this provision to avoid using good faith efforts to negotiate
24 contractual arrangements."
