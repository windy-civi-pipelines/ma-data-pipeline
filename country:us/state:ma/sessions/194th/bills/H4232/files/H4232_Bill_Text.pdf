542 reversed unless at least twenty percent (20%) of the registered voters shall vote to disapprove
543 such action. The questions so submitted shall be stated upon the ballot in substantially the same
544 language and form in which they were stated when presented to said representative Town
545 meeting by the moderator as appears from the records of the said meeting. If such petition is not
