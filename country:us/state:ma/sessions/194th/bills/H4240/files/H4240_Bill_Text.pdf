The Commonwealth of Massachusetts
_______________
In the One Hundred and Ninety-Fourth General Court
(2025-2026)
_______________
An Act making appropriations for the fiscal year 2026 for the maintenance of the departments,
boards, commissions, institutions and certain activities of the Commonwealth, for interest,
sinking fund and serial bond requirements, and for certain permanent improvements.
Whereas, The deferred operation of this act would tend to defeat its purpose, which is
immediately to make appropriations for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2025, and to make
certain changes in law, each of which is immediately necessary or appropriate to effectuate said
appropriations or for other important public purposes, therefore it is hereby declared to be an
emergency law, necessary for the immediate preservation of the public convenience.
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives in General Court assembled, and by the authority
of the same, as follows:
SECTION 1. To provide for the operations of the several departments, boards,
commissions and institutions of the commonwealth and other services of the commonwealth and
for certain permanent improvements and to meet certain requirements of law, the sums set forth
in this act, for the several purposes and subject to the conditions specified, are hereby
appropriated from the General Fund unless specifically designated otherwise, subject to the laws
regulating the disbursement of public funds and the approval thereof for the fiscal year ending
June 30, 2026. All sums appropriated under this act, including supplemental and deficiency
budgets, shall be expended in a manner reflecting and encouraging a policy of nondiscrimination
and equal opportunity for members of minority groups, women and persons with a disability. All

officials and employees of an agency, board, department, commission or division receiving funds
under this act shall take affirmative steps to ensure equality of opportunity in the internal affairs
of state government and in their relations with the public, including those persons and
organizations doing business with the commonwealth. Each agency, board, department,
commission and division of the commonwealth, in spending appropriated sums and discharging
its statutory responsibilities, shall adopt measures to ensure equal opportunity in the areas of
hiring, promotion, demotion or transfer, recruitment, layoff or termination, rates of
compensation, in-service or apprenticeship training programs and all other terms and conditions
of employment.
SECTION 1A. In accordance with Articles LXIII and CVII of the Articles of
Amendment to the Constitution of the Commonwealth and section 6D of chapter 29 of the
General Laws, it is hereby declared that the amounts of revenue set forth in this section, by
source, for the respective funds of the commonwealth for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2026
are necessary and sufficient to provide the means to defray the appropriations and expenditures
from such funds for fiscal year 2026 as set forth and authorized in this act. The comptroller shall
keep a distinct account of actual receipts from each such source by each such fund to furnish the
executive office for administration and finance and the house and senate committees on ways
and means with quarterly statements comparing those receipts with the projected receipts set
forth in this section and shall include a full statement comparing the actual and projected receipts
in the annual report for fiscal year 2026 pursuant to section 12 of chapter 7A of the General
Laws. The quarterly and annual reports shall also include detailed statements of any other
sources of revenue for the budgeted funds in addition to those specified in this section.

SECTION 3 LOCAL AID DISTRIBUTIONS.
SECTION 3. Notwithstanding any general or special law to the contrary, for the fiscal year ending
June 30, 2026 the distribution of unrestricted general government aid to cities and towns of the balance of
the State Lottery and Gaming Fund, as paid from the General Fund in accordance with clause (c) of the
second paragraph of section 35 of chapter 10 of the General Laws, and additional funds from the General
Fund and the Gaming Local Aid Fund, shall be $1,323,109,519 and shall be apportioned to cities and towns
in accordance with this section.
For fiscal year 2026 the total amounts to be distributed and paid to each city, town and regional
school district from item 7061-0008 of section 2 and item 1596-2450 of section 2F, shall be as set forth in
the following lists. If there is conflict between the language of this section and the distribution listed below,
the distribution below shall control. The specified amounts distributed from said item 7061-0008 of said
section 2 and said item 1596-2450 of said section 2F shall be deemed in full satisfaction of the amounts
due under chapter 70 of the General Laws.
For fiscal year 2026, a district’s school aid shall be calculated according to the provisions of said
chapter 70. The foundation budget category of “low-income enrollment” for the purpose of calculating
foundation enrollment shall be determined by financial eligibility for certain federal programs, as defined by
the provisions of section 2 of said chapter 70, and including a number of students identified and approved
as low income through the supplemental claiming system established and posted by the department for
that purpose, as well as students identified and approved as homeless for purposes of calculating the
McKinney-Vento homelessness grant program administered by the department, consistent with the
conditions provided for in said section 2. Provided further, that the assumed special education enrollment
percentage for vocational school students shall be set at 4.97 per cent and the assumed special education
enrollment percentage for non-vocational school students shall be set at 3.97 per cent.
The per-pupil rates for the employee benefits and fixed charges allotments shall be adjusted by the
foundation employee benefits inflation rate and the per-pupil rates for all other foundation allotments shall
be adjusted by the foundation inflation index. Foundation increments shall be the additional resources
provided for the education of students designated as English learners or low-income; provided, however,
that for low-income students the amount of the foundation increment shall be determined by the low-income
group into which each district is assigned. Foundation budget rates for employee benefits and fixed
charges, guidance and psychological services, special education out-of-district tuition, English learners and
low-income students shall be increased by five-sixths of the gap between the rates used in fiscal year 2021
and the rates established in tables 1 and 2 of section 3 of said chapter 70, consistent with adjustments
prescribed in said section 3 and set at the rates identified in the table below. Required local contributions
shall be calculated pursuant to said chapter 70; provided, that municipal revenue growth factors shall be
calculated in a manner consistent with calculations made in fiscal year 2025; provided further, that the total
statewide target local contribution shall be 59 percent and the effort reduction percentage shall be 100
percent; and provided further that the minimum aid per pupil dollar amount shall be $150.
Chapter 70 aid for fiscal year 2026 shall be the greater of: (i) foundation aid, or (ii) the sum of base
aid and minimum aid. No non-operating district shall receive chapter 70 aid in an amount greater than the
district’s foundation budget.
The department of elementary and secondary education shall not consider health care costs for
retired teachers to be part of net school spending for any district in which such costs were not considered
part of net school spending in fiscal year 1994 and for any district that has not accepted the provisions of
section 260 of chapter 165 of the acts of 2014; provided, however, that any district for whom such costs
are not so considered shall have included as part of net school spending an amount equal to the increase
in the foundation budget for the district associated with health care costs of retired teachers.

No payments to cities, towns or counties maintaining an agricultural school under this section shall
be made after November 30 of the fiscal year until the commissioner of revenue certifies acceptance of the
prior fiscal year’s annual financial reports submitted under section 43 of chapter 44 of the General Laws.
Advance payments shall be made for some or all of periodic local reimbursement or assistance programs
to any city, town, regional school district or independent agricultural school that demonstrates an
emergency cash shortfall, as certified by the commissioner of revenue and approved by the secretary of
administration and finance, under guidelines established by the secretary.

671 whose parentage has been acknowledged by the person who gave birth and the other parent and
672 either parent rescinds the acknowledgment as provided in section 11 of chapter 209C or under
673 similar law of another state or foreign country, the birth record shall be amended to remove the
674 other parent’s information; provided, however, that:

693 correct such record until they have received an affidavit signed and sworn to by the adopting
694 parents, or by the person adopted, furnishing such facts. If a person who was in the custody of
695 the department of children and families is adopted and the adopting parents surrender the person
696 back to the department, that person shall have the right to change the birth certificate back to that
697 person’s birth name.
31

698 (h) The local clerk or state registrar in receipt of an adoption record pursuant to this
699 section shall, on forms provided by the state registrar, complete an amended, corrected or
700 supplemented record of birth, death or marriage or acknowledgment or adjudication of
701 parentage. The original record of birth, death or marriage or acknowledgment or adjudication of
702 parentage and all returns and index entries in whatever format they are maintained shall be
703 identified as corrected, amended or supplemented. All documentary evidence, including
704 certificates of adoption or certified copies thereof, shall be sent to the state registrar for a
705 permanent filing. If the affidavit is initially submitted to the state registrar, the state registrar
706 shall forward to the local clerk of the municipality where the birth or death occurred, a certified
707 copy of the corrected, amended or supplemented record, noting the documentary evidence to
708 substantiate the affidavit, and the local clerk shall thereupon correct, amend or supplement the
709 record in the office of the clerk. If a copy of the record is sent to the local clerk of the
710 municipality where the parents resided at the time of birth or where the deceased lived at the
711 time of death, the state registrar shall forward to such local clerk a certified copy of the
712 corrected, amended or supplemented record, noting the documentary evidence to substantiate the
713 affidavit, and the local clerk shall thereupon correct, amend or supplement the record in the
714 office of the clerk. Reference to the record of the affidavit or such decree shall be made on the
715 margin of the original record. If the local clerk or state registrar furnishes a copy of such a
716 record, they shall certify the facts contained therein as corrected, amended or supplemented.
717 Except as provided in this section, the local clerk or other official responsible for the keeping of
718 such records shall not release information contained in the original record except upon proper
719 judicial order or when requested by a person seeking their own birth or marriage record or by a
720 person whose official duties, in the opinion of the local clerk or state registrar, entitle them to the
32

721 information contained in the original record. Death records corrected, amended or supplemented
722 after January 1, 1996, as well as the affidavit of the party seeking the correction, amendment or
723 supplementation of the death record and all documentary evidence or related records submitted
724 in support of such affidavit, shall not be restricted, except for records or other items of
725 documentary evidence submitted in support of the affidavit which are: (i) considered medical
726 records for purposes of paragraph (c) of clause twenty-sixth of section 7 of chapter 4; (ii)
727 restricted by section 2A; or (iii) restricted by judicial order. If the original record has been
728 amended following adoption in accordance with this section, the local clerk or state registrar
729 shall issue information contained in the original record only upon receipt of an order of the
730 probate court for the county in which said adoption was granted or in accordance with section 2B
731 or, in the case of an adoption granted outside the commonwealth, upon receipt of an order of the
732 probate court for the county in which the birth of the adopted person occurred or in accordance
733 with section 2B, instructing said clerk or state registrar to release the information contained in
734 such original record. Evidence contained in the adoption record of a parent’s willingness to
735 provide information about their identity to the adopted person shall, except in extraordinary
736 circumstances, be considered sufficient evidence to warrant the granting of an order for release
737 of the information contained in the birth certificate registered prior to adoption. If the corrected,
738 amended or supplemented record is that of a person who has acquired the status of a marital
739 child or whose record has been amended through an adoption decree or whose record has been
740 amended through addition of a named parent or whose record has been amended pursuant to
741 subsection (e), the local clerk or state registrar shall not indicate on such copy that the record has
742 been corrected, amended or supplemented.
33

743 (i) An affidavit or a certified copy of the record of any other municipality or of a written
744 statement made at the time by any person since deceased required by law to furnish evidence of
745 said affidavit, may be the basis for completing the record of a birth, marriage or death not
746 containing all the facts required by section 1. No record of birth shall be established for a
747 deceased person more than 5 years after the date of death nor shall a record of marriage be
748 established if both spouses are deceased, except as provided by sections 13A, 13B and 13C.
749 (j) Upon the adoption of an abandoned child or foundling within the commonwealth the
750 facts of whose birth are not recorded pursuant to sections 1 or 1A, or, if such facts are recorded,
751 cannot otherwise be identified, the state registrar, upon receipt of: (i) an affidavit executed by the
752 adopting parents setting forth all material facts known concerning said abandoned child or
753 foundling; and (ii) an order issued by the commissioner of children and families determining the
754 most probable date of birth of such abandoned child or foundling shall record the facts relative to
755 the birth pursuant to sections 1 or 1A. In addition to any other certificates or copies of records
756 authorized by law, the commissioner may, upon application, issue certificates setting forth the
757 facts concerning an abandoned child or foundling appearing in any records of the department of
758 children and families if no certificate of birth is recorded in the municipality where the
759 abandoned child or foundling was born or the state registry.
760 (k) If an application to correct or amend a record of birth, marriage or death or a delayed
761 record of a birth, marriage or death is approved, the applicant shall pay a fee as determined by
762 the secretary of administration and finance.
763 (l) Upon application of both parties to a marriage, the record of such marriage shall be
764 amended to remove the sex of either or both parties to the marriage and, if applicable, to change
765 the name of either or both parties to the marriage. Such application shall be made to the state
34

766 registrar or local clerk of the city or town where the marriage record was issued and shall
767 include: (i) an affidavit executed by both parties to the marriage on a form provided by the state
768 registrar attesting to their concurrence that the record be amended to remove sex of either or both
769 parties; and (ii) if applicable, a request by a party to the marriage for a change of name along
770 with evidence of the party’s legal change of name.
771 SECTION 32. Section 1 of chapter 55 of the General Laws, as amended by section 181 of
772 chapter 238 of the acts of 2024, is hereby further amended by inserting before the definition of

775 dependent, including, but not limited to, caregiving services by an individual or nonprofit or for-
776 profit organization that provides such services and any other costs directly related to such
777 services that occur as a result of campaign activities; provided, however, that expenses related to
778 adult-care services shall not include payments to a family member, as defined in section 1 of
779 chapter 50, of the parent or other adult dependent receiving care, unless the family member
780 owns, operates or is employed by a professional caregiving service or a nonprofit or for-profit
781 organization that provides adult-care services and the cost of the service is not greater than such
782 family member would otherwise charge.

791 by section 13 of chapter 206 of the acts of 2024, is hereby further amended by striking out
792 subsections (a) and (b) and inserting in place thereof the following 2 subsections:-
793 (a) A tax is hereby imposed upon the transfer of the estate of each person dying on or
794 after January 1, 1997 who, at the time of death, was a resident of the commonwealth. The
795 amount of the tax shall be equal to the credit for state death taxes that would have been allowable
796 to a decedent’s estate as computed under section 2011 of the Code, as in effect on December 31,
797 2000, hereinafter referred to as the “credit”. The credit shall be determined based on the value of
798 the federal gross estate after such estate is increased by the value of any property: (i) not
799 included in the federal gross estate; (ii) in which the decedent had at death a qualifying income
800 interest for life described in subsection (c) of section 3A; (iii) for which a deduction was allowed
801 for Massachusetts estate tax purposes with respect to the transfer of such property to the
802 decedent; and (iv) which is not real or tangible personal property located outside of the
803 commonwealth at the time of death. If the federal gross estate of a person includes real or
804 tangible personal property located outside of the commonwealth at the time of death, the credit
805 shall be determined based on the value of the federal gross estate after such estate is reduced by
806 the value of such real or tangible personal property located outside of the commonwealth and
807 increased by the value of any property: (A) not included in the federal gross estate; (B) in which
808 the decedent had at death a qualifying income interest for life described in subsection (c) of
809 section 3A; (C) for which a deduction was allowed for Massachusetts estate tax purposes with
810 respect to the transfer of such property to the decedent; and (D) that is not real or tangible
36

811 personal property located outside of the commonwealth at the time of death; provided, however,
812 that for the purposes of calculating the federal taxable estate, no deduction shall be allowed that
813 is attributable to such real or tangible personal property located outside of the commonwealth.
814 (b) A tax is hereby imposed upon the transfer of real property situated in this
815 commonwealth and upon tangible personal property having an actual situs in this commonwealth
816 of every person who at the time of their death was not a resident of this commonwealth. The
817 amount of this tax is the amount of the credit calculated based upon a federal gross estate that is
818 equal to the sum of: (i) the value of the estate’s real or tangible personal property located in the
819 commonwealth; and (ii) the value of any real or tangible property: (A) not included in the federal
820 gross estate; (B) in which the decedent had at death a qualifying income interest for life
821 described in subsection (c) of section 3A; (C) for which a deduction was allowed for
822 Massachusetts estate tax purposes with respect to the transfer of such property to the decedent;
823 and (D) which is not located outside of the commonwealth at the time of death. Under this
824 subsection, for the purposes of calculating the federal taxable estate, no deduction shall be
825 allowed that is attributable to property other than such real or tangible personal property located
826 in the commonwealth.

835 Upon receiving notification of satisfaction of a security interest pursuant to section 24,
836 the registrar may waive the issuance and mailing of the certificate of title to the owner or a third

838 issuance and mailing of the certificate of title, the registrar shall ensure that: (i) the owner or
839 authorized third party may receive a paper certificate of title upon request; and (ii) there is a
840 process or system established to ensure that the owner or authorized third party may effect action
841 that would otherwise be necessary upon the certificate of title. The registrar may promulgate
842 rules and regulations related to this section.
843 Nothing in this section shall relieve a seller’s obligation under section 15 to assign and
844 deliver title to a purchaser or the registrar at the time of delivery of the vehicle, nor shall
845 anything in this section relieve a purchaser’s obligation under sections 1A and 2 of chapter 90 to

959 whether the child is receiving or may be eligible to receive benefits. In reviewing eligibility, the
960 department shall consult with the parents and other individuals who may have information about
961 the child’s eligibility. If the department determines, or has cause to believe, that the child may be
962 eligible for benefits, it shall apply for benefits on the child’s behalf. If the agency administering
963 such benefits denies the application, the department may appeal the decision as permitted by the
964 agency administering the benefits. The department shall review cases of children in foster care
965 annually to determine whether the child may have become eligible for benefits after the initial
966 assessment determined them to be ineligible or whether the child may be eligible for new
967 benefits after the initial assessment. The department shall seek federal foster care reimbursement
968 for a child only if such reimbursement will not impact the child’s eligibility for benefits or the
969 dollar amount of benefits.
43

970 (c) The department may apply to be the representative payee or fiduciary of a child under
971 its care and custody if the child is already receiving benefits prior to entering the department’s
972 custody. The department may also apply to be the representative payee or fiduciary if the
973 department is applying for benefits for the child. The department shall consider whether applying
974 to become the child’s representative payee or fiduciary under this section will undermine the
975 goal of reunification and not be in the child’s best interests.
976 (d) The department shall provide timely notice to counsel for a child in its care and
977 custody and the counsel for the parent, parents or legal guardian or guardians of the child of: (i)
978 the department’s submission of an application for benefits on the child’s behalf; (ii) the

983 benefits eligibility determination; and (vi) the department’s receipt of any notice of an eligibility
984 redetermination.

986 adoption has been entered under paragraph (4) of subsection (b) of section 26.
987 (e) The department shall maintain an accounting of a child’s benefits when the
988 department is the child’s representative payee or fiduciary and shall make current accounting

995 controlled by the department. The department shall provide such accounting information to the
996 court at permanency hearings, at other court proceedings, as necessary, or upon request.
997 (f) The department shall not use a child’s benefits to reimburse the commonwealth for the
998 child’s placement in foster care if the department is the child’s representative payee or fiduciary.
999 The department shall ensure that if the child is receiving supplemental security income benefits
1000 under Title XVI of the Social Security Act, any funds retained on the child’s behalf are kept in a
1001 manner that does not exceed any federal asset or resource limit that would affect the child’s
1002 eligibility to continue receiving such benefits. Benefits held by the department as a representative
1003 payee or fiduciary may be spent on the child’s unmet needs, which would not ordinarily be
1004 funded by another source, subject to program rules for the use of such benefits, or otherwise
1005 conserved for the child. For a child who is a recipient of supplemental security income or other
1006 federal means-tested benefits with an asset or resource limit, the department shall conserve any
1007 funds that are above the federal asset or resource limits for such benefits in an Achieving a Better
1008 Life Experience (ABLE) account, authorized by 26 U.S.C. 529A, as amended or another account
1009 for the child determined not to interfere with federal asset or resource limits for any other federal
1010 means-tested benefit program. For a child who is not receiving supplemental security income or
1011 other federal means-tested benefits with an asset or resource limit, the department shall place
1012 excess funds in an interest-bearing account or other savings or investment vehicle for the benefit
1013 of the child. The department shall keep retroactive benefits received if the department is the
1014 child’s representative payee or fiduciary as required by the program rules of the agency
1015 administering such benefits.
45

1016 (g) The department shall take steps to conserve the benefits of children under its care and
1017 custody who are receiving benefits to assist them in the transition to adulthood and living
1018 independently. The department shall establish accounts as specified in subsection (f) in
1019 conserving a child’s benefits. The department shall work actively with the agency administering
1020 such benefits and the child to ensure that when the child leaves foster care, becomes eligible for
1021 direct payment or another representative payee is identified, all payments of benefits or
1022 conserved funds will be: (i) returned to the agency following program rules; or (ii) upon
1023 agreement by the agency, if necessary, transferred to the child or to a new representative payee
1024 or fiduciary.
1025 (h) The department shall provide a child under its care and custody who is not less than
1026 14 years old and the child’s legal counsel with ongoing financial information regarding the
1027 eligibility for benefits, as well as the existence, amount, availability, past use and limitations of
1028 funds conserved for the child; provided, however, that such information shall be tailored to the
1029 individual child based on age and other factors. For a youth not less than 17 years of age,
1030 financial information shall also include basic guidance on and assistance with understanding
1031 budgeting and money management, including checking and savings accounts, tailored to the
1032 youth.
1033 (i) The department shall provide each child under its care and custody who has attained
1034 the age of 14 years with ongoing financial literacy training and support and tailored to the child

46

1039 or training; (ix) long term asset-building; and (x) available community and agency services.
1040 Financial literacy resources concerning the use of conserved funds shall also be made available
1041 to all parents, guardians and adoptive parents who gain access to funds conserved by the
1042 department.
1043 (j) Annually, the department shall submit a report to the senate and house committees on
1044 ways and means, the joint committee on children, families and persons with disabilities, the
1045 clerks of the senate and house of representative and the secretary of administration and finance.
1046 The report shall include: (i) the numbers of children in the department’s care and custody
1047 receiving benefits for which the department is the representative payee or fiduciary; (ii) the

1049 income, retirement, survivors or disability insurance or other federal benefits; (iii) the dollar
1050 amount of benefits being conserved by the department; (iv) the number and type of accounts
1051 established by the department on behalf of such children; and (v) to the extent such data is

1055 who were already receiving benefits after screening; and (C) for whom the department submitted
1056 applications for benefits, by type of application, and the outcome of those applications, including

1058 shall provide information regarding its ongoing efforts to gather and report upon such
1059 information.
1060 (k) The department shall continue to administer the benefits of young adults aged 18 to

1602 chapter 32 shall meet the commonwealth’s obligations pursuant to said section 22C of said
1603 chapter 32, including retirement benefits payable by the state employees’ retirement system and

72

1610 payments upon a transfer of funds to reimburse certain cities and towns for pensions of retired
1611 teachers, including any other obligation that the commonwealth has assumed on behalf of a
1612 retirement system other than the state employees’ retirement system or state teachers’ retirement
1613 system, including the commonwealth’s share of the amounts to be transferred pursuant to section

1617 prepared quarterly by the secretary of administration and finance and submitted to the house and
1618 senate committees on ways and means and the joint committee on public service in advance of

1620 actually to be made. If the amount transferred pursuant to said subdivision (1) of said section
1621 22C of said chapter 32 exceeds the amount necessary to adequately fund the annual pension
1622 obligations, the excess amount shall be credited to the Pension Reserves Investment Trust Fund
1623 established in subdivision (8) of said section 22 of said chapter 32 to reduce the unfunded
1624 pension liability of the commonwealth.
1625 SECTION 121. Notwithstanding any general or special law to the contrary, the

1628 before the certification of the fiscal year 2026 consolidated net surplus, pursuant to section 5C of
1629 chapter 29 of the General Laws. The amount deposited shall be an amount equal to 10 per cent of
1630 all payments received by the commonwealth in fiscal year 2026 under the master settlement
1631 agreement in Commonwealth of Massachusetts v. Philip Morris, Inc. et al., Middlesex Superior
1632 Court, No. 95-7378; provided, however, that if in fiscal year 2026 the unexpended balances of
73

1633 said items 0699-0015 and 0699-9100 of said section 2 are less than 10 per cent of all payments
1634 received by the commonwealth in fiscal year 2026 under the master settlement agreement
1635 payments, an amount equal to the difference shall be transferred to the State Retiree Benefits
1636 Trust Fund from payments received by the commonwealth under the master settlement
1637 agreement.

1639 transferring the consolidated net surplus in the budgetary funds for fiscal year 2026 to the
1640 Commonwealth Stabilization Fund pursuant to section 5C of chapter 29 of the General Laws, the
1641 comptroller shall transfer $14,000,000 from the General Fund to the Disaster Relief and
1642 Resiliency Fund established in section 2HHHHHH of said chapter 29.
1643 SECTION 123. Notwithstanding any general or special law to the contrary, any funds

1646 of the General Laws.

1650 1455 of section 2 and the Health Safety Net Trust Fund established in section 66 of chapter 118E
1651 of the General Laws in fiscal year 2026 to support the Medicare Saving or Medicare Buy-In
1652 programs established in section 25A of said chapter 118E; provided, however, that the secretary
1653 of health and human services shall certify to the house and senate committees on ways and
1654 means, not less than 45 days in advance of the transfer, in writing, the amount to be transferred
74

1655 and an explanation of the amount of expected savings to those programs resulting from the
1656 transfer.
1657 SECTION 125. Notwithstanding any general or special law to the contrary, payments
1658 from the Health Safety Net Trust Fund established in section 66 of chapter 118E of the General
1659 Laws may be made either as safety net care payments under the commonwealth’s waiver
1660 pursuant to section 1115 of the federal Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. 1315, or as an adjustment
1661 to service rate payments under Titles XIX and XXI of the federal Social Security Act or a
1662 combination of both. Other federally permissible funding mechanisms available for certain
1663 hospitals, as defined by regulations of the executive office of health and human services, may be
1664 used to reimburse up to $70,000,000 of uncompensated care pursuant to said section 66 and
