81 SECTION 4. Tabulation of Ranked Choice Ballots.
82 Notwithstanding the provisions of Chapter 452 of the Acts of 1948, or any other general
83 or special law, rule, or regulation to the contrary, votes in ranked choice voting contests shall be
84 tabulated as follows:
85 (a) Single-Winner Tabulation. In all contests for mayor and district city councillor
86 conducted by ranked choice voting, each ballot shall count as one vote for the highest-ranked
87 active candidate on that ballot. The candidate with the greatest number of votes at the end of
88 tabulation is elected. Tabulation shall proceed in rounds as follows:
89 11.
90 If there are more than two active candidates, the active candidate with the fewest votes is
91 eliminated, and votes for the eliminated candidate are counted for each ballot's next-ranked
92 active candidate. If there are two or fewer active candidates, tabulation is complete.
93 (b) Multi-Winner Tabulation. In all contests for City Councilor At-Large conducted by
94 ranked choice voting, each ballot shall count in whole or in part for the highest-ranked active
95 candidate on that ballot. In the first round, each ballot shall count as one vote for its highest-
96 ranked active candidate, and the election threshold shall be determined by dividing the number
5 of 10
97 of votes cast by five, rounding down to the nearest whole number, and adding one. Tabulation
98 shall proceed in rounds as follows:
99 1 1 .
100 If the number of active candidates is equal to the remaining number of seats to be elected,
101 all active candidates shall be elected, and tabulation shall be complete.
102 i. If an active candidate has a number of votes that equals or exceeds the election
103 threshold, the active candidate with the most votes shall be elected. If the elected candidate has a
104 number of votes that exceeds the threshold, the excess part of each vote received by that
105 candidate shall count in the next round for the ballot's next-ranked active candidate (i.e., the
106 voter's second, third, etc. ranked-candidate on the ballot).
107 iii. If no active candidate equals or exceeds the election threshold, the candidate with the
108 fewest votes shall be defeated and a new round shall begin. The excess part of each vote received
109 by that candidate shall count in the next round for the ballot's next-ranked active candidate (i.e.,
110 the voter's second, third, etc. ranked-candidate on the ballot).
111 iv.
112 Once the tabulation process has proceeded through successive rounds such that either the
113 number of active candidates equals the remaining number of seats to be filled, or no further vote
114 transfers are possible due to exhausted ballots or the absence of additional ranked candidates, the
115 contest shall be concluded.
116 (c) Treatment of Ballots.
6 of 10
117 An undervote is a ballot that does not rank any candidates in a particular contest. An
118 undervote does not count as an active or inactive ballot in any round of tabulation of that contest.
119 i
120 An inactive ballot is a ballot that ceases in a round of tabulation to count for any
121 candidate for the remainder of the tabulation of the contest because either:
122 (A) Al candidates ranked on the ballot have become inactive; or
123 (B) The ballot includes an overvote and any candidates ranked higher than the overvote
124 have become inactive. An overvote occurs when a voter ranks more than one candidate at the
125 same ranking.
126 iii. During tabulation, a ballot shall remain active and continue to count for its highest-
127 ranked active candidate notwithstanding any skipped or repeated rankings on the ballot. A
128 skipped ranking occurs when a voter leaves a ranking unassigned but ranks a candidate at a
129 subsequent ranking. A repeated ranking occurs when a voter ranks the same candidate at
130 multiple rankings.
131 (d) Ties. If two or more candidates are tied with the fewest votes, and tabulation cannot
132 continue until the candidate with the fewest votes is eliminated, then the candidate with the
133 fewest votes in the prior round shall be defeated. If two or more such tied candidates were tied in
134 the prior round, the second tie shall be decided by referring similarly to the number of votes for
135 each candidate in the second-prior round. This
136 process shall be applied successively as many times as necessary. If otherwise not
137 provided herein, the election commission shall establish a method of tiebreaking to be used.
7 of 10
138 SECTION 5. Results Reporting.
139 Notwithstanding the provisions of section 60 of chapter 452 of the Acts of 1948, as so
140 appearing in section 2 of chapter 376 of the Acts of 1951; or any other general or special law,
141 rule, or regulation to the contrary, votes in ranked choice voting contests shall be reported as
142 follows:
143 (a) Unofficial Results. The election commission shall promulgate rules or guidance to
144 ensure the release of unofficial election results on election night, including round-by-round
145 results for each ranked choice contest. The commission shall make best efforts to publish initial
146 unofficial results on election night, as soon as they become available. Unofficial results shall be
147 clearly marked as preliminary and subject to revision.
148 (b) Final Results. In addition to any other information required by law to be reported with
149 official final results, the election commission shall make public:
150 the number and percentage of votes that each candidate received in each round of the
151 official tabulation; and the number of ballots that became inactive in each round for the reasons
152 set out in section 4(c)(2), reported as separate figures.
153 iii. The election commission shall make final anonymized results and data available in
154 both human-readable and machine-readable formats to allow for independent verification,
155 consistent with applicable law.
156 SECTION 6. Regulatory Authority.
157 The election commission shall have the authority to promulgate whatever rules are
158 necessary to implement this Act.
8 of 10
159 Theolin commision shal etia hor vented hoice all are to inderstin, son him to rank
160 candidates. The election commission shall ensure that an appropriate ranked choice voter
161 education campaign is conducted before each municipal election, and shall include outreach in
162 multiple languages and is consistent with the City's language access and disability policies.
163 SECTION 7. Severability.
164 If any provision of this Act, or the application of any provision of this Act to any person,
165 office, or circumstance, is held to be unconstitutional, the remainder of this Act and the
166 application of its provision to any person, office, or circumstance, shall not be affected by the
167 holding.
168 SECTION 8, Voter Acceptance and Effective Date.
169 Upon passage of this Home Rule Petition by the Massachusetts legislature, the following
170 question shall be placed on the ballot to be used at a regular state or municipal election or a
171 special election called for the purpose of presenting the question to the voters, as hereby stated
172 Shall an act entitled "An Act to Implement Ranked Choice Voting for the City of Boston" be
173 accepted?
174 The city law department shall prepare the summary of the question, which shall appear
175 on the ballot along with the question provided in this section subject to any necessary changes
176 required by law.
177 If a majority of votes cast in answer to the question is in the affirmative, the city shall be
178 taken to have accepted the Act, but not otherwise. The Act shall take effect immediately upon
179 approval of said question; provided, however, that it shall be applicable only to municipal
9 of 10
180 elections in which the regular or special election for that contest is 365 days or more after the day

81 SECTION 4. Tabulation of Ranked Choice Ballots.
82 Notwithstanding the provisions of Chapter 452 of the Acts of 1948, or any other general
83 or special law, rule, or regulation to the contrary, votes in ranked choice voting contests shall be
84 tabulated as follows:
85 (a) Single-Winner Tabulation. In all contests for mayor and district city councillor
86 conducted by ranked choice voting, each ballot shall count as one vote for the highest-ranked
87 active candidate on that ballot. The candidate with the greatest number of votes at the end of
88 tabulation is elected. Tabulation shall proceed in rounds as follows:
89 11.
90 If there are more than two active candidates, the active candidate with the fewest votes is
91 eliminated, and votes for the eliminated candidate are counted for each ballot's next-ranked
92 active candidate. If there are two or fewer active candidates, tabulation is complete.
93 (b) Multi-Winner Tabulation. In all contests for City Councilor At-Large conducted by
94 ranked choice voting, each ballot shall count in whole or in part for the highest-ranked active
95 candidate on that ballot. In the first round, each ballot shall count as one vote for its highest-
96 ranked active candidate, and the election threshold shall be determined by dividing the number
5 of 10

97 of votes cast by five, rounding down to the nearest whole number, and adding one. Tabulation
98 shall proceed in rounds as follows:
99 1 1 .
100 If the number of active candidates is equal to the remaining number of seats to be elected,
101 all active candidates shall be elected, and tabulation shall be complete.
102 i. If an active candidate has a number of votes that equals or exceeds the election
103 threshold, the active candidate with the most votes shall be elected. If the elected candidate has a
104 number of votes that exceeds the threshold, the excess part of each vote received by that
105 candidate shall count in the next round for the ballot's next-ranked active candidate (i.e., the
106 voter's second, third, etc. ranked-candidate on the ballot).
107 iii. If no active candidate equals or exceeds the election threshold, the candidate with the
108 fewest votes shall be defeated and a new round shall begin. The excess part of each vote received
109 by that candidate shall count in the next round for the ballot's next-ranked active candidate (i.e.,
110 the voter's second, third, etc. ranked-candidate on the ballot).
111 iv.
112 Once the tabulation process has proceeded through successive rounds such that either the
113 number of active candidates equals the remaining number of seats to be filled, or no further vote
114 transfers are possible due to exhausted ballots or the absence of additional ranked candidates, the
115 contest shall be concluded.
116 (c) Treatment of Ballots.
6 of 10

117 An undervote is a ballot that does not rank any candidates in a particular contest. An
118 undervote does not count as an active or inactive ballot in any round of tabulation of that contest.
119 i
120 An inactive ballot is a ballot that ceases in a round of tabulation to count for any
121 candidate for the remainder of the tabulation of the contest because either:
122 (A) Al candidates ranked on the ballot have become inactive; or
123 (B) The ballot includes an overvote and any candidates ranked higher than the overvote
124 have become inactive. An overvote occurs when a voter ranks more than one candidate at the
125 same ranking.
126 iii. During tabulation, a ballot shall remain active and continue to count for its highest-
127 ranked active candidate notwithstanding any skipped or repeated rankings on the ballot. A
128 skipped ranking occurs when a voter leaves a ranking unassigned but ranks a candidate at a
129 subsequent ranking. A repeated ranking occurs when a voter ranks the same candidate at
130 multiple rankings.
131 (d) Ties. If two or more candidates are tied with the fewest votes, and tabulation cannot
132 continue until the candidate with the fewest votes is eliminated, then the candidate with the
133 fewest votes in the prior round shall be defeated. If two or more such tied candidates were tied in
134 the prior round, the second tie shall be decided by referring similarly to the number of votes for
135 each candidate in the second-prior round. This
136 process shall be applied successively as many times as necessary. If otherwise not
137 provided herein, the election commission shall establish a method of tiebreaking to be used.
