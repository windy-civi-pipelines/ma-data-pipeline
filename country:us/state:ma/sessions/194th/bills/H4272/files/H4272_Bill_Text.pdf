6 said section 17.
7 (b) The licensing authority shall not approve the transfer of a license granted pursuant to

11 with those departments and that all applicable taxes, fees and contributions have been paid.
12 (c) If a licensee terminates or fails to renew a license granted under this section or any

17 dissolve.
18 (d) The license authorized to be granted under this act shall be issued within 3 years after

20 that time period, it may be granted to a new applicant under subsections (b) and (c) thereafter.
