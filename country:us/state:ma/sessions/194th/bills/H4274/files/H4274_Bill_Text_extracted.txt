73 activities at the health club. No contract for services may require the buyer to execute a
74 promissory note or series of promissory notes which, when negotiated, cuts off as to third parties
75 a defense which the buyer may have against the seller. No contract may be assigned by one
76 health club to another health club without the prior, contemporaneous, and informed written
77 consent of the buyer. Consent to an assignment is contemporaneous if it was obtained within 30
78 days of the date of the assignment. Consent to an assignment is informed if the seller provided

82 delivery shall be reflected in the contract.
83 Any seller of a contract for health club services making an automatic renewal or
84 continuous service offer to a buyer shall: (i) present the automatic renewal offer terms or
85 continuous service offer terms in a clear and conspicuous manner before the subscription or
86 purchasing agreement is fulfilled and in visual proximity, or in the case of an offer conveyed by
87 voice, in temporal proximity, to the request for consent to the offer. If the offer also includes a
88 free gift or trial, the offer shall include a clear and conspicuous explanation of the price that will
89 be charged after the trial ends or the manner in which the pricing will change upon conclusion of
90 the trial; (ii) obtain the buyer’s written consent to the agreement containing the automatic
91 renewal offer terms or continuous service offer terms, including the terms of an automatic
92 renewal offer or continuous service offer that is made at a promotional or discounted price for a
93 limited period of time, prior to charging the consumer; and (iii) provide a written

115 seller) OR POSTMARKED BY CERTIFIED OR REGISTERED UNITED STATES MAIL
116 WITHIN FIVE(5) BUSINESS DAYS OF THE DATE YOU RECEIVED THIS CONTRACT
117 FOR HEALTH CLUB SERVICES.
118 IF THE HEALTH CLUB GOES OUT OF BUSINESS OR REFUSES TO GIVE YOU A
119 REFUND, THERE MAY BE A BOND OR LETTER OF CREDIT UNDER WHICH YOU ARE

136 All monies paid pursuant to such contract shall be refunded within ten business days of
137 receipt of such notice of cancellation. If the buyer has executed any credit or loan agreement to
138 pay for all or part of the health club services, any such negotiable instrument shall be void upon
139 cancellation under this section and shall also be returned to the buyer within said ten business
140 days.

146 assistant, or nurse practitioner verifying that the buyer is physically unable to use a substantial
7 of 11
147 portion of the health club services for a period in excess of three months. The buyer shall have
148 the option to be relieved of liability for payment on that portion of the contract term for which
149 the buyer is disabled.
150 A buyer may cancel a contract if the health club services facilities are not available to the
151 buyer because the seller fails to open a planned health club or location, or substantially changes
152 the operation of the health club or location, or if the buyer changes residence to a location more

155 Every contract for health club services shall provide clearly and conspicuously in writing
156 that after the expiration of the five-day period for cancellation as provided in section eighty-one,

159 significantly physically or medically disabled for a period in excess of three months, or if the
160 health club services or facilities are not available to the buyer because the seller fails to open a
161 planned health club or location or substantially changes the operation of the health club or
162 location. The contract shall also provide that the buyer may also cancel if the buyer changes
163 residence to a location more than ten miles from a health club operated by the seller or a
164 substantially similar health club which will accept the seller's obligation under the contract.
165 Nothing contained herein shall restrict or prohibit the seller from offering or providing in such
166 contract additional or broader reasons for cancellation.
8 of 11
167 The seller may require reasonable evidence of the reason for cancellation by the buyer

172 if upon a doctor's order, you cannot physically or medically receive the services because
173 of significant physical or medical disability for a period in excess of three months;
174 in case of your death;

177 health club or location; or
178 if you move either your residence or your place of employment more than ten miles from
179 any health club operated by the seller or a substantially similar health club which will accept the

187 has consumed or wishes to retain after cancellation of the contract. In no instance shall the seller
9 of 11
188 demand more than the full contract price from the buyer. If the buyer has executed any credit or
189 loan agreement to pay for all or part of the price of the contract for health club services, any such
190 negotiable instrument executed by the buyer shall also be returned and terminated within ten

206 within fourteen days of the date of any temporary closure, the seller shall provide notice of the
207 date the impacted facility temporarily closed and the date it expects to reopen, which date shall
208 be within a reasonable period of time from the time the facility temporarily closed, to the office

211 the seller shall conspicuously post a notice with information about the temporary closure at each
212 entrance to the impacted facility and on the seller’s website. Further, within forty-eight hours of
213 any temporary closure, the seller shall send each buyer associated with the impacted facility
214 information about the temporary closure, including the date the facility temporarily closed and
215 the date the facility expects to reopen. And, within fourteen days of the date of any temporary
