An Act regarding requirements for continuing education for electricians.
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives in General Court assembled, and by the authority
of the same, as follows:
1 SECTION 1. Chapter 141 of the General Laws, as appearing in the 2016 Official Edition,
2 is hereby amended by inserting after section 2B the following section:-
3 Section 2C (a) Except as otherwise provided for in this section or chapter, each licensee
4 of the board of state examiners of electricians, hereinafter referred to as “the board”, as a
5 condition for license renewal, shall present evidence satisfactory to the board that, in the 3-year
6 period before license renewal, he or she has completed 21 clock hours of continuing education as
7 provided for in this section.
8 (b) Of the required 21 clock hours, 15 clock hours shall be on topics related to 527 CMR
9 12.00: Massachusetts electrical code amendments, business, law, and related topics with a
1 of 4

10 provider in an area of study approved by the board. Courses offered for master electricians and
11 journeyman electricians shall focus on 527 CMR 12.00 and other laws and regulations as they
12 pertain to electrical work: courses for systems contractors and systems technicians shall focus on
13 the applicable chapters of 527 CMR 12.00, the adopted version of NFPA 72, and other laws and
14 regulations as they pertain to systems work. The board may require specific content to be
15 contained in any approved courses. It shall be the licensee's responsibility to ensure that their
16 provider has been approved by the board.
17 (c) Of the required 21 clock hours, 6 clock hours shall be in areas chosen by the licensee
18 for professional development in the subjects of electrical code, business, law, first aid, safety,
19 building code, and related topics; provided, that the instruction need not be offered by a board-
20 approved provider.
21 (d) Notwithstanding subsections (a) to (c), inspectors of wires, appointed pursuant to
22 section 32 of chapter 166, electrical inspectors or investigators employed by the division of
23 professional licensure, and licensed members of the board, shall complete the required 15 hours
24 of mandatory continuing education within the first year of the release of the updated edition of
25 527 CMR 12.00: Massachusetts electrical code amendments as a condition of license renewal.
26 (e) In addition to the 21 hours for renewal as provided for in subsection (c), each
27 inspector of wires appointed pursuant to section 32 of chapter 166 shall complete in each license
28 cycle 6 hours of continuing education in courses approved by the board, for a total of 27 clock
29 hours. The board may designate 1 or more associations of inspectors of wires or other providers
30 to offer these courses.
2 of 4

31 (f) The board may, at its discretion, consider a written request for an extension or
32 exemption from the deadlines for the continuing education requirement under the following
33 circumstances:
34 (i) A request for an extension based on illness, disability, or other medically-related
35 condition, shall be in writing, under oath, and accompanied by a letter addressed to the board,
36 written and signed by a licensed medical doctor, stating the nature of the licensee’s medical
37 condition and the correlation between that condition and the licensee’s inability to work in any
38 trade capacity, as well as to complete the required continuing education within the required
39 period.
40 (ii) Instructors who teach 2 15-clock-hour seminars or courses or 2 6-hour professional
41 development courses per cycle shall be deemed to have met the continuing education
42 requirements.
43 (iii) Any holder of a journeyman electrician or systems technician license issued by the
44 board following examination or by reciprocity during the 90 days preceding the license renewal
45 date shall be exempt from the continuing education requirement for the license renewal cycle in
46 effect at the time of licensure.
47 (g) Any licensee who does not complete the required hours of continuing education shall
48 not be eligible for license renewal. A licensee who misrepresents completion of continuing
49 education in a license renewal shall be subject to disciplinary action which could include fines
50 and license suspension or revocation.
51 (h) A licensee who allows their license to lapse beyond 90 days, who did not complete
52 their continuing education prior to their license expiration, shall not be eligible to reinstate their
3 of 4

53 license until they complete the latest board-approved version of the 15-hour continuing education
54 course and a 6-hour professional development course. Additionally, if a license has been expired
55 for more than 12 years (4 license cycle), even if originally obtained by reciprocity, the former
56 licensee shall be required to pass the Massachusetts examination for the license they previously
57 held in order to reinstate their license.
58 (i)(1) Upon successful completion of the 15 clock hours of continuing education, each
59 licensee shall receive from their CEP a certificate of completion. The board shall retain such
60 documentation for 10 years. This requirement shall not be deemed to waive the requirement that
61 CEPs also maintain records as required in 237 CMR 17.00.
62 (2) Upon successful completion of the 6 clock hours of professional development, each
63 licensee shall receive from the sponsor a certificate of completion as provided for in 237 CMR
64 17.02(3)(b). Each licensee shall retain such documentation for 10 years and shall furnish it to the
65 board for verification of completion of the professional development if so requested.
66 (3) Appointed inspectors of wires pursuant to section 32 of chapter 166 shall provide to
67 the board successful completion and documentation of the required 27 clock hours of mandatory
68 continuing education and certification programs as required by the board pursuant to these
69 regulations indicating qualification for initial or continuing appointment as an inspector of wires.
70 SECTION 2. The board of state examiners of electricians shall promulgate rules and
71 regulations for the administration and enforcement of section 1.
