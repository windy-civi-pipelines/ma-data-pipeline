An Act relative to the separation of agricultural land for renewable energy purposes.
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives in General Court assembled, and by the authority
of the same, as follows:
1 Section 17 of chapter 61A of the General Laws, as appearing in the 2022 Official Edition,
2 is hereby amended by inserting, after the first sentence, the following: -
3 Notwithstanding the provisions in this section, if, by conveyance or other action of the
4 owner thereof, a portion of land previously used primarily and directly for agricultural purposes
5 pursuant to section 1 or land used primarily and directly for horticultural use pursuant to section
6 2, which is valued, assessed and taxed under the provisions of this chapter is separated to serve
7 as the site of a renewable energy generating source, as defined in subsection (b) of section 11F of
8 chapter 25A of the General Laws, the land so separated shall not be subject to liability for
9 conveyance for such time as the separated land is in use for the purpose of producing a
10 renewable energy generating source. Such land shall instead be subject to the payment of fifty
11 percent of the applicable roll-back taxes to be due payable at the time it commences serving as
12 the site of a renewable energy generating source; provided that such land is non-productive
13 agricultural or horticultural land at the time of the proposed separation. Should the use of
14 separated land as a renewable energy generating source permanently cease, and the land is not
1 of 2

15 placed back into agricultural use or horticultural use, then the land shall be subject to liability for
16 conveyance applicable thereto at the time its use as a renewable energy generating source
17 permanently ceases. Any portion of land separated subject to this provision shall not exceed ten
18 percent of the total amount of contiguous land; provided that such separated land shall not
19 exceed fifteen acres of the land which is valued, assessed and taxed under the provisions of this
20 chapter at the time such land is separated to serve as the site of a renewable energy generating
21 source.
