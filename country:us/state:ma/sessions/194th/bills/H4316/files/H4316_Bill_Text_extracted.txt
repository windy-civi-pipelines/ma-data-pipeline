86 section shall be liable in a civil action, action for contempt or other appropriate proceeding to the

95 said limitations period shall apply to a claim for a consumer debt, whether the claim sounds in
96 contract, account stated, open account, contract or instrument under seal or other basis.
97 (b) Notwithstanding section 14 of chapter 260, a payment on a consumer debt that is
98 made after the limitations period under subsection (a) has expired shall not revive or extend the
5 of 10
99 limitations period or bar the consumer from asserting a defense to the collection of a consumer
100 debt.
101 (c) No creditor, debt buyer or debt collector shall bring a suit or initiate an arbitration or
102 other legal proceeding to collect a consumer debt if the applicable limitations period under
103 subsection (a) has expired.
104 (d) A waiver by a consumer of a protection or right under this section shall be void and
105 unenforceable.
106 (e) Notwithstanding section 20 of chapter 260 or any other general or special law to the
107 contrary, an action for the collection of a consumer debt arising from a judgment or decree,
108 including an execution upon or trustee process based on said judgment or decree and other
109 activity to collect on the judgment, shall be commenced not more than 10 years after the entry of
110 said judgment or decree. If such an action has commenced within 10 years, said judgment or
111 decree may be renewed one time for 10 years. A judgment or decree shall not be revived or
112 renewed after the limitations period under this subsection has expired.
113 Section 4. (a) A plaintiff who has obtained a judgment on a claim for the collection of a
114 consumer debt shall provide written notice to the consumer debtor not less than 30 days prior to
115 a supplementary process in a civil action for the examination of said consumer debtor pursuant to
116 section 14 of chapter 224 or a payment review hearing in a small claims action pursuant to
117 Uniform Small Claims Rule 7(i). Such notice shall inform the consumer debtor of the
118 opportunity to submit a financial affidavit in a form prescribed by the court and signed under the
119 penalties of perjury. If the consumer debtor indicates through the financial affidavit that all
120 income and assets are exempt from collection and files the affidavit as prescribed by the court,
6 of 10
121 the court shall acknowledge receipt and inform both parties that the supplementary process or
122 payment review hearing shall not occur. Upon filing of said affidavit, no further supplementary
123 proceedings or payment review hearings shall be scheduled unless the judgment creditor presents
124 evidence of the judgment debtor’s non-exempt assets or income and the court determines that
125 there is a reasonable basis to believe that there are non-exempt assets or income warranting the
126 scheduling of a new supplementary process or payment review hearing.
127 (b) Notwithstanding sections 18 and 20 of chapter 224 or any other applicable law, rule,
128 or regulation to the contrary, no capias or other warrant to compel the attendance of an alleged
129 consumer debtor shall be issued for failure of the alleged consumer debtor to appear at a
130 supplementary process in a civil action for an examination pursuant to section 14 of chapter 224
131 or a payment review hearing in a small claims action pursuant to Uniform Small Claims Rule
132 7(i). If the alleged consumer debtor fails to appear, the court shall schedule a show cause hearing
133 to determine whether a capias or other warrant to compel the attendance of the alleged consumer
134 debtor should be issued. No capias or other warrant shall be issued to compel the attendance of
135 the alleged consumer debtor at a show cause hearing without evidence that notice of the said
136 hearing was served on the consumer either by signed return receipt or by a sworn return of
137 service.
138 (c) Notwithstanding sections 18 and 20 of chapter 224 or any other applicable law, rule or
139 regulation to the contrary, an alleged consumer debtor that is compelled to attend pursuant to a
140 capias or other warrant shall be brought before the court the same day. The consumer shall be
141 given the opportunity to complete the financial affidavit described in subsection (a). The capias
142 or other warrant shall be satisfied by the consumer’s appearance in court or completion of the
143 financial affidavit indicating that all forms of income and assets are exempt.
7 of 10
144 (d) Notwithstanding sections 18 and 20 of chapter 224 or any other applicable law, rule
145 or regulation to the contrary, no person shall be imprisoned or jailed for failure to pay a
146 consumer debt, nor shall a person be imprisoned or jailed for contempt of or failure to comply
147 with a court order to pay a consumer debt in part or in full.
148 Section 5. (a) Except as provided in subsection (b), if a plaintiff prevails in an action to
149 collect a consumer debt, interest computed pursuant to section 6C of chapter 231 or section 8
150 chapter 235 shall be limited to a fixed rate of interest of 12 per cent per annum.
151 (b) For actions to collect a consumer debt, judgments entered on or after January 1, 2026,
152 or where an application for renewal of judgment is filed on or after January 1, 2026, interest shall
153 be limited to a fixed rate of 3 per cent per annum. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed
154 to require any interest which accrued at a higher interest rate prior to January 1, 2026, to be re-
155 calculated or reduced to the new 3 per cent rate. Judgments issued prior to January 1, 2026, with
156 an interest rate other than 3 per cent per annum shall not be required to be amended or reissued
157 by the courts.
158 (c) If the plaintiff prevails in an action to collect a consumer debt, the plaintiff may
159 collect attorney’s fees only if the contract or other document evidencing the indebtedness sets
160 forth an obligation of the consumer debtor to pay attorney’s fees; provided, however, that if the
161 contract or other document evidencing indebtedness provides for attorney’s fees in some specific
162 percentage, the provision and obligation shall be valid and enforceable for not more than 15 per
163 cent of the amount of the debt excluding attorney’s fees and collection costs; provided further
164 that if a contract or other document evidencing indebtedness provides for the payment of
165 reasonable attorney’s fees by the consumer debtor, without specifying a specific percentage, the
8 of 10
166 provision shall be construed to mean the lesser of 15 per cent of the amount of the debt,
167 excluding attorney’s fees and collection costs, or the amount of attorney’s fees calculated by a
168 reasonable rate for such cases multiplied by the amount of time reasonably expended to obtain
169 the judgment; provided further, that the documentation setting forth a party’s obligation to pay
170 attorney’s fees shall be provided to the court before a court may enforce those provisions; and
171 provided further, that such documentation shall not include materials that the plaintiff has
172 already filed together with the complaint in compliance with applicable court rules.
173 Section 6. (a) A violation of sections 2 to 5, inclusive, shall constitute a violation of
174 chapter 93A.
175 (b) Any portion of a contract, including a consumer form contract, that violates sections 2
176 to 5, inclusive, shall be void and unenforceable.
177 SECTION 2. Section 28 of chapter 246 of the General Laws, as appearing in the 2022
178 Official Edition, is hereby amended by adding the following paragraph:- This section shall not
179 apply in a proceeding to attach earnings or a pension to satisfy a judgment for collection of a
180 consumer debt as defined in section 1 of chapter 93M, and in such an action, said chapter 93M
181 shall apply.
182 SECTION 3. Section 3 of chapter 93M of the General Laws shall not apply to a
183 consumer debt for which the cause of action accrued before January 1, 2026; provided, however,
184 that subsection (b) of said section 3 of said chapter 93M shall apply to payments made after the
185 effective date of this act; provided, further, that subsection (b) of section 6 of chapter 93M shall
186 not apply to a contract, including a consumer form contract that is in effect before January 1,
187 2026.
9 of 10
188 SECTION 4. This act shall take effect on January 1, 2026.

126 scheduling of a new supplementary process or payment review hearing.
127 (b) Notwithstanding sections 18 and 20 of chapter 224 or any other applicable law, rule,
128 or regulation to the contrary, no capias or other warrant to compel the attendance of an alleged
129 consumer debtor shall be issued for failure of the alleged consumer debtor to appear at a
130 supplementary process in a civil action for an examination pursuant to section 14 of chapter 224
131 or a payment review hearing in a small claims action pursuant to Uniform Small Claims Rule
132 7(i). If the alleged consumer debtor fails to appear, the court shall schedule a show cause hearing
133 to determine whether a capias or other warrant to compel the attendance of the alleged consumer
134 debtor should be issued. No capias or other warrant shall be issued to compel the attendance of
135 the alleged consumer debtor at a show cause hearing without evidence that notice of the said
136 hearing was served on the consumer either by signed return receipt or by a sworn return of
137 service.
138 (c) Notwithstanding sections 18 and 20 of chapter 224 or any other applicable law, rule or
139 regulation to the contrary, an alleged consumer debtor that is compelled to attend pursuant to a
140 capias or other warrant shall be brought before the court the same day. The consumer shall be
141 given the opportunity to complete the financial affidavit described in subsection (a). The capias
142 or other warrant shall be satisfied by the consumer’s appearance in court or completion of the
143 financial affidavit indicating that all forms of income and assets are exempt.

144 (d) Notwithstanding sections 18 and 20 of chapter 224 or any other applicable law, rule
145 or regulation to the contrary, no person shall be imprisoned or jailed for failure to pay a
146 consumer debt, nor shall a person be imprisoned or jailed for contempt of or failure to comply
147 with a court order to pay a consumer debt in part or in full.
148 Section 5. (a) Except as provided in subsection (b), if a plaintiff prevails in an action to
149 collect a consumer debt, interest computed pursuant to section 6C of chapter 231 or section 8
150 chapter 235 shall be limited to a fixed rate of interest of 12 per cent per annum.
151 (b) For actions to collect a consumer debt, judgments entered on or after January 1, 2026,
152 or where an application for renewal of judgment is filed on or after January 1, 2026, interest shall
153 be limited to a fixed rate of 3 per cent per annum. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed
154 to require any interest which accrued at a higher interest rate prior to January 1, 2026, to be re-
155 calculated or reduced to the new 3 per cent rate. Judgments issued prior to January 1, 2026, with
156 an interest rate other than 3 per cent per annum shall not be required to be amended or reissued
157 by the courts.
158 (c) If the plaintiff prevails in an action to collect a consumer debt, the plaintiff may
159 collect attorney’s fees only if the contract or other document evidencing the indebtedness sets
160 forth an obligation of the consumer debtor to pay attorney’s fees; provided, however, that if the
161 contract or other document evidencing indebtedness provides for attorney’s fees in some specific
162 percentage, the provision and obligation shall be valid and enforceable for not more than 15 per
163 cent of the amount of the debt excluding attorney’s fees and collection costs; provided further
164 that if a contract or other document evidencing indebtedness provides for the payment of
165 reasonable attorney’s fees by the consumer debtor, without specifying a specific percentage, the
8 of 10

166 provision shall be construed to mean the lesser of 15 per cent of the amount of the debt,
167 excluding attorney’s fees and collection costs, or the amount of attorney’s fees calculated by a
168 reasonable rate for such cases multiplied by the amount of time reasonably expended to obtain
169 the judgment; provided further, that the documentation setting forth a party’s obligation to pay
170 attorney’s fees shall be provided to the court before a court may enforce those provisions; and
171 provided further, that such documentation shall not include materials that the plaintiff has
172 already filed together with the complaint in compliance with applicable court rules.
173 Section 6. (a) A violation of sections 2 to 5, inclusive, shall constitute a violation of
174 chapter 93A.
175 (b) Any portion of a contract, including a consumer form contract, that violates sections 2
176 to 5, inclusive, shall be void and unenforceable.
177 SECTION 2. Section 28 of chapter 246 of the General Laws, as appearing in the 2022
178 Official Edition, is hereby amended by adding the following paragraph:- This section shall not
179 apply in a proceeding to attach earnings or a pension to satisfy a judgment for collection of a
180 consumer debt as defined in section 1 of chapter 93M, and in such an action, said chapter 93M
181 shall apply.
182 SECTION 3. Section 3 of chapter 93M of the General Laws shall not apply to a
183 consumer debt for which the cause of action accrued before January 1, 2026; provided, however,
184 that subsection (b) of said section 3 of said chapter 93M shall apply to payments made after the
185 effective date of this act; provided, further, that subsection (b) of section 6 of chapter 93M shall
186 not apply to a contract, including a consumer form contract that is in effect before January 1,
187 2026.
