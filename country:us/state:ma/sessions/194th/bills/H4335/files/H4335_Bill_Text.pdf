An Act relative to cognitive rehabilitation for individuals with an acquired brain injury.
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives in General Court assembled, and by the authority
of the same, as follows:
1 SECTION 1. Chapter 32A of the General Laws is hereby amended by inserting after
2 section 17Z the following section:-
3 Section 17AA. (a) For purposes of this section, the following terms shall have the
4 following meanings:-
5 “Acquired brain injury (ABI)” is any injury to the brain which occurs after birth and can
6 be caused by infectious diseases, metabolic disorders, endocrine disorders or diminished oxygen,
7 brain tumors, toxins, disease that affects the blood supply to the brain, stroke or a traumatic brain
8 injury.
9 “Cognitive communication therapy” treats problems with communication which have an
10 underlying cause in a cognitive deficit rather than a primary language or speech deficit.
11 “Cognitive rehabilitation therapy (CRT)” is a process of re-learning cognitive skills
12 essential for daily living through the coordinated specialized, integrated therapeutic treatments
1 of 18

13 which are provided in dynamic settings designed for efficient and effective re-learning following
14 damage to brain cells or brain chemistry due to brain injury.
15 “Community reintegration services” provide incremental guided real-world therapeutic
16 training to develop skills essential for an individual to participate in life: to re-enter employment;
17 to go to school and engage in other productive activity; to safely live independently; and to
18 participate in their community while avoiding re-hospitalization and long-term support needs.
19 “Functional rehabilitation therapy and remediation” is a structured approach to
20 rehabilitation for brain disorders which emphasizes learning by doing, and focuses re-learning a
21 specific task in a prescribed format, with maximum opportunity for repeated correct practice.
22 Compensatory strategies are developed for those skills which are persistently impaired and
23 individuals are trained on daily implementation. To ensure acquisition and use, focus is set on re-
24 learning those skills essential for safe daily living in the environment in which they will be used:
25 home and community settings.
26 “Medical necessity” or “medically necessary,” health care services that are consistent
27 with generally accepted principles of professional medical practice.
28 “Neurobehavioral therapy” is a set of medical and therapeutic assessment and treatments

32 in cognitive function which has not been present since birth and is a decline from a previously
33 attained level of function.

35 capacity or an individual’s ability to exert control over behavior, thoughts and feelings. It is a

43 psychological overlay.
44 “Post-acute residential treatment” includes integrated medical and therapeutic services,
45 treatment, education, and skills training within a 24/7 real-world environment of care- a home
46 and community setting. Maximum opportunity to for correct practice of skill in the context of
47 use develops new neural pathways which ensure ongoing skill use and avoidance of re-
48 hospitalization and long-term care.
