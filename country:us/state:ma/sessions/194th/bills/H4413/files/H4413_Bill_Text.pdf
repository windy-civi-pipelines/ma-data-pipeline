To the Honorable Senate and House of Representatives,
I am submitting for your consideration the attached legislation recommending terms for
certain bonds authorized in sections 3 and 4 of chapter 17 of the acts of 2025, entitled “An Act
Financing Improvements to Municipal Roads and Bridges”.
Pursuant to section 3 of Article LXII of the Amendments to the Constitution of the
Commonwealth of Massachusetts, I recommend that the bonds that the State Treasurer is
authorized to issue pursuant to sections 3 and 4 of chapter 17, inclusive, of the acts of 2025 be
issued for terms not to exceed 30 years from the date of issuance thereof; provided, however, that
all such bonds shall be payable not later than June 30, 2065.
I appreciate the Legislature’s prompt attention to enacting this necessary piece of
legislation to allow important capital projects in the Commonwealth to proceed.
Respectfully submitted,
Maura T. Healey,
