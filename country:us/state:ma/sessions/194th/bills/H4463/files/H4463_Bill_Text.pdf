3 of 5

57 There shall be a separate fund, to be administered by the board of higher education,
58 which shall be known as the Green and Healthy Public College and University Building Fund.
59 The fund shall be credited with: (i) appropriations, bond proceeds or other money authorized or
60 transferred by the general court and specifically designated to be credited to the fund; (ii) funds
61 from public and private sources, including, but not limited to gifts, grants and donations; and (iii)
62 any interest earned on such funds. Amounts credited to the fund shall be used, without further
63 appropriation, to fund and implement the recommendations of the Green and Healthy Public
64 College and University Building Planning Commission, established in section 48 of chapter 15A,
65 for the renovation and rehabilitation of existing buildings and new building construction to meet
66 the recommended green and healthy public higher education buildings standards.
67 SECTION 3. The Green and Healthy Public College and University Building Planning
68 Commission, as established in section 48 of chapter 15A of the General Laws, shall create and
69 recommend a plan for all existing and new public higher education buildings to equitably meet,
70 by December 31, 2037, the standards for green and healthy public higher education buildings
71 developed pursuant to paragraph (c) of said section 48 of said chapter 15A. The commission
72 shall issue recommendations, including an analysis that summarizes the findings of its
73 assessment of public higher education buildings in the commonwealth, for implementing green
74 and healthy public higher education buildings standards for cost-effective renovation and
75 rehabilitation of existing buildings and for new building construction, along with a plan to ensure
76 all such buildings meet these standards by December 31, 2037.
77 The recommendations shall prioritize addressing buildings with the greatest needs first,
78 based in part on recommendations made to the commission by the department of higher
79 education and the University of Massachusetts. The recommendations shall also consider the
4 of 5

80 environmental conditions of buildings, surrounding communities and resources, site challenges
81 and buildings serving the highest percentage of low income or historically underserved students.
82 The recommendations shall estimate the cost of bringing all buildings into compliance with the
83 standards by December 31, 2037, including the ongoing cost of maintenance and repair, and
84 recommend a plan to fund these costs, and shall also compare those costs with long-term savings
85 in health and medical costs, energy costs, maintenance, life cycle assessment and other savings
86 and the growth in economic activity of bringing buildings to the standards, including increased
87 jobs and job training.
88 The first plan of the commission shall be published and submitted to the clerks of the
89 senate and house of representatives, the joint committee on ways and means and the joint
90 committee on higher education not later than December 31, 2028. Prior to completing its
91 assessment and issuing its recommendations, the commission shall conduct public hearings at
92 every commonwealth institution of public higher education and shall consult with employee
93 organizations, as defined in chapter 150E, representing employees at each institution of public
94 higher education.
