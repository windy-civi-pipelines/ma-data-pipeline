An Act to ensure affordable prescription medications through accountability standards.
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives in General Court assembled, and by the authority
of the same, as follows:
1 SECTION 1. Section 1 of chapter 6D of the General Laws, as appearing in the
2 2022 Official Edition, is hereby amended by inserting after the definition of “Alternative
3 payment methodologies or methods” the following definition:-
4 “Biosimilar”, a drug that is produced or distributed pursuant to a biologics license
5 application approved under 42 U.S.C. 262(k)(3).
6 SECTION 2. Said chapter 6D, as so appearing, is hereby further amended by adding the
7 following section:-
8 Section 23. (a) For the purposes of this section, “Manufacturer” shall mean an entity that
9 manufactures a pharmaceutical drug.
10 (b) The commission may require a manufacturer specified in subsection (c) to disclose to
11 the commission within a reasonable time information relating to the manufacturer’s pricing of
1 of 8
12 that drug, on a standard reporting form developed by the commission with the input of the
13 manufacturers, which includes, but shall not be limited to, the following:
14 (1) A schedule of the drug’s wholesale acquisition cost increases over the previous 5
15 calendar years;
16 (2) The manufacturer’s aggregate, company-level research and development and other
17 relevant capital expenditures, including facility construction, for the most recent year for which
18 final audited data are available;
19 (3) A written, narrative description, suitable for public release, of factors that contributed
20 to reported changes in wholesale acquisition cost during the previous 5 calendar years; and
21 (4) Any other information that the manufacturer wishes to provide to the commission.
22 Based on the records furnished, the commission may identify a proposed value for a
23 prescribed drug specified in subsection (c). The Commission may request additional relevant
24 information that it deems necessary.
25 (c) A manufacturer of a drug for which the commission has received a referral from the
26 center under subsection (b) of section 25 of chapter 12C shall comply with the requirements set
27 forth in this section; provided that the commission may select or prioritize a subset of the
28 referred drugs for the commission’s review.
29 (d) Records disclosed by a manufacturer under this section shall: (i) be accompanied by
30 an attestation that all information provided is true and correct; (ii) not be public records under
31 section 7 of chapter 4 or chapter 66; and (iii) remain confidential; provided, however, that the
32 commission may produce reports summarizing any findings; provided that any such report shall
2 of 8
33 not be in a form that identifies specific prices charged for or rebate amounts associated with
34 drugs by a manufacturer, or in a manner that is likely to compromise the financial, competitive or
35 proprietary nature of the information.
36 (e) If, after review of any records furnished to the commission under subsection (b), the
37 commission determines that the manufacturer’s pricing of the drug is potentially unreasonable or
38 excessive in relation to the commission’s proposed value under subsection (b), the commission
39 shall require that the manufacturer provide within 30 days further information related to the
40 pricing of the prescribed drug and the manufacturer’s justification for the pricing. In addition to
41 the manufacturer, the commission may identify other relevant parties including but not limited to
42 patients, providers, provider organizations and payers who may provide information to the
43 commission.
44 (f) The commission shall provide to the manufacturer for review and input any
45 information, analyses or reports regarding a particular drug reviewed or relied on by the
46 commission in assessing the proposed value of the drug shall be provided to the manufacturer.
47 The commission shall consider any clarifications or data provided by the manufacturer with
48 respect to its drug. The commission may not rely solely on the analysis or research of an outside
49 third party in reaching its determination regarding the proposed value or the reasonableness of
50 the drug pricing.
51 (g) If the commission relies upon a third party to provide cost-effectiveness analysis or
52 research related to the proposed value, such analysis or research shall also provide, without
53 limitation (i) a description of the methodologies and models used by the third party in its
54 analysis; (ii) any assumptions and potential limitations of research findings in the context of the
3 of 8
55 results; and (iii) outcomes for affected subpopulations that utilize the drug, including but not
56 limited to potential impacts on individuals of minority racial or ethnic groups, and on individuals
57 with specific disabilities or health conditions who regularly utilize the eligible drug.
58 (h) Not later than 60 days after receiving information from the manufacturer, as required
59 under subsections (b) or (e), the commission shall issue a determination on whether the
60 manufacturer’s pricing of a drug is unreasonable or excessive in relation to the commission’s
61 proposed value of the drug. Following the determination, the commission shall issue
62 recommendations on measures to reduce the cost of the drug and to improve the affordability of
63 the drug for patients. Recommendations may include, but not be limited to: (i) an alternative
64 purchasing plan or value-based payment methodology; (ii) a bulk purchasing program; (iii)
65 changes to co-pay, deductibles, coinsurance or other cost-sharing requirements; or (iv) a
66 reinsurance program to subsidize the cost of the eligible drug. The commission shall make its
67 determination and recommendations public and shall post them on its website and shall provide
68 them to private and public health care payers.
69 (i) If the manufacturer fails to timely comply with the commission’s request for records
70 under subsections (b) or (e), or otherwise knowingly obstructs the commission’s ability to issue
71 its determination under subsection (h), including, but not limited to, providing incomplete, false
72 or misleading information, the commission may assess a civil penalty to a manufacturer of not
73 more than $500,000. A civil penalty assessed under this subsection shall be deposited into the
74 Payment Reform Fund established pursuant to section 100 of chapter 194 of the acts of 2011.
75 The commission shall seek to promote compliance with this section and shall only impose a civil
76 penalty on the manufacturer as a last resort.
4 of 8
77 (j) Neither the proposed value, nor the analysis produced via the process to determine a
78 proposed value, is intended to be used by MassHealth, health insurance carriers, managed care
79 organizations, accountable care organizations, hospitals or pharmacies to determine whether a
80 treatment should be approved for an individual patient, whether any individual patient should be
81 subjected to step therapy or other utilization management methodology,
82 (k) The commission shall adopt any written policies, procedures or regulations that the
83 commission determines necessary to implement this section.
84 SECTION 3. Section 11N of chapter 12 of the General Laws, as appearing in the 2022
85 Official Edition, is hereby amended by striking out subsection (a) and inserting in place thereof
