An Act authorizing ranked choice voting in the town of Arlington.
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives in General Court assembled, and by the authority
of the same, as follows:
1 SECTION l. Chapter 503 of the acts of 1952, as most recently amended by section 1 of
2 chapter 10 of the acts of 2022, is hereby further amended by inserting after section 8A the
3 following section:-
4 Section 8B. Ranked Choice Voting
5 (a) For the purposes of this section, the following terms shall, unless the context clearly
6 requires otherwise, have the following meanings:
7 “Concluded ballot”, a ballot that does not rank any continuing candidate or contains an
8 overvote at the highest-ranked continuing candidate.
9 “Continuing candidate”, a candidate who has not been defeated.
1 of 4
10 “Highest-ranked continuing candidate”, the continuing candidate with the highest ranking
11 on a voter's ballot. Where a ballot omits l or more rankings, the next highest ranking shall be
12 used for determining the highest-ranked continuing candidate.
13 “Overvote”, a circumstance in which a voter ranks more than 1 candidate at the same
14 ranking.
15 “Ranked choice voting”, a method of casting and tabulating ballots in which voters rank
16 candidates for office in order of preference.
17 “Ranking”, the number assigned on a ballot by a voter to a candidate to express the
18 voter's preference for that candidate. Ranking number 1 shall be the highest ranking, ranking
19 number 2 shall be the next-highest ranking and so on.
20 (b) The offices of select board member, school committee member, moderator, elected
21 member of the board of the housing authority and assessor shall be elected by ranked choice
22 voting, except for single-seat offices when the number of candidates printed on the ballot is less
23 than or equal to 2 or multi-seat offices when the number of candidates printed on the ballot is
24 less than or equal to the number of seats to be elected. Rank choice voting elections shall be
25 tabulated in rounds pursuant to this section.
26 (c) In any single-seat election, each round shall begin by counting the number of votes for
27 each continuing candidate. Each ballot shall count as 1 vote for its highest-ranked continuing
28 candidate. Concluded ballots shall not be counted for any continuing candidate. Each round shall
29 end with 1 of the following 2 outcomes:
2 of 4
30 (1) If there are 2 continuing candidates, the candidate with the most votes shall be
31 elected, and tabulation shall be complete.
32 (2) Otherwise, the candidate with the fewest votes shall be defeated and a new round
33 shall begin.
34 (d) In any multi-seat election, the first seat shall be filled pursuant to the tabulation
35 process established in subsection (c). The remaining seats shall be filled by repeated application
36 of the tabulation process established in subsection (c); provided, however, that all votes marked
37 for candidates who have already been elected shall be disregarded and votes shall be counted for
38 the next highest-ranked continuing candidate.
39 (e) If 2 or more candidates are tied with the fewest votes such that tabulation cannot
40 continue until the candidate with the fewest votes is defeated, then the tied candidate with the
41 fewest votes in the prior round shall be defeated. If 2 or more such tied candidates were tied with
42 the fewest votes in the prior round, the second tie shall be decided by referring similarly to the
43 number of votes for each candidate in the second-prior round. This process shall be applied
44 successively as many times as necessary. The town clerk shall establish a method of tiebreaking
45 that will be used if 2 or more candidates are tied with the fewest votes in the first round of
46 tabulation.
47 (f) The town clerk may make any changes, subject to approval by the select board, to the
48 ranked choice voting ballot and tabulation process necessary to ensure the integrity and smooth
49 functioning of the election; provided, that ranked choice voting shall still be used and the fewest
50 number of changes shall be made to achieve such purpose.
51 (g) The town clerk shall publish election results that show the tabulation by rounds.
3 of 4
52 SECTION 2. (A) The following question shall be placed on the ballot to be used at a
53 regular state or town election or at a special election called for the purpose of presenting the
54 question to the voters:
55 Shall an act entitled "An Act Authorizing Ranked Choice Voting in the Town of
56 Arlington" be accepted?
57 (B) The town attorney shall prepare the summary of the proposed legislation, which shall
58 appear on the ballot along with the question provided in paragraph (A) of this section.
59 (C) If a majority of votes cast in answer to the question is in the affirmative, section 1 of
60 this act shall take effect in the town of Arlington, but not otherwise.
61 SECTION 3. Section 2 shall take effect upon the passage of this act.
