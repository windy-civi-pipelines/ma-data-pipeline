170 services of an independent repair provider, for that manufacturer's brand of agricultural
171 equipment; except that, if compliance with the memorandum of understanding would deny the
172 owner any rights afforded to the owner in this chapter, including any rights to documentation,
173 data, tools or embedded software for agricultural equipment necessary for the diagnosis,
174 maintenance or repair of the owner's agricultural equipment, the owner is entitled to the
