An Act making appropriations for fiscal year 2025 to provide for supplementing certain existing

important public purposes, therefore it is hereby declared to be an emergency law, necessary for
the immediate preservation of the public convenience.
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives in General Court assembled, and by the authority
of the same, as follows:
1 SECTION 1. To provide for certain unanticipated obligations of the commonwealth, to
2 provide for an alteration of purpose for current appropriations and to meet certain requirements
3 of law, the sums set forth in this section are hereby appropriated from the General Fund or the
4 Transitional Escrow Fund established in section 16 of chapter 76 of the acts of 2021, as amended

6 section, for the several purposes and subject to the conditions specified in this section, and
7 subject to the laws regulating the disbursement of public funds for the fiscal year ending June 30,
