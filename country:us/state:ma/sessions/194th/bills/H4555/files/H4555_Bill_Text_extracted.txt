317 SECTION 6. (a)(1) Notwithstanding any general or special law to the contrary, if a
318 newborn screening for hereditary disorders performed pursuant to section 270.006(A)(2)(e) of
319 chapter 105, Code of Massachusetts Regulations detects the presence of sickle cell trait, the
320 laboratory performing the screening shall notify the physician responsible for the newborn’s care
16 of 22

321 and shall document the patient’s information in the central registry established pursuant to
322 paragraph (2) in a manner and on forms prescribed by the department of public health.

326 including a document available in multiple languages (as determined by the department) that

329 preceding sentence is not identified, the laboratory described in paragraph (1) shall provide the
330 patient’s parents with such information relating to genetic counseling. Genetic counseling
331 concerning a diagnosis of sickle cell trait shall include, but not be limited to, information
332 concerning the fact that one or both of the parents carries sickle cell trait and the risk that other
333 children born to the parents may carry sickle cell trait or may be born with sickle cell disease.
334 (b)(1) The commissioner of public health shall establish a central registry of patients
335 diagnosed with sickle cell trait. The information in the central registry shall be used for the

343 diagnosed with sickle cell trait. Such notifications shall be provided: at least once when the
344 patient is in early adolescence, when the patient may begin to participate in strenuous athletic
345 activities that could result in adverse symptoms for a person with sickle cell trait; at least once
346 during later adolescence, when the patient should be made aware of the reproductive
347 implications of sickle cell trait; and at such other intervals as the commissioner may require.
348 (3) The commissioner shall establish a system under which the department shall make
349 reasonable efforts to notify patients listed in the registry who reach the age of 18 years of the
350 patient’s inclusion in the registry and of the availability of educational services, genetic
351 counseling, and other resources that may be beneficial to the patient.
