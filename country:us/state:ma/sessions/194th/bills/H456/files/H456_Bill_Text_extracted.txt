8 following new section:-
9 Section 15G. The commission shall make available licenses annually for the operation of
10 online wine and malt beverages stores, which shall have a physical address but need not have a

13 SECTION 3. Section 22 of chapter 138, as so appearing, is hereby amended by striking
14 the section in its entirety and inserting in place thereof the following:-
15 Section 22. Any person may, but only for his own use and that of his family and guests,
16 transport alcoholic beverages or alcohol, without any license or permit, but not exceeding in
17 amount, at any one time, twenty gallons of malt beverages, three gallons of any other alcoholic
18 beverage, or one gallon of alcohol, or their measured equivalent; provided, that any person may,
19 without any license or permit, transport from his place of residence to a new place of residence
20 established by him alcoholic beverages manufactured by him for his own private use.
21 Licensees for the sale of alcoholic beverages or alcohol, as the case may be, may
22 transport and deliver anywhere in or outside of the commonwealth alcoholic beverages or
23 alcohol lawfully bought or sold by them, in vehicles owned or leased by them or their
24 employees, if each vehicle used for such transportation and delivery is covered by a permit
25 issued by the commission; provided, however, that vehicles owned or leased by holders of
26 permits under section nineteen A may be used only for the transportation of samples or of no
27 more than twenty-four gallons of alcoholic beverages or alcohol; provided, further, that the
28 salesperson possesses the proper invoice and that a record of these deliveries is kept available by
29 the wholesaler for commission inspection. The permit fee for each vehicle shall be $150.
30 Any railroad or car corporation or the owner or operator of any vessel or shipping
31 company or any common carrier by air may, if authorized by a permit issued by the commission,

43 Every person operating a vehicle when engaged in such transportation or delivery shall
44 carry the vehicle permit or a certified copy thereof; provided, however, that no permit shall be

46 within or outside of the commonwealth and shall, upon demand of any constable, policeman,
47 member of the state police or any investigator of the commission produce such permit or copy
48 for inspection; and failure to produce such permit or copy shall be prima facie evidence of
49 unlawful transportation and shall, in the discretion of the commission, be sufficient cause for the
50 suspension, cancellation, revocation or forfeiture of such permit.
51 Whoever knowingly transports within or outside the commonwealth any alcoholic
52 beverages or alcohol except as authorized by this section shall be punished by a fine of not more

60 ultimate consumers of such products. There shall be a fee for such permit, and persons operating
61 a vehicle when engaged in such transportation or delivery shall be required to carry such permit
62 or certified copy thereof. Parcels transported or delivered under this paragraph shall be clearly
63 labeled with words that indicate that the package contains alcohol and that the signature of a

65 contain a check box next to the recipient's signature where he shall certify that he is not under 21

69 receive the signature of a person accepting delivery of a parcel under this section and to certify
70 that the person has displayed a valid identification as so required. No such delivery shall exceed
71 108 liters.
72 Upon application by an operator of a catering business, the commission is authorized to
73 issue and may issue a permit, to be renewed annually, to such operator to receive alcoholic
74 beverages or alcohol on behalf of, and transport and deliver such alcoholic beverages or alcohol
