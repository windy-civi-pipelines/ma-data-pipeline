An Act authorizing the town of Cohasset to grant five additional licenses for the sale of all

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives in General Court assembled, and by the authority
of the same, as follows:
1 SECTION 1. (a) Notwithstanding section 17 of chapter 138 of the General Laws, the
2 licensing authority of the town of Cohasset may grant 5 additional licenses for the sale of all
3 alcoholic beverages to be drunk on the premises pursuant to section 12 of said chapter 138 to
4 establishments located within the 3 economic development zones described in subsection (b)
5 upon approval of and under conditions set by the licensing authority of the town of Cohasset. A
6 license granted under this act shall be clearly marked on its face either “Village District”, “3A
7 Commercial District” or “Harbor District” as applicable, and subject to all of said chapter 138
8 except said section 17.
9 (b) The licensing authority shall restrict the licenses authorized in this act to
10 establishments located within either the town’s: (i) “Village District”; (ii) “3A Commercial
11 District”; or (iii) “Harbor District” as those areas are designated on the map entitled “Town of
12 Cohasset Massachusetts Zoning District Map September 2024” as adopted by Town Meeting
1 of 2

13 commencing June 5, 2024, a copy of which is on file in the office of the town clerk of the town
14 of Cohasset.
15 (c) A license granted pursuant to this act shall only be exercised in the dining room of a
16 common victualler and other such public rooms or areas as may be deemed reasonable and
17 appropriate by the licensing authority as certified in writing.
18 (d) The licensing authority shall not approve the transfer of a license granted pursuant to
19 this act to a location outside of its initial zoned area as described in clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) of
20 subsection (b), but it may grant such license to a new applicant within such initial zoned area if
21 the applicant files with the licensing authority a letter from the department of revenue and a letter
22 from the department of unemployment assistance indicating that the license is in good standing
23 with those departments and that all applicable taxes, fees and contributions have been paid.
24 (e) If a licensee terminates or fails to renew a license granted under this act or any such
25 license granted under this act is cancelled, revoked or no longer in use, the license shall be
26 returned physically, with all of the legal rights, privileges and restrictions pertaining thereto, to
27 the licensing authority, which may then grant the license to a new applicant under the same
28 conditions specified in this act.
29 (f) All licenses granted under this act shall be issued within 5 years after the effective
30 date of this act; provided, however, that a license originally granted within that time period may
31 be granted to a new applicant under subsections (d) and (e) thereafter.
32 SECTION 2. This act shall take effect upon its passage.
