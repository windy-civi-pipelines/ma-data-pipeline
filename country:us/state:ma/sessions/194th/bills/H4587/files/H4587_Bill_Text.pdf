In the One Hundred and Ninety-Fourth General Court
(2025-2026)
_______________
An Act establishing a sick leave bank for David A. Russell, an employee of the Department of
Corrections (DOC).
Whereas, The deferred operation of this act would tend to defeat its purpose, which is to
establish forthwith a sick leave bank for an employee of the Department of Corrections (DOC),
therefore it is hereby declared to be an emergency law, necessary for the immediate preservation
of the public convenience.
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives in General Court assembled, and by the authority
of the same, as follows:
1 Notwithstanding any general or special law to the contrary, the Department of
2 Corrections (DOC) shall establish a sick leave bank for David A. Russell, an employee of the
3 office. Any employee of the office may voluntarily contribute 1 or more sick, personal or
4 vacation days to the sick leave bank for use by David A. Russell. If David A. Russell terminates
5 employment with the office or requests to dissolve the sick leave bank, any remaining time in the
6 sick leave bank shall be transferred to the extended illness leave bank. Sick leave bank days shall
7 not be used for absences unrelated to the illness or disability that necessitated the establishment
8 of the sick leave bank as determined by the office.
