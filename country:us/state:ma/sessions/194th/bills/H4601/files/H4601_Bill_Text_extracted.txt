570 Section 1. It is hereby found that the closure of the Naval Air Station hereinafter referred
571 to as NAS South Weymouth, by the United States Government in September of 1997 is
572 detrimental to the economic welfare of the citizens of the commonwealth and, in particular, the
573 towns of Abington and Rockland and the city known as the town of Weymouth. The closure of
574 this military installation imposes upon the commonwealth and its citizens an increased fiscal
575 burden in addition to that incurred by the commonwealth on account of the closure of various
576 other military installations in the commonwealth. It is further found that the full redevelopment
577 of NAS South Weymouth remains essential for the benefit of the towns of Abington, Rockland
578 and Weymouth, the region and the commonwealth and, to that end, chapter 291 of the acts of
579 2014 reconstituted the South Shore Tri-Town Development Corporation, or SSTDC, as the
29 of 99
580 Southfield Redevelopment Authority, and this act shall reinforce applicable control over land use
581 and development decisions affecting Abington, Rockland and Weymouth that constitute NAS
582 South Weymouth and strengthen the alignment of interests between the authority, the towns and
583 the master developer as defined herein. Therefore, it is the purpose of this act to promote the
584 expeditious and orderly conversion and redevelopment of NAS South Weymouth for nonmilitary
585 purposes including, but not limited to, commercial, housing, industrial, institutional, educational,
586 governmental, recreational, conservation or manufacturing uses in order to prevent blight,
587 economic dislocation and additional unemployment and to aid and strengthen the local economy,
588 the regional economy and the economy of the commonwealth. In order to achieve these
589 objectives, it is deemed necessary and appropriate to continue the structure of SSTDC, as
590 renamed and reconstituted pursuant to chapter 291 of the acts of 2014, with full powers and
591 authority to carry out this act.
592 Section 2. It shall be the goal of this act to promote the expeditious acquisition and
593 redevelopment of NAS South Weymouth while addressing the economic, social and
594 environmental needs of the region. Except as otherwise provided in this act, this goal shall be
595 accomplished in a manner consistent with the zoning by-laws. The redevelopment is designed to
596 minimize and mitigate negative off-base impacts on the area such as those on water resources, air
597 quality, traffic and noise, and to limit the impacts to those necessary to achieve community reuse
598 goals and objectives. The redevelopment shall be integrated with the United States government's
599 cleanup of hazardous materials on the base to ensure effective, expeditious and efficient
600 environmental remediation and protection of public health and welfare in accordance with
601 federal and state law and regulation.
30 of 99
602 Section 3. There was created by chapter 291 of the acts of 2014 a body politic and
603 corporate, to be known as the Southfield Redevelopment Authority, to carry out this act. The
604 authority is deemed to be a public instrumentality and the exercise by the authority of the powers
605 conferred by this act shall be deemed and held to be the performance of public functions. The
606 authority shall be included within the definition of a “local government unit or local
607 governmental unit”, as defined in section 1 of chapter 29C of the General Laws, and its bonds
608 and notes shall be included within the definition of “local governmental obligations”, as defined
609 in said section 1 of said chapter 29C. The authority shall be included within the definition of a
610 “governmental entity” for purposes of owning public infrastructure improvements pursuant to
611 chapter 293 of the acts of 2006. The authority shall be an “eligible applicant” and a municipality
612 for the purposes of the General Laws and the authority, the town of Rockland, the town of
613 Weymouth and the town of Abington shall be eligible for any financial or other assistance from
614 the Massachusetts School Building Authority and the Massachusetts Department of
615 Transportation pursuant to chapter 90 of the General Laws.
616 To achieve its primary purpose of securing the redevelopment of NAS South Weymouth
617 for the benefit of the towns of Abington, Rockland and Weymouth, the authority shall be guided
618 in its financing activities with the goal of generating fiscal benefit to the towns stemming from
619 the redevelopment. The authority, during its existence, and the master developer, giving
620 consideration to its economic interests, shall pursue the redevelopment of the underutilized land
621 within NAS South Weymouth in a manner that, in the aggregate, generates revenue for the towns
622 that exceeds the costs that the towns incur for the provision of those municipal services that the
623 towns are obligated to provide to NAS South Weymouth pursuant to this act. The authority shall,
624 to the maximum extent feasible and consistent with the zoning by-laws, dispose of all of the
31 of 99
625 property within the NAS South Weymouth redevelopment area through sale or other transfer

1036 (e) Directors may receive compensation as determined from time to time by the advisory
1037 board established by section 11. Directors shall receive reimbursement of such incidental
1038 expenses determined by the board to be necessary; provided, however, that the annual
1039 compensation of the directors shall not exceed $6,250 or 80 per cent of the total combined
1040 average of the annual salaries of the town councilors of the town of Weymouth, whichever is
1041 higher.
1042 (f) Directors shall be residents of the commonwealth. No director or employee of the
1043 authority shall be a local elected public official of the town of Abington, Rockland or
1044 Weymouth, except that residents of the towns of Abington and Rockland who participate in their
1045 respective town meetings shall not be restricted from service as a director or employee of the
1046 authority. Each resident appointee shall maintain a legal residence within NAS South
1047 Weymouth, and each town appointee shall maintain a legal residence in his or her appointing
1048 town, at all times during his or her respective term on the board. Any resident or town appointee
1049 who fails to maintain his or her legal residence as required shall be automatically disqualified
1050 from further service on the board without need for further action by the board or the relevant
1051 appointing authority.
1052 (g) Public employees or appointed officials of the federal government and the
1053 commonwealth and its political subdivisions may serve as directors of the authority so long as
51 of 99
1054 their service as director does not constitute a conflict of interest with their duties as public
1055 employees or appointed officials.
1056 (h) Directors shall be subject to chapter 268A of the General Laws.
1057 (i) The directors may, from time to time, by majority vote designate employees of the
1058 authority, consultants and other individuals to participate on boards, commissions, committees
1059 and other organizations established by the authority or otherwise related to the project as a
1060 representative of the directors.
1061 (j) The directors may, from time to time, by majority vote, authorize a person, other than
1062 a majority of the board, to issue endorsements, certificates and other ministerial documents in
1063 furtherance of actions taken by the board.
1064 (k) The officers and directors of the authority shall have the full protections afforded by
1065 section 13 of chapter 258 of the General Laws to the same extent as municipal officers in a city
1066 or town which has accepted said section 13 of said chapter 258.
1067 (l) Sections 18 to 25, inclusive, of chapter 30A of the General Laws shall apply to the
1068 authority.
1069 Section 10. If a director, or member of his immediate family shall be interested either
1070 directly or indirectly, or shall be a director, officer or employee of or have an ownership interest
1071 in a firm or authority interested directly or indirectly, in a contract or other matter involving the
1072 authority, such interest shall be disclosed to the board and shall be set forth in the minutes of the
1073 board. The member having such interest shall not participate on behalf of the authority in any
1074 proceeding or decision relating to such contract or matter. For the purpose of this section,
52 of 99
1075 immediate family shall include spouse, parent, parent-in-law, brother, brother-in-law, sister,
1076 sister-in-law, son, son-in-law, daughter, daughter-in-law and the parent or child of any of such
1077 individuals.
1078 Notwithstanding the foregoing, or the provisions of chapter 268A of the General Laws,
1079 an interest of a resident appointee or of a member of the immediate family of a resident
1080 appointee arising solely on account of the appointee’s or immediate family member’s residing at
1081 NAS South Weymouth shall not be disqualifying and shall not be deemed an impermissible
1082 conflict of interest.
1083 Section 11. (a) There shall be an advisory board to the authority consisting of: (i) 1 voting
1084 representative appointed by the town of Abington and 1 voting representative appointed by the

1101 by-laws or at a special meeting called by the authority or by a quorum of the advisory board. A
1102 quorum of the advisory board shall consist of a majority of its representatives, but in no event
1103 shall it be less than 4 representatives. The advisory board may act by the affirmative vote of a
1104 majority of the representatives present that constitute a quorum.
1105 (c) For the conduct of its business the advisory board shall adopt and may revise and
1106 amend its own by-laws. The advisory board shall elect from among its members a chairperson, a
1107 vice chairperson and a secretary and such other officers as the advisory board may determine.
1108 Each such officer shall serve in such capacity at the pleasure of the advisory board and may be
1109 removed from such position by majority vote of the advisory board. In the event of a vacancy,
1110 the appointing authority shall fill the vacancy for the unexpired term. Each member of the
1111 advisory board shall serve without compensation but may be reimbursed for all reasonable
1112 expenses incurred in the performance of his or her duties as approved by the advisory board and
1113 the authority.
1114 (d) The purposes of the advisory board shall be as follows: (i) to review the annual report
1115 of the authority and to prepare comments thereon for the benefit of the authority, the governor
1116 and the towns, and to make such examinations of the reports on the authority's records and
1117 affairs as the advisory board deems appropriate; (ii) to hold meetings with the board of directors
1118 of the authority and, at the discretion of the advisory board and with the concurrence of the board
54 of 99

1120 deems necessary and appropriate on matters relating to the authority, and to hold meetings at
1121 other times as the advisory board may determine; (iii) to make recommendations to the authority
1122 on any budget; (iv) to make recommendations to the governor, the general court and the towns
1123 regarding the authority, its programs, and the project; and (v) to determine, from time to time,
1124 compensation for the directors pursuant to section 9.
1125 (e) The authority shall provide such reasonable administrative and staff support to the
1126 advisory board as may be necessary for the efficient discharge of the advisory board's
1127 responsibilities pursuant to this act.
1128 (f) Notwithstanding the provisions of chapter 268A of the General Laws, an interest of an
1129 advisory board member or of a member of the immediate family of an advisory board member
1130 arising solely on account of the member’s or immediate family member’s residing at NAS South
1131 Weymouth shall not be disqualifying and shall not be deemed an impermissible conflict of
1132 interest.
1133 Section 12. The board may from time to time hire employees and engage outside vendors
1134 or consultants, or both, as necessary to achieve the orderly functioning of the authority.
1135 Employees of the authority shall not be subject to the provisions of chapter 30 or section 45, 46,
1136 51 or 52 of chapter 31 of the General Laws. Employees of the authority shall be subject to the

1138 shall be set by the board.
1139 Section 13. The board may hire, fix and pay compensation, prescribe duties and

55 of 99
1141 law or personnel or civil service rule of the commonwealth. The employees of the authority shall
1142 not be classified employees of the commonwealth. An individual employed by the authority shall
1143 be deemed an employee at will and shall serve at the pleasure of the authority.
1144 Section 14. (a) The zoning by-laws shall remain in effect, subject to their modification
1145 pursuant to the procedures set forth in this section. Such zoning by-laws, as they may be
1146 modified in accordance with this section from time to time, shall supersede the zoning by-laws of
1147 the towns with respect to land in the NAS South Weymouth redevelopment area. In recognition
1148 of the significant number of housing units allowed by the zoning by-laws in proximity to MBTA
1149 communities, the zoning by-laws satisfy the requirements of section 3A of chapter 40A of the
1150 General Laws for the project and each of the towns, as applicable, and the project and each of the
1151 towns will be eligible for any funding that would be available if a municipality complies with
1152 said section 3A of said chapter 40A in recognition of the extent of housing that can be provided
1153 in proximity to MBTA communities as a result of the project. “MBTA community” as used
1154 herein shall mean an MBTA community as defined in 760 CMR 72.00, regulations for said
1155 section 3A of said chapter 40A promulgated by the executive office of housing and livable
1156 communities, in consultation with executive office of economic development, the Massachusetts
1157 Bay Transportation Authority and the Massachusetts Department of Transportation, as may be
1158 amended.
1159 (b) Consistent with current and prior planning for NAS South Weymouth, NAS South
1160 Weymouth shall be developed in accordance with the following principles:
1161 (1) notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this act or any other general or
1162 special law or bylaw or regulation of the authority, or in any existing agreement between the
56 of 99
1163 master developer and the authority or any other entity, of the residential units at NAS South
1164 Weymouth, a minimum of 10 per cent shall meet the requirements of “affordable” housing or
1165 “workforce” housing, as such terms are defined in the affordable and workforce housing plan
1166 and the affordable and workforce housing regulations or the new regulations, as applicable.
1167 Affordable or workforce housing constructed within NAS South Weymouth prior to the effective
1168 date of this act shall be counted towards the aggregate 10 per cent minimum requirement;
1169 (2) further development at NAS South Weymouth should be planned and built-out to
1170 incorporate smart growth principles to the extent feasible with a mix of housing and commercial
1171 development, and transportation choices. Whenever feasible, uses at the project should be
1172 designed to be located within walking distance of each other, or even in the same building.
1173 Sustainable and environmentally-friendly development should also be integrated into the project
1174 with water conservation and building designs that comply with generally accepted “green”
1175 design standards. The project should incorporate green building technologies into aspects of its
1176 infrastructure design, construction and operation, and promote the use of green building
1177 technologies by its vertical residential and commercial builders as well;
1178 (3) passive and active recreational facilities shall be included in the further development
1179 of NAS South Weymouth, with such facilities to include but not be limited to the existing
1180 recreation complex, bicycle and walking paths, picnic areas and nature trails; provided, however,
1181 that notwithstanding the generality of the preceding sentence, the master developer shall not be
1182 required to construct or operate a golf course; and
1183 (4) the master developer shall submit to the authority no later than 2 months after the
1184 approval of same by the Natural Heritage and Endangered Species Program an open space
57 of 99
1185 preservation plan, which shall include a plan for addressing all existing runways, taxiways,
1186 traffic control towers and other infrastructure located on any land zoned open space as of the
1187 effective date of this act. In connection with existing and proposed development at NAS South
1188 Weymouth, the project will provide a significant open space area subject to restrictions for the
1189 ongoing protection of habitat and rare species. The following existing restrictions are on record
1190 affecting land within NAS South Weymouth: (i) First Amended and Restated Grant of
1191 Restriction, East End Parcels Restriction, dated October 22, 2013, by LNR South Shore, LLC as
1192 declarant thereunder and (ii) Second Amended and Restated Grant of Restriction, Golf Course
1193 Parcels Restriction, dated February 26, 2014, by LNR South Shore, LLC as declarant thereunder;
1194 items (i) and (ii) collectively referred to herein as the “restrictions”. Notwithstanding any general
1195 or special law to the contrary, any modifications to the restrictions in connection with the
1196 reconfiguration of the proposed protected open space at NAS South Weymouth, including
1197 modifications that release certain land from the restrictions, is allowed and shall not be subject to
1198 any requirement of section 5A of chapter 3 of the General Laws, provided that the
1199 reconfiguration of such open space is consistent with any then-current conservation and
1200 management permit issued by the National Heritage and Endangered Species Program, or its
1201 successor, for the project within NAS South Weymouth redevelopment area.
1202 (c) Major zoning revisions shall not be effective until such revisions are approved by: (i)
1203 the town in which the land that is the subject of such revision is located; and (ii) the board. No
1204 town shall consider a major zoning revision except at the initiative of the applicable town
1205 executive, the master developer, the town’s planning board, the town council in the case of
1206 Weymouth or a person owning land to be affected by the revision. In addition to the
1207 requirements of chapter 40A of the General Laws, upon the filing of any application for major
58 of 99
1208 zoning revision to the town council in Weymouth or town meetings in Abington or Rockland, the
1209 town council or respective town meetings shall give notice of such filing to the authority,
1210 whereupon the authority shall publish a notice of a public hearing in a newspaper or general
1211 circulation within the NAS South Weymouth redevelopment area, and hold at least 1 public
1212 hearing in the NAS South Weymouth redevelopment area or in any 1 of the towns at which the
1213 public shall be afforded the opportunity to comment on the proposed revision. Within 90 days of
1214 receipt of a petition for a proposed major zoning revision, the receiving town shall convene a
1215 meeting of the town council in Weymouth or a town meeting if in Rockland or Abington for the
1216 purpose of adopting the proposed major zoning revision. The towns shall notify the authority of
1217 any major zoning revisions they may adopt, such notice to be provided within 30 days of
1218 obtaining the attorney general’s approval of such revision if required pursuant to section 32 of
1219 chapter 40 of the General Laws. All other provisions of chapter 40A of the General Laws shall
1220 apply, except that the towns may reconsider a proposed major zoning revision pursuant to this
1221 act within 6 months of an unfavorable action notwithstanding anything to the contrary in section
1222 5 of said chapter 40A. Pursuant to 53G of chapter 44 of the General Laws, a town may request,
1223 and the master developer may elect to provide, reimbursement for legal fees incurred by the town
1224 in connection with the passage of this act.
1225 (d) The board shall have the authority to make minor zoning revisions as described in the
1226 zoning by-laws. In addition, the board shall within 90 days of the adoption of this act, make all
1227 revisions, if any, to the zoning by-laws necessary to make the zoning by-laws conform to this
1228 act. The authority shall be responsible for maintaining a codification of the zoning by-law that
1229 reflects all major zoning revisions adopted by the various towns and all minor zoning revisions
1230 adopted by the board, and all revisions to the zoning map made pursuant to subsection (e).
59 of 99
1231 (e) Revisions to the zoning map shall be made in accordance with the terms of the zoning
1232 by-laws.
1233 (f) Revisions to the zoning by-laws pursuant to subsection (d) shall be by majority vote of
1234 the board. Prior to approving any minor zoning revision pursuant to said subsection (d), the
1235 authority shall formally notify the Towns, shall publish a notice of public hearing in newspapers
1236 of general circulation within the NAS South Weymouth redevelopment area, shall hold at least 1
1237 public hearing in the NAS South Weymouth redevelopment area or in any 1 of the towns at
1238 which the proposed revision to the zoning by-laws not considered substantial shall be considered
1239 and voted upon, and shall afford the opportunity for public comment at such public hearing. The
1240 administrative provisions of the zoning by-laws or of any other regulation promulgated by the
1241 authority may provide for expedited permitting under which the time frames for actions,
1242 including a failure to take action, applicable to municipalities and their boards, commissions and
1243 agencies under the provisions of the General Laws may be shortened. Nothing in this section
1244 shall require the authority to be governed by the requirements of chapter 30A of the General
1245 Laws.
1246 (g) The procedures set forth in this section for adopting revisions to the zoning by-laws
1247 shall be exclusive notwithstanding any general or special law to the contrary.
1248 (h) Regulations for the effective implementation and enforcement of the zoning by-laws
1249 and revisions thereof shall be developed and adopted by the authority, pursuant to section 6. No
1250 regulation shall be adopted by the authority without first publishing notice of same in a
1251 newspaper of general circulation within the NAS South Weymouth redevelopment area, holding
1252 at least one public meeting in the NAS South Weymouth redevelopment area or in any one of the
60 of 99
1253 towns, and affording the opportunity for public comment. Nothing in this section shall require
1254 the authority to be governed by the requirements of chapter 30A of the General Laws.
1255 (i)(1) As authorized in subsection (t) of section 6, the authority shall have exclusive
1256 authority to issue and enforce land use, subdivision and zoning permits, approvals, orders of
1257 conditions and other entitlements pursuant to the zoning by-law, regulations promulgated
1258 pursuant to subsection (h), subdivision regulations, and wetland protection laws in effect within
1259 the NAS South Weymouth redevelopment area. Such authority shall include the exclusive
1260 jurisdiction to sit as a permit granting authority pursuant to section 15 of chapter 40A of the
1261 General Laws. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this act or any other
1262 general or special law or bylaw or regulation of the authority, or in any existing agreement
1263 between the master developer or the authority or any other entity, or any combination of the
1264 foregoing parties, for the purposes of all projects at the NAS South Weymouth redevelopment
1265 area for which construction commences after the effective date of this act, there shall be a new
1266 set of regulations developed by the authority governing development, including, without
1267 limitation, regarding affordable and workforce housing, and land use, zoning, subdivision and
1268 wetlands administration, in each case, in place of any existing regulations in place.
1269 Administration of the following municipal powers pursuant to the General Laws that do not
1270 involve the administration by the authority of such land use, subdivision, zoning and wetland
1271 controls and related entitlement activities shall remain with the towns in which the applicable
1272 real property is located unless expressly granted to said authority in this act or elsewhere: (i)
1273 issuance of building permits by the inspectional services department; (ii) public-health and
1274 safety-related matters under the jurisdiction of the local board of health; and (iii) issuance of
1275 liquor licenses. If any building or structure is proposed to be constructed on a lot located within 2
61 of 99
1276 or more towns, the building department or board of health or licensing department, as
1277 appropriate, of the town in which the majority of the gross floor area of the building or structure
1278 is to be located shall have exclusive jurisdiction. Once construction or operation, as appropriate,
1279 has begun pursuant to the applicable permit or license, the town with such jurisdiction shall
1280 retain such jurisdiction, even if subsequent improvements cause the majority of the gross floor
1281 area or operation to be located thereafter in the other town.
1282 (2) The town of Weymouth may issue a maximum of 13 alcoholic beverage licenses
1283 within the portion of the NAS South Weymouth redevelopment area located within Weymouth
1284 in accordance with chapter 138 of the General Laws, the town of Abington may issue a
1285 maximum of 2 alcoholic beverage licenses within the portion of the NAS South Weymouth
1286 redevelopment area located within Abington in accordance with chapter 138 and the town of
1287 Rockland may issue a maximum of 13 alcoholic beverage licenses within the portion of the NAS
1288 South Weymouth redevelopment area located within Rockland in accordance with said chapter
1289 138; provided, however, that said licenses shall not diminish the number of licenses permitted by
1290 the commonwealth to be granted elsewhere within the towns of Weymouth or Rockland. None of
1291 the licenses authorized by this section shall be transferable outside the NAS South Weymouth
1292 redevelopment area. Nothing in this section shall be deemed to limit the ability of the towns to
1293 issue entertainment licenses and temporary alcoholic beverage licenses as it deems necessary and
1294 appropriate for activities occurring within their respective borders.
1295 (j) All decisions and determinations of the authority, whether legislative or adjudicatory
1296 in nature, shall be appealable by persons aggrieved by such decision or determination in
1297 accordance with applicable provisions of the General Laws. Where any applicable General Law
1298 requires notice of any such appeal to be filed with a municipal clerk, such filing shall be made
62 of 99
1299 with the clerk of the authority, and with the clerk of the town or towns in which the land subject
1300 to such decision or determination is located.
1301 (k) Nothing in this act shall be interpreted as modifying or abrogating any permit,
1302 approval or entitlement issued by the commonwealth in relation to the project and pursuant to
1303 any law relating to the protection of human health or the environment.
1304 Section 15. Anything developed within the NAS South Weymouth redevelopment area as
1305 of the effective date of this act shall be governed by the then-existing zoning by-laws and
1306 regulations promulgated by the authority and currently in effect. The board is hereby directed, (i)
1307 within 120 days of the effective date of this act, to revise, re-promulgate, re-issue, re-negotiate
1308 and re-execute, as needed, all regulations promulgated by the authority and currently in effect; or
1309 (ii) prior to commencement of any new development by the master developer at NAS South
1310 Weymouth, to enter into the new regulations or any agreements, including the ENA or DDA, as
1311 mutually determined by the authority and the master developer to be necessary, for the purpose
1312 of governing any development to occur within the NAS South Weymouth redevelopment area
1313 following the effective date of this act. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the
1314 DDA, as renegotiated pursuant to this section shall:
1315 (a) require that the master developer work with the authority and the towns to develop a
1316 plan for procuring, financing, operating and maintaining the existing and permanent water and
1317 wastewater infrastructure for the project. The permanent water and wastewater infrastructure
1318 may include the construction of a wastewater treatment plant and associated groundwater
1319 discharge facilities. Nothing in this section shall prevent the master developer, the authority or
1320 the towns from mutually agreeing to assign or delegate the operation and maintenance of the
63 of 99
1321 existing or permanent water and wastewater infrastructure to qualified parties including, without
1322 limitation, any of the towns; and
1323 (b) not include any provision imposing monetary penalties or forfeitures on the master
1324 developer in the event the master developer elects not to develop a golf course as part of the
1325 project.
1326 Section 16. The executive office for administration and finance and the executive offices
1327 of housing and livable communities, economic development and labor and workforce
1328 development shall identify a senior staff member who shall assist the towns with establishing a
1329 method for coordinating 1-stop licensing for all businesses and developments to be located
1330 within the NAS South Weymouth redevelopment area for the purpose of expediting the process
1331 for obtaining commonwealth licenses, permits, certificates, approvals, registrations, charters and
1332 meeting any other requirements of law.
1333 Section 17. Each public agency in the commonwealth, including, without limitation,
1334 agencies such as the Massachusetts Department of Transportation, the department of
1335 environmental protection and the Massachusetts water resources authority, involved in the
1336 development or financing of economic development projects shall develop a coordinated 1-stop
1337 program for businesses, institutions and private parties that may intend to locate in the NAS
1338 South Weymouth redevelopment area in order to enable development activities within the NAS
1339 South Weymouth redevelopment area to be more effectively promoted by the commonwealth.
1340 Further, to promote efficient redevelopment, any construction within or modifications to the
1341 layout of the parkway located within NAS South Weymouth in connection with the project shall
1342 solely require the approval of the authority.
64 of 99
1343 Section 18. (a) The authority may fix, revise, charge, collect, levy and abate betterments,
1344 assessments, special assessments and fees, and other charges for the cost, administration and
1345 operation of the infrastructure improvements. In providing for the payment of the cost of the
1346 infrastructure improvements or for the use of the infrastructure improvements, the authority may
1347 avail itself of the General Laws relative to the assessment, apportionment, division, fixing,
1348 reassessment, revision, abatement and collection of infrastructure charges, including betterments,
1349 assessments, special assessments and fees by municipalities, or the establishment of liens
1350 therefor and interest thereon, and the procedures set forth in sections 5 and 6 of chapter 254 of
1351 the General Laws for the foreclosure of liens, as it shall deem necessary and appropriate for
1352 purposes of the assessment and collection of such infrastructure improvement charges.
1353 Notwithstanding any general or special law to the contrary, the authority may pay the entire cost
1354 of any infrastructure improvements, including the acquisition thereof, during construction or
1355 after completion, or the debt service of notes or bonds used to fund such costs, from betterments,
1356 assessments, special assessments, fees, or other charges, and may establish the betterments,
1357 assessments, special assessments, fees or other charges, prior to, during, or a reasonable time
1358 following the completion of the construction of such infrastructure improvements. The authority
1359 may establish a schedule for the payment of betterments, assessments, special assessments, fees
1360 or other charges, not to exceed 40 years. The authority may determine the circumstances under
1361 which the betterments, assessments, special assessments, fees and other charges, may be
1362 increased, if at all, as a consequence of delinquency or default by the owner of that parcel or any
1363 other parcel within the NAS South Weymouth redevelopment area.
1364 (b) The betterments, assessments, special assessments, fees and other charges of general
1365 application authorized by this act may be increased in accordance with the procedures to be
65 of 99
1366 established by the authority for assuring that interested persons are afforded notice and an
1367 opportunity to present data, views and arguments. The initial schedule of assessments, special
1368 assessments, fees and other charges, may be adopted by the authority at any scheduled meeting
1369 of the board, provided that notice of the meeting, and the proposed schedule, is sent to each
1370 owner of a parcel within the NAS South Weymouth redevelopment area, by registered or
1371 certified mail at least 7 days prior to the meeting. Thereafter, the authority shall hold at least 1
1372 public hearing on a revision to its schedule of betterments, assessments, special assessments, fees
1373 and other charges thereof prior to adoption by the authority, notice of which revisions shall be
1374 delivered to the towns and shall be published in a newspaper of general circulation in each of the
1375 towns at least 1 month in advance of the hearing. No later than the date of such publications, the
1376 authority shall make available to the public and deliver to the towns the proposed revisions to the
1377 schedule of special assessments, fees, betterments, assessments and other charges. The
1378 betterments, assessments, special assessments, fees and other charges established by the
1379 authority shall not be subject to supervision or regulation by any department, division,
1380 commission, board, bureau or agency of the commonwealth or its political subdivisions,
1381 including without limitation, the towns, except for the approval of the taxation plan and any
1382 amendments thereof requiring approval by the secretary and commissioner of revenue.
1383 (c) The betterments, assessments, special assessments, fees and other charges established
1384 by the authority in accordance with this act shall be fixed and adjusted in respect of the aggregate
1385 thereof so as to provide revenues sufficient: (i) to pay the principal of, premium, if any, and
1386 interest on bonds, notes or other evidences of indebtedness issued by the authority under this act
1387 as the same become due and payable; (ii) to create and maintain such reasonable reserves as may
1388 be reasonably required by a trust agreement or resolution securing bonds or notes; (iii) to provide
66 of 99
1389 funds for paying the cost of necessary repairs, replacements and renewals of infrastructure
1390 improvements; and (iv) to pay or provide for an amount that the authority may be obligated to
1391 pay or provide for by law or contract, including a resolution or contract with or for the benefit of
1392 the holders of its bonds and notes, provided that the authority shall not be required to increase
1393 any mandatory betterments, assessments, special assessments, fees or other charges by virtue of
1394 any individual proprietor delinquencies. Nothing herein shall be deemed to impose a limitation
1395 on the authority’s ability to establish, set, or impose betterments, assessments, special
1396 assessments, fees or charges at levels sufficient to meet any covenant requirements that may be
1397 contained in any resolution or contract with or for the benefit of the holders of its bonds or notes,
1398 or otherwise providing security for the same.
1399 (d) As an alternative to levying betterments, assessments, special assessments, fees and
1400 other charges under this act or the General Laws, the authority may levy special assessments on
1401 real estate within the NAS South Weymouth redevelopment area to finance the cost,
1402 administration and operation of the infrastructure improvements. In determining the basis for and
1403 amount of the special assessment, the cost, administration, maintenance and operation of the
1404 infrastructure improvements, including the cost of the repayment of the debt issued or to be
1405 issued by the authority to finance the improvements, may be calculated and levied using any of
1406 the following methods that result in fairly allocating the costs of the infrastructure improvements
1407 to the real estate in the NAS South Weymouth redevelopment area: (1) equally per length of
1408 frontage, or by lot, parcel or dwelling unit, or by the square footage of a lot, parcel or dwelling
1409 unit; (2) according to the value of the property; or (3) in any other reasonable manner that results
1410 in fairly allocating the cost, administration and operation of the infrastructure improvements,
67 of 99
1411 according to the benefit conferred or use received including, but not limited to, by classification
1412 of commercial or residential use or distance from the infrastructure improvements.
1413 (e) The authority may also provide for the following: (1) a maximum amount to be
1414 assessed with respect to any parcel; (2) a tax year or other date after which no further special
1415 assessments under this section shall be levied or collected on a parcel; (3) annual collection of
1416 the levy without subsequent approval of the authority; (4) the circumstances under which the
1417 special assessment levied against a parcel may be increased, if at all, as a consequence of
1418 delinquency or default by the owner of that parcel or any other parcel within the NAS South
1419 Weymouth redevelopment area; and (5) procedures allowing for the prepayment of betterments,
1420 assessments, special assessments, fees and other charges under this act.
1421 (f) Betterments, assessments, special assessments, fees and other charges levied under
1422 this act shall be collected and secured in the same manner as property taxes, betterments,
1423 assessments and fees owed to the towns unless otherwise provided by the authority and shall be
1424 subject to the same penalties and the same procedure, sale and lien priority in case of
1425 delinquency as is provided for such property taxes, betterments and liens owed to the towns.
1426 (g) The appellate tax board shall have jurisdiction within the NAS South Weymouth
1427 redevelopment area pursuant to chapter 58A of the General Laws to the same extent as its
1428 jurisdiction in cities and towns. The authority shall have exclusive responsibility for paying any
1429 reimbursement payments owed under section 69 of chapter 59 of the General Laws, or otherwise,
1430 as a result of the abatement, by such board or another body of competent jurisdiction, of any
1431 property tax assessments made by the authority prior to the complete transition of the assessing
1432 and taxing power to the towns pursuant to subsection (a) of section 19.
68 of 99
1433 Section 19. (a) Notwithstanding any general or special law to the contrary, property taxes
1434 upon personal property, persons, residents and estates lying within the NAS South Weymouth
1435 redevelopment area, shall, commencing as of January 1, 2015, for the fiscal year commencing
1436 July 1, 2015, be imposed, levied and administered by each town for its respective portion of
1437 NAS South Weymouth, consistent with the General Laws that are applicable to municipalities.
1438 The towns shall collect upon the estates, real and personal, within NAS South Weymouth a
1439 property tax rate equal to the base rate plus the Southfield rate. In connection with the foregoing,
1440 the towns shall have all the powers and authority of cities and towns under chapters 40, 59, 60,
1441 60A, 61B and section 3A of chapter 64G of the General Laws including, with respect to unpaid
1442 taxes due and owing as a result of prior assessments by the South Shore Tri-Town Development
1443 Corporation, the exclusive power to exercise enforcement and collection rights pursuant to said
1444 chapter 60 of the General Laws and other relevant law, and may accept a local option under a
1445 general or special law related to the assessment, exemption or enforcement of property taxes and
1446 excises that cities and towns may accept. A property tax bill issued by a town pursuant to this
1447 subsection prior to the town’s first opportunity to issue assessments pursuant to section 21 of
1448 said chapter 59 shall be based on the assessed value established by the town in its most recent
1449 assessment of the property in question or such other assessed value as may have been determined
1450 for such property through abatement proceedings. The board shall notify each town of the
1451 Southfield rate to be charged in the next following fiscal year no later than June 1 of each year,
1452 and of the amount of pledged revenue to be remitted to the authority in the next following fiscal
1453 year, as provided below. The Southfield rate shall not be set for any given fiscal year until at
1454 least 45 days after the board provides each executive with written notice of and an opportunity to
1455 comment on the proposed rate and the Authority operating budget on which it is based. During
69 of 99
1456 such 45-day period, the executives in Rockland and Abington, and the town council in
1457 Weymouth to which the rate-setting notice shall be referred by the mayor of Weymouth may
1458 convene a public hearing for the purpose of obtaining public comment on the proposed
1459 Southfield rate. No later than 30 days after collection of property taxes for each fiscal quarter,
1460 each town shall remit to the authority the Southfield revenue collected by such town in the
1461 preceding fiscal quarter. Each town shall also remit to the authority, pledged revenue within 30
1462 days of billing from the authority. Nothing in this act shall be deemed to limit a town’s ability, in
1463 respect of any given fiscal year or other period, to remit property tax revenue in excess of
1464 Southfield revenue to the authority. Southfield revenue shall not be deemed to constitute any part
1465 of “total taxes assessed” by the towns for the purposes of administering section 21C of chapter
1466 59 of the General Laws. Land and improvements located within each town’s respective portion
1467 of NAS South Weymouth shall, in the fiscal year commencing July 1, 2015, be deemed for all
1468 purposes to be additional new growth within that town within the meaning of paragraph (f) of
1469 section 21C of said chapter 59 and section 23D of said chapter 59.
1470 (b) In consideration of the collection and retention of base revenue pursuant to
1471 subsection(a), each town shall be responsible for providing police and fire protection, emergency
1472 services, schools, maintenance of all public ways or ways maintained and used as public ways,
1473 public works, inspectional and other municipal services, including waste collection, to its
1474 respective portion of NAS South Weymouth except for portions owned or controlled by agencies
1475 of the United States government on the same basis and terms as it provides such services to other
1476 parts of the town and as required by applicable law. Notwithstanding the generality of the
1477 preceding sentence, no town shall be required to provide water or sewer services to any portion
1478 of NAS South Weymouth except pursuant to agreement with the authority or the master
70 of 99
1479 developer. For purposes of determining state education assistance, including without limitation
1480 the calculation of each town’s foundation enrollment under chapter 70 of the General Laws, each
1481 school-age child living within NAS South Weymouth shall be counted as a child enrolled in the
1482 town in which the child resides, and all expenses incurred by each respective town on behalf of
1483 such children’s education shall be included as expenses of the town incurring such costs in the
1484 determination of each respective town’s share of such assistance, including without limitation
1485 each town’s foundation budget under said chapter 70.
1486 (c) The authority and the master developer, as the case may be, at its election, shall take
1487 all actions necessary to transfer to the applicable town control of all existing public ways, or
1488 ways maintained and used as public ways, located within NAS South Weymouth, together with
1489 associated infrastructure including public utilities and sewer and storm drain lines located within
1490 or adjacent to the rights of way of such ways, and each town shall, without regard to the
1491 requirements of chapter 82 of the General Laws or other general or special laws, accept the
1492 applicable portion of such way or ways as a public way in said town. The authority and the
1493 master developer, as the case may be, at its election, shall take all actions necessary to transfer to
1494 the applicable town control of, and each town shall accept as a public way, any new public way
1495 and associated infrastructure developed, constructed or acquired by the authority or the master
1496 developer, as the case may be, within NAS South Weymouth following the effective date of this
1497 act provided the board has approved the layout and construction of such way is consistent with
1498 the authority’s subdivision regulations, and provided further that the customary street acceptance
1499 procedures of the town in which the way is to be accepted as a public way are substantially
1500 satisfied and such town agrees that the way has been constructed in accordance with the
1501 authority’s subdivision regulations. Notwithstanding any general or special law to the contrary:
71 of 99
1502 (i) public ways or portions thereof located within NAS South Weymouth and for which a town
1503 accepts pursuant to this subsection shall be included in the apportionment for such town of state
1504 assistance to cities and towns under chapter 90 of the General Laws or under any other statute or
1505 program providing financial assistance to cities and towns of the commonwealth in connection
1506 with transportation matters; (ii) any other attributes of a town located within NAS South
1507 Weymouth including without limitation population and employment shall likewise be included
1508 for purposes of such apportionment; and (iii) improvement, maintenance, repair or other projects
1509 related to said public ways shall be eligible for such assistance.
1510 (d) Any existing agreements or obligations owed between the towns or the authority or
1511 the prior master developer, or any combination of the foregoing parties, as applicable, related to
1512 the development within the NAS South Weymouth redevelopment area shall be rescinded and
1513 shall have no further force and effect as of January 1, 2020, unless affirmatively assumed by the
1514 authority or the master developer in writing, whether in a new agreement or an amendment or
1515 restatement of such existing agreements or obligation.
1516 (e) Following the termination of the authority in accordance with section 33, each town
1517 shall have the authority to assess, impose, levy and collect property taxes on properties located
1518 within its respective portion of the NAS South Weymouth redevelopment area on the same basis
1519 as such town administers its property tax collection system elsewhere within the town.
1520 (f) Taxes within NAS South Weymouth are currently levied and assessed consistent with
1521 the taxation plan dated October 13, 2014 that was approved by the secretary and the
1522 commissioner of revenue, which taxation plan may be revised from time to time. The taxation
1523 plan details the specific powers and duties of the authority and the towns; provide for the timely
72 of 99
1524 transfer of assessment and collection records from the authority to the towns; detail the oversight
1525 to be provided by the commissioner of revenue regarding the base rate and Southfield rate,
1526 including required reports and other information; and address such other pertinent matters as
1527 determined by the secretary and the commissioner of revenue.
1528 Section 20. (a) The authority may provide by resolution of the board for the issuance of
1529 bonds and notes of the authority for the purposes of paying or refinancing all or any part of the
1530 cost of the project and its infrastructure improvements. Such cost shall include the cost of: (1)
1531 construction, reconstruction, renovation and acquisition of all lands, structures, real or personal
1532 property, rights, rights-of-way, franchises, easements and interests acquired or to be acquired by
1533 the authority, the towns, the commonwealth or any other political subdivision thereof, including
1534 the costs of any infrastructure and improvements to be transferred to the towns in accordance
1535 with subsection (c) of section 19; (2) all machinery and equipment including machinery and
1536 equipment needed to expand or enhance services from the towns, the commonwealth or a
1537 political subdivision thereof to the authority; (3) financing charges and interest prior to and
1538 during construction, and for a period not exceeding 1 year after completion of the construction,
1539 interest and reserves for principal and interest, including costs of municipal bond insurance and
1540 any other type of financial guaranty and costs of issuance; (4) extensions, enlargements,
1541 additions and enhancements to infrastructure improvements; (5) architectural, engineering,
1542 financial and legal services; (6) plans, specifications, studies, surveys and estimates of costs and
1543 of revenues; (7) administrative expenses necessary or incident to the construction, acquisition,
1544 financing, operation and maintenance of the project; and (8) other expenses as may be necessary
1545 or incident to the construction, acquisition, operation, maintenance and financing of the
1546 infrastructure improvements, including the cost of issuing bonds or notes. The authority may
73 of 99
1547 issue up to $175,000,000 of its bonds. The authority may issue bonds secured in whole or in part
1548 by betterments, assessments, special assessments, fees and other charges, notes, debentures, long
1549 term capital leases, grants and governmental assistance and long-term contracts; provided that,
1550 for so long as the 2020A bonds are outstanding, the authority may not secure any bonds or notes
1551 issued after the effective date of this section with a pledge or other commitment of ad valorem
1552 property taxes assessed by the authority or the towns pursuant to said section 19 with respect to
1553 any of the assessable property under the Trust Indenture. The principal of and interest on such
1554 bonds shall be payable solely from the funds which are identified by the authority and are
1555 permitted by this act to provide for such payment. The bonds of each issue shall be dated, shall
1556 bear interest at such rates, which may be variable or fixed, and shall mature at times not
1557 exceeding 35 years from their dates of initial issuance, as the authority may determine, and may
1558 be made redeemable before maturity, at the option of the authority, at such prices and under such
1559 terms and conditions as the authority may fix prior to the issuance of the bonds. The authority
1560 shall determine the form of the bonds and the manner of execution of the bonds, and shall fix the
1561 denominations of the bonds and the places of payment of principal and interest, which may be at
1562 a bank or trust company within or without the commonwealth and such other locations as
1563 designated by the authority. In the event an officer whose signature or a facsimile of whose
1564 signature shall appear on any bonds shall cease to be an officer before the delivery of the bonds,
1565 the signature or facsimile shall nevertheless be valid and sufficient for all purposes as if such
1566 officer had remained in office until the delivery. The bonds shall be issued in registered form.
1567 The authority may sell the bonds in a manner and for a price, either at public or private sale, as it
1568 may determine to be for the best interests of the authority.
74 of 99
1569 (b) Prior to the preparation of definitive bonds, the authority may, under like restrictions,
1570 issue interim receipts or temporary notes, with or without coupons, exchangeable for definitive
1571 bonds when such bonds have been executed and are available for delivery. The authority may
1572 also provide for the replacement of bonds that shall become mutilated or shall be destroyed or
1573 lost. The authority may issue, from time to time, notes of the authority in anticipation of federal,
1574 state or local grants for the cost of the project and acquiring, constructing or improving the
1575 infrastructure improvements. The notes shall be authorized, issued and sold in the same manner
1576 as provided in, and shall otherwise be subject to, this act. Such notes shall mature at such times
1577 as provided by the issuing resolution of the authority and may be renewed from time to time;
1578 provided, however, that all such notes and renewals thereof shall mature on or before 20 years
1579 from their date of issuance. Bonds and notes may be issued under this act subject only to those
1580 proceedings, conditions or things that are specifically required by this act.
1581 (c) The authority may provide by resolution for issuance of refunding bonds of the
1582 authority for the purpose of refunding bonds then outstanding at maturity or upon acceleration or
1583 redemption. Refunding bonds may be issued at such times prior to the maturity or redemption of
1584 the refunded bonds as the authority deems to be in the public interest. Refunding bonds may be
1585 issued in sufficient amounts to pay or provide for the principal of the bonds being refunded under
1586 this act, and the payment of a redemption premium thereon and interest accrued or to accrue to
1587 the date of redemption of such bonds, and, if deemed advisable by the authority, for the
1588 additional purpose of paying any cost of the project, including the acquisition, constructing or
1589 reconstructing of the infrastructure improvements. The issuance of such bonds, the maturities
1590 and other details thereof, the rights of the holders thereof, and the duties of the authority in
1591 respect to the same shall be governed by this act insofar as the same may be applicable.
75 of 99
1592 (d) While bonds issued by the authority remain outstanding, the powers, duties or
1593 existence of the authority shall not be diminished or impaired in any way that will adversely
1594 affect the interests and rights of the holders of such bonds.
1595 (e) The board may by resolution delegate to a person, other than a majority of the board,
1596 the power to determine any of the matters set forth in this section.
1597 (f) Bonds and notes issued under this section, unless otherwise authorized by law, shall
1598 not be deemed to constitute a debt of the commonwealth or of the towns, or a pledge of the faith
1599 and credit of the commonwealth or of the towns, but such bonds shall be payable solely from the
1600 funds of the authority or as otherwise provided in this act. Unless the towns or the
1601 commonwealth subsequently agree to pay the bonds or notes of the authority, such bonds and
1602 notes shall contain on their faces a statement to the effect that neither the commonwealth nor the
1603 towns shall be obliged to pay the same or the interest thereon and that neither the faith and credit
1604 nor taxing power of the commonwealth or the towns is pledged to the payment of the principal of
1605 or the interest on such bonds or notes. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, nothing
1606 in this act shall be construed as imposing on any town any obligation with respect to the
1607 repayment of the series 2020A bonds and any debt issued by the authority pursuant to this act.
1608 (g) All bonds or notes issued under this act shall have all the qualities and incidents of
1609 negotiable instruments as defined in section 3-104 of chapter 106 of the General Laws.
1610 (h) Prior to the issuance of bonds with a maturity date later than the date the authority is
1611 required to be terminated pursuant to section 33, the mayor of the town of Weymouth and boards
1612 of selectmen of the towns of Abington and Rockland, in consultation with the authority, shall
1613 enter into an intermunicipal debt service agreement acceptable to the authority, which shall
76 of 99
1614 provide for the continued payment of principal and interest on such bonds and the maintenance
1615 of all required reserves and any other obligations as may be set forth in the applicable bond
1616 instruments from betterments, assessments, special assessments, fees, other charges and other
1617 revenues generated in the NAS South Weymouth redevelopment area and the authority and the
1618 towns may enter into and perform their respective obligations under such debt service
1619 agreement; provided, however, that such agreement shall not extend the duration of the authority
1620 past the date on which it is to be terminated pursuant to section 33.
1621 Section 21. (a) In the discretion of the authority, bonds, refunding bonds or notes may be
1622 secured by a trust agreement by and between the authority and a corporate trustee, which may be
1623 a trust company or bank having the powers of a trust company within or without the
1624 commonwealth. Such trust agreement may pledge or assign the revenues to be received, but shall
1625 not convey or mortgage the project or a part thereof.
1626 (b) Either the resolution providing for the issuance of bonds or notes or the trust
1627 agreement may contain provisions for protecting and enforcing the rights and remedies of the
1628 bondholders as may be reasonable and proper and not in violation of law, including, without
1629 limiting the generality of the foregoing, provisions defining defaults and providing for remedies
1630 in the event thereof, which may include the acceleration of maturities and covenants setting forth
1631 the duties of, and limitations on, the authority in relation to the acquisition, maintenance,
1632 operation, insurance and disposition of property, custody, safeguarding, investment, application
1633 of moneys, use of any surplus bond or note proceeds and establishment of reserves. Such
1634 resolution or trust agreement may contain, but shall not be limited to, covenants by the authority
1635 in relation to the following: (i) the establishment, revision and collection of such betterments,
1636 assessments, special assessments, fees and other charges for services or facilities furnished or
77 of 99
1637 supplied by the authority as shall provide revenues which together with other revenues of the
1638 project, if any, are sufficient to pay: (1) the cost of maintaining, repairing and operating the
1639 project and of making renewals and replacements in connection therewith, (2) the principal of
1640 and the interest on the bonds or notes, as the same shall become due and payable, (3) payments
1641 in lieu of taxes, betterments, assessments, special assessments, fees and other charges and (4)
1642 reserves for all such purposes; (ii) the purposes for which the proceeds of the sale of the bonds or
1643 notes shall be applied and the use and disposition thereof; (iii) the use and disposition of the
1644 gross revenues of the authority from the project, additions thereto and extension and the
1645 infrastructure improvements thereof, including the creation and maintenance of funds for
1646 working capital and for renewals and replacements to the project; (iv) the amount, if any, of
1647 additional bonds or notes payable from the revenues of the project and the limitations, terms and
1648 conditions on which such additional bonds or notes may be issued; and (v) the operation,
1649 maintenance, management, accounting and auditing of the project and of the income and
1650 revenues of the authority.
1651 (c) It shall be lawful for a bank or trust company within or without the commonwealth to
1652 act as depository of the proceeds of bonds or revenues and to furnish such indemnifying bonds or
1653 to pledge such securities as may be required by the authority. Such trust agreement may set forth
1654 the rights and remedies of the bondholders and of the trustee and may restrict the individual right
1655 of action by bondholders as is customary in trust agreements or trust indentures securing bonds
1656 and debentures of authorities. Such trust agreement may contain other provisions as the authority
1657 may deem reasonable and proper for the security of the bondholders. All expenses incurred in
1658 carrying out the provisions of such trust agreement may be treated as a part of the cost of the
1659 operation of the project. The pledge by any such trust agreement or resolution shall be valid and
78 of 99
1660 binding from the time when the pledge is made. The revenues or other moneys so pledged and
1661 then held or thereafter received by the authority shall immediately be subject to the lien of such
1662 pledge without a physical delivery thereof or further act. The lien of any such pledge shall be
1663 valid and binding as against all parties having claims of any kind in tort, contract or otherwise
1664 against the authority, irrespective of whether such parties have notice thereof. The financing
1665 document by which any pledge is created by the authority shall not be required to be filed or
1666 recorded to perfect such pledge except in the official records of the authority and no uniform
1667 commercial code filing shall be required to be made. A pledge or assignment made by the
1668 authority is an exercise of its political and governmental powers, and revenues, funds, assets,
1669 property and contract or other rights to receive the same and the proceeds thereof which are
1670 subject to the lien of a pledge or assignment created under this act shall not be applied to
1671 purposes not permitted by the pledge or assignment.
1672 (d) In addition to other security provided herein or otherwise by law, bonds, notes or
1673 obligations issued by the authority under this act may be secured, in whole or in part, by a letter
1674 of credit, line of credit, bond insurance policy, liquidity facility or other credit facility for the
1675 purpose of providing funds for payments in respect of bonds, notes or other obligations required
1676 by the holder thereof to be redeemed or repurchased prior to maturity or for providing additional
1677 security for such bonds, notes or other obligations. In connection therewith, the authority may
1678 enter into reimbursement agreements, remarketing agreements, standby bond purchase
1679 agreements and any other necessary or appropriate agreements. The authority may pledge or
1680 assign the authority’s revenues as security for the reimbursement by the authority to the
1681 providers of such letters of credit, lines of credit, bond insurance policies, liquidity facilities or
79 of 99
1682 other credit facilities of any payments made under the letters of credit, lines of credit, bond
1683 insurance policies, liquidity facilities or other credit facilities.
1684 (e) In connection with, or incidental to, the issuance of bonds, notes or other obligations,
1685 the authority may enter into such contracts as it may determine to be necessary or appropriate to
1686 place the bonds, notes or other obligations of the authority, as represented by the bonds or notes,
1687 or other obligations in whole or in part, on such interest rate or cash flow basis as the authority
1688 may determine, including without limitation, interest rate swap agreements, insurance
1689 agreements, forward payment conversion agreements, futures contracts, contracts providing for
1690 payments based on levels of, or changes in, interest rates or market indices, contracts to manage
1691 interest rate risk, including without limitation, interest rate floors or caps, options, puts, calls and
1692 similar arrangements. Such contracts shall contain such payment, security, default, remedy and
1693 other terms and conditions as the authority may deem appropriate and shall be entered into with
1694 such parties as the authority may select, after giving due consideration, where applicable, for the
1695 creditworthiness of the counter parties, including a rating by a nationally-recognized rating
1696 agency, the impact on a rating on outstanding bonds, notes or other obligations or other criteria
1697 the authority may deem appropriate.
1698 (f) The authority shall have the power to purchase its bonds or notes out of any funds
1699 available therefor. The authority may hold, pledge, cancel or resell such bonds or notes, subject
1700 to and in accordance with agreements with bondholders.

_______________
An Act making appropriations for the fiscal year 2025 to provide for supplementing certain

of the same, as follows:
1 SECTION 1. To provide for supplementing certain items in the general appropriation act
2 and other appropriation acts for fiscal year 2025, the sums set forth in section 2 are hereby
3 appropriated from the General Fund or the Transitional Escrow Fund established in section 16 of
4 chapter 76 of the acts of 2021, as amended by section 4 of chapter 98 of the acts of 2022, unless
5 specifically designated otherwise in this act or in those appropriation acts, for the several
6 purposes and subject to the conditions specified in this act or in those appropriation acts, and
7 subject to the laws regulating the disbursement of public funds for the fiscal year ending June 30,
8 2025. These sums shall be in addition to any amounts previously appropriated and made

570 Section 1. It is hereby found that the closure of the Naval Air Station hereinafter referred

572 detrimental to the economic welfare of the citizens of the commonwealth and, in particular, the
573 towns of Abington and Rockland and the city known as the town of Weymouth. The closure of
574 this military installation imposes upon the commonwealth and its citizens an increased fiscal
575 burden in addition to that incurred by the commonwealth on account of the closure of various
576 other military installations in the commonwealth. It is further found that the full redevelopment
577 of NAS South Weymouth remains essential for the benefit of the towns of Abington, Rockland
578 and Weymouth, the region and the commonwealth and, to that end, chapter 291 of the acts of
579 2014 reconstituted the South Shore Tri-Town Development Corporation, or SSTDC, as the
29 of 99

580 Southfield Redevelopment Authority, and this act shall reinforce applicable control over land use
581 and development decisions affecting Abington, Rockland and Weymouth that constitute NAS
582 South Weymouth and strengthen the alignment of interests between the authority, the towns and
583 the master developer as defined herein. Therefore, it is the purpose of this act to promote the
584 expeditious and orderly conversion and redevelopment of NAS South Weymouth for nonmilitary
585 purposes including, but not limited to, commercial, housing, industrial, institutional, educational,
586 governmental, recreational, conservation or manufacturing uses in order to prevent blight,
587 economic dislocation and additional unemployment and to aid and strengthen the local economy,
588 the regional economy and the economy of the commonwealth. In order to achieve these
589 objectives, it is deemed necessary and appropriate to continue the structure of SSTDC, as
590 renamed and reconstituted pursuant to chapter 291 of the acts of 2014, with full powers and
591 authority to carry out this act.
592 Section 2. It shall be the goal of this act to promote the expeditious acquisition and
593 redevelopment of NAS South Weymouth while addressing the economic, social and
594 environmental needs of the region. Except as otherwise provided in this act, this goal shall be
595 accomplished in a manner consistent with the zoning by-laws. The redevelopment is designed to
596 minimize and mitigate negative off-base impacts on the area such as those on water resources, air
597 quality, traffic and noise, and to limit the impacts to those necessary to achieve community reuse
598 goals and objectives. The redevelopment shall be integrated with the United States government's
599 cleanup of hazardous materials on the base to ensure effective, expeditious and efficient
600 environmental remediation and protection of public health and welfare in accordance with
601 federal and state law and regulation.
30 of 99

602 Section 3. There was created by chapter 291 of the acts of 2014 a body politic and
603 corporate, to be known as the Southfield Redevelopment Authority, to carry out this act. The
604 authority is deemed to be a public instrumentality and the exercise by the authority of the powers
605 conferred by this act shall be deemed and held to be the performance of public functions. The
606 authority shall be included within the definition of a “local government unit or local
607 governmental unit”, as defined in section 1 of chapter 29C of the General Laws, and its bonds
608 and notes shall be included within the definition of “local governmental obligations”, as defined
609 in said section 1 of said chapter 29C. The authority shall be included within the definition of a
610 “governmental entity” for purposes of owning public infrastructure improvements pursuant to
611 chapter 293 of the acts of 2006. The authority shall be an “eligible applicant” and a municipality
612 for the purposes of the General Laws and the authority, the town of Rockland, the town of
613 Weymouth and the town of Abington shall be eligible for any financial or other assistance from
614 the Massachusetts School Building Authority and the Massachusetts Department of
615 Transportation pursuant to chapter 90 of the General Laws.
616 To achieve its primary purpose of securing the redevelopment of NAS South Weymouth
617 for the benefit of the towns of Abington, Rockland and Weymouth, the authority shall be guided
618 in its financing activities with the goal of generating fiscal benefit to the towns stemming from
619 the redevelopment. The authority, during its existence, and the master developer, giving
620 consideration to its economic interests, shall pursue the redevelopment of the underutilized land
621 within NAS South Weymouth in a manner that, in the aggregate, generates revenue for the towns
622 that exceeds the costs that the towns incur for the provision of those municipal services that the
623 towns are obligated to provide to NAS South Weymouth pursuant to this act. The authority shall,
624 to the maximum extent feasible and consistent with the zoning by-laws, dispose of all of the

1078 Notwithstanding the foregoing, or the provisions of chapter 268A of the General Laws,
1079 an interest of a resident appointee or of a member of the immediate family of a resident
1080 appointee arising solely on account of the appointee’s or immediate family member’s residing at

1107 vice chairperson and a secretary and such other officers as the advisory board may determine.
1108 Each such officer shall serve in such capacity at the pleasure of the advisory board and may be
1109 removed from such position by majority vote of the advisory board. In the event of a vacancy,
1110 the appointing authority shall fill the vacancy for the unexpired term. Each member of the
1111 advisory board shall serve without compensation but may be reimbursed for all reasonable
1112 expenses incurred in the performance of his or her duties as approved by the advisory board and
1113 the authority.
1114 (d) The purposes of the advisory board shall be as follows: (i) to review the annual report
1115 of the authority and to prepare comments thereon for the benefit of the authority, the governor
1116 and the towns, and to make such examinations of the reports on the authority's records and

1129 advisory board member or of a member of the immediate family of an advisory board member
1130 arising solely on account of the member’s or immediate family member’s residing at NAS South
1131 Weymouth shall not be disqualifying and shall not be deemed an impermissible conflict of
1132 interest.
1133 Section 12. The board may from time to time hire employees and engage outside vendors
1134 or consultants, or both, as necessary to achieve the orderly functioning of the authority.
1135 Employees of the authority shall not be subject to the provisions of chapter 30 or section 45, 46,

1144 Section 14. (a) The zoning by-laws shall remain in effect, subject to their modification
1145 pursuant to the procedures set forth in this section. Such zoning by-laws, as they may be
1146 modified in accordance with this section from time to time, shall supersede the zoning by-laws of
1147 the towns with respect to land in the NAS South Weymouth redevelopment area. In recognition
1148 of the significant number of housing units allowed by the zoning by-laws in proximity to MBTA
1149 communities, the zoning by-laws satisfy the requirements of section 3A of chapter 40A of the
1150 General Laws for the project and each of the towns, as applicable, and the project and each of the
1151 towns will be eligible for any funding that would be available if a municipality complies with
1152 said section 3A of said chapter 40A in recognition of the extent of housing that can be provided
1153 in proximity to MBTA communities as a result of the project. “MBTA community” as used
1154 herein shall mean an MBTA community as defined in 760 CMR 72.00, regulations for said
1155 section 3A of said chapter 40A promulgated by the executive office of housing and livable
1156 communities, in consultation with executive office of economic development, the Massachusetts
1157 Bay Transportation Authority and the Massachusetts Department of Transportation, as may be
1158 amended.
1159 (b) Consistent with current and prior planning for NAS South Weymouth, NAS South
1160 Weymouth shall be developed in accordance with the following principles:
1161 (1) notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this act or any other general or
1162 special law or bylaw or regulation of the authority, or in any existing agreement between the
56 of 99

1163 master developer and the authority or any other entity, of the residential units at NAS South
1164 Weymouth, a minimum of 10 per cent shall meet the requirements of “affordable” housing or
1165 “workforce” housing, as such terms are defined in the affordable and workforce housing plan
1166 and the affordable and workforce housing regulations or the new regulations, as applicable.
1167 Affordable or workforce housing constructed within NAS South Weymouth prior to the effective
1168 date of this act shall be counted towards the aggregate 10 per cent minimum requirement;
1169 (2) further development at NAS South Weymouth should be planned and built-out to
1170 incorporate smart growth principles to the extent feasible with a mix of housing and commercial
1171 development, and transportation choices. Whenever feasible, uses at the project should be
1172 designed to be located within walking distance of each other, or even in the same building.
1173 Sustainable and environmentally-friendly development should also be integrated into the project
1174 with water conservation and building designs that comply with generally accepted “green”
1175 design standards. The project should incorporate green building technologies into aspects of its
1176 infrastructure design, construction and operation, and promote the use of green building
1177 technologies by its vertical residential and commercial builders as well;
1178 (3) passive and active recreational facilities shall be included in the further development
1179 of NAS South Weymouth, with such facilities to include but not be limited to the existing
1180 recreation complex, bicycle and walking paths, picnic areas and nature trails; provided, however,
1181 that notwithstanding the generality of the preceding sentence, the master developer shall not be
1182 required to construct or operate a golf course; and
1183 (4) the master developer shall submit to the authority no later than 2 months after the
1184 approval of same by the Natural Heritage and Endangered Species Program an open space
57 of 99

1185 preservation plan, which shall include a plan for addressing all existing runways, taxiways,
1186 traffic control towers and other infrastructure located on any land zoned open space as of the
1187 effective date of this act. In connection with existing and proposed development at NAS South
1188 Weymouth, the project will provide a significant open space area subject to restrictions for the
1189 ongoing protection of habitat and rare species. The following existing restrictions are on record
1190 affecting land within NAS South Weymouth: (i) First Amended and Restated Grant of
1191 Restriction, East End Parcels Restriction, dated October 22, 2013, by LNR South Shore, LLC as
1192 declarant thereunder and (ii) Second Amended and Restated Grant of Restriction, Golf Course
1193 Parcels Restriction, dated February 26, 2014, by LNR South Shore, LLC as declarant thereunder;
1194 items (i) and (ii) collectively referred to herein as the “restrictions”. Notwithstanding any general
1195 or special law to the contrary, any modifications to the restrictions in connection with the
1196 reconfiguration of the proposed protected open space at NAS South Weymouth, including
1197 modifications that release certain land from the restrictions, is allowed and shall not be subject to
1198 any requirement of section 5A of chapter 3 of the General Laws, provided that the
1199 reconfiguration of such open space is consistent with any then-current conservation and
1200 management permit issued by the National Heritage and Endangered Species Program, or its
1201 successor, for the project within NAS South Weymouth redevelopment area.
1202 (c) Major zoning revisions shall not be effective until such revisions are approved by: (i)
1203 the town in which the land that is the subject of such revision is located; and (ii) the board. No
1204 town shall consider a major zoning revision except at the initiative of the applicable town
1205 executive, the master developer, the town’s planning board, the town council in the case of
1206 Weymouth or a person owning land to be affected by the revision. In addition to the
1207 requirements of chapter 40A of the General Laws, upon the filing of any application for major
58 of 99

1208 zoning revision to the town council in Weymouth or town meetings in Abington or Rockland, the
1209 town council or respective town meetings shall give notice of such filing to the authority,
1210 whereupon the authority shall publish a notice of a public hearing in a newspaper or general
1211 circulation within the NAS South Weymouth redevelopment area, and hold at least 1 public
1212 hearing in the NAS South Weymouth redevelopment area or in any 1 of the towns at which the
1213 public shall be afforded the opportunity to comment on the proposed revision. Within 90 days of
1214 receipt of a petition for a proposed major zoning revision, the receiving town shall convene a
1215 meeting of the town council in Weymouth or a town meeting if in Rockland or Abington for the
1216 purpose of adopting the proposed major zoning revision. The towns shall notify the authority of
1217 any major zoning revisions they may adopt, such notice to be provided within 30 days of
1218 obtaining the attorney general’s approval of such revision if required pursuant to section 32 of
1219 chapter 40 of the General Laws. All other provisions of chapter 40A of the General Laws shall
1220 apply, except that the towns may reconsider a proposed major zoning revision pursuant to this
1221 act within 6 months of an unfavorable action notwithstanding anything to the contrary in section
1222 5 of said chapter 40A. Pursuant to 53G of chapter 44 of the General Laws, a town may request,
1223 and the master developer may elect to provide, reimbursement for legal fees incurred by the town
1224 in connection with the passage of this act.
1225 (d) The board shall have the authority to make minor zoning revisions as described in the
1226 zoning by-laws. In addition, the board shall within 90 days of the adoption of this act, make all
1227 revisions, if any, to the zoning by-laws necessary to make the zoning by-laws conform to this
1228 act. The authority shall be responsible for maintaining a codification of the zoning by-law that
1229 reflects all major zoning revisions adopted by the various towns and all minor zoning revisions
1230 adopted by the board, and all revisions to the zoning map made pursuant to subsection (e).
59 of 99

1231 (e) Revisions to the zoning map shall be made in accordance with the terms of the zoning
1232 by-laws.
1233 (f) Revisions to the zoning by-laws pursuant to subsection (d) shall be by majority vote of
1234 the board. Prior to approving any minor zoning revision pursuant to said subsection (d), the
1235 authority shall formally notify the Towns, shall publish a notice of public hearing in newspapers
1236 of general circulation within the NAS South Weymouth redevelopment area, shall hold at least 1
1237 public hearing in the NAS South Weymouth redevelopment area or in any 1 of the towns at
1238 which the proposed revision to the zoning by-laws not considered substantial shall be considered
1239 and voted upon, and shall afford the opportunity for public comment at such public hearing. The
1240 administrative provisions of the zoning by-laws or of any other regulation promulgated by the
1241 authority may provide for expedited permitting under which the time frames for actions,
1242 including a failure to take action, applicable to municipalities and their boards, commissions and
1243 agencies under the provisions of the General Laws may be shortened. Nothing in this section
1244 shall require the authority to be governed by the requirements of chapter 30A of the General
1245 Laws.
1246 (g) The procedures set forth in this section for adopting revisions to the zoning by-laws
1247 shall be exclusive notwithstanding any general or special law to the contrary.
1248 (h) Regulations for the effective implementation and enforcement of the zoning by-laws
1249 and revisions thereof shall be developed and adopted by the authority, pursuant to section 6. No
1250 regulation shall be adopted by the authority without first publishing notice of same in a
1251 newspaper of general circulation within the NAS South Weymouth redevelopment area, holding
1252 at least one public meeting in the NAS South Weymouth redevelopment area or in any one of the
60 of 99

1253 towns, and affording the opportunity for public comment. Nothing in this section shall require
1254 the authority to be governed by the requirements of chapter 30A of the General Laws.
1255 (i)(1) As authorized in subsection (t) of section 6, the authority shall have exclusive
1256 authority to issue and enforce land use, subdivision and zoning permits, approvals, orders of
1257 conditions and other entitlements pursuant to the zoning by-law, regulations promulgated
1258 pursuant to subsection (h), subdivision regulations, and wetland protection laws in effect within
1259 the NAS South Weymouth redevelopment area. Such authority shall include the exclusive
1260 jurisdiction to sit as a permit granting authority pursuant to section 15 of chapter 40A of the
1261 General Laws. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this act or any other
1262 general or special law or bylaw or regulation of the authority, or in any existing agreement
1263 between the master developer or the authority or any other entity, or any combination of the
1264 foregoing parties, for the purposes of all projects at the NAS South Weymouth redevelopment
1265 area for which construction commences after the effective date of this act, there shall be a new
1266 set of regulations developed by the authority governing development, including, without
1267 limitation, regarding affordable and workforce housing, and land use, zoning, subdivision and
1268 wetlands administration, in each case, in place of any existing regulations in place.
1269 Administration of the following municipal powers pursuant to the General Laws that do not
1270 involve the administration by the authority of such land use, subdivision, zoning and wetland
1271 controls and related entitlement activities shall remain with the towns in which the applicable
1272 real property is located unless expressly granted to said authority in this act or elsewhere: (i)
1273 issuance of building permits by the inspectional services department; (ii) public-health and
1274 safety-related matters under the jurisdiction of the local board of health; and (iii) issuance of
1275 liquor licenses. If any building or structure is proposed to be constructed on a lot located within 2
61 of 99

1276 or more towns, the building department or board of health or licensing department, as
1277 appropriate, of the town in which the majority of the gross floor area of the building or structure
1278 is to be located shall have exclusive jurisdiction. Once construction or operation, as appropriate,
1279 has begun pursuant to the applicable permit or license, the town with such jurisdiction shall
1280 retain such jurisdiction, even if subsequent improvements cause the majority of the gross floor
1281 area or operation to be located thereafter in the other town.
1282 (2) The town of Weymouth may issue a maximum of 13 alcoholic beverage licenses
1283 within the portion of the NAS South Weymouth redevelopment area located within Weymouth
1284 in accordance with chapter 138 of the General Laws, the town of Abington may issue a
1285 maximum of 2 alcoholic beverage licenses within the portion of the NAS South Weymouth
1286 redevelopment area located within Abington in accordance with chapter 138 and the town of
1287 Rockland may issue a maximum of 13 alcoholic beverage licenses within the portion of the NAS
1288 South Weymouth redevelopment area located within Rockland in accordance with said chapter
1289 138; provided, however, that said licenses shall not diminish the number of licenses permitted by
1290 the commonwealth to be granted elsewhere within the towns of Weymouth or Rockland. None of
1291 the licenses authorized by this section shall be transferable outside the NAS South Weymouth
1292 redevelopment area. Nothing in this section shall be deemed to limit the ability of the towns to
1293 issue entertainment licenses and temporary alcoholic beverage licenses as it deems necessary and
1294 appropriate for activities occurring within their respective borders.
1295 (j) All decisions and determinations of the authority, whether legislative or adjudicatory
1296 in nature, shall be appealable by persons aggrieved by such decision or determination in
1297 accordance with applicable provisions of the General Laws. Where any applicable General Law
1298 requires notice of any such appeal to be filed with a municipal clerk, such filing shall be made
62 of 99

1299 with the clerk of the authority, and with the clerk of the town or towns in which the land subject
1300 to such decision or determination is located.
1301 (k) Nothing in this act shall be interpreted as modifying or abrogating any permit,
1302 approval or entitlement issued by the commonwealth in relation to the project and pursuant to
1303 any law relating to the protection of human health or the environment.
1304 Section 15. Anything developed within the NAS South Weymouth redevelopment area as
1305 of the effective date of this act shall be governed by the then-existing zoning by-laws and
1306 regulations promulgated by the authority and currently in effect. The board is hereby directed, (i)
1307 within 120 days of the effective date of this act, to revise, re-promulgate, re-issue, re-negotiate
1308 and re-execute, as needed, all regulations promulgated by the authority and currently in effect; or
1309 (ii) prior to commencement of any new development by the master developer at NAS South
1310 Weymouth, to enter into the new regulations or any agreements, including the ENA or DDA, as
1311 mutually determined by the authority and the master developer to be necessary, for the purpose
1312 of governing any development to occur within the NAS South Weymouth redevelopment area
1313 following the effective date of this act. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the
1314 DDA, as renegotiated pursuant to this section shall:
1315 (a) require that the master developer work with the authority and the towns to develop a
1316 plan for procuring, financing, operating and maintaining the existing and permanent water and
1317 wastewater infrastructure for the project. The permanent water and wastewater infrastructure
1318 may include the construction of a wastewater treatment plant and associated groundwater
1319 discharge facilities. Nothing in this section shall prevent the master developer, the authority or
1320 the towns from mutually agreeing to assign or delegate the operation and maintenance of the
63 of 99

1321 existing or permanent water and wastewater infrastructure to qualified parties including, without
1322 limitation, any of the towns; and
1323 (b) not include any provision imposing monetary penalties or forfeitures on the master
1324 developer in the event the master developer elects not to develop a golf course as part of the
1325 project.
1326 Section 16. The executive office for administration and finance and the executive offices
1327 of housing and livable communities, economic development and labor and workforce
1328 development shall identify a senior staff member who shall assist the towns with establishing a
1329 method for coordinating 1-stop licensing for all businesses and developments to be located
1330 within the NAS South Weymouth redevelopment area for the purpose of expediting the process
1331 for obtaining commonwealth licenses, permits, certificates, approvals, registrations, charters and
1332 meeting any other requirements of law.
1333 Section 17. Each public agency in the commonwealth, including, without limitation,
1334 agencies such as the Massachusetts Department of Transportation, the department of
1335 environmental protection and the Massachusetts water resources authority, involved in the
1336 development or financing of economic development projects shall develop a coordinated 1-stop
1337 program for businesses, institutions and private parties that may intend to locate in the NAS
1338 South Weymouth redevelopment area in order to enable development activities within the NAS
1339 South Weymouth redevelopment area to be more effectively promoted by the commonwealth.
1340 Further, to promote efficient redevelopment, any construction within or modifications to the
1341 layout of the parkway located within NAS South Weymouth in connection with the project shall
1342 solely require the approval of the authority.
64 of 99

1343 Section 18. (a) The authority may fix, revise, charge, collect, levy and abate betterments,
1344 assessments, special assessments and fees, and other charges for the cost, administration and
1345 operation of the infrastructure improvements. In providing for the payment of the cost of the
1346 infrastructure improvements or for the use of the infrastructure improvements, the authority may
1347 avail itself of the General Laws relative to the assessment, apportionment, division, fixing,
1348 reassessment, revision, abatement and collection of infrastructure charges, including betterments,
1349 assessments, special assessments and fees by municipalities, or the establishment of liens
1350 therefor and interest thereon, and the procedures set forth in sections 5 and 6 of chapter 254 of
1351 the General Laws for the foreclosure of liens, as it shall deem necessary and appropriate for
1352 purposes of the assessment and collection of such infrastructure improvement charges.
1353 Notwithstanding any general or special law to the contrary, the authority may pay the entire cost
1354 of any infrastructure improvements, including the acquisition thereof, during construction or
1355 after completion, or the debt service of notes or bonds used to fund such costs, from betterments,
1356 assessments, special assessments, fees, or other charges, and may establish the betterments,
1357 assessments, special assessments, fees or other charges, prior to, during, or a reasonable time
1358 following the completion of the construction of such infrastructure improvements. The authority
1359 may establish a schedule for the payment of betterments, assessments, special assessments, fees
1360 or other charges, not to exceed 40 years. The authority may determine the circumstances under
1361 which the betterments, assessments, special assessments, fees and other charges, may be
1362 increased, if at all, as a consequence of delinquency or default by the owner of that parcel or any
1363 other parcel within the NAS South Weymouth redevelopment area.
1364 (b) The betterments, assessments, special assessments, fees and other charges of general
1365 application authorized by this act may be increased in accordance with the procedures to be
65 of 99

1366 established by the authority for assuring that interested persons are afforded notice and an
1367 opportunity to present data, views and arguments. The initial schedule of assessments, special
1368 assessments, fees and other charges, may be adopted by the authority at any scheduled meeting
1369 of the board, provided that notice of the meeting, and the proposed schedule, is sent to each
1370 owner of a parcel within the NAS South Weymouth redevelopment area, by registered or
1371 certified mail at least 7 days prior to the meeting. Thereafter, the authority shall hold at least 1
1372 public hearing on a revision to its schedule of betterments, assessments, special assessments, fees
1373 and other charges thereof prior to adoption by the authority, notice of which revisions shall be
1374 delivered to the towns and shall be published in a newspaper of general circulation in each of the
1375 towns at least 1 month in advance of the hearing. No later than the date of such publications, the
1376 authority shall make available to the public and deliver to the towns the proposed revisions to the
1377 schedule of special assessments, fees, betterments, assessments and other charges. The
1378 betterments, assessments, special assessments, fees and other charges established by the
1379 authority shall not be subject to supervision or regulation by any department, division,
1380 commission, board, bureau or agency of the commonwealth or its political subdivisions,
1381 including without limitation, the towns, except for the approval of the taxation plan and any
1382 amendments thereof requiring approval by the secretary and commissioner of revenue.
1383 (c) The betterments, assessments, special assessments, fees and other charges established
1384 by the authority in accordance with this act shall be fixed and adjusted in respect of the aggregate
1385 thereof so as to provide revenues sufficient: (i) to pay the principal of, premium, if any, and
1386 interest on bonds, notes or other evidences of indebtedness issued by the authority under this act
1387 as the same become due and payable; (ii) to create and maintain such reasonable reserves as may
1388 be reasonably required by a trust agreement or resolution securing bonds or notes; (iii) to provide
66 of 99

1389 funds for paying the cost of necessary repairs, replacements and renewals of infrastructure
1390 improvements; and (iv) to pay or provide for an amount that the authority may be obligated to
1391 pay or provide for by law or contract, including a resolution or contract with or for the benefit of
1392 the holders of its bonds and notes, provided that the authority shall not be required to increase
1393 any mandatory betterments, assessments, special assessments, fees or other charges by virtue of
1394 any individual proprietor delinquencies. Nothing herein shall be deemed to impose a limitation
1395 on the authority’s ability to establish, set, or impose betterments, assessments, special
1396 assessments, fees or charges at levels sufficient to meet any covenant requirements that may be
1397 contained in any resolution or contract with or for the benefit of the holders of its bonds or notes,
1398 or otherwise providing security for the same.
1399 (d) As an alternative to levying betterments, assessments, special assessments, fees and
1400 other charges under this act or the General Laws, the authority may levy special assessments on
1401 real estate within the NAS South Weymouth redevelopment area to finance the cost,
1402 administration and operation of the infrastructure improvements. In determining the basis for and
1403 amount of the special assessment, the cost, administration, maintenance and operation of the
1404 infrastructure improvements, including the cost of the repayment of the debt issued or to be
1405 issued by the authority to finance the improvements, may be calculated and levied using any of
1406 the following methods that result in fairly allocating the costs of the infrastructure improvements
1407 to the real estate in the NAS South Weymouth redevelopment area: (1) equally per length of
1408 frontage, or by lot, parcel or dwelling unit, or by the square footage of a lot, parcel or dwelling
1409 unit; (2) according to the value of the property; or (3) in any other reasonable manner that results
1410 in fairly allocating the cost, administration and operation of the infrastructure improvements,
67 of 99

1411 according to the benefit conferred or use received including, but not limited to, by classification
1412 of commercial or residential use or distance from the infrastructure improvements.
1413 (e) The authority may also provide for the following: (1) a maximum amount to be
1414 assessed with respect to any parcel; (2) a tax year or other date after which no further special
1415 assessments under this section shall be levied or collected on a parcel; (3) annual collection of
1416 the levy without subsequent approval of the authority; (4) the circumstances under which the
1417 special assessment levied against a parcel may be increased, if at all, as a consequence of
1418 delinquency or default by the owner of that parcel or any other parcel within the NAS South
1419 Weymouth redevelopment area; and (5) procedures allowing for the prepayment of betterments,
1420 assessments, special assessments, fees and other charges under this act.
1421 (f) Betterments, assessments, special assessments, fees and other charges levied under
1422 this act shall be collected and secured in the same manner as property taxes, betterments,
1423 assessments and fees owed to the towns unless otherwise provided by the authority and shall be
1424 subject to the same penalties and the same procedure, sale and lien priority in case of
1425 delinquency as is provided for such property taxes, betterments and liens owed to the towns.
1426 (g) The appellate tax board shall have jurisdiction within the NAS South Weymouth
1427 redevelopment area pursuant to chapter 58A of the General Laws to the same extent as its
1428 jurisdiction in cities and towns. The authority shall have exclusive responsibility for paying any
1429 reimbursement payments owed under section 69 of chapter 59 of the General Laws, or otherwise,
1430 as a result of the abatement, by such board or another body of competent jurisdiction, of any
1431 property tax assessments made by the authority prior to the complete transition of the assessing
1432 and taxing power to the towns pursuant to subsection (a) of section 19.
68 of 99

1433 Section 19. (a) Notwithstanding any general or special law to the contrary, property taxes
1434 upon personal property, persons, residents and estates lying within the NAS South Weymouth
1435 redevelopment area, shall, commencing as of January 1, 2015, for the fiscal year commencing
1436 July 1, 2015, be imposed, levied and administered by each town for its respective portion of
1437 NAS South Weymouth, consistent with the General Laws that are applicable to municipalities.
1438 The towns shall collect upon the estates, real and personal, within NAS South Weymouth a
1439 property tax rate equal to the base rate plus the Southfield rate. In connection with the foregoing,
1440 the towns shall have all the powers and authority of cities and towns under chapters 40, 59, 60,
1441 60A, 61B and section 3A of chapter 64G of the General Laws including, with respect to unpaid
1442 taxes due and owing as a result of prior assessments by the South Shore Tri-Town Development
1443 Corporation, the exclusive power to exercise enforcement and collection rights pursuant to said
1444 chapter 60 of the General Laws and other relevant law, and may accept a local option under a
1445 general or special law related to the assessment, exemption or enforcement of property taxes and
1446 excises that cities and towns may accept. A property tax bill issued by a town pursuant to this
1447 subsection prior to the town’s first opportunity to issue assessments pursuant to section 21 of
1448 said chapter 59 shall be based on the assessed value established by the town in its most recent
1449 assessment of the property in question or such other assessed value as may have been determined
1450 for such property through abatement proceedings. The board shall notify each town of the
1451 Southfield rate to be charged in the next following fiscal year no later than June 1 of each year,
1452 and of the amount of pledged revenue to be remitted to the authority in the next following fiscal
1453 year, as provided below. The Southfield rate shall not be set for any given fiscal year until at
1454 least 45 days after the board provides each executive with written notice of and an opportunity to
1455 comment on the proposed rate and the Authority operating budget on which it is based. During
69 of 99

1456 such 45-day period, the executives in Rockland and Abington, and the town council in
1457 Weymouth to which the rate-setting notice shall be referred by the mayor of Weymouth may
1458 convene a public hearing for the purpose of obtaining public comment on the proposed
1459 Southfield rate. No later than 30 days after collection of property taxes for each fiscal quarter,
1460 each town shall remit to the authority the Southfield revenue collected by such town in the
1461 preceding fiscal quarter. Each town shall also remit to the authority, pledged revenue within 30
1462 days of billing from the authority. Nothing in this act shall be deemed to limit a town’s ability, in
1463 respect of any given fiscal year or other period, to remit property tax revenue in excess of
1464 Southfield revenue to the authority. Southfield revenue shall not be deemed to constitute any part
1465 of “total taxes assessed” by the towns for the purposes of administering section 21C of chapter
1466 59 of the General Laws. Land and improvements located within each town’s respective portion
1467 of NAS South Weymouth shall, in the fiscal year commencing July 1, 2015, be deemed for all
1468 purposes to be additional new growth within that town within the meaning of paragraph (f) of
1469 section 21C of said chapter 59 and section 23D of said chapter 59.
1470 (b) In consideration of the collection and retention of base revenue pursuant to
1471 subsection(a), each town shall be responsible for providing police and fire protection, emergency
1472 services, schools, maintenance of all public ways or ways maintained and used as public ways,
1473 public works, inspectional and other municipal services, including waste collection, to its
1474 respective portion of NAS South Weymouth except for portions owned or controlled by agencies
1475 of the United States government on the same basis and terms as it provides such services to other
1476 parts of the town and as required by applicable law. Notwithstanding the generality of the
1477 preceding sentence, no town shall be required to provide water or sewer services to any portion
1478 of NAS South Weymouth except pursuant to agreement with the authority or the master
70 of 99

1479 developer. For purposes of determining state education assistance, including without limitation
1480 the calculation of each town’s foundation enrollment under chapter 70 of the General Laws, each
1481 school-age child living within NAS South Weymouth shall be counted as a child enrolled in the
1482 town in which the child resides, and all expenses incurred by each respective town on behalf of
1483 such children’s education shall be included as expenses of the town incurring such costs in the
1484 determination of each respective town’s share of such assistance, including without limitation
1485 each town’s foundation budget under said chapter 70.
1486 (c) The authority and the master developer, as the case may be, at its election, shall take
1487 all actions necessary to transfer to the applicable town control of all existing public ways, or
1488 ways maintained and used as public ways, located within NAS South Weymouth, together with
1489 associated infrastructure including public utilities and sewer and storm drain lines located within
1490 or adjacent to the rights of way of such ways, and each town shall, without regard to the
1491 requirements of chapter 82 of the General Laws or other general or special laws, accept the
1492 applicable portion of such way or ways as a public way in said town. The authority and the
1493 master developer, as the case may be, at its election, shall take all actions necessary to transfer to
1494 the applicable town control of, and each town shall accept as a public way, any new public way
1495 and associated infrastructure developed, constructed or acquired by the authority or the master
1496 developer, as the case may be, within NAS South Weymouth following the effective date of this
1497 act provided the board has approved the layout and construction of such way is consistent with
1498 the authority’s subdivision regulations, and provided further that the customary street acceptance
1499 procedures of the town in which the way is to be accepted as a public way are substantially
1500 satisfied and such town agrees that the way has been constructed in accordance with the
1501 authority’s subdivision regulations. Notwithstanding any general or special law to the contrary:
71 of 99

1502 (i) public ways or portions thereof located within NAS South Weymouth and for which a town
1503 accepts pursuant to this subsection shall be included in the apportionment for such town of state
1504 assistance to cities and towns under chapter 90 of the General Laws or under any other statute or
1505 program providing financial assistance to cities and towns of the commonwealth in connection
1506 with transportation matters; (ii) any other attributes of a town located within NAS South
1507 Weymouth including without limitation population and employment shall likewise be included
1508 for purposes of such apportionment; and (iii) improvement, maintenance, repair or other projects
1509 related to said public ways shall be eligible for such assistance.
1510 (d) Any existing agreements or obligations owed between the towns or the authority or
1511 the prior master developer, or any combination of the foregoing parties, as applicable, related to
1512 the development within the NAS South Weymouth redevelopment area shall be rescinded and
1513 shall have no further force and effect as of January 1, 2020, unless affirmatively assumed by the
1514 authority or the master developer in writing, whether in a new agreement or an amendment or
1515 restatement of such existing agreements or obligation.
1516 (e) Following the termination of the authority in accordance with section 33, each town
1517 shall have the authority to assess, impose, levy and collect property taxes on properties located
1518 within its respective portion of the NAS South Weymouth redevelopment area on the same basis
1519 as such town administers its property tax collection system elsewhere within the town.
1520 (f) Taxes within NAS South Weymouth are currently levied and assessed consistent with
1521 the taxation plan dated October 13, 2014 that was approved by the secretary and the
1522 commissioner of revenue, which taxation plan may be revised from time to time. The taxation
1523 plan details the specific powers and duties of the authority and the towns; provide for the timely
72 of 99

1524 transfer of assessment and collection records from the authority to the towns; detail the oversight
1525 to be provided by the commissioner of revenue regarding the base rate and Southfield rate,
1526 including required reports and other information; and address such other pertinent matters as
1527 determined by the secretary and the commissioner of revenue.
1528 Section 20. (a) The authority may provide by resolution of the board for the issuance of
1529 bonds and notes of the authority for the purposes of paying or refinancing all or any part of the
1530 cost of the project and its infrastructure improvements. Such cost shall include the cost of: (1)
1531 construction, reconstruction, renovation and acquisition of all lands, structures, real or personal
1532 property, rights, rights-of-way, franchises, easements and interests acquired or to be acquired by
1533 the authority, the towns, the commonwealth or any other political subdivision thereof, including
1534 the costs of any infrastructure and improvements to be transferred to the towns in accordance
1535 with subsection (c) of section 19; (2) all machinery and equipment including machinery and
1536 equipment needed to expand or enhance services from the towns, the commonwealth or a
1537 political subdivision thereof to the authority; (3) financing charges and interest prior to and
1538 during construction, and for a period not exceeding 1 year after completion of the construction,
1539 interest and reserves for principal and interest, including costs of municipal bond insurance and
1540 any other type of financial guaranty and costs of issuance; (4) extensions, enlargements,
1541 additions and enhancements to infrastructure improvements; (5) architectural, engineering,
1542 financial and legal services; (6) plans, specifications, studies, surveys and estimates of costs and
1543 of revenues; (7) administrative expenses necessary or incident to the construction, acquisition,
1544 financing, operation and maintenance of the project; and (8) other expenses as may be necessary
1545 or incident to the construction, acquisition, operation, maintenance and financing of the
1546 infrastructure improvements, including the cost of issuing bonds or notes. The authority may
73 of 99

1547 issue up to $175,000,000 of its bonds. The authority may issue bonds secured in whole or in part
1548 by betterments, assessments, special assessments, fees and other charges, notes, debentures, long
1549 term capital leases, grants and governmental assistance and long-term contracts; provided that,
1550 for so long as the 2020A bonds are outstanding, the authority may not secure any bonds or notes
1551 issued after the effective date of this section with a pledge or other commitment of ad valorem
1552 property taxes assessed by the authority or the towns pursuant to said section 19 with respect to
1553 any of the assessable property under the Trust Indenture. The principal of and interest on such
1554 bonds shall be payable solely from the funds which are identified by the authority and are
1555 permitted by this act to provide for such payment. The bonds of each issue shall be dated, shall
1556 bear interest at such rates, which may be variable or fixed, and shall mature at times not
1557 exceeding 35 years from their dates of initial issuance, as the authority may determine, and may
1558 be made redeemable before maturity, at the option of the authority, at such prices and under such
1559 terms and conditions as the authority may fix prior to the issuance of the bonds. The authority
1560 shall determine the form of the bonds and the manner of execution of the bonds, and shall fix the
1561 denominations of the bonds and the places of payment of principal and interest, which may be at
1562 a bank or trust company within or without the commonwealth and such other locations as
1563 designated by the authority. In the event an officer whose signature or a facsimile of whose
1564 signature shall appear on any bonds shall cease to be an officer before the delivery of the bonds,
1565 the signature or facsimile shall nevertheless be valid and sufficient for all purposes as if such
1566 officer had remained in office until the delivery. The bonds shall be issued in registered form.
1567 The authority may sell the bonds in a manner and for a price, either at public or private sale, as it
1568 may determine to be for the best interests of the authority.
74 of 99

1569 (b) Prior to the preparation of definitive bonds, the authority may, under like restrictions,
1570 issue interim receipts or temporary notes, with or without coupons, exchangeable for definitive
1571 bonds when such bonds have been executed and are available for delivery. The authority may
1572 also provide for the replacement of bonds that shall become mutilated or shall be destroyed or
1573 lost. The authority may issue, from time to time, notes of the authority in anticipation of federal,
1574 state or local grants for the cost of the project and acquiring, constructing or improving the
1575 infrastructure improvements. The notes shall be authorized, issued and sold in the same manner
1576 as provided in, and shall otherwise be subject to, this act. Such notes shall mature at such times
1577 as provided by the issuing resolution of the authority and may be renewed from time to time;
1578 provided, however, that all such notes and renewals thereof shall mature on or before 20 years
1579 from their date of issuance. Bonds and notes may be issued under this act subject only to those
1580 proceedings, conditions or things that are specifically required by this act.
1581 (c) The authority may provide by resolution for issuance of refunding bonds of the
1582 authority for the purpose of refunding bonds then outstanding at maturity or upon acceleration or
1583 redemption. Refunding bonds may be issued at such times prior to the maturity or redemption of
1584 the refunded bonds as the authority deems to be in the public interest. Refunding bonds may be
1585 issued in sufficient amounts to pay or provide for the principal of the bonds being refunded under
1586 this act, and the payment of a redemption premium thereon and interest accrued or to accrue to
1587 the date of redemption of such bonds, and, if deemed advisable by the authority, for the
1588 additional purpose of paying any cost of the project, including the acquisition, constructing or
1589 reconstructing of the infrastructure improvements. The issuance of such bonds, the maturities
1590 and other details thereof, the rights of the holders thereof, and the duties of the authority in
1591 respect to the same shall be governed by this act insofar as the same may be applicable.
75 of 99

1592 (d) While bonds issued by the authority remain outstanding, the powers, duties or
1593 existence of the authority shall not be diminished or impaired in any way that will adversely
1594 affect the interests and rights of the holders of such bonds.
1595 (e) The board may by resolution delegate to a person, other than a majority of the board,
1596 the power to determine any of the matters set forth in this section.
1597 (f) Bonds and notes issued under this section, unless otherwise authorized by law, shall
1598 not be deemed to constitute a debt of the commonwealth or of the towns, or a pledge of the faith
1599 and credit of the commonwealth or of the towns, but such bonds shall be payable solely from the
1600 funds of the authority or as otherwise provided in this act. Unless the towns or the
1601 commonwealth subsequently agree to pay the bonds or notes of the authority, such bonds and
1602 notes shall contain on their faces a statement to the effect that neither the commonwealth nor the
1603 towns shall be obliged to pay the same or the interest thereon and that neither the faith and credit
1604 nor taxing power of the commonwealth or the towns is pledged to the payment of the principal of
1605 or the interest on such bonds or notes. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, nothing
1606 in this act shall be construed as imposing on any town any obligation with respect to the
1607 repayment of the series 2020A bonds and any debt issued by the authority pursuant to this act.
1608 (g) All bonds or notes issued under this act shall have all the qualities and incidents of
1609 negotiable instruments as defined in section 3-104 of chapter 106 of the General Laws.
1610 (h) Prior to the issuance of bonds with a maturity date later than the date the authority is
1611 required to be terminated pursuant to section 33, the mayor of the town of Weymouth and boards
1612 of selectmen of the towns of Abington and Rockland, in consultation with the authority, shall
1613 enter into an intermunicipal debt service agreement acceptable to the authority, which shall
76 of 99

1614 provide for the continued payment of principal and interest on such bonds and the maintenance
1615 of all required reserves and any other obligations as may be set forth in the applicable bond
1616 instruments from betterments, assessments, special assessments, fees, other charges and other
1617 revenues generated in the NAS South Weymouth redevelopment area and the authority and the
1618 towns may enter into and perform their respective obligations under such debt service
1619 agreement; provided, however, that such agreement shall not extend the duration of the authority
1620 past the date on which it is to be terminated pursuant to section 33.
1621 Section 21. (a) In the discretion of the authority, bonds, refunding bonds or notes may be
1622 secured by a trust agreement by and between the authority and a corporate trustee, which may be
1623 a trust company or bank having the powers of a trust company within or without the
1624 commonwealth. Such trust agreement may pledge or assign the revenues to be received, but shall
1625 not convey or mortgage the project or a part thereof.
1626 (b) Either the resolution providing for the issuance of bonds or notes or the trust
1627 agreement may contain provisions for protecting and enforcing the rights and remedies of the
1628 bondholders as may be reasonable and proper and not in violation of law, including, without
1629 limiting the generality of the foregoing, provisions defining defaults and providing for remedies
1630 in the event thereof, which may include the acceleration of maturities and covenants setting forth
1631 the duties of, and limitations on, the authority in relation to the acquisition, maintenance,
1632 operation, insurance and disposition of property, custody, safeguarding, investment, application
1633 of moneys, use of any surplus bond or note proceeds and establishment of reserves. Such
1634 resolution or trust agreement may contain, but shall not be limited to, covenants by the authority
1635 in relation to the following: (i) the establishment, revision and collection of such betterments,
1636 assessments, special assessments, fees and other charges for services or facilities furnished or
77 of 99

1637 supplied by the authority as shall provide revenues which together with other revenues of the
1638 project, if any, are sufficient to pay: (1) the cost of maintaining, repairing and operating the
1639 project and of making renewals and replacements in connection therewith, (2) the principal of
1640 and the interest on the bonds or notes, as the same shall become due and payable, (3) payments
1641 in lieu of taxes, betterments, assessments, special assessments, fees and other charges and (4)
1642 reserves for all such purposes; (ii) the purposes for which the proceeds of the sale of the bonds or
1643 notes shall be applied and the use and disposition thereof; (iii) the use and disposition of the
1644 gross revenues of the authority from the project, additions thereto and extension and the
1645 infrastructure improvements thereof, including the creation and maintenance of funds for
1646 working capital and for renewals and replacements to the project; (iv) the amount, if any, of
1647 additional bonds or notes payable from the revenues of the project and the limitations, terms and
1648 conditions on which such additional bonds or notes may be issued; and (v) the operation,
1649 maintenance, management, accounting and auditing of the project and of the income and
1650 revenues of the authority.
1651 (c) It shall be lawful for a bank or trust company within or without the commonwealth to
1652 act as depository of the proceeds of bonds or revenues and to furnish such indemnifying bonds or
1653 to pledge such securities as may be required by the authority. Such trust agreement may set forth
1654 the rights and remedies of the bondholders and of the trustee and may restrict the individual right
1655 of action by bondholders as is customary in trust agreements or trust indentures securing bonds
1656 and debentures of authorities. Such trust agreement may contain other provisions as the authority
1657 may deem reasonable and proper for the security of the bondholders. All expenses incurred in
1658 carrying out the provisions of such trust agreement may be treated as a part of the cost of the
1659 operation of the project. The pledge by any such trust agreement or resolution shall be valid and
78 of 99

1660 binding from the time when the pledge is made. The revenues or other moneys so pledged and
1661 then held or thereafter received by the authority shall immediately be subject to the lien of such
1662 pledge without a physical delivery thereof or further act. The lien of any such pledge shall be
1663 valid and binding as against all parties having claims of any kind in tort, contract or otherwise
1664 against the authority, irrespective of whether such parties have notice thereof. The financing
1665 document by which any pledge is created by the authority shall not be required to be filed or
1666 recorded to perfect such pledge except in the official records of the authority and no uniform
1667 commercial code filing shall be required to be made. A pledge or assignment made by the
1668 authority is an exercise of its political and governmental powers, and revenues, funds, assets,
1669 property and contract or other rights to receive the same and the proceeds thereof which are
1670 subject to the lien of a pledge or assignment created under this act shall not be applied to
1671 purposes not permitted by the pledge or assignment.
1672 (d) In addition to other security provided herein or otherwise by law, bonds, notes or
1673 obligations issued by the authority under this act may be secured, in whole or in part, by a letter
1674 of credit, line of credit, bond insurance policy, liquidity facility or other credit facility for the
1675 purpose of providing funds for payments in respect of bonds, notes or other obligations required
1676 by the holder thereof to be redeemed or repurchased prior to maturity or for providing additional
1677 security for such bonds, notes or other obligations. In connection therewith, the authority may
1678 enter into reimbursement agreements, remarketing agreements, standby bond purchase
1679 agreements and any other necessary or appropriate agreements. The authority may pledge or
1680 assign the authority’s revenues as security for the reimbursement by the authority to the
1681 providers of such letters of credit, lines of credit, bond insurance policies, liquidity facilities or
79 of 99

1682 other credit facilities of any payments made under the letters of credit, lines of credit, bond
1683 insurance policies, liquidity facilities or other credit facilities.
1684 (e) In connection with, or incidental to, the issuance of bonds, notes or other obligations,
1685 the authority may enter into such contracts as it may determine to be necessary or appropriate to
1686 place the bonds, notes or other obligations of the authority, as represented by the bonds or notes,
1687 or other obligations in whole or in part, on such interest rate or cash flow basis as the authority
1688 may determine, including without limitation, interest rate swap agreements, insurance
1689 agreements, forward payment conversion agreements, futures contracts, contracts providing for
1690 payments based on levels of, or changes in, interest rates or market indices, contracts to manage
1691 interest rate risk, including without limitation, interest rate floors or caps, options, puts, calls and
1692 similar arrangements. Such contracts shall contain such payment, security, default, remedy and
1693 other terms and conditions as the authority may deem appropriate and shall be entered into with
1694 such parties as the authority may select, after giving due consideration, where applicable, for the
1695 creditworthiness of the counter parties, including a rating by a nationally-recognized rating
1696 agency, the impact on a rating on outstanding bonds, notes or other obligations or other criteria
1697 the authority may deem appropriate.
1698 (f) The authority shall have the power to purchase its bonds or notes out of any funds
1699 available therefor. The authority may hold, pledge, cancel or resell such bonds or notes, subject
1700 to and in accordance with agreements with bondholders.
1701 (g) Any moneys received by the authority, whether as proceeds from the issuance of
1702 bonds or notes, or as revenue or otherwise, may be designated by the board as trust funds to be
1703 held and applied solely as provided in this act.
80 of 99

1704 Section 22. Bonds, refunding bonds and notes issued under this act shall be securities in
1705 which all public officers and public bodies of the commonwealth and its political subdivisions,
1706 all insurance companies, trust companies and their commercial departments and within the limits
1707 set forth in chapter 172 of the General Laws, banking associations, investment companies,
1708 executors, trustees and other fiduciaries, and all other persons whatsoever who are now or may
1709 hereinafter be authorized to invest in bonds or other obligations of a similar nature may properly
1710 and legally invest funds, including capital in their control or belonging to them; and such bonds
1711 are shall be obligations that may properly and legally be made eligible for the investment of
1712 savings deposits and the income thereof in the manner provided in chapter 168 of the General
1713 Laws. Such bonds shall be securities that may properly and legally be deposited with and
1714 received by a state or municipal officer or an agency or political subdivision of the
1715 commonwealth for a purpose for which the deposit of bonds or other obligations of the
1716 commonwealth is now or may hereafter be authorized by law.
1717 Section 23. A holder of bonds or notes issued under this act and a trustee under a trust,
1718 except to the extent the rights herein given may be restricted by the trust agreement, may, either
1719 at law or in equity, by suit, action, mandamus or other proceeding, protect and enforce all rights
1720 under the laws of the commonwealth or granted hereunder or under the trust agreement, and may
1721 enforce and compel the performance of all duties required by this act or by the trust agreement,
1722 to be performed by the authority or by an officer thereof.
1723 Section 24. The towns and the commonwealth are pledged to agree with the holders of
1724 the bonds or notes that neither the towns nor the commonwealth shall limit or alter or cause to
1725 limit or alter the rights hereby vested in the authority to acquire or maintain the project or
1726 infrastructure improvements, to establish and collect betterments, assessments, special
81 of 99

1727 assessments, fees and other charges and to fulfill the terms of any agreements made with the
1728 holders of the bonds or notes nor impair the rights and remedies of the bondholders or
1729 noteholders, until the bonds or notes, together with interest thereon, with interest on any unpaid
1730 installments of interest and all costs and expenses in connection with an action or proceeding by
1731 or on behalf of the bondholders or noteholders, are fully met and discharged.
1732 Section 25. (a) The creation of the authority and the carrying out of its corporate purposes

1846 adoption or rejection of the agreement at a town council meeting or a town meeting, as the case
1847 may be, provide the authority with a written notification stating whether the town council or
1848 town meeting adopted or rejected the agreement. Any town that has rejected the agreement shall
1849 have 1 year from the date of such disapproval to reconsider its decision and rescind its rejection
1850 and adopt the dissolution and administration agreement. Once a town adopts the agreement, it
1851 shall not thereafter vote to disapprove or reject it. If all 3 towns have not adopted the agreement
1852 at least 1 year prior to the bond termination date, the authority shall remain in existence and carry
1853 out its functions consistent with this act. If the towns fail to adopt the agreement, the general
