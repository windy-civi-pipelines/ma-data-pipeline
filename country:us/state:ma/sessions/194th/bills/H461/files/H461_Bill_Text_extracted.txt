257 violation of this chapter is not reasonable in relation to the development and preservation of

260 (2) The Attorney General shall have exclusive authority to enforce the provisions of this
261 chapter.
262 (3) Nothing in this chapter shall be construed as providing the basis for, or be subject to,

265 Attorney General shall provide a Regulated Entity forty-five days’ written notice identifying the
266 specific provisions of this chapter the Attorney General alleges have been or are being violated.
267 If within the forty-five day period the Regulated Entity cures the noticed violation and provides
268 the Attorney General an express written statement that the alleged violations have been cured, no
269 action shall be initiated against the Regulated Entity.
270 Section 8. Exemptions.
271 (1) This chapter does not apply to protected health information collected, used, or
272 disclosed by covered entities and business associates when the protected health information is
273 collected, used, or disclosed in accordance with the federal health insurance portability and
274 accountability act of 1996 and its implementing regulations and afforded all the privacy
275 protections and security safeguards of that federal law. For the purpose of this subsection (1),
276 “protected health information,” “covered entity,” and “business associate” have the same
14 of 15
277 meaning as in the federal health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 and its
278 implementing regulations.
279 (2) Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to prohibit disclosure as required by law.
280 (3) If any provision of this chapter, or the application thereof to any person or
281 circumstance, is held invalid, the remainder of this chapter and the application of such provision
282 to other persons not similarly situated or to other circumstances shall not be affected by the
283 invalidation.
