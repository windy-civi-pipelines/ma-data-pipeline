2 section 8M the following section:-
3 8N. (a) All carriers licensed under chapters 175, 176A, 176B and 176G that provide
4 medical or prescription drug benefits subject to utilization review consistent with section 12 of
5 chapter 176O, shall make publicly available on their website a searchable list of all items,
6 services and medications that require prior authorization. Prior authorization may not be
7 requested for an item, service or medication that is not listed on the publicly available website.
8 (b) If a carrier contracts with another entity that manages or administers such benefits for
9 the carrier, including a utilization review organization as defined in section 1 of said chapter
10 176O, that entity shall provide the carrier the information required under subsection (a) and that
11 carrier shall post the required information publicly on the carrier’s website consistent with the
12 requirements of subsection (a).
1 of 16
13 (c) Carriers and utilization management organizations shall report annually, not later than
14 July 1, to the division of insurance data regarding approval and denials of prior authorization
15 requests, including request for drug benefits, in a readily accessible, standardized, searchable
16 format as determined by the division. Data shall be submitted for the following categories:
17 medical, inpatient and outpatient surgical services, post-acute care admissions to skilled nursing
18 facilities, inpatient rehab facilities and home care services, prescription drugs, behavioral health,
19 diagnostic services including labs and imaging and all other categories of health care services or
20 drug benefits for which a prior authorization request was required. Such data shall include:
21 (i) the number and percentage of standard prior authorization requests that were approved
22 or denied;
23 (ii) the number and percentage of standard prior authorization requests that were initially
24 denied and approved after appeal;
25 (iii) the number and percentage of prior authorization requests for which the timeframe
26 for review was extended, and the request was approved;

40 other entity that manages or administers such benefits for the carrier, under subsection (a) to the
41 clerks of the senate and house of representatives, the joint committee on health care financing,
42 the center for health information and analysis and the health policy commission. The
43 commissioner shall make publicly available, through its website or alternative means, the
44 submitted data, including a listing of all items, services and medications subject to prior
45 authorization by each individual carrier.
46 (f) The division shall promulgate rules and regulations necessary to implement this
47 section.
48 SECTION 2. Chapter 32A of the General Laws, is hereby amended by inserting after
49 section 4B the following section:-
50 Section 4C. The commission or an entity with which the commission contracts to provide
51 or manage health insurance benefits, shall adopt utilization review criteria and conduct all
52 utilization review activities under the criteria and in compliance with this section. The criteria
3 of 16
53 shall be, to the maximum extent feasible, scientifically derived and evidence-based, and
54 developed with the input of participating physicians. Utilization review criteria, including
55 detailed preauthorization requirements and clinical review criteria, shall be applied consistently
56 and posted on a publicly-available website by the commission or any entity with which the
57 commission contracts to provide or manage health insurance benefits in an up-to-date, readily
58 accessible, standardized and searchable electronic format. If the commission or an entity with
59 which the commission contracts to provide or manage health insurance benefits intends either to
60 implement a new preauthorization requirement or restriction or amend an existing requirement or
61 restriction, the new or amended requirement or restriction shall not be implemented unless: (i)
62 the appropriate website has been updated to reflect the new or amended requirement or
63 restriction; (ii) active or retired employees of the commonwealth and their dependents who are
64 affected are notified of the changes by electronic means via email and any applicable online
65 member portal, or for those without access to electronic means of communication, by mail; and
66 (iii) the commission or an entity with which the commission contracts to provide or manage
67 health insurance benefits has processes in place to ensure continuation of any previously
68 approved preauthorizations.
69 The commission or an entity with which the commission contracts to provide or manage
70 health insurance benefits shall not retrospectively deny authorization for an admission,
71 procedure, treatment, service or course of medication when an authorization has already been
72 approved for that service unless the approval was based upon fraudulent information material to
73 the review.
74 SECTION 3. Section 24B of chapter 175 of the General Laws, as appearing in the 2022
75 Official Edition, is hereby amended by adding the following paragraphs:-
4 of 16
76 A carrier, as defined in section 1 of chapter 176O, shall be required to pay for health care
77 services ordered by the treating health care provider if: (1) the services are a covered benefit
78 under the insured’s health benefit plan; and (2) the services follow the carrier’s clinical review
79 criteria; provided, however, that a claim for treatment of medically necessary services may not
80 be denied if the treating health care provider follows the carrier’s approved method for securing
81 authorization for a covered service for the insured at the time the service was provided.
82 A carrier shall not deny payment for a claim for medically necessary covered services on
83 the basis of an administrative or technical defect in the claim except in the case where the carrier
84 has a reasonable basis, supported by specific information available for review, that the claim for
85 health care services rendered was submitted fraudulently. A carrier shall have no more than 1
86 year after the original payment was received by the health care provider to recoup a full or partial
87 payment for a claim for services rendered, or to adjust a subsequent payment to reflect a
88 recoupment of a full or partial payment. Claims may not be recouped for utilization review
89 purposes if the services were already deemed medically necessary or the manner in which the
90 services were accessed or provided were previously approved by the carrier or its contractor.
91 SECTION 4. Subsection (a) of section 12 of chapter 176O, as so appearing, is hereby
92 amended by striking out the second paragraph and inserting in place thereof the following
93 paragraph:-
94 A carrier or utilization review organization shall adopt utilization review criteria and
95 conduct all utilization review activities under the criteria and in compliance with this section.
96 The criteria shall be, to the maximum extent feasible, scientifically derived and evidence-based,
97 and developed with the input of participating physicians, consistent with the development of
5 of 16
98 medical necessity criteria under section 16. Utilization review criteria, including detailed
99 preauthorization requirements and clinical review criteria, shall be applied consistently by a
100 carrier or a utilization review organization and posted on a carrier or utilization review
101 organization's public-facing website in an up-to-date, readily accessible, standardized and
102 searchable electronic format. If a carrier or utilization review organization intends either to
103 implement a new preauthorization requirement or restriction or amend an existing requirement or
104 restriction, the carrier or utilization review organization shall ensure that the new or amended
105 requirement or restriction shall not be implemented unless: (i) the carrier's or utilization review
106 organization's website has been updated to reflect the new or amended requirement or restriction;
107 (ii) insureds who are affected are notified of the changes by electronic means via email and any
108 applicable online member portal, or for those without access to electronic means of
109 communication, by mail; and (iii) the carrier or utilization review organization has processes in
110 place to ensure continuation of any previously approved preauthorizations.
111 SECTION 5. Said subsection (a) of said section 12 of said chapter 176O of the General
112 Laws, as appearing in the 2022 Official Edition, is hereby further amended by inserting after the
113 third paragraph the following paragraphs:-
114 A carrier or utilization review organization shall not retrospectively deny authorization
115 for an admission, procedure, treatment, service or course of medication when an authorization
116 has already been approved for that service unless the approval was based upon fraudulent
117 information material to the review.
118 SECTION 6. Subsection (b) of said section 12 of said chapter 176O, as so appearing, is
119 hereby amended by inserting after the word “information”, in line 38, the following words:-
6 of 16
120 ; provided, however, that if additional delay would result in significant risk to the
121 enrollee’s health or well-being, a carrier or a utilization review organization shall respond not
122 more than 24 hours following the receipt of all necessary information. If a carrier or utilization
123 review organization does not, within the time limits set forth in this section, respond to a
124 completed prior authorization request or request missing information, the prior authorization
125 request shall be deemed to have been granted; provided further that if a prior authorization is
126 requested for an item, service, or medication that is not publicly listed on a carrier’s website as
127 being subject to prior authorization, the request shall be deemed to have been granted.
128 SECTION 7. Said section 12 of said chapter 176O of the General Laws, as appearing in
129 the 2022 Official Edition, is further amended by adding after subsection (f) the following
130 subsections:-

132 as determined by a health care provider and approved for coverage by a previous carrier or health
133 benefit plan, a carrier or utilization review organization shall not restrict coverage of such
134 treatment, service or course of medication for at least 90 days upon the insured member’s
135 enrollment.
136 (h) Preauthorization approval for a prescribed treatment, service or course of medication
137 shall be valid for the duration of a prescribed or ordered course of treatment, or at least 1 year;
138 provided further that a change in dosage for an approved medication shall not require a new
139 preauthorization.
140 (i) For an insured member who is stable on a treatment, service or course of medication
141 as determined by a health care provider and approved for coverage by the carrier or health
7 of 16
142 benefit plan, and where that drug or medical service is then removed from a plan’s formulary or
143 is subject to new coverage restrictions after the beneficiary enrollment period has ended, a carrier
144 shall cover the approved drug or medical service without restrictions for the rest of the benefit
145 year or 90 days, whichever is longer.
146 (j) If a carrier and a provider or provider organization are engaged in an alternative
147 payment contract that includes downside risk, the carrier shall not unilaterally require prior
148 authorization requirements for any particular health care service that is included in that
149 alternative payment contract.
150 SECTION 8. Chapter 176O, as so appearing, is hereby amended by inserting after section
151 12B the following sections:
152 12C. (a)(1) For items, services or drugs covered under the insured’s medical benefit, a
153 carrier or utilization review organization shall implement and maintain a prior authorization
154 application programming interface for the automated processing of prior authorization requests

183 12D. (a) For purposes of this subsection, “artificial intelligence” means an engineered or
184 machine-based system that varies in its level of autonomy and that can, for a given set of human-
185 defined explicit or implicit objectives, make predictions, recommendations or decisions
186 influencing real or virtual environments. Artificial intelligence systems use machine and human-
187 based inputs to: (i) perceive real and virtual environments; (ii) abstract such perceptions into
188 models through analysis in an automated manner; and (iii) use model inference to formulate
189 options for information or action.
190 (b) A carrier or utilization review organization that uses an artificial intelligence,
191 algorithm or other software tool for the purpose of utilization review or utilization management
192 functions, based in whole or in part on medical necessity, or that contracts with or otherwise
193 works through an entity that uses an artificial intelligence, algorithm or other software tool for
194 the purpose of utilization review or utilization management functions, based in whole or in part
195 on medical necessity, shall comply with this subsection and shall ensure all of the following:
196 (1) the artificial intelligence, algorithm or other software tool bases determinations on the
197 following information, as applicable:
198 (i) an enrollee’s medical or other clinical history;
199 (ii) individual clinical circumstances as presented by the requesting provider;
200 (iii) other relevant clinical information contained in the enrollee’s medical or other
201 clinical record;
202 (2) the artificial intelligence, algorithm or other software tool does not base
203 determinations solely on a group dataset;
10 of 16

210 discriminate, directly or indirectly, against enrollees in violation of state or federal law;
211 (6) the artificial intelligence, algorithm or other software tool is fairly and equitably
212 applied, including in accordance with any applicable regulations and guidance issued by the
213 United States Department of Health and Human Services;
214 (7) the artificial intelligence, algorithm or other software tool shall be open to inspection
215 for audit or compliance reviews by the division;
216 (8) carriers and utilization review organizations shall disclose to the division, each health
217 care provider in the carrier’s network, and each enrollee in a health benefits plan offered by the

219 will be used by the carrier or utilization review organization’s utilization review process;
220 provided further that, if applicable, a carrier or utilization review organization shall disclose
221 algorithm criteria, data sets used to train the algorithm, the algorithm itself and the outcomes of
222 the software in which the algorithm is used;
223 (9) the artificial intelligence, algorithm or other software tool’s performance, use and
224 outcomes are periodically reviewed and revised to maximize accuracy and reliability;
11 of 16
225 (10) patient data is not used beyond said data’s intended and stated purpose, consistent
226 with the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as applicable; and
227 (11) the artificial intelligence, algorithm or other software tool does not directly or
228 indirectly cause harm to the enrollee.
229 (c) Notwithstanding subsection (a), an artificial intelligence-based algorithm or other
230 software tool shall not be the sole basis of a decision to deny, delay or modify health care
231 services based, in whole or in part, on medical necessity. An adverse determination of medical
232 necessity or denial of preauthorization shall be made only by a licensed physician or a licensed
233 health care provider competent to evaluate the specific clinical issues involved in the health care
234 services requested by the provider, as provided in subsection (a) of this section, by reviewing and
235 considering the requesting provider’s recommendation, the enrollee’s medical or other clinical
236 history, as applicable, and individual clinical circumstances.
237 (d) This section shall apply to utilization review or utilization management functions that
238 prospectively, retrospectively or concurrently review requests for covered health care services.

249 organization that fails to comply with the requirements of these sections. If the commissioner
250 determines that a carrier or utilization review organization is failing to comply with the
251 requirements of section 12 through 12D, inclusive, or 16 of this chapter, the commissioner shall
252 notify the carrier of such violation and shall impose a corrective action plan. If the carrier does
253 not come into compliance by adhering to the corrective action plan within a period determined
254 by the commissioner, the carrier shall be fined up to $5,000 for each day during which such
255 violation continues; provided, however, that the commissioner may impose additional penalties
256 for repeated or wanton violations.
257 SECTION 9. Section 25 of said chapter 176O of the General Laws, as appearing in the
258 2022 Official Edition, is hereby amended by striking subsection (e) and inserting in place thereof

40 other entity that manages or administers such benefits for the carrier, under subsection (a) to the
41 clerks of the senate and house of representatives, the joint committee on health care financing,
42 the center for health information and analysis and the health policy commission. The
43 commissioner shall make publicly available, through its website or alternative means, the
44 submitted data, including a listing of all items, services and medications subject to prior
45 authorization by each individual carrier.
46 (f) The division shall promulgate rules and regulations necessary to implement this
47 section.
48 SECTION 2. Chapter 32A of the General Laws, is hereby amended by inserting after
49 section 4B the following section:-
50 Section 4C. The commission or an entity with which the commission contracts to provide
51 or manage health insurance benefits, shall adopt utilization review criteria and conduct all
52 utilization review activities under the criteria and in compliance with this section. The criteria
3 of 16

53 shall be, to the maximum extent feasible, scientifically derived and evidence-based, and
54 developed with the input of participating physicians. Utilization review criteria, including
55 detailed preauthorization requirements and clinical review criteria, shall be applied consistently
56 and posted on a publicly-available website by the commission or any entity with which the
57 commission contracts to provide or manage health insurance benefits in an up-to-date, readily
58 accessible, standardized and searchable electronic format. If the commission or an entity with
59 which the commission contracts to provide or manage health insurance benefits intends either to
60 implement a new preauthorization requirement or restriction or amend an existing requirement or
61 restriction, the new or amended requirement or restriction shall not be implemented unless: (i)
62 the appropriate website has been updated to reflect the new or amended requirement or
63 restriction; (ii) active or retired employees of the commonwealth and their dependents who are
64 affected are notified of the changes by electronic means via email and any applicable online
65 member portal, or for those without access to electronic means of communication, by mail; and
66 (iii) the commission or an entity with which the commission contracts to provide or manage
67 health insurance benefits has processes in place to ensure continuation of any previously
68 approved preauthorizations.
69 The commission or an entity with which the commission contracts to provide or manage
70 health insurance benefits shall not retrospectively deny authorization for an admission,
71 procedure, treatment, service or course of medication when an authorization has already been
72 approved for that service unless the approval was based upon fraudulent information material to
73 the review.
74 SECTION 3. Section 24B of chapter 175 of the General Laws, as appearing in the 2022
75 Official Edition, is hereby amended by adding the following paragraphs:-
4 of 16

76 A carrier, as defined in section 1 of chapter 176O, shall be required to pay for health care
77 services ordered by the treating health care provider if: (1) the services are a covered benefit
78 under the insured’s health benefit plan; and (2) the services follow the carrier’s clinical review
79 criteria; provided, however, that a claim for treatment of medically necessary services may not
80 be denied if the treating health care provider follows the carrier’s approved method for securing
81 authorization for a covered service for the insured at the time the service was provided.
82 A carrier shall not deny payment for a claim for medically necessary covered services on
83 the basis of an administrative or technical defect in the claim except in the case where the carrier
84 has a reasonable basis, supported by specific information available for review, that the claim for
85 health care services rendered was submitted fraudulently. A carrier shall have no more than 1
86 year after the original payment was received by the health care provider to recoup a full or partial
87 payment for a claim for services rendered, or to adjust a subsequent payment to reflect a
88 recoupment of a full or partial payment. Claims may not be recouped for utilization review
89 purposes if the services were already deemed medically necessary or the manner in which the
90 services were accessed or provided were previously approved by the carrier or its contractor.
91 SECTION 4. Subsection (a) of section 12 of chapter 176O, as so appearing, is hereby
92 amended by striking out the second paragraph and inserting in place thereof the following
93 paragraph:-
94 A carrier or utilization review organization shall adopt utilization review criteria and
95 conduct all utilization review activities under the criteria and in compliance with this section.
96 The criteria shall be, to the maximum extent feasible, scientifically derived and evidence-based,
97 and developed with the input of participating physicians, consistent with the development of
5 of 16

98 medical necessity criteria under section 16. Utilization review criteria, including detailed
99 preauthorization requirements and clinical review criteria, shall be applied consistently by a
100 carrier or a utilization review organization and posted on a carrier or utilization review
101 organization's public-facing website in an up-to-date, readily accessible, standardized and
102 searchable electronic format. If a carrier or utilization review organization intends either to
103 implement a new preauthorization requirement or restriction or amend an existing requirement or
104 restriction, the carrier or utilization review organization shall ensure that the new or amended
105 requirement or restriction shall not be implemented unless: (i) the carrier's or utilization review
106 organization's website has been updated to reflect the new or amended requirement or restriction;
107 (ii) insureds who are affected are notified of the changes by electronic means via email and any
108 applicable online member portal, or for those without access to electronic means of
109 communication, by mail; and (iii) the carrier or utilization review organization has processes in
110 place to ensure continuation of any previously approved preauthorizations.
111 SECTION 5. Said subsection (a) of said section 12 of said chapter 176O of the General
112 Laws, as appearing in the 2022 Official Edition, is hereby further amended by inserting after the
113 third paragraph the following paragraphs:-
114 A carrier or utilization review organization shall not retrospectively deny authorization
115 for an admission, procedure, treatment, service or course of medication when an authorization
116 has already been approved for that service unless the approval was based upon fraudulent
117 information material to the review.
118 SECTION 6. Subsection (b) of said section 12 of said chapter 176O, as so appearing, is
119 hereby amended by inserting after the word “information”, in line 38, the following words:-
6 of 16

120 ; provided, however, that if additional delay would result in significant risk to the
121 enrollee’s health or well-being, a carrier or a utilization review organization shall respond not
122 more than 24 hours following the receipt of all necessary information. If a carrier or utilization
123 review organization does not, within the time limits set forth in this section, respond to a
124 completed prior authorization request or request missing information, the prior authorization
125 request shall be deemed to have been granted; provided further that if a prior authorization is
126 requested for an item, service, or medication that is not publicly listed on a carrier’s website as
127 being subject to prior authorization, the request shall be deemed to have been granted.
128 SECTION 7. Said section 12 of said chapter 176O of the General Laws, as appearing in
129 the 2022 Official Edition, is further amended by adding after subsection (f) the following
130 subsections:-
131 (g) For an insured member who is stable on a treatment, service or course of medication
132 as determined by a health care provider and approved for coverage by a previous carrier or health
133 benefit plan, a carrier or utilization review organization shall not restrict coverage of such
134 treatment, service or course of medication for at least 90 days upon the insured member’s
135 enrollment.
136 (h) Preauthorization approval for a prescribed treatment, service or course of medication
137 shall be valid for the duration of a prescribed or ordered course of treatment, or at least 1 year;
138 provided further that a change in dosage for an approved medication shall not require a new
139 preauthorization.
140 (i) For an insured member who is stable on a treatment, service or course of medication
141 as determined by a health care provider and approved for coverage by the carrier or health
7 of 16

142 benefit plan, and where that drug or medical service is then removed from a plan’s formulary or
143 is subject to new coverage restrictions after the beneficiary enrollment period has ended, a carrier
144 shall cover the approved drug or medical service without restrictions for the rest of the benefit
145 year or 90 days, whichever is longer.
146 (j) If a carrier and a provider or provider organization are engaged in an alternative
147 payment contract that includes downside risk, the carrier shall not unilaterally require prior
148 authorization requirements for any particular health care service that is included in that
149 alternative payment contract.
150 SECTION 8. Chapter 176O, as so appearing, is hereby amended by inserting after section
151 12B the following sections:
152 12C. (a)(1) For items, services or drugs covered under the insured’s medical benefit, a
153 carrier or utilization review organization shall implement and maintain a prior authorization
154 application programming interface for the automated processing of prior authorization requests
155 to enable a provider to: (i) determine whether prior authorization is required for a health care
156 item, service or drug; (ii) identify prior authorization information and documentation
157 requirements, including any standardized forms; and (iii) facilitate the exchange of prior
158 authorization requests and determinations from the provider’s electronic health records or

183 12D. (a) For purposes of this subsection, “artificial intelligence” means an engineered or
184 machine-based system that varies in its level of autonomy and that can, for a given set of human-
185 defined explicit or implicit objectives, make predictions, recommendations or decisions
186 influencing real or virtual environments. Artificial intelligence systems use machine and human-
187 based inputs to: (i) perceive real and virtual environments; (ii) abstract such perceptions into
188 models through analysis in an automated manner; and (iii) use model inference to formulate
189 options for information or action.
190 (b) A carrier or utilization review organization that uses an artificial intelligence,
191 algorithm or other software tool for the purpose of utilization review or utilization management
192 functions, based in whole or in part on medical necessity, or that contracts with or otherwise
193 works through an entity that uses an artificial intelligence, algorithm or other software tool for
194 the purpose of utilization review or utilization management functions, based in whole or in part
195 on medical necessity, shall comply with this subsection and shall ensure all of the following:
196 (1) the artificial intelligence, algorithm or other software tool bases determinations on the
197 following information, as applicable:
198 (i) an enrollee’s medical or other clinical history;
199 (ii) individual clinical circumstances as presented by the requesting provider;
200 (iii) other relevant clinical information contained in the enrollee’s medical or other
201 clinical record;
202 (2) the artificial intelligence, algorithm or other software tool does not base
203 determinations solely on a group dataset;
10 of 16

204 (3) the artificial intelligence, algorithm or other software tool’s criteria and guidelines
205 complies with this chapter, including, but not limited to, sections 12 through 16, inclusive, and
206 applicable state and federal law;
207 (4) the artificial intelligence, algorithm or other software tool does not supplant health
208 care provider decision-making;

210 discriminate, directly or indirectly, against enrollees in violation of state or federal law;
211 (6) the artificial intelligence, algorithm or other software tool is fairly and equitably
212 applied, including in accordance with any applicable regulations and guidance issued by the
213 United States Department of Health and Human Services;
214 (7) the artificial intelligence, algorithm or other software tool shall be open to inspection
215 for audit or compliance reviews by the division;
216 (8) carriers and utilization review organizations shall disclose to the division, each health
217 care provider in the carrier’s network, and each enrollee in a health benefits plan offered by the
218 carrier, and on the carrier’s public website if artificial intelligence-based algorithms are used or
219 will be used by the carrier or utilization review organization’s utilization review process;
220 provided further that, if applicable, a carrier or utilization review organization shall disclose
221 algorithm criteria, data sets used to train the algorithm, the algorithm itself and the outcomes of
222 the software in which the algorithm is used;
223 (9) the artificial intelligence, algorithm or other software tool’s performance, use and
224 outcomes are periodically reviewed and revised to maximize accuracy and reliability;
11 of 16

225 (10) patient data is not used beyond said data’s intended and stated purpose, consistent
226 with the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as applicable; and
227 (11) the artificial intelligence, algorithm or other software tool does not directly or
228 indirectly cause harm to the enrollee.
229 (c) Notwithstanding subsection (a), an artificial intelligence-based algorithm or other
230 software tool shall not be the sole basis of a decision to deny, delay or modify health care
231 services based, in whole or in part, on medical necessity. An adverse determination of medical
232 necessity or denial of preauthorization shall be made only by a licensed physician or a licensed
233 health care provider competent to evaluate the specific clinical issues involved in the health care
234 services requested by the provider, as provided in subsection (a) of this section, by reviewing and
235 considering the requesting provider’s recommendation, the enrollee’s medical or other clinical
236 history, as applicable, and individual clinical circumstances.
237 (d) This section shall apply to utilization review or utilization management functions that
238 prospectively, retrospectively or concurrently review requests for covered health care services.

248 and section 16 and shall impose a penalty or other remedy against a carrier or utilization review
249 organization that fails to comply with the requirements of these sections. If the commissioner
250 determines that a carrier or utilization review organization is failing to comply with the
251 requirements of section 12 through 12D, inclusive, or 16 of this chapter, the commissioner shall
252 notify the carrier of such violation and shall impose a corrective action plan. If the carrier does
253 not come into compliance by adhering to the corrective action plan within a period determined
254 by the commissioner, the carrier shall be fined up to $5,000 for each day during which such
255 violation continues; provided, however, that the commissioner may impose additional penalties
256 for repeated or wanton violations.
257 SECTION 9. Section 25 of said chapter 176O of the General Laws, as appearing in the
258 2022 Official Edition, is hereby amended by striking subsection (e) and inserting in place thereof
