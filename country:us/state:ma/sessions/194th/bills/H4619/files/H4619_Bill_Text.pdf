1 SECTION 1. Chapter 111 of the General Laws is hereby amended by inserting after

14 “Hospital”, a hospital licensed pursuant to section 51 of chapter 111.
15 “Professional fee”, a fee charged or billed by a health care provider for professional
16 medical services.
17 (b) A health care provider shall not charge, bill or collect a facility fee except for: (i)
18 services provided on a hospital’s campus; (ii) services provided at a facility that includes a
19 licensed hospital emergency department; or (iii) emergency services provided at a licensed
20 satellite emergency facility.
21 (c) Notwithstanding subsection (b), a health care provider shall not charge, bill, or collect
22 a facility fee for a service identified by the commission pursuant to its authority in section 20 of
23 chapter 6D as a service that may reliably be provided safely and effectively in settings other than
24 hospitals.
25 (d) The department shall promulgate regulations necessary to implement this section and
26 impose penalties for non-compliance consistent with the department’s authority to regulate
27 health care providers. A health care provider that violates any provision of this section or the
28 rules and regulations adopted pursuant hereto shall be punished by a fine of not more than
29 $1,000 per occurrence.

2 of 10

33 (b) If a health care provider is required to provide a patient with notice under subsection
34 (a) and a patient’s appointment is scheduled to occur not less than 10 days after the appointment
35 is made, the health care provider shall provide written notice and explanation to the patient by
36 first class mail, encrypted electronic means or a secure patient Internet portal not less than 3 days
37 after the appointment is made. If an appointment is scheduled to occur less than 10 days after the
38 appointment is made or if the patient arrives without an appointment, the notice shall be provided
39 to the patient on the facility’s premises.
40 If a patient arrives without an appointment, a health care provider shall provide written
41 notice and explanation to the patient prior to the care if practicable, or if prior notice is not
42 practicable, the health care provider shall provide an explanation of the fee to the patient within a
43 reasonable period of time; provided, however, that the explanation of the fee shall be provided
44 before the patient leaves the facility. If the patient is incapacitated or otherwise unable to read,
45 understand and act on the patient’s rights, the notice and explanation of the fee shall be provided
46 to the patient’s representative within a reasonable period of time.
47 (c) A facility at which facility fees for services are charged, billed, or collected shall
48 clearly identify itself as being associated with a hospital, including by stating the name of the
49 hospital that owns or operates the location in its signage, marketing materials, Internet web sites,
50 and stationery.
51 (d) If a health care provider charges, bills, or collects facility fees at a given facility,
52 notice shall be posted in that facility informing patients that a patient may incur higher financial
53 liability as compared to receiving the service in a non-hospital facility. Notice shall be
3 of 10

54 prominently displayed in locations accessible to and visible by patients, including in patient
55 waiting areas.
56 (e)(1) If a location at which health care services are provided without facility fees
57 changes status such that facility fees would be permissible at that location under section 51M,
58 and the health care provider that owns or operates the location elects to charge, bill, or collect
59 facility fees, the health care provider shall provide written notice to all patients who received
60 services at the location during the previous calendar year not later than 30 days after the change
61 of status. The notice shall state that: (i) the location is now owned or operated by a hospital; (ii)
62 certain health care services delivered at the facility may result in separate facility and
63 professional bills for services; and (iii) patients seeking care at the facility may incur higher
64 financial liability at that location due to its change in status.
65 (2) In cases in which a written notice is required by paragraph (1), the health care
66 provider that owns or operates the location shall not charge or bill a facility fee for services
67 provided at that location until not less than 30 days after the written notice is provided.
68 (3) A notice required or provided under paragraph (1) shall be filed with the department
69 not later than 30 days after its issuance.
70 (f) The department may promulgate regulations necessary to implement this section and
71 impose penalties for non-compliance consistent with the department’s authority to regulate
72 health care providers. A health care provider that violates any provision of this section or the
73 rules and regulations adopted pursuant hereto shall be punished by a fine of not more than
74 $1,000 per occurrence. In addition to any penalties for noncompliance that may be established by
75 the department, a violation of this section shall be an unfair trade practice under chapter 93A.

76 SECTION 2. Section 228 of said chapter 111 of the General Laws, as appearing in the
77 2022 Official Edition, is hereby amended by striking out subsection (e) and inserting in place
78 thereof the following subsection:-
79 (e) A health care provider shall determine if it participates in a patient’s health benefit
80 plan prior to said patient’s admission, procedure or service for conditions that are not emergency
81 medical conditions as defined in section 1 of chapter 176O. If the health care provider does not
82 participate in the patient’s health benefit plan and the admission, procedure or service was
83 scheduled more than 7 days in advance of the admission, procedure or service, such provider
84 shall notify the patient verbally and in writing of that fact not less than 7 days before the
85 scheduled admission, procedure or service. If the health care provider does not participate in the
86 patient’s health benefit plan and the admission, procedure or service was scheduled less than 7
87 days in advance of the admission, procedure or service, such provider shall notify the patient
88 verbally of that fact not less than 2 days before the scheduled admission, procedure or service or
89 as soon as is practicable before the scheduled admission, procedure or service, with written
90 notice of that fact to be provided upon the patient’s arrival at the scheduled admission, procedure
91 or service. If a health care provider that does not participate in the patient’s health benefit plan
92 fails to provide the required notifications under this subsection, or if the provider is rendering
93 unforeseen out-of-network services, as defined in subsection (a) of section 30 of chapter 176O,
94 the provider shall not bill the insured except for any applicable copayment, coinsurance or
95 deductible that would be payable if the insured received the service from a participating health
96 care provider under the terms of the insured’s health benefit plan. Nothing in this subsection
97 shall relieve a health care provider from the requirements under subsections (b) to (d), inclusive.

120 presented with fraudulent intent a claim which contains a false statement, including but not
121 limited to a payment or false statement regarding an impermissible facility fee shall be liable to

153 such facility; (iv) health care services rendered by an out-of-network provider, including an out-
154 of-network laboratory, radiologist, or pathologist, where the health care services were referred,
155 or an insured’s specimen was sent, by a participating provider to an out-of-network provider; or
156 (v) unforeseen health care services that arise at the time health care services are rendered that
157 must necessarily be rendered by an out-of-network provider; and (3) health care services
158 delivered by an ambulance service provider licensed by the department of public health pursuant

164 network deductible or out-of-pocket maximum pursuant to the terms and conditions of an
165 insured’s health benefit plan.
166 (c) A carrier shall reimburse an out-of-network provider who renders an unforeseen out-
167 of-network service to an insured at the carrier’s median contracted rate for that service in the
168 geographic region in the relevant market. Such payment shall constitute payment in full to the
169 out-of-network provider and the out-of-network provider shall not bill the insured for any
170 amount except for any in-network cost sharing amount owed for such service.
171 (d) With respect to an entity providing or administering a self-funded health benefit plan
172 governed by the provisions of the federal Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, 29
173 U.S.C. § 1001 et seq. and its plan members, this section shall only apply if the plan elects to be
174 subject to the provisions of this section. To elect to be subject to the provisions of this section,
175 the self-funded health benefit plan shall provide notice to the division on an annual basis, in a
176 form and manner prescribed by the division, attesting to the plan’s participation and agreeing to
177 be bound by the provisions of this section. The self-funded health benefit plan shall amend the
178 health benefit plan, coverage policies, contracts and any other plan documents to reflect that the
179 benefits of this section shall apply to the plan’s members.
180 (e) This section shall not be construed to require a carrier to cover health care services not
181 required by law or by the terms and conditions of an insured’s health benefit plan. Nothing in
182 this section shall require a carrier to pay for health care services delivered to an insured that are
183 not covered benefits under the terms of the insured’s health benefit plan.
184 (f) Nothing in this section shall require a carrier to pay for nonemergency services
185 delivered to an insured if the insured had a reasonable opportunity to choose to have the service
9 of 10

186 performed by a network provider participating in the insured’s health benefit plan. Evidence that
187 an insured had a reasonable opportunity to choose to have the service performed by a
188 participating provider may include, but is not limited to, a consent waiver signed by the insured.
189 (g) The commissioner shall promulgate regulations to implement this section.
