93 online tool allows the user to modify or delete a direction at all times, a direction regarding
5 of 18

107 held by the user for whom, or for whose estate, the fiduciary acts or represents.

6 of 18

114 (1) grant a fiduciary or designated recipient full access to the user’s account;
115 (2) grant a fiduciary or designated recipient partial access to the user’s account sufficient
116 to perform the tasks with which the fiduciary or designated recipient is charged; or
117 (3) provide a fiduciary or designated recipient a copy in a record of any digital asset that,
118 on the date the custodian received the request for disclosure, the user could have accessed if the
119 user were alive and had full capacity and access to the account.

121 digital assets under this chapter.

124 some, but not all, of the user’s digital assets, the custodian need not disclose the assets if
125 segregation of the assets would impose an undue burden on the custodian. If the custodian
126 believes the direction or request imposes an undue burden, the custodian or fiduciary may seek
127 an order from the court to disclose:
128 (1) a subset limited by date of the user’s digital assets;
129 (2) all of the user’s digital assets to the fiduciary or designated recipient;
130 (3) none of the user’s digital assets; or

133 If a deceased user consented or a court directs disclosure of the contents of electronic
134 communications of the user, the custodian shall disclose to the personal representative of the

142 will, trust, or other record evidencing the user’s consent to disclosure of the content of electronic
143 communications; and

153 applicable law;
154 (iii) unless the user provided direction using an online tool, the user consented to
155 disclosure of the content of electronic communications; or

157 necessary for administration of the estate.
