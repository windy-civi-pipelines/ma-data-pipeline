34 Except in a judicial proceeding alleging a violation of this section, no information
35 obtained in violation of this section shall be admissible in any criminal, civil, administrative or
36 other proceeding.
37 (c) The registrar of motor vehicles may acquire, possess, or use facial recognition
38 technology to investigate and verify an individual’s identity when issuing licenses, permits or
39 other documents pursuant to chapter 90, and the department of state police may access or use

41 provided, however, that the registrar shall not otherwise allow any other entity to access or
42 otherwise use its facial recognition technology except in accordance with subsection (d).
43 (d) The department of state police may perform a facial recognition search, or request the
44 federal bureau of investigation to perform such a search, for the following purposes:
45 (1) to assist the registrar of motor vehicles in investigating and verifying an individual’s
46 identity pursuant to subsection (c);
47 (2) to execute a warrant duly authorized by a judge based on probable cause that an
48 unidentified or unconfirmed individual in an image has committed a felony;
49 (3) upon reasonable belief that an emergency involving immediate danger of death or

53 (5) on behalf of another law enforcement agency or a federal agency, provided that such
54 agency obtained a warrant pursuant to clause (2) or documented in writing the reason for a

56 One facial recognition operations group within the department shall be charged with
57 receiving and evaluating law enforcement requests for facial recognition searches, performing
58 facial recognition searches, reporting results, and recording relevant data. The department shall
59 only use existing facial recognition technology used by the registrar of motor vehicles or federal
60 bureau of investigations or facial recognition technology approved by the executive office of
61 technology services and security, which may only be approved following a public hearing on the
62 proposed software.
63 Any search request made to the federal bureau of investigation under this section shall be
64 documented in writing.
65 (e) For any emergency facial recognition search performed or requested under subsection
66 (d)(3), the law enforcement agency shall immediately document the factual basis for its belief
67 that an emergency requires the performance of such a search without delay, and any emergency
68 facial recognition search shall be narrowly tailored to address the emergency. Not later than 48
69 hours after the law enforcement agency obtains access to the results of a facial recognition
70 search, the agency shall file with the superior court in the relevant jurisdiction a signed, sworn
71 statement made by a supervisory official of a rank designated by the head of the agency setting
72 forth the grounds for the emergency search.
73 (f) All individuals charged with a crime who were identified using a facial recognition
74 search under this subsection shall be provided notice that they were subject to such search,

99 enforcement agency or federal agency on whose behalf the search was performed; (ii) the total
100 number of facial recognition searches requested to be performed by the federal bureau of
101 investigation on behalf of law enforcement agencies, disaggregated by requesting law

121 (k) Notwithstanding subsection (b), it shall be unlawful for a law enforcement agency of
122 officer to use a biometric surveillance system to infer a person’s emotions or affect. It shall also
123 be unlawful for a law enforcement agency or officer to use a biometric surveillance system to
