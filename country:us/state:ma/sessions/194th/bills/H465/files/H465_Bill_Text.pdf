5 that they have received a diploma from the faculty of a reputable dental college as defined in

7 as a member of the faculty of a dental college accredited by the Commission on Accreditation of

11 incorporated under the laws of the commonwealth, may upon payment of a fee to be determined
12 annually by the commissioner of administration under the provision of section 3B of chapter 7 be
13 registered by the board as a limited registrant for one year; provided, however, that practice
14 under any such original or renewal limited registration so issued by the board shall be limited to
15 no longer than 5 years unless said applicant passes a clinical examination administered by the
16 board or is a full time faculty member; and provided further, that, any applicant who has
17 practiced under an original or renewed license for 5 years and who has passed a clinical
18 examination administered by the board may qualify for a renewal of such license for a period not
19 to exceed 5 years in which the applicant may continue to practice in a hospital or other
20 institution designated on their registration and under the direction of a registered dentist
21 employed therein.
22 (b) A limited registration shall entitle an applicant to practice dentistry only in the
23 hospital or other institution designated on their registration and under the direction of a registered
24 dentist or a special registration dentist employed therein. Limited registration under this section
25 may be revoked at any time by the board and a holder of such a limited registration shall not
26 practice dentistry in a private dental office or private dental clinic; provided, however, that a full-
27 time faculty member may participate in, and only in, an intramural group dental practice which is
28 operated, managed and physically located within a nonprofit dental educational or research
29 institution and their affiliated hospitals in which the full-time faculty member is employed.
30 (c) Upon the completion of 10 years of practice under any original or renewal license
