6 specifically designated to be credited to the fund; (ii) funds from public and private sources,
7 including, but not limited to, gifts, grants and donations; and (iii) any interest earned on the
8 assets of the fund. Amounts credited to the fund shall be expended, subject to appropriation, in
9 grants to eligible non-regional school districts for transportation costs, including but not limited
10 to the purchase and maintenance of buses, fuel costs and driver salaries. Amounts credited to the
11 fund shall be made available for expenditure upon their certification pursuant to section 5I. The

14 (b) There shall be a committee to oversee the fund established in subsection (a). The
15 committee shall consist of 11 members to be appointed by the commissioner of elementary and
16 secondary education, 8 of whom shall be representatives from regional and non-regional school
17 districts, and 3 of whom shall be representatives of the department of elementary and secondary
18 education. The committee shall ensure the fair and transparent allocation of funds through a
19 grant program to eligible non-regional school districts.
20 (c) Eligible non-regional school districts may apply for grants from the fund to cover a
21 portion of their transportation-related expenses. A non-regional school district shall be eligible to
22 apply for a grant from the fund if its transportation costs per pupil exceed 125 per cent of the
23 average transportation costs per pupil in the commonwealth, as determined by the department of
24 elementary and secondary education. The committee may grant a school district up to 40 per cent
25 of the excess between the school district’s transportation costs per pupil and the average

35 transportation challenges. Annually, not later than June 30, the department shall submit a report
