MAURA T. HEALEY KIMBERLEY DRISCOLL
GOVERNOR LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR
January 22, 2025
To the Honorable Senate and House of Representatives,
I am filing for your consideration a bill entitled “An Act Making Appropriations for
Fiscal Year 2025 (FY25) to Provide for Supplementing Certain Existing Appropriations and for
Certain Other Activities and Projects.”
The proposal filed today would allocate $1.32 billion gross in excess income surtax
collections from fiscal year 2023 and 2024.
Our administration is committed to using these voter-approved dollars to support
transformational investments in our transportation and education systems. When combined with
our House 1 budget, this bill will make historic investments in our public transportation system,
enabling $8 billion in new infrastructure investments over the next 10 years, stabilizing the
MBTA, supporting the transportation workforce, and providing needed resources to
municipalities and regional and local transit providers. Our investments in education will help
create an education to workforce pipeline through investments in our career technical education
institutions, reducing waitlists for our English for Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL) services,
and expanding successful state programs like early college and innovation pathways under our
Reimagining High School Initiative. Education investments will compliment House 1 budget
proposals to advance major initiatives in early education and support for cities and towns.
In total, this legislation proposes to appropriate $857.5 million toward our transportation
system and $462.5 million for education.
For transportation, this supplemental budget would allocate:
$780 million for the MBTA, including:
1 of 3

$400 million for a safety and workforce reserve dedicated to responding to Federal
Transit Administration findings and implementing solutions
$300 million to replenish the MBTA’s reserves to ensure operational sustainability
$67 million for the continued ramp up of the income-eligible fare relief program, which
began in September 2024 and has now surpassed 30,000 eligible participants
$13 million to reimburse the MBTA for mitigation efforts to support commuters and
riders during the Sumner Tunnel closure
$52.5 million for the Massachusetts Department of Transportation, including:
$25 million for a Winter Resiliency Assistance Program to support local cities and towns
to prepare for winter storm events
$17.5 million for a workforce and capital project delivery reserve to enable MassDOT to
deliver more projects, programs, and technical assistance to local and regional partners
$10 million for microtransit and last mile grants to improve mobility choices for
underserved communities and people across the state
$25 million for the Regional Transit Authorities for workforce and training initiatives
For education, this supplemental budget would also allocate:
$150 million to support special education circuit breaker reimbursements in FY26, fully
meeting our commitment to the Student Opportunity Act
$150 million to increase capacity in our early education and care system, including $50
million to expand the Commonwealth Preschool Partnership Initiative and continue down the
path towards universal Pre-K
$75 million for grants to our career and technical education institutions to expand
capacity and reduce waitlists
$32.5 million for the Reimagining High School Initiative, including expansions for early
college and innovation pathways programs
$30 million to better coordinate and address the growing waitlist for ESOL services with
an emphasis on vocational learning
$25 million for high dosage tutoring
2 of 3

This proposal provides an opportunity for us to put our surtax dollars to work in ways
that substantially improve the lives of our residents, businesses and communities. I look forward
to working with you on these transformative proposals and helping Massachusetts become an
even better place to live.
Respectfully submitted,
Maura T. Healey,
Governor
