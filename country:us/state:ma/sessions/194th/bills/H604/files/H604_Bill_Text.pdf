1 SECTION 1. There shall be included in the 2025-2026 school year curriculum and all
2 subsequent curriculums learning, discussion, and exploration into the history of APIDA
3 individuals, and their history relating to the United States. This instruction of both local and

5 the US population as a whole. This instruction may be modified to fit the needs of an individual
6 community but must fully comply with the criteria detailed in Section 4.
7 SECTION 2. There shall be established and set up on the books of the commonwealth a

12 fund: (i) funds from public and private sources such as gifts, grants and donations to further
13 APIDA history education; (ii) revenue from fines imposed for a hate crime or civil rights
14 violation pursuant to section 37 or section 39 of chapter 265; and (iv) interest earned on money
15 in the fund.
16 SECTION 3. Chapter 71 of the General Laws is hereby amended by adding the following

34 publicly funded schools and school districts, with particular attention to the study of the
35 achievements of APIDA people; (ii) address how the history and patterns of prejudice and racism
36 have impacted APIDA people; and (iii) reject the targeting of a APIDA populations and other
37 forms of prejudice that can lead to systemic racism in an effort to be more anti-racist.
38 (e) The Massachusetts Association of School Superintendents and the Department of
39 Elementary and Secondary Education shall assist schools in providing instruction on the history
40 of APIDA people by facilitating access to high-quality curricular materials.
41 (f) The Department of Elementary and Secondary Education will provide training for
42 educators in the teaching of APIDA history in person or through the use of synchronous audio,
43 video, electronic media, or other telecommunications technology.

45 instruction in every year of elementary, middle school, and high school; provided, however, that
46 APIDA history education and instruction shall be utilized during appropriate times in
47 elementary, middle, and high school curricula, as determined by the local school district and in
48 conjunction with state curricular standards.
49 SECTION 4. The Department of Elementary and Secondary Education shall annually
50 assess whether each district is meeting the updated curricular standards with APIDA history set
51 by the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education; if they assess that they are not
52 already meeting the curricular standards, each district superintendent shall be expected to work
3 of 4

53 with their history and social science departments to improve their curriculum to meet the
54 standards. To do so, they may use funds provided by the APIDA History Education Trust Fund.
55 SECTION 5. Sections 1, 2, and 4 shall take effect for the school year beginning after July
