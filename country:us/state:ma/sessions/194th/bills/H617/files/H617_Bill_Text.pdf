Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives in General Court assembled, and by the authority

1 There shall be an educational mandate task force to review existing state mandates placed
2 on public schools and districts in the Commonwealth. The task force shall consist of 11
3 members: the house and senate chairs of the joint committee on education, or their designees,
4 who shall serve as the co-chairs of the task force; a member of the general court appointed by the
5 senate minority leader; a member of the general court appointed by the house minority leader;
6 the commissioner of elementary and secondary education, or a designee; and 6 persons to be
7 appointed by the secretary of education, 1 of whom shall be selected from a list of 3 persons
8 nominated by the Massachusetts Association of School Superintendents, 1 of whom shall be
9 selected from a list of 3 persons nominated by the Massachusetts Association of School
10 Committees, 1 of whom shall be selected from a list of 3 persons nominated by the
1 of 2

11 Massachusetts Association of School Business Officials, 1 of whom shall be selected from a list
12 of 3 persons nominated by the Massachusetts Secondary School Administrators’ Association, 1
13 of whom shall be selected from a list of 3 persons nominated by the Massachusetts Elementary
14 School Principals’ Association, and 1 of whom shall be selected from a list of 3 persons
15 nominated by the Massachusetts Administrators of Special Education.
16 The task force shall: (i) identify and review the state laws, regulations, and administrative
17 directives that prescribe requirements for school districts, including those that require school
18 districts to prepare and submit reports and data to the department of elementary and secondary
19 education; (ii) identify the state laws that require the department of elementary and secondary
20 education to submit reports to the legislature based on information it must obtain from school
21 districts; and (iii) develop recommendations to streamline, consolidate, or eliminate such
22 mandates or reporting requirements that are outdated, or duplicative of or inconsistent with
23 current laws, regulations or practices. In developing its recommendations, the task force shall
24 consider the feasibility of creating a single master reporting form to prevent duplicate
25 information from being reported by school districts more than once yearly. Such
26 recommendations shall also include a process for ensuring that new state laws or regulations do
27 not duplicate existing reporting requirements.
28 The first meeting of the task force shall take place within 60 days of the effective date of
29 this act. The task force shall file a report containing its findings and recommendations, including
30 legislative recommendations, if any, with the clerks of the house and senate not later than 12
31 months following the first meeting of the task force. Prior to issuing its recommendations, the
32 task force shall conduct at least one public hearing to receive testimony from members of the
33 public.
