An Act relative to equitable accelerated learning opportunities for public school students.
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives in General Court assembled, and by the authority
of the same, as follows:
1 Section 1B of Chapter 69 of the General Laws as appearing in the 2020 Official Edition
2 is hereby amended by inserting after the 25th paragraph the following paragraphs:
3 “The board of elementary and secondary education shall establish regulations regarding,
4 in the K-12 public schools of the Commonwealth, the use of whole-grade and content-specific
5 academic acceleration designed to match the level, complexity, and pace of instruction of the
6 curriculum to the readiness and motivation of the student; enabling accelerated students to
7 master knowledge and skills, as they may be capable, at a rate faster or at an age earlier than the
8 typical age-average student. Said regulations shall authorize, provide a framework, and direct
9 school districts to provide access to appropriate curriculum, instruction and pacing for students
10 who demonstrate readiness for academic content, skills or understanding at a level beyond the
11 curriculum ordinarily taught to students of a certain age.
1 of 3
12 To ensure equity in education, the acceleration regulations established pursuant to this
13 section shall direct that schools evaluate all children to determine the need for acceleration
14 accommodations, not only those students recommended for acceleration by teachers and parents.
15 Said regulations shall require the use of screening assessments, and an evaluation tool designed
16 to take personal bias out of the decision-making process when considering a child for
17 acceleration; and to ensure that acceleration decisions are evidence-based, systematic,
18 thoughtful, well-reasoned, and defensible. Such regulations shall require that any determination
19 made regarding acceleration accommodations for a student shall be documented in a written
20 acceleration plan including, at a minimum, relevant academic and social-emotional supports.
21 Said written acceleration plan shall be implemented by administrators, counselors, and
22 teachers. All districts shall provide professional development for educators to ensure a
23 supportive environment for accelerated students and document it in their plans pursuant to
24 Chapter 71 Section 38Q . The Department of Elementary and Secondary Education shall
25 develop and make available professional development and other assistance for implementation of
26 acceleration plans.
27 In developing said regulations, the department shall consider, at a minimum, the
28 following acceleration strategies:
29 Single subject acceleration;
30 Combined classes (multi-age);
31 Online courses and open educational resources;
32 Concurrent or dual enrollment, and early college;
2 of 3
33 Curriculum compacting;
34 Credit by examination or prior experience;
35 Credit toward graduation requirements for high-school level courses taken during
36 elementary and middle school
37 Competency/mastery-based learning and advancement;
38 Whole-grade acceleration (one or more);
39 Self-paced instruction;
40 Mentoring;
41 Early entrance to first grade;
42 Early graduation”
