17 whether there are disparate expenditures reported related to capital projects involving vocational-
18 technical or agricultural schools and comparable capital projects involving comprehensive high
19 schools. As part of the study, the office shall, as needed, consult with the department of
20 elementary and secondary education, the department of labor and workforce development as
21 relates to current labor rates in the construction industry, the department of agricultural resources
