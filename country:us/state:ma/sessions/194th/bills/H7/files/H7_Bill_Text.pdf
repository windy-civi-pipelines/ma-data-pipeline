5 Section 20. Notwithstanding any general or special law to the contrary, the comptroller,

8 quality acceptable for internal control systems in operation throughout the various state agencies

13 readily accessible in accordance with internal control guidelines established by the office of the
14 comptroller.
15 Within each agency there shall be an official, equivalent in title or rank to an assistant or
16 deputy to the department head, whose responsibility, in addition to his regularly assigned duties,
17 shall be to ensure that the agency has written documentation of its internal control system on file.
18 Said official shall, annually, or more often as conditions warrant, evaluate the effectiveness of
19 the agency's internal control system and establish and implement changes necessary to ensure
20 that: (1) the documentation of all internal control systems is readily available for examination by
21 the comptroller, the secretary of administration and finance and the state auditor, (2) the results
22 of audits and recommendations to improve departmental internal controls are promptly evaluated
23 by the agency management, (3) timely and appropriate corrective actions are effected by the

25 management as necessary to correct or otherwise resolve matters will be addressed by the agency
26 in their budgetary request to the general court.
27 The comptroller shall prepare and update from time to time a training program, which the
28 office shall publish on its official website, a program which shall provide a general introduction
29 and training on the requirements of this section.

34 intentional violation of general laws governing commonwealth financial system operations and
2 of 3

35 controls, or thefts of funds or property shall be immediately reported to the state auditor's office,
36 who shall review the matter. Said auditor shall consider the materiality, risk, and nature of the
37 matter reported, as well as the nature and extent of past reports involving the entity, to determine
38 the level of review. Should a formal review be initiated, said auditor shall report to appropriate
39 management and law enforcement officials a determination of the amount involved and the
40 internal control weakness that contributed to or caused the condition. Said auditor shall then
41 make recommendations to the agency official overseeing the internal control system and other
42 appropriate management officials. The recommendations of said auditor shall address the
43 correction of the conditions found and the necessary internal control policies and procedures that
44 must be modified. The agency oversight official and the appropriate management officials shall
45 immediately implement policies and procedures necessary to prevent a recurrence of the
46 problems identified.
