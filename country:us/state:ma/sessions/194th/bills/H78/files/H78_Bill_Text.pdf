6 (a) As used in this chapter, unless the context otherwise requires:
7 (1) “Affiliate” means a legal entity that shares common branding with another legal entity
8 or controls, is controlled by or is under common control with another legal entity. For the
9 purposes of this subdivision, “control” and “controlled” mean:

11 of any class of voting security of a company;
12 (B) control in any manner over the election of a majority of the directors or of individuals
13 exercising similar functions; or
14 (C) the power to exercise controlling influence over the management of a company.
15 (2) “Affirmative Consent” means a clear affirmative act signifying a consumer's freely
16 given, specific, informed and unambiguous authorization for an act or practice after having been
17 informed, in response to a specific request from a controller, provided that:
18 (A) the request is provided to the consumer in a clear and conspicuous stand-alone
19 disclosure;
20 (B) the request includes a description of the processing purpose for which the consumer’s
21 consent is sought and:
22 (1) clearly distinguishes between an act or practice that is necessary to fulfill a request of
23 the consumer and an act or practice that is for another purpose;
24 (2) clearly states the specific categories of personal data that the controller intends to
25 collect, process, or transfer under each act or practice; and
26 (3) is written in easy-to-understand language and includes a prominent heading that
27 would enable a reasonable consumer to identify and understand each act or practice;

29 (D) the request is made in a manner reasonably accessible to and usable by consumers
30 with disabilities;

32 (F) the request is made available to the consumer in each language in which the controller
33 provides a product or service for which authorization is sought;
34 (G) the option to refuse to give consent is at least as prominent as the option to give
35 consent and the option to refuse to give consent takes the same number of steps or fewer as the
36 option to give consent; and
37 (H) affirmative consent to an act or practice is not inferred from the inaction of the
38 consumer or the consumer's continued use of a service or product provided by the controller.
39 “Affirmative Consent” does not include:
40 (A) acceptance of a general or broad terms of use or similar document that contains
41 descriptions of personal data processing along with other, unrelated information;

336 Deregulation Act of 1978, 49 USC 41713, as said acts may be amended from time to time.
337 (c) Controllers and processors that comply with the verifiable parental consent
338 requirements of COPPA shall be deemed compliant with any obligation to obtain parental
339 consent pursuant to this chapter.
340 Section 4. Consumer rights.
341 (a) A consumer shall have the right to:
342 (1) Confirm whether or not a controller is collecting or processing the consumer's
343 personal data and access such personal data;
18 of 45

344 (2) obtain from a controller a list of specific third parties, other than natural persons, to
345 which the controller has transferred either (i) the consumer’s personal data; or (ii) any personal
346 data;
347 (3) correct inaccuracies in the consumer's personal data, taking into account the nature of
348 the personal data and the purposes of the processing of the consumer's personal data, and instruct
349 a controller or processor to make reasonable efforts to notify all third parties or processors to
350 which the controller has transferred such personal data of such corrections;
351 (4) delete personal data provided by, or obtained about, the consumer, including personal
352 data the consumer provided to the controller, personal data the controller obtained from another
353 source, and derived data and instruct a controller or processor to make reasonable efforts to
354 notify all third parties or processors to which the controller has transferred such personal data of
355 such deletion request;
356 (5) obtain a copy of the consumer's personal data collected or processed by the controller,
357 in a portable and, to the extent technically feasible, readily usable format that allows the
358 consumer to transmit the data to another controller without hindrance, where the processing is
359 carried out by automated means; and
360 (6) opt out of the collection and processing of the personal data for purposes of
361 (A) targeted advertising;
362 (B) the transfer of personal data; or
363 (C) profiling in furtherance of solely automated decisions that produce legal or similarly
364 significant effects concerning the consumer.
19 of 45

365 (b) A consumer may exercise rights under this section by a secure and reliable means
366 established by the controller and described to the consumer in the controller's privacy notice. A
367 consumer may designate an authorized agent in accordance with section 5 of this act to exercise
368 the rights of such consumer specified in this section on behalf of the consumer. In the case of
369 personal data of a known child, the parent or legal guardian may exercise such consumer rights
370 on the child's behalf. In the case of personal data concerning a consumer subject to a
371 guardianship, conservatorship or other protective arrangement, the guardian or the conservator of
372 the consumer may exercise such rights on the consumer's behalf.
373 (c) Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, a controller shall comply with a request
374 by a consumer to exercise the consumer rights authorized pursuant to said sections as follows:
375 (1) A controller shall respond to the consumer without undue delay, but not later than
376 forty-five days after receipt of the request. The controller may extend the response period by
377 twenty additional days when reasonably necessary, considering the complexity and number of
378 the consumer's requests, provided the controller informs the consumer of any such extension
379 within the initial forty-five-day response period and of the reason for the extension.
380 (2) If a controller declines to take action regarding the consumer's request, the controller
381 shall inform the consumer without undue delay, but not later than forty-five days after receipt of
382 the request, of the justification for declining to take action and instructions for how to appeal the
383 decision.
384 (3) Information provided in response to a consumer request shall be provided by a
385 controller, free of charge, twice per consumer during any twelve-month period. If requests from
386 a consumer are manifestly unfounded, excessive or repetitive, the controller may charge the
20 of 45

387 consumer a reasonable fee to cover the administrative costs of complying with the request or
388 decline to act on the request. The controller bears the burden of demonstrating the manifestly
389 unfounded, excessive or repetitive nature of the request.
390 (4) If a controller is unable to authenticate a request to exercise any of the rights afforded
391 under subdivisions (1) to (5), inclusive, of subsection (a) of this section using commercially
392 reasonable efforts, the controller shall not be required to comply with a request to initiate an
393 action pursuant to this section and shall provide notice to the consumer that the controller is
394 unable to authenticate the request to exercise such right or rights until such consumer provides
395 additional information reasonably necessary to authenticate such consumer and such consumer's
396 request to exercise such right or rights, provided that any such information may not be used for
397 any purposes other than the authentication of such consumer. A controller shall not require
398 authentication to exercise an opt-out request, but a controller may deny an opt-out request if the
399 controller has a good faith, reasonable and documented belief that such request is fraudulent. If a
400 controller denies an opt-out request because the controller believes such request is fraudulent, the
401 controller shall send a notice to the person who made such request disclosing that such controller
402 believes such request is fraudulent, why such controller believes such request is fraudulent and
403 that such controller shall not comply with such request.
404 (5) A controller that has obtained personal data about a consumer from a source other
405 than the consumer shall be deemed in compliance with a consumer's request to delete such data
406 pursuant to subdivision (4) of subsection (a) of this section by deleting the consumer’s personal
407 data retained by the controller and retaining a record of the deletion request and the minimum
408 data necessary for the purpose of ensuring the consumer's personal data remains deleted from the
21 of 45

409 controller's records and not using such retained data for any other purpose pursuant to this
410 chapter.
411 (d) A controller shall establish a process for a consumer to appeal the controller's refusal
412 to take action on a request within a reasonable period of time after the consumer's receipt of the
413 decision. The appeal process shall be conspicuously available and similar to the process for
414 submitting requests to initiate action pursuant to this section. Not later than sixty days after
415 receipt of an appeal, a controller shall inform the consumer in writing of any action taken or not
416 taken in response to the appeal, including a written explanation of the reasons for the decisions.
417 If the appeal is denied, the controller shall also provide the consumer with an online mechanism,
418 if available, or other method through which the consumer may contact the Attorney General to
419 submit a complaint.
420 (e) A controller may not condition, effectively condition, attempt to condition, or attempt
421 to effectively condition the exercise of a right described in this section through—
422 (1) the use of any false, fictitious, fraudulent, or materially misleading statement or
423 representation; or
424 (2) the use of dark patterns.
425 (f) A controller or processor may not collect, process, or transfer personal data in a
426 manner that discriminates against an individual or class of individuals, or otherwise makes
427 unavailable the equal enjoyment of goods or services, on the basis of an individual's or class of
428 individuals’ actual or perceived race, color, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, disability,
429 religion, genetic information, pregnancy or condition related to pregnancy, status as a veteran,
430 ancestry or national origin, or any other basis protected by chapter 151B.
22 of 45

431 (g) Subsection (f) does not apply to:
432 (1) The collection, processing, or transfer of personal data for the sole purpose of:
433 (A) A controller or processor’s self-testing to prevent or mitigate unlawful discrimination
434 or otherwise to ensure compliance with state or federal law; or
435 (B) Diversifying an applicant, participant or customer pool; or
436 (2) A private establishment, as described in 42 United States Code, Section 2000a(e).
437 Section 5. Authorized agent.
438 A consumer may designate another person to serve as the consumer's authorized agent,
439 and act on such consumer's behalf, to exercise rights specified in subsection (a) of section 4 of
440 this act. A controller shall comply with a request received from an authorized agent if the
441 controller is able to verify, with commercially reasonable effort, the identity of the consumer and
442 the authorized agent's authority to act on such consumer's behalf.
443 Section 6. Actions of controllers.
444 (a) A controller shall:
445 (1) Limit the collection, processing, and transfer of personal data to what is reasonably
446 necessary to provide or maintain:
447 (A) a specific product or service requested by the consumer to whom the data pertains
448 including any routine administrative, operational, or account-servicing activity, such as billing,
449 shipping, delivery, storage, or accounting; or
23 of 45

450 (B) a communication, that is not an advertisement, by the controller to the consumer
451 reasonably anticipated within the context of the relationship between the controller and the
452 consumer.
453 Except with respect to sensitive data, a controller may process or transfer personal data
454 collected under this subsection to provide first-party advertising or targeted advertising;
455 provided, however, that this paragraph does not permit the processing or transfer of personal data
456 for targeted advertising to a consumer who has opted out of such advertising pursuant to section
457 4, 5, or 6, or to a consumer under circumstances where the controller has knowledge, or willfully
458 disregards, that the consumer is a minor;
459 (2) not collect, process, or transfer sensitive data concerning a consumer except when
460 such collection, processing, or transfer is strictly necessary to provide or maintain a specific
461 product or service requested by the consumer to whom the sensitive data pertains;
462 (3) not sell sensitive data;
463 (4) establish, implement and maintain reasonable administrative, technical and physical
464 data security practices to protect the confidentiality, integrity and accessibility of personal data
465 appropriate to the volume and nature of the personal data at issue, including disposing of
466 personal data in accordance with a retention schedule that requires the deletion of personal data
467 when the data is required to be deleted by law or is no longer necessary for the purpose for which
468 the data was collected, processed, or transferred;
469 (5) not transfer sensitive data concerning a consumer without obtaining the consumer's
470 affirmative consent, or, in the case of the collection or processing of personal data concerning a
471 known child, without collecting or processing such data in accordance with COPPA;
24 of 45

472 (6) provide an effective mechanism for a consumer to revoke the consumer's affirmative
473 consent under this chapter that is at least as easy as the mechanism by which the consumer
474 provided the consumer's affirmative consent and, upon revocation of such affirmative consent,
475 cease to process the data as soon as practicable, but not later than fifteen days after the receipt of
476 such request;
477 (7) not process the personal data of a consumer for purposes of targeted advertising, or
478 sell the consumer's personal data, under circumstances where a controller has actual knowledge,
479 or willfully disregards, that the consumer is a minor; and
480 (8) not discriminate or retaliate against a consumer for exercising any of the consumer
481 rights contained in this chapter, or for refusing to agree to the collection or processing of
482 personal data for a separate product or service, including denying goods or services, charging
483 different prices or rates for goods or services or providing a different level of quality of goods or
484 services to the consumer.
485 (b) Nothing in paragraph (8) of subsection (a) shall be construed to require a controller to
486 provide a product or service that requires the personal data of a consumer which the controller
487 does not collect or maintain, or prohibit a controller from offering a different price, rate, level,
488 quality or selection of goods or services to a consumer, including offering goods or services for
489 no fee, if the offering is in connection with a consumer's voluntary participation in a financial
490 incentive program such as a bona fide loyalty, rewards, premium features, discounts or club card
491 program, provided that the controller may not transfer personal data to a third party as part of
492 such program unless:
25 of 45

493 (1) The transfer is functionally necessary to enable the third party to provide a benefit to
494 which the consumer is entitled;
495 (2) the transfer of personal data to the third party is clearly disclosed in the terms of the
496 program; and
497 (3) the third party uses the personal data only for purposes of facilitating a benefit to
498 which the consumer is entitled and does not process or transfer the personal data for any other
499 purpose.
500 The sale of personal data shall not be considered functionally necessary to provide a
501 financial incentive program. A controller shall not use financial incentive practices that are
502 unjust, unreasonable, coercive or usurious in nature.
503 (c) A controller shall provide consumers with a reasonably accessible, clear and
504 meaningful privacy notice that includes:
505 (1) The categories of personal data collected and processed by the controller, including a
506 separate list of categories of sensitive data collected and processed by the controller, described in
507 a level of detail that provides consumers a meaningful understanding of the type of personal data
508 collected or processed;
509 (2) the purpose for collecting and processing each category of personal data the controller
510 collects or processes described in a way that gives consumers a meaningful understanding of
511 how each category of their personal data will be use;
512 (3) how consumers may exercise their consumer rights, including how a consumer may
513 appeal a controller's decision with regard to the consumer's request;
26 of 45

514 (4) the categories of personal data that the controller transfers to third parties, if any, and
515 the purposes for those transfers;
516 (5) the categories of third parties, if any, to which the controller transfers personal data;
517 (6) The length of time the controller intends to retain each category of personal data, or, if
518 it is not possible to identify the length of time, the criteria used to determine the length of time
519 the controller intends to retain categories of personal data; and
520 (7) an active electronic mail address or other online mechanism that the consumer may
521 use to contact the controller.
522 The privacy notice shall be provided directly to consumers and made available online to
523 the general public. If a controller makes a material change to its privacy notice, the controller
524 shall notify each consumer affected by the material change before implementing the material
525 change with respect to prospectively collected personal data and provide a reasonable
526 opportunity for each consumer to withdraw consent. A controller should provide a reasonable
527 opportunity for each consumer to affirmatively consent to further materially different processing
528 or transfer of previously collected personal data under the changed policy. The controller shall
529 take all reasonable electronic measures to provide direct notification regarding material changes
530 to the privacy notice to each affected consumer, taking into account available technology and the
531 nature of the relationship.
532 (d) If a controller sells personal data to third parties or processes personal data for
533 targeted advertising, the controller shall clearly and conspicuously disclose such sales or
534 processing, as well as the manner in which a consumer may exercise the right to opt out of such
535 sales or processing.
27 of 45

536 (e) A controller shall establish, and shall describe in a privacy notice, one or more secure
537 and reliable means for consumers to submit a request to exercise their consumer rights pursuant
538 to this chapter. Such means shall take into account the ways in which consumers normally
539 interact with the controller, the need for secure and reliable communication of such requests and
540 the ability of the controller to verify the identity of the consumer making the request. A
541 controller shall not require a consumer to create a new account in order to exercise consumer
542 rights, but may require a consumer to use an existing account. Any such means shall include:
543 (1) Providing a clear and conspicuous link on the controller's Internet web site to an
544 Internet web page that enables a consumer, or an agent of the consumer, to opt out of the targeted
545 advertising, the sale of the consumer's personal data, and profiling in furtherance of solely
546 automated decisions that produce legal or similarly significant effects concerning the consumer;
547 and
548 (2) Not later than 18 months after the effective date of this chapter, allowing a consumer
549 to opt out of any collection or processing of the consumer's personal data for the purposes of
550 targeted advertising, or any sale of the consumer’s personal data, through an opt-out preference
551 signal sent, with such consumer's consent, by a platform, technology or mechanism to the
552 controller indicating such consumer's intent to opt out of any such processing or sale. Such
553 platform, technology or mechanism shall:
554 (i) Be consumer-friendly and easy to use by the average consumer; and
555 (ii) Enable the controller to reasonably determine whether the consumer is a resident of
556 this state and whether the consumer has made a legitimate request to opt out of any sale of such
557 consumer's personal data or targeted advertising. For purposes of this subsection, the use of an
28 of 45

558 internet protocol address to estimate the consumer’s location shall be considered sufficient to
559 reasonably determine residency.
560 If a consumer's decision to opt out of any processing of the consumer's personal data for
561 the purposes of targeted advertising, or any sale of personal data, through an opt-out preference
562 signal sent in accordance with the provisions of this subsection conflicts with the consumer's
563 existing controller-specific privacy setting or voluntary participation in a controller's financial
564 incentive program, the controller shall comply with such consumer's opt-out preference signal
565 but may notify such consumer of such conflict and provide to such consumer the choice to
566 confirm such controller-specific privacy setting or participation in such program.
567 (f) If a controller responds to consumer opt‐out requests received pursuant to subsection
568 (e) of this section by informing the consumer of a change in the price, rate, level, quality, or
569 selection of goods or services, the controller shall present the terms of any financial incentive
570 offered pursuant to subsection (b) of this section for the retention, processing, sale or transfer of
571 the consumer's personal data.
572 Section 7. Responsibilities of processors and controllers.
573 (a) A processor shall adhere to the instructions of a controller and shall assist the
574 controller in meeting the controller's obligations under this chapter. Such assistance shall
575 include:
576 (1) Taking into account the nature of processing and the information available to the
577 processor, by appropriate technical and organizational measures, insofar as is reasonably
578 practicable, to fulfill the controller's obligation to respond to consumer rights requests;
29 of 45

579 (2) taking into account the nature of processing and the information available to the
580 processor, by assisting the controller in meeting the controller's obligations in relation to the
581 security of processing the personal data and in relation to the notification of a breach of security
582 of the system of the processor, in order to meet the controller's obligations; and
583 (3) providing necessary information to enable the controller to conduct and document
584 data protection assessments.
585 (b) A contract between a controller and a processor shall govern the processor's data
586 processing procedures with respect to processing performed on behalf of the controller. The
587 contract shall be written, binding and clearly set forth instructions for processing data, the nature
588 and purpose of processing, the type of data subject to processing, the duration of processing and
589 the rights and obligations of both parties including a method by which the processor shall notify
590 the covered entity of material changes to its privacy practices. The processor shall adhere to the
591 instructions of the controller and only process and transfer the data it receives from the controller
592 to the extent necessary to provide a service requested by the controller, as set out in the contract.
593 The contract shall also require that the processor:
594 (1) Ensure that each person processing personal data is subject to a duty of confidentiality
595 with respect to the data;
596 (2) at the controller's direction, delete or return all personal data to the controller as
597 requested at the end of the provision of services, unless retention of the personal data is required
598 by law;
30 of 45

599 (3) upon the reasonable request of the controller, make available to the controller all
600 information in its possession necessary to demonstrate the processor's compliance with the
601 obligations in this chapter;
602 (4) after providing the controller an opportunity to object, engage any subcontractor
603 pursuant to a written contract that requires the subcontractor to meet the contractual and statutory
604 or regulatory obligations of the processor with respect to the personal data;
605 (5) be prohibited from combining personal data that the processor receives from or on
606 behalf of a controller with personal data that the processor receives from or on behalf of another
607 person or collects from the interaction of the processor with an individual; and
608 (6) allow, and cooperate with, reasonable assessments by the controller or the controller's
609 designated assessor, or the processor may arrange for a qualified and independent assessor to
610 conduct an assessment of the processor's policies and technical and organizational measures in
611 support of the obligations under this chapter, using an appropriate and accepted control standard
612 or framework and assessment procedure for such assessments. The processor shall provide a
613 report of such assessment to the controller upon request.
614 (c) A processor shall establish, implement and maintain reasonable administrative,
615 technical and physical data security practices to protect the confidentiality, integrity and
616 accessibility of personal data that are consistent with chapter 93H and appropriate to the volume
617 and nature of the personal data at issue.
618 (d) Nothing in the contract in subsection (b) shall relieve a controller or processor from
619 the liabilities imposed on the controller or processor by virtue of such controller's or processor's
620 role in the processing relationship, as described in this chapter.
31 of 45

621 (e) Determining whether a person is acting as a controller or processor with respect to a
622 specific processing of data is a fact-based determination that depends upon the context in which
623 personal data is to be processed. A person who is not limited in such person's processing of
624 personal data pursuant to a controller's instructions, or who fails to adhere to such instructions, is
625 a controller and not a processor with respect to a specific processing of data. A processor that
626 continues to adhere to a controller's instructions with respect to a specific processing of personal
627 data remains a processor. If a processor begins, alone or jointly with others, determining the
628 purposes and means of the processing of personal data, the processor is a controller with respect
629 to such processing and may be subject to an enforcement action under this chapter.
630 (f) A processor shall not process or transfer personal data on the behalf of a controller if
631 the processor has actual knowledge that the controller has violated this chapter with respect to
632 such personal data.
633 Section 8. Data Protection Assessments.
634 (a) A controller shall not conduct processing that presents a heightened risk of harm to a
635 consumer without conducting and documenting a data protection assessment for each of the
636 controller's processing activities that presents such heightened risk of harm to a consumer. For
637 the purposes of this section, processing that presents a heightened risk of harm to a consumer
638 includes:
639 (1) The collection or processing of personal data for the purposes of targeted advertising;
640 (2) the sale of personal data;
32 of 45

641 (3) the processing of personal data for the purposes of profiling, where such profiling
642 presents a reasonably foreseeable risk of:
643 (A) unfair or deceptive treatment of, or unlawful disparate impact on, consumers,
644 (B) financial, physical or reputational injury to consumers,
645 (C) a physical or other intrusion upon the solitude or seclusion, or the private affairs or
646 concerns, of consumers, where such intrusion would be offensive to a reasonable person, or
647 (D) other substantial injury to consumers; and
648 (4) the collection or processing of sensitive data.
649 (b) Data protection assessments conducted pursuant to subsection (a) of this section shall
650 identify the categories of personal data collected, the purposes for collecting such personal data,
651 whether personal data is being transferred, and identify and weigh the benefits that may flow,
652 directly and indirectly, from the processing to the controller, the consumer, other stakeholders
653 and the public against the potential risks to the rights of the consumer associated with such
654 processing, as mitigated by safeguards that are employed by the controller to reduce such risks.
655 The controller shall factor into any such data protection assessment the use of de-identified data
656 and the reasonable expectations of consumers, as well as the context of the processing and the
657 relationship between the controller and the consumer whose personal data will be processed.
658 (c) No later than 30 days after completing a data protection assessment under this section,
659 a controller shall submit a report of the data protection assessment or evaluation to the Attorney
660 General. The report must include a summary of the data protection assessment and the controller
661 shall make the summary publicly available in a place that is easily accessible to consumers.
33 of 45

662 Controllers may redact trade secrets or other confidential or proprietary information from the
663 report. The Attorney General may require that a controller disclose any data protection
664 assessment that is relevant to an investigation conducted by the Attorney General, and the
665 controller shall make the data protection assessment available to the Attorney General. The
666 Attorney General may evaluate the data protection assessment for compliance with the
667 responsibilities set forth in this chapter. To the extent any information contained in a data
668 protection assessment disclosed to the Attorney General includes information subject to attorney-
669 client privilege or work product protection, such disclosure shall not constitute a waiver of such
670 privilege or protection.
671 (d) A single data protection assessment may address a comparable set of processing
672 operations that include similar activities.
673 (e) If a controller conducts a data protection assessment for the purpose of complying
674 with another applicable law or regulation, the data protection assessment shall be deemed to
675 satisfy the requirements established in this section if such data protection assessment is
676 reasonably similar in scope and effect to the data protection assessment that would otherwise be
677 conducted pursuant to this section.
678 (f) A controller shall conduct and document a data protection assessment before initiating
679 a processing activity that presents a heightened risk of harm to a consumer and shall review and
680 update the data protection assessment as often as appropriate considering the type, amount, and
681 sensitivity of personal data collected or processed and level of risk presented by the processing,
682 throughout the processing activity’s lifecycle in order to:
683 (1) monitor for harm caused by the processing and adjust safeguards accordingly; and
34 of 45

684 (2) ensure that data protection and privacy are considered as the controller makes new
685 decisions with respect to the processing.
686 Section 9. De-identified data.
687 (a) Any controller in possession of de-identified data shall:
688 (1) Take technical measures to ensure that the data cannot be associated with an
689 individual;
690 (2) publicly commit to maintaining and using de-identified data without attempting to re-
691 identify the data; and
692 (3) contractually obligate any recipients of the de-identified data to comply with all
693 provisions of this chapter.
694 (b) Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to:
695 (1) Require a controller or processor to re-identify de-identified data; or
696 (2) maintain data in identifiable form, or collect, obtain, retain or access any data or
697 technology, in order to be capable of associating an authenticated consumer request with
698 personal data.
699 (c) Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to require a controller or processor to
700 comply with an authenticated consumer rights request if the controller:
701 (1) Is not reasonably capable of associating the request with the personal data or it would
702 be unreasonably burdensome for the controller to associate the request with the personal data;
703 and
35 of 45

704 (2) does not use the personal data to recognize or respond to the specific consumer who is
705 the subject of the personal data, or associate the personal data with other personal data about the
706 same specific consumer;
707 (d) A controller that transfers de-identified data shall exercise reasonable oversight to
708 monitor compliance with any contractual commitments to which the de-identified data is subject
709 and shall take appropriate steps to address any breaches of those contractual commitments.
710 Section 10. Limitations.
711 (a) Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to restrict a controller's or processor's
712 ability to:
713 (1) Comply with federal, state or municipal ordinances or regulations;
714 (2) comply with a civil, criminal or regulatory inquiry, investigation, subpoena or
715 summons by federal, state, municipal or other governmental authorities;
716 (3) cooperate with law enforcement agencies concerning conduct or activity that the
717 controller or processor reasonably and in good faith believes may violate federal, state or
718 municipal ordinances or regulations;
719 (4) investigate, establish, exercise, prepare for or defend legal claims;

728 harassment, malicious or deceptive activities or any illegal activity targeted at or involving the
729 controller or processor or its services, preserve the integrity or security of systems or investigate,

731 paragraph, “illegal activity” means a violation of a federal, state, or local law punishable as a
732 felony or misdemeanor that can directly harm;
733 (10) engage in public or peer-reviewed scientific, historical, or statistical research in the
734 public interest that adheres to all relevant laws and regulations governing such research, if

737 (A) whether the deletion of personal data requested by a consumer under section 4,
738 subsection (a), subparagraph (4) is likely to provide substantial benefits that do not exclusively
739 accrue to the controller,
740 (B) the expected benefits of the research outweigh the privacy risks, and
741 (C) whether the controller has implemented reasonable safeguards to mitigate privacy
742 risks associated with research, including any risks associated with re-identification;
743 (11) assist another controller, processor or third party with any of the obligations under
744 this chapter;
37 of 45

745 (12) process personal data for reasons of public interest in the area of public health,
746 community health or population health, but solely to the extent that such processing is
747 (A) subject to suitable and specific measures to safeguard the rights of the consumer
748 whose personal data is being processed, and
749 (B) under the responsibility of a professional subject to confidentiality obligations under
750 federal, state or local law;
751 (13) ensure the data security and integrity of personal data as required by this chapter,

755 similar transaction when the third party assumes control, in whole or in part, of the controller’s
756 assets, only if the controller, in a reasonable time prior to the transfer, provides an affected
757 consumer with:
758 (A) A notice describing the transfer, including the name of the entity receiving the
759 consumer’s personal data and the applicable privacy policies of such entity and

767 publication is intended to allow members of the public to contact such member or employee in
768 the ordinary course of the entity’s operations; or

770 the personal data becomes de-identified data, including to:
771 (A) Conduct internal research to develop, improve or repair products, services or
772 technology;
773 (B) identify and repair technical errors that impair existing or intended functionality; or;
774 (C) perform internal operations that are reasonably aligned with the expectations of the
775 consumer or reasonably anticipated based on the consumer's existing relationship with the
776 controller, or are otherwise compatible with processing data in furtherance of the provision of a
777 product or service specifically requested by a consumer or the performance of a contract to
778 which the consumer is a party.
779 (b) The obligations imposed on controllers or processors under this chapter shall not
780 apply where compliance by the controller or processor with said sections would violate an
781 evidentiary privilege under the laws of this state. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to
782 prevent a controller or processor from providing personal data concerning a consumer to a
783 person covered by an evidentiary privilege under the laws of the state as part of a privileged
784 communication.
39 of 45

785 (c) A controller or processor that discloses personal data to a processor or third-party
786 controller in accordance with this chapter shall not be deemed to have violated said sections if
787 the processor or third-party controller that receives and processes such personal data violates said
788 sections, provided, at the time the disclosing controller or processor disclosed such personal data,
789 the disclosing controller or processor did not have actual knowledge that the receiving processor
790 or third-party controller would violate said sections. A third-party controller or processor
791 receiving personal data from a controller or processor in compliance with this chapter is likewise
792 not in violation of said sections for the transgressions of the controller or processor from which
793 such third-party controller or processor receives such personal data.
794 (d) Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to:
795 (1) Impose any obligation on a controller or processor that adversely affects the rights or
796 freedoms of any person, including, but not limited to, the rights of any person to freedom of
797 speech or freedom of the press guaranteed in the First Amendment to the United States
798 Constitution or Article 16 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights;
799 (2) apply to any person's collection or processing of personal data in the course of such
800 person's purely personal or household activities; or
801 (3) for private schools approved under section 1 of chapter 76 and private institutions of
802 higher education as defined by title I of the Higher Education Act of 1965, 20 United States
803 Code, Section 1001 et seq., require deletion of personal data that would unreasonably interfere
804 with the provision of education services by or the ordinary operation of the school or institution.
805 (e) Personal data collected or processed by a controller pursuant to this section may be
806 collected or processed to the extent that such collection and processing is:
40 of 45

807 (1) Reasonably necessary and proportionate to the purposes listed in this section, or, in
808 the case of sensitive data, strictly necessary to the purposes listed in this section;
809 (2) limited to what is necessary in relation to the specific purposes listed in this section.
810 Personal data processed pursuant to subsection (b) of this section shall, where applicable, take
811 into account the nature and purpose or purposes of such processing. Such data shall be subject to
812 reasonable administrative, technical and physical measures to protect the confidentiality,
813 integrity and accessibility of the personal data and to reduce reasonably foreseeable risks of harm
814 to consumers relating to such processing of personal data; and
815 (3) compliant with section 4, subsection (f).
816 (f) If a controller collects or processes personal data pursuant to an exemption in this
817 section, the controller bears the burden of demonstrating that such collection or processing
818 qualifies for the exemption and complies with the requirements in subsection (e) of this section.
819 Section 11. Rulemaking.
820 The Attorney General may adopt rules and regulations to implement this Act.
821 Section 12. Enforcement.
822 (a) The Attorney General may bring a civil action against a controller or processor that
823 violates this chapter to:
824 (1) Enjoin an act or practice that is in violation of this chapter;
825 (2) enforce compliance with this chapter or a rule adopted under this chapter;
41 of 45

826 (3) obtain damages, restitution or other compensation on behalf of the residents of the
827 Commonwealth;
828 (4) impose civil penalties in an amount not less than $15,000 per individual per violation,
829 as adjusted annually to reflect an increase in the Consumer Price Index; or
830 (5) obtain reasonable attorney's fees and other litigation costs, including but not limited to
831 investigative costs and expert fees, reasonably incurred.
832 (b) A violation of this chapter or a rule adopted under this chapter with respect to the
833 personal data of a consumer constitutes an injury to that consumer. The injured consumer may
834 bring a civil action against the party that commits the violation, provided such party is not a
835 small business. In a civil action brought under this subsection in which a plaintiff prevails, the
836 court may award the plaintiff:
837 (1) Damages in an amount not less than $15,000 per individual per violation, as adjusted
838 annually to reflect an increase in the Consumer Price Index, or actual damages, whichever is
839 greater;
840 (2) punitive damages;
841 (3) injunctive relief, including an order that an entity retrieve any personal data
842 transferred in violation of this title;
843 (4) declaratory relief; or
844 (5) reasonable attorney's fees and litigation costs.
42 of 45

845 (c) If the court finds that a defendant has engaged in flagrant, willful, and repeated
846 violations of this chapter in an action brought by the Attorney General pursuant to subsection (a)
847 of this section, the court may issue an order to suspend or prohibit the defendant from operating
848 in the commonwealth in addition to any other remedies under subsection (a) of this section.
849 (d) When calculating awards and civil penalties in any action under this section, the court
850 shall consider:
851 (1) the number of affected individuals and the amount and sensitivity of any personal data
852 at issue;
853 (2) the severity of the violation or noncompliance;
854 (3) the risks caused by the violation or noncompliance;
855 (4) whether the violation or noncompliance was part of a pattern of noncompliance and
856 violations and not an isolated instance;
857 (5) whether the violation or noncompliance was willful and not the result of error;
858 (6) the precautions taken by the defendant to prevent a violation;
859 (7) the number of administrative actions, lawsuits, settlements, and consent-decrees under
860 this chapter involving the defendant;
861 (8) the number of administrative actions, lawsuits, settlements, and consent-decrees
862 involving the defendant in other states and at the federal level in issues involving information
863 privacy; and
864 (9) the international record of the defendant when it comes to information privacy issues.
43 of 45

865 (e) A violation of the requirements of this chapter constitutes an unfair or deceptive
866 practice in the conduct of trade or commerce for the purposes of chapter 93A.
867 (f) Any provision of a contract or agreement of any kind, including but not limited to a
868 controller’s terms of service or a privacy policy that purports to waive or limit in any way an
869 individual’s rights under this chapter, including but not limited to any right to a remedy or means
870 of enforcement, shall be deemed contrary to public policy and shall be void and unenforceable.
871 (g) No private or government action brought pursuant to this chapter shall preclude any
872 other action under this chapter.
873 Section 13. Relationship to Other Laws
874 (a) Nothing in this chapter shall diminish any individual’s rights or obligations under
875 chapters 66A, 93A, 93H, or under sections 1B or 3B of chapter 214.
876 Section 14. Targeted Advertising to Minors
877 A controller shall not engage in targeted advertising or first-party advertising to a
878 consumer if the controller knows or willfully disregards the fact that the consumer is a minor.
879 Section 15. Additional Protections for Location Information
880 (a) With respect to precise geolocation data that reveals that an individual or a device that
881 identifies or is linked or reasonably linkable to 1 or more individuals is presently in or was in the
882 Commonwealth of Massachusetts:
44 of 45

883 (1) an individual shall have the same rights, privileges, and protections as a consumer
884 under this chapter for all such precise location data that is linked or reasonably linkable to that
885 individual or a device associated with that individual; and
886 (2) a controller shall treat such precise geolocation data in the same manner as it
887 would the precise geolocation data of a consumer under this chapter.
888 Section 16. Deadlines for certain actions.
889 The first data protection assessments required by section 8 are required to be completed
890 not later than the first anniversary of the effective date of this Act.
891 Section 17. Effective date.
892 This Act takes effect 180 days after enactment.
