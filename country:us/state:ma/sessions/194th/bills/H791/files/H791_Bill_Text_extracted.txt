_______________
An Act relative to assisted living and the frail elder waiver.
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives in General Court assembled, and by the authority
of the same, as follows:
1 SECTION 1. Notwithstanding any general or special law to the contrary, the executive
2 office of health and human services shall, not later than 90 days after the effective date of this
3 act, pursue and submit applications for new state plan amendments, state plan options or state
4 plan waiver or demonstration requests for federal approval that will establish an assisted living
5 service to allow individuals qualifying for Medicaid and at risk of entering a nursing home to
6 reside in a certified assisted living residence; provided, however, that the average daily rate
7 developed for such service, when combined with the average daily benefit assistance provided by
8 the Supplemental Security Income program inclusive of the state supplementary payment
9 program authorized under section 131 of chapter 6 of the General Laws and chapter 118A of the
10 General Laws, shall not exceed 80 per cent of the cost of substantially similar institutional care
11 for the equivalent waiver year as demonstrated by the Factor G value of Appendix J of the
12 current MassHealth frail elder home and community-based services waiver, 0059.R08.00;
13 provided further, that MassHealth shall implement a rate schedule for such assisted living service
1 of 3
14 that uses disproportionate share payment methodologies to ensure equal economic access to the
15 assisted living care setting for long-term care services and supports when measured with
16 consideration for the level of access that MassHealth members have for institutional services.
17 SECTION 2. The executive office of health and human services shall, not later than 120
18 days after the effective date of this act, report to the house and senate committees on ways and
19 means on the status of submitted and pending applications described in section 1 and the
20 projected fiscal impact to the commonwealth of federal approval for such applications. The
21 report shall include, but not be limited to, comment on the deliberations and decisions regarding:
22 (i) amending the current MassHealth frail elder waiver to include assisted living services as a
23 new waiver service in a manner comparable to how the District of Columbia Medicaid program
24 has delivered services to members residing in assisted living settings; (ii) implementing a new
25 home and community-based services waiver under section 1915(c) of the Social Security Act for
26 the sole purpose of establishing assisted living services as an option for MassHealth members in
27 a manner comparable to how the Ohio Medicaid program has delivered services to members
28 residing in assisted living settings; and (iii) enabling assisted living as a setting of choice for
29 MassHealth members participating in managed care programs with reference to “in lieu of
30 services and setting” authority as enabled by 42 C.F.R. 435.3(e)(2) in a manner comparable to
31 how the California Medicaid program has delivered services to members residing in assisted
32 living settings.
33 SECTION 3. The executive office of aging and independence shall, not later than 180
34 days after the effective date of this act, report to the joint committee on elder affairs on the
35 current structural, organizational or cultural barriers that are experienced by MassHealth
36 members and such members’ potential to reside at an assisted living residence that is located
2 of 3
37 within their community. The report shall include, but not be limited to, particular consideration
38 of residents within qualified census tracts or difficult development areas and such residents’
39 ability and likelihood to access assisted living residences in comparison to their ability and
40 likelihood to access nursing facility services.
