6 nomination papers for such committees with the state secretary, or are newly registered voters in
7 their city or town enrolled in that political party and have not been enrolled in another political
8 party during the year preceding such last day for filing nomination papers. Ward and town
9 committee members shall hold office for a period of two years ending on the thirtieth day

14 or chosen to fill a vacancy, cancels or changes his party enrollment he shall forthwith cease to be
15 a member of said committee.
16 For the purposes of this chapter, notwithstanding the fact that ward lines in a city have
17 been redistricted subsequent to a biennial state elections or presidential primary, members of
18 ward committees elected from wards in existence at the time of a biennial state elections or

20 elected and organized under the redistricted ward lines at the biennial state elections or

27 Notice of the number of committee members to be elected shall be given by the ward or town
28 committee, as the case may be, to the state secretary on or before August first of the year
29 preceding the year in which said persons are to be elected. In case a ward or town committee
30 fails to fix the number of members of a ward or town committee or to give such notice, the
31 number of members of such ward or town committee to be elected shall be the number of
