The Commonwealth of Massachusetts
_______________
In the One Hundred and Ninety-Fourth General Court
(2025-2026)
_______________
An Act relative to the disclosure of the political party offices campaign contributions.
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives in General Court assembled, and by the authority
of the same, as follows:
1 SECTION 1. The Massachusetts General Laws are hereby amended by inserting the
2 following new chapter:
3 An important part of the political institutions, of our society, and our Commonwealth, are
4 enabled by the creation of political parties, and designations, to provide a vehicle for citizens to
5 engage in organized political actions, to facilitate the recruitment, and candidacy of individuals
6 for office; and to provide mechanisms for developing organized political positions, and
7 platforms.
8 Under the Massachusetts Constitution, the Massachusetts General Laws, and appropriate
9 regulations, flowing from these legal authorities, political parties, are described, and can be
1 of 2

10 established, to enjoy, and access certain legal mechanisms, providing choices to all eligible, and
11 registered voters of The Commonwealth of Massachusetts.
12 While political parties, and designations, have elements of private, and/or semi-private
13 organizations, they also have public, and semi-public elements, and aspects, and so are in
14 important ways, hybrid organizations.
15 Although it is true, that political parties, have elements that have conventionally been
16 regarded as semi-private, they perform in a public arena, and have elements of direct influence,
17 in terms of government, and public policy that influence the residents of various electoral
18 districts, and The Commonwealth of Massachusetts, as a whole.
19 SECTION 2. â€“ It is in the public interest, and has long been established, that an Office of
20 Campaign and Political Finance (OCPF) shall exist, to collect, to report, and to make available,
21 the various sources of contributions, the expenditure of gathered resources; and to monitor,
22 develop, and enforce appropriate legal requirements regarding such matters; in regards to
23 candidates for elections.
24 The evolution of these standards, has been in the direction of efficiency, effectiveness,
25 and public knowledge, which assist broad public purposes of transparency, and understanding.
26 Therefore, this statute defines certain political party offices, such as candidates for state
27 committee members; town committees, ward committees, and city committees, at elections,
28 which are printed on the public ballot, at regular intervals, to be offices, for which such
29 candidates, are required to report all contributions, and all expenditures, relating to campaigns
30 for these offices, according to the reasonable regulations that are established, and may be
31 additionally established, by the Office of Campaign and Political Finance (OCPF).
