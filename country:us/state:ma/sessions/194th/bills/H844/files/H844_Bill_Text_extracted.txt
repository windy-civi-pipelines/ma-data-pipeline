19 "Official", shall mean any person including any election committee for the person who
20 was, at the time of the contribution, an incumbent, candidate or successful candidate for an
21 elective office of a government entity, if the office is directly or indirectly responsible for, or can

30 "Solicitor", shall mean any person who directly or indirectly solicits any client for, or

32 (b) It shall be unlawful:
33 (1) For any investment adviser to provide investment advisory services for compensation

35 entity is made by the investment adviser, any partner, executive officer, or solicitor of the
36 investment adviser, including any person who becomes a partner, executive officer or solicitor
37 within two years after the contribution is made; or any political action committee controlled by

62 the circumstances.
63 (e) A violation of this section shall be punished by a fine of not more than $1,000 or by
64 imprisonment for not more than 6 months or both such fine and imprisonment for both the
65 investment advisor and the government official involved. Each such violation shall constitute a
