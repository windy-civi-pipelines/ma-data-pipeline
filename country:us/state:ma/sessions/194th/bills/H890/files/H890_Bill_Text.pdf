2 section 2EEEEEE the following section:-
3 Section 2FFFFFF. (a) There shall be a Crumbling Concrete Assistance Fund, which shall
4 be administered by the secretary of housing and livable communities. The fund shall be
5 expended, without further appropriation to: (i) provide financial assistance to owners of
6 residential real property for the repair or replacement of concrete foundations of such residential
7 real property that have deteriorated due to the presence of pyrite or pyrrhotite; (ii) minimize
8 negative fiscal impacts on municipalities in which such property is located; and (iii) reimburse
9 the owner of a residential real property that presents satisfactory evidence, as determined by the
10 secretary, that said owner has paid for and replaced their concrete foundation that deteriorated
11 due to the presence of pyrite or pyrrhotite prior to the establishment of the fund; provided,
12 however, that the reimbursement shall not exceed the funding the owner would have received

21 and shall not be transferred to any other fund or revert to the General Fund.
22 (b) The secretary of housing and livable communities may apply for, receive and deposit
23 any federal funds, including, but not limited to, funds made available by the United States
