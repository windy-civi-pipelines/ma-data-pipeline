14 projects approved by the department that increase or maintain harbor access and maintain or
15 augment structures that provide protection to the coastline and development along the same. The
16 department shall promulgate regulations to define typical projects that are approved for

19 protection or harbor maintenance project but is not specifically defined as such in the
20 regulations. Subject to appropriation, the department shall provide financial assistance for each
21 coastal protection and harbor maintenance project or portion thereof authorized by this section in

23 promulgated by the department, including zero or low-interest loans to the municipality, in an
24 aggregate amount equal to 50 percent percent of the approved costs of such project or portion
25 thereof approved by the department of environmental management. This assistance shall not be

27 assistance available through the department, but shall assist municipalities in affording and
28 financing their portion of approved and necessary projects.

30 assistance to the department in whatever maximum amount is appropriated by the

38 management is directed to promulgate the rules and regulations required under this act within 90
39 days after the effective date of this act.
