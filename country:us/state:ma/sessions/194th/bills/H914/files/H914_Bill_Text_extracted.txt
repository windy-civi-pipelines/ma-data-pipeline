_______________
In the One Hundred and Ninety-Fourth General Court
(2025-2026)
_______________
An Act to create fees for single use disposable food containers.
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives in General Court assembled, and by the authority
of the same, as follows:
1 Whereas, in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, food and beverage packaging
2 comprise most street litter and are significant contributors to the total amount of waste entering
3 the waste stream, and local governments in the U.S. spend $11.5 billion annually cleaning up
4 litter, and all disposable food-ware is non-recyclable, and many types of disposable food-ware
5 are not accepted in commercial compost facilities because they cause contamination and lower
6 the quality and value of compost, and food packaging materials, including food contact papers
7 and compostable paperboard- containers and molded plastics, frequently contain harmful poly
8 and perfluoroalkyl chemicals that are linked to serious health impacts, and many of the chemical
9 additives used in packaging are known to migrate into food and beverages. Hundreds of common
10 packaging chemicals are known to be hazardous to human health and in the environment, many
11 are extremely persistent and bioaccumulative, therefore the Commonwealth of Massachusetts
12 sets forward this act to reduce restaurant packaging waste.
