8 ASTM D6400 is the specification for plastics designed for compostability in municipal or
9 industrial aerobic composting facilities. D6868 is the specification for aerobic compostability of
1 of 3
10 plastics used as coatings on a compostable substrate. A bioplastic product must use a logo
11 indicating the product has been certified by a recognized third-party independent verification
12 body as meeting the ASTM standard specification; and displays the word "compostable," where
13 possible indicating the product has been tested by a recognized third-party independent body and
14 meets the ASTM standard specification. Fiber-based products or product components would
15 need to be (a) free from any organic fluorine substances that a manufacturer has intentionally
16 added in any amount; and (b) not contain total organic fluorine at or above 100 parts per million
17 as measured by an independent laboratory.
18 “Disposable food service ware” All food and beverage containers, bowls, plates, trays,
19 cartons, cups, lids, straws, stirrers, forks, spoons, knives, film wrap, and other items designed for
20 one-time or non-durable uses on or in which any food vendor directly places or packages
21 prepared foods or which are used to consume foods. This includes, but is not limited to, service

26 and food trucks.
27 “Recyclable Material” that can be sorted, cleansed, and reconstituted using the local
28 municipality’s regular year-round collection program for the purpose of using the altered form in
29 the manufacture of a new product. Regular year-round collection means either the municipal
30 curbside pickup or else a municipal transfer station in communities that do not have curbside
31 pickup. All recyclable plastic material must be identified by its plastic resin code in a visible
2 of 3
32 manner on the food service ware. "Recycling" does not include burning, incinerating, converting,
33 or otherwise thermally destroying solid waste.
34 “Reusable Products” Those that will be used more than once in its same form by a food
35 establishment. Reusable food service ware includes: tableware, flatware, food or beverage
36 containers, packages or trays, such as, but not limited to, soft drink bottles and milk containers
37 that are designed to be returned to the store or distributor that provided the take-out containers.

39 containers, packages, or trays used on-premises or returnable containers brought back to the food
40 establishment.
41 Section 2. (a) Except as provided in this section on and after January 1, 2027, all retail
