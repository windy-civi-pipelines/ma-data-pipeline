Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives in General Court assembled, and by the authority
of the same, as follows:
1 SECTION 1. Purpose
2 The purpose of this act is to ensure that municipalities in the Commonwealth of
3 Massachusetts meet state-defined standards for safe drinking water in order to qualify for state

5 prioritize water quality.

7 For the purposes of this act, the following terms shall have the meanings assigned below:
8 (a) Safe Drinking Water: Water that meets or exceeds the standards established by the
9 Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection (MassDEP) in accordance with the

11 (b) Municipality: A city or town within the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

16 responsible for regulating and ensuring environmental quality, including water resources.
17 SECTION 3. Eligibility Requirements for State Funding or Grants

19 must provide certification from MassDEP demonstrating that its public water system complies
20 with all federal and state water quality regulations.
21 (b) Annual Testing: Municipalities must conduct annual water quality testing and submit
22 results to MassDEP. The testing shall include, but not be limited to, analysis for contaminants
23 such as lead, arsenic, nitrates, perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), and
24 bacterial pathogens.
25 (c) Action Plan for Noncompliance: Municipalities found to be out of compliance with
26 safe drinking water standards shall be required to submit a detailed remediation plan to

35 (c) Emergency Exceptions: In cases where a municipality faces an immediate public
36 health crisis related to water quality, the Commonwealth may allocate emergency funding to
37 address the issue, even if the municipality is otherwise ineligible under this act.
38 SECTION 5. Enforcement
39 (a) MassDEP shall monitor compliance with the requirements of this act and establish a
40 reporting system for municipalities to demonstrate ongoing adherence to water quality standards.
41 (b) Municipalities that falsify water quality reports or fail to meet reporting requirements
42 shall be subject to penalties, including fines and temporary suspension of state funding
43 eligibility.
44 SECTION 6. Public Reporting

46 municipalities in the Commonwealth. The report shall include a list of municipalities in
47 compliance, municipalities under remediation, and municipalities that have failed to meet safe
48 drinking water standards.

51 prepare for compliance with its provisions.
