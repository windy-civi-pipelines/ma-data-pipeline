1 of 8

10 “Abusive trade practice” , any conduct by a covered entity that 1) materially interferes
11 with the ability of an end user to understand a term or condition of the agreement between
12 covered entities and end users relating to biometric recognition technology or biometric data or
13 2) takes unreasonable advantage of: a) A lack of understanding on the part of the end user of the
14 material risks, costs, or conditions of the covered entity’s product or service that uses biometric
15 recognition technology; or b) The inability of the end user to protect their interests in selecting or
16 using a covered entity’s product or service; or c) The reasonable reliance by the end user on a
17 covered entity’s representation to act in the interests of the end user.
18 “Biometric data” means information that pertains to measurable biological or behavioral
19 characteristics of an individual that can be used singularly, or in combination with each other, or
20 with other information, for verification, recognition, or identification of an individual. Examples
21 include but are not limited to fingerprints, retina and iris patterns, voiceprints, D.N.A. sequences,
22 facial characteristics and face geometry, gait, handwriting, keystroke dynamics, and mouse
23 movements.
24 Biometric data does not include writing samples, written signatures, mere photographs,
25 human biological samples used for valid scientific testing or screening, demographic data, tattoo
26 descriptions, or physical descriptions such as height, weight, hair color, or eye color.
27 Biometric data does not include donated organs, tissues, parts of the human body, blood,
28 or serum stored on behalf of recipients or potential recipients of living or cadaveric transplants
29 obtained or stored by a federally designated organ procurement agency.

31 provider or health care facility, or collected, processed, used, or stored exclusively for medical
2 of 8

32 education or research, public health or epidemiological purposes, health care treatment, health
33 insurance, payment, or operations, so long as such information is protected under the federal
34 Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 and applicable federal and state
35 laws and regulations.
36 Biometric data does not include information captured from an X-ray, roentgen process,
37 computed tomography, M.R.I., P.E.T. scan, mammography, or other image or film of the human
38 anatomy used to diagnose, prognose, or treat an illness or other medical condition or to further
39 validate scientific testing or screening.

42 of a specific individual.

44 consumer's wishes by which he or she, or his or her legal guardian, by a person who has power
45 of attorney or is acting as a conservator for the consumer, such as by a statement or by a clear
46 affirmative action, signifies agreement to the processing of biometric data relating to the
47 consumer for a narrowly defined particular purpose. Acceptance of a general or broad terms of
48 use or similar document that contains descriptions of biometric data processing along with other,
49 unrelated information, does not constitute consent. Hovering over, muting, pausing, or closing a
50 given piece of content does not constitute consent. Likewise, agreement obtained through use of
51 an abusive trade practice does not constitute consent.
52 “Controller” , Any covered entity that, alone or jointly with others, determines the
53 purposes and means of processing biometric data.

88 (b) A covered entity shall be required to secure biometric data from unauthorized access
89 in a reasonable manner that is the same as or more protective than the manner in which the
90 covered entity secures other confidential and sensitive data and shall be prohibited from
91 engaging in harmful data practices.
92 (c) A covered entity shall not: (i) process or transfer biometric data in any manner not
93 consented to by the end user; (ii) engage in the sale of biometric data to a third party; (iii)
94 disclose biometric data with any other person or entity except as consistent with the duties of
95 loyalty, care, and confidentiality under subsections 2(a), 2(b) and 2(c)(i) and 2(c)(ii),
5 of 8

96 respectively; or (iv) disclose or share biometric data with any other person unless that person
97 enters into a contract with the covered entity that imposes on the person the same duties of care,
98 loyalty, and confidentiality toward the end user as are imposed on the covered entity under this
99 subsection.
100 (d) A covered entity shall take reasonable steps to ensure that the practices of any person
101 to whom the online service provider discloses or sells, or with whom the online service provider
102 shares, biometric data fulfill the duties of care, loyalty, and confidentiality assumed by the
103 person under the contract described in subparagraph (c), including by auditing, on a regular
104 basis, the data security and data practices of any such person.
105 (e) A covered entity shall not discriminate against a consumer because of the withheld
106 consent under this title, including, but not limited to: (i) denying goods or services to the end
107 user; (ii) charging different prices or rates for goods or services, including through the use of
108 discounts or other benefits or imposing penalties; (iii) providing a different level or quality of
109 goods or services to the end user; (iv) suggesting that the end user will receive a different price
110 or rate for goods or services or a different level or quality of goods or services.
111 Section 3. Regulating unfair, deceptive, and abusive biometric data practices
112 (a) A covered entity shall not: (i) engage in a deceptive data practice; (ii) engage in an
113 unfair data practice; or (iii) engage in an abusive trade practice.
114 (b) It is the intent of the legislature that in construing paragraph (a) of this section in
115 actions unfair and deceptive trade practices, the courts will be guided by the interpretations given
116 by the Federal Trade Commission and the Federal Courts to section 5(a)(1) of the Federal Trade
117 Commission Act (15 U.S.C. 45(a)(1)), as from time to time amended.

118 (c) The attorney general may make rules and regulations interpreting the provisions of
119 subsection 2(a) of this chapter.
120 Section 4. Limits on decision-making and public surveillance
121 (a) Covered entities shall not use biometric data to help make decisions that produce legal
122 effects or similarly significant effects concerning end users. Decisions that include legal effects
123 or similarly significant effects concerning end users include, without limitation, denial or
124 degradation of consequential services or support, such as financial or lending services, housing,
125 insurance, educational enrollment, criminal justice, employment opportunities, health care
126 services, and access to basic necessities, such as food and water.
127 (b) Covered entities may not operate, install, or commission the operation or installation
128 of equipment incorporating biometric recognition technology in any place, whether licensed or

130 (c) The legislature finds that the practices covered by this section are matters vitally
131 affecting the public interest for the purpose of applying the Massachusetts Consumer Protection
132 law, chapter 93a. A violation of this section is not reasonable in relation to the development and
133 preservation of business and is an unfair or deceptive act in trade or commerce and an unfair
134 method of competition for the purpose of applying the Massachusetts Consumer Protection law,
135 chapter 93a.
136 Section 5. Applicability of other state and federal laws
7 of 8

139 privacy of personal information.
140 Section 6. Enforcement
141 The attorney general may bring an action pursuant to section 4 of chapter 93A against a
142 person or otherwise to remedy violations of this chapter and for other relief that may be
143 appropriate.
