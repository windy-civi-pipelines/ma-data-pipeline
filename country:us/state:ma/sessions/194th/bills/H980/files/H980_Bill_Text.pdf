14 program eligibility by the community, for projects that include, but are not limited to, elevating
15 vulnerable utilities, installation of flood equalization vents, elevating buildings, or any eligible
16 project as defined in Section 3 that is determined to be flood mitigation or wet floodproofing
17 projects and,
18 ii. Fund all the administrative actions involved in administering this program or any other
19 state or federal mitigation grant or loan programs at the community level whether funding is or is
20 not awarded and,
21 iii. Fund outreach and education activities within communities that relate to information

26 Community—Any state or area or political subdivision thereof, or any Indian tribe or
27 authorized tribal organization, or authorized native organization, which has the authority to adopt
28 and enforce this standard for areas within its jurisdiction.

30 relative to the datum specified on the community’s flood hazard map.
2 of 8

31 Dry Floodproofing—A combination of measures that results in a structure, including the
32 attendant utilities and equipment, being watertight with all elements substantially impermeable
33 and with structural components having the capacity to resist flood loads.
34 Flood- A general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of two or
35 more acres of normally dry land area or of two or more properties, at least one of which is the

58 market value This term includes structures that have incurred substantial damage, regardless of
59 the actual repair work performed.

61 resistant materials and construction techniques in areas of a structure that are below the elevation
62 required by this standard by intentionally allowing those areas to flood
