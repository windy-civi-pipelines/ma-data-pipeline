An Act related to granting three additional liquor licenses for the sale of all alcoholic beverages
to be drunk off the premises in the town of Marshfield and three additional licenses for alcoholic

3 the licensing authority of the town of Marshfield may grant three additional licenses for the sale
4 of all alcoholic beverages to be drunk on the premises pursuant to section 12 of said chapter 138
5 and three all alcoholic beverages not to be drunk on the premises pursuant to section 15 of said
6 chapter 138. The license shall be subject to all of chapter 138, except section 17.
7 (b.) The three on-the-premises licenses granted under this act shall only be executed in
8 the dining room of a common victualler and such other public rooms or areas as may be deemed
1 of 2

9 reasonable and appropriate by the licensing authority of the town of Marshfield as certified in
10 writing.
11 (c.) The three off-the-premises licenses granted under this act shall only be exercised to
12 be drunk off of the premises.
13 (d.) The licensing authority for the town of Marshfield may grant these licenses if the
14 applicant files with the licensing authority a letter from the department of revenue and a letter
15 from the department of unemployment assistance indicating that the applicant is in good standing
16 with those departments and that all applicable taxes, fees, and contributions have been paid.
17 (e.) If a licensee terminates or fails to renew a license granted under this act, or any such
18 license is cancelled, revoked, or no longer in use it shall be returned physically, with all of the
19 legal rights, privileges, and restrictions pertaining thereto, to the licensing authority of the town
20 of Marshfield, which may then grant the license to the new applicant under the same conditions
21 as specified in this act.
22 (f.) All licenses granted under this act shall be issued within 4 years after the effective
23 date of this act; provided, however, that a license originally granted within that time period may
24 be granted to a new applicant under subsections (c) or (d) thereafter.
25 Section 2. This act shall take effect upon its passage.
