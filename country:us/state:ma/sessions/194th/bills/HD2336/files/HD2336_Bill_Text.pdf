Senate President Spilka, Speaker Mariano, Chairs and Members of the House and Senate,
I am proposing for your consideration additional changes to the Emergency Assistance Shelter
System to be included in the supplemental budget pending with the Legislature.
Since the beginning of the Healey-Driscoll Administration, we have worked in partnership with
the Legislature and in the face of heightened demand and limited resources to serve homeless
families, including Massachusetts residents and those new to our state. As you know, the
Emergency Assistance Shelter System was established in 1983 as the Right to Shelter Law. Its
purpose was to provide “a program of emergency assistance to needy families with children and
pregnant women with no other children.”
I have evaluated the Right to Shelter Law and regulations as well as the operational burdens on
the system. Based on that review, and in the face of continued inaction by Congress and no

assistance from the federal government, I believe these changes are appropriate and needed to
ensure the long-term sustainability of the state shelter system in a way that aligns with the
original intent of the law. In addition, my proposed changes will allow us to continue to ensure
the safety of our system, support cities and towns in addressing the needs of unhoused families in
their communities and put us on the path toward a more fiscally sustainable Emergency
Assistance shelter system in Fiscal Year 2026 and beyond.
To that end, I recommend the following changes to the current system requirements below:
Current Requirement Proposed Change
Eviction Eligibility Criteria Under the line item, families The Administration proposes
