** *EOHLC recently just recently learned that this District is evidently still zoned for and there was not adequate time to send out a report for submission by the town. The Town of North Andover voted to repeal its 40R District
in 2019. At that time DHCD's approval of the repeal was subject to the town returning the $600K Zoning Incentive Payment it received or replacement of the 40R District. EOHLC never received a repayment or a formal
proposal for a replacement District but nevertheless understood that the repeal stood. No units have been permitted in the District.
