I. INTRODUCTION
Pursuant to An Act Relative to Natural Gas Leaks, St. 2014, c. 149, § 9 (“Section 9” of
the “Act”), the Department of Public Utilities (“Department”) submits a report on or before
December 31 annually which addresses the prevalence of natural gas leaks in the natural gas
system to the House and Senate Chairs of the Joint Committee on Telecommunications, Utilities
and Energy, and the House and Senate chairs of the Joint Committee on Public Safety and
Homeland Security. Specifically, the report must include, but not be limited to, the following:
(1) the total number of Grade 1, Grade 2, and Grade 3 leaks as classified in G.L. c. 164, § 144
and reported in the previous year; (2) estimates for lost and unaccounted-for natural gas
(“LAUF”) and methane emissions as a result of such Grade 1, Grade 2, and Grade 3 leaks; and
(3) the time and cost estimates for eliminating the backlog of Grade 1, Grade 2, and Grade 3
leaks. St. 2014, c. 149, § 9. The Department is pleased to present this report to the Joint
Committee on Telecommunications, Utilities and Energy and the Joint Committee on Public
Safety and Homeland Security for the calendar year ended December 31, 2023.
Natural gas leaks occur in the gas distribution system for several reasons, including the
age of the infrastructure, corrosion, and damage from other underground construction projects,
also referred to as encroachment.1 A significant reason for the occurrence of natural gas leaks in
Massachusetts is the presence of certain aging, leak-prone infrastructure, including
1 Encroached pipe includes cast-iron pipe, eight inches or less in diameter, that has been
exposed and undermined by a trench crossing the pipeline or by an adjacent, parallel
excavation. 220 CMR 113.06, 113.07.

non-cathodically protected steel,2 cast-iron,3 and wrought iron.4 A 2014 study commissioned by
the Department estimated that there were over 6,000 miles of aging infrastructure in
Massachusetts comprising materials that are vulnerable to natural gas leakage. ICF International,
Report on Lost and Unaccounted for Gas (December 23, 2014).5 The Department has
recognized that there may be public safety, service reliability, and environmental issues
associated with the continued existence and aging of leak-prone facilities in gas companies’
distribution systems. New England Gas Company, D.P.U. 10-114, at 56 (2011); Bay State Gas
Company, D.P.U. 09-30, at 133 (2009). Historically, the Department has determined that a
2 Cathodic protection systems help prevent corrosion from occurring on the exterior of
pipes by substituting a new source of electrons, commonly referred to as either a
“sacrificial anode” or “impressed current anode.” Both systems operate by imparting a
direct current onto the buried pipeline, using devices called rectifiers. As long as the
current is sufficient, corrosion is prevented, or at least mitigated and held in check. Fact

3 Gray cast-iron is a cast ferrous material in which a major part of the carbon content
occurs as free carbon in the form of flakes interspersed through the metal. Because the
carbon flakes do not bond with the ferrous material on the molecular level, the metal is
brittle and susceptible to stress cracking under pressure situations. American Gas
Association, Gas Piping Technology Committee.
4 Together with cast-iron, wrought iron pipelines are among the oldest energy pipelines
constructed in the United States. The degrading nature of iron alloys, the age of the
pipelines, and the pipe joint designs have greatly increased the risk involved with the
continued use of such pipelines. Pipeline Replacement Background, United States

sustained replacement of aging infrastructure facilities is appropriate and desirable from a public
policy perspective, given the potential benefits to public safety, service reliability, and the
environment. Boston Gas Company/Colonial Gas Company/Essex Gas Company, D.P.U. 10-55,
at 121 (2010); D.P.U. 10-114, at 56; D.P.U. 09-30, at 133-134. The Department also
acknowledges continuing stakeholder discussions and legislative and policy changes around the
future of natural gas infrastructure, and the Department will remain engaged in those initiatives.
The Department and the gas industry are addressing the challenges posed by certain
aging infrastructure in several ways. First, recognizing the public safety and environmental
issues posed by natural gas leaks, the Department has taken proactive steps to address issues
regarding the replacement or repair of leak-prone infrastructure. In the early 1990s, the
Department promulgated regulations (220 CMR 113.00) prohibiting the installation of cast-iron
pipe for the distribution of gas after April 12, 1991. Beginning in 2009, the Department began
approving targeted infrastructure replacement factor (“TIRF”) programs for several gas
distribution companies to accelerate the replacement of leak-prone infrastructure. Similarly,
pursuant to G.L. c. 164, § 145 (added by St. 2014, c. 149, § 2; amended by St. 2021, c. 8,

Section 9:
§§ 87-89, St. 2022, c. 179, § 58, and St. 2024, c. 239, § 81) (“GSEP Statute”), gas distribution
companies have submitted to the Department accelerated infrastructure replacement plans to
replace aging or leaking natural gas pipeline infrastructure, in the interest of public safety and to
reduce LAUF. On October 31, 2014, seven of the Commonwealth’s gas distribution companies
submitted to the Department their first annual accelerated infrastructure replacement plans,
D.P.U. 24-GLR-01 Page 4
referred to as gas system enhancement plans (“GSEPs”).6 The Department approved the first
GSEPs (for 2015) on April 30, 2015. The Department has since approved the gas distribution
companies’ 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, and 2024 GSEPs, on or about
April 30 of those years.7 Because the intent of the pipeline replacement programs is to reduce
the number of natural gas leaks in the natural gas system, as well as to reduce LAUF and
methane emissions, we discuss the GSEPs in more detail in Section III, below.8
Further, G.L. c. 164, § 144 prescribes a uniform gas leak classification (Grade 1, Grade 2,
or Grade 3) based on the hazard presented by a gas leak and a timeline in which distribution
companies must repair or monitor each leak depending on its grade. Additionally, G.L. c. 164,

Section 10:
§ 144(d) prioritizes the repair of gas leaks detected within a school zone, and G.L. c. 164,
6 The original seven gas distribution companies were: The Berkshire Gas Company; Bay
State Gas Company d/b/a Columbia Gas of Massachusetts; Liberty Utilities (New
England Natural Gas Company) Corp. d/b/a Liberty Utilities; Boston Gas Company and
Colonial Gas Company each d/b/a National Grid; NSTAR Gas Company
d/b/a Eversource Energy; and Fitchburg Gas and Electric Light Company d/b/a Unitil.
As noted below, there have been some recent organizational changes to these seven
companies. The eighth gas distribution company in Massachusetts as of 2014,
Blackstone Gas Company, did not submit a GSEP because its gas distribution system
contained no leak-prone infrastructure.
Under their GSEPs, the gas distribution companies plan to replace a total of
approximately 6,023 miles of aging infrastructure in Massachusetts over 20 years
(beginning in 2015), with the exception that Colonial Gas Company intends to complete
replacement of its aging infrastructure within eleven years, and NSTAR Gas Company
and Boston Gas Company plan to complete their replacements within 25 years.
7 The Department is currently reviewing the gas distribution companies’ 2025 GSEPs, filed
on October 31, 2024, and will issue final Orders on them no later than April 30, 2025.
8 Section III also provides information on the amount of leak-prone infrastructure within
each gas distribution company’s system.
D.P.U. 24-GLR-01 Page 5

Section 11:
§ 144(e) requires gas distribution companies to provide in their annual service quality reports the
location, classification date, and repair dates of each leak existing as of the date of the report. On
March 8, 2019, the Department promulgated final regulations regarding these requirements and
established specific criteria to identify and repair or eliminate environmentally significant
Grade 3 leaks (“SEI”). Uniform Natural Gas Leaks Classification Rulemaking, D.P.U. 16-31-C
(2019); see 220 CMR 114.00, Uniform Natural Gas Leaks Classification.
Finally, on December 12, 2019, pursuant to St. 2018, c. 227, §§ 19 and 23, the
Department promulgated final regulations and guidelines establishing procedures for all gas
distribution companies and municipal gas operators to report LAUF and the components
thereof -- including fugitive emissions from leaks -- annually to the Department in a uniform
manner. LAUF Rulemaking, D.P.U. 19-44-A (2019); see 220 CMR 115.00. The companies
filed their first LAUF reports pursuant to the new regulations and guidelines on or about
March 15, 2020, and have filed their annual LAUF reports on or about March 15 each year
thereafter.
II. PREVALENCE OF NATURAL GAS LEAKS IN THE NATURAL GAS SYSTEM
A. Introduction
General Laws c. 164, § 144, requires the gas distribution companies and municipal gas
operators to grade all reported natural gas leaks based on the hazard posed by the leak, and it
prescribes a timeline for the companies/operators to repair or monitor natural gas leaks
depending on the hazard posed by the leak, as follows:
• A Grade 1 leak represents an existing or probable hazard to persons or
property, and requires repair “as immediately as possible,” continuous action
until the conditions are no longer hazardous, and continuous surveillance until
the hazard or source of the leak is eliminated. G.L. c. 164, § 144(b)(2).
D.P.U. 24-GLR-01 Page 6
• A Grade 2 leak is recognized as non-hazardous to persons or property at the
time of detection, but justifies scheduled repair based on probable future
hazard. This grade of leak must be repaired, or the main replaced, within
twelve months from the date of classification, and must be re-evaluated at
least once every six months until eliminated. G.L. c. 164, § 144(b)(3).
• A Grade 3 leak is recognized as non-hazardous to persons or property at the
time of detection and can be reasonably expected to remain non-hazardous.
This grade of leak must be re-evaluated during the next scheduled survey or
within twelve months from the date last evaluated, whichever occurs first,
until the leak is eliminated or the main replaced. G.L. c. 164, § 144(b)(4).
For the purposes of this report, the Department gathered gas leak data from the following
local gas distribution companies and municipal gas operators in the Commonwealth: The
Berkshire Gas Company (“Berkshire”); Eversource Gas of Massachusetts d/b/a Eversource
Energy (“EGMA”); Liberty Utilities (New England Natural Gas Company) Corp. d/b/a Liberty
Utilities (“Liberty”); Boston Gas Company and Colonial Gas Company d/b/a National Grid
(“National Grid”);9 NSTAR Gas Company d/b/a Eversource Energy (“NSTAR Gas”); Fitchburg
Gas and Electric Light Company d/b/a Unitil (“Unitil”); Holyoke Gas & Electric Department
(“Holyoke”); Middleborough Gas & Electric Department (“Middleborough”); Wakefield
Municipal Gas and Light Department (“Wakefield”); and Westfield Gas & Electric Light
Department (“Westfield”). Section II.B, below, presents a summary of the gas leak data, as
follows: (1) the number of Grade 1, Grade 2, and Grade 3 gas leaks classified pursuant to
9 On December 16, 2019, the Department approved the merger of Boston Gas Company
and Colonial Gas Company with and into Boston Gas Company, within the National Grid
USA holding company system. Boston Gas Company and Colonial Gas Company,

G.L. c. 164, § 144 and reported to the Department in 2023;10 (2) estimates of LAUF and methane
emissions from such leaks for 2023; and (3) time and cost estimates for eliminating the backlog
of Grade 1, Grade 2, and Grade 3 leaks that existed at the end of 2023. Appendix A, attached to
this report, sets forth the company/operator-specific information regarding gas leaks, LAUF,
methane emissions, and time/cost estimates.
The Department notes three significant aspects of this report. First, while this report
provides the number of Grade 1, Grade 2, and Grade 3 leaks identified and existing during 2023,
these data do not represent the number of ongoing, unrepaired leaks as of the date of this report.
Rather, the actual number of natural gas leaks on the gas distribution system may fluctuate daily
for a number of reasons, including the following: (1) gas distribution companies and municipal
gas operators are required to repair Grade 1 leaks “as immediately as possible”; (2) gas
distribution companies and municipal gas operators engage in ongoing repair of Grade 2 and
Grade 3 leaks; and (3) new Grade 1, Grade 2, and Grade 3 leaks generally occur as a result of
encroachment or certain aging infrastructure. Accordingly, the data provided in this report
should be viewed as a cumulative total of Grade 1, Grade 2, and Grade 3 leaks as reported in
calendar year 2023, along with the associated cost estimates to fix the unrepaired leaks that
10 In late 2016 and early 2017, the Department’s Pipeline Safety Division (“Division”)
directed the gas distribution companies and municipal gas operators to begin providing
quarterly reports of gas leak information, including total numbers of leaks by grade. In
addition, pursuant to G.L. c. 164, § 144, the gas companies are required to report in their
annual service quality reports the location of each Grade 1, Grade 2, and Grade 3 leak
existing as of the date of the report, the date each leak was classified, and the dates of
repairs performed on each Grade 1, Grade 2, and Grade 3 leak. In 2019, the Division
began requesting more specific quarterly data pursuant to the new regulations,
220 CMR 114.00.
D.P.U. 24-GLR-01 Page 8
existed on each reporting entity’s gas distribution system as of the end of calendar year 2023.
The report also identifies the number of unrepaired leaks, by grade, existing as of the end of
calendar year 2023.
Second, the LAUF and methane values contained in this report are not categorized by
leak grade, as there is no standard industry approach for calculating LAUF or methane emissions
by leak grade (i.e., LAUF or methane emissions associated only with Grade 1, Grade 2, or
Grade 3 leaks that exclude other causes). Further, the Department has determined that the LAUF
value associated with leakage, as reported to the Department annually by each gas distribution
company and municipal gas operator, is the appropriate measurement to include in this report.11
Third, all gas distribution companies and municipal gas operators report methane
emissions in accordance with the Department of Environmental Protection’s 310 CMR 7.71,
Reporting of Greenhouse Gas Emissions.12 The gas distribution companies and municipal gas
operators have stated that it is the most widely accepted method used by the natural gas industry
to estimate methane emissions from natural gas facilities and, therefore, all leakage on the
natural gas system. See Gas Leaks Report, D.P.U. 15-GLR-01, at 10 (2015). Finally, to present
11 The Department reviewed the LAUF and methane emission estimates that each operator
submitted in the Massachusetts addendum to its Form PHMSA F 7100.1 1, which each
operator files annually with the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration
(“PHMSA”) of the U.S. Department of Transportation, pursuant to 49 C.F.R. Part 191.
In some cases, the Department also reviewed the LAUF reports.
12 Where applicable, this regulation requires gas distribution companies and municipal gas
operators to estimate the average volume of methane emissions by applying the leak
factors identified in the Greenhouse Gas regulations, 40 C.F.R. Part 98, subpart W,
Table W-7, to various types of pipe material.
D.P.U. 24-GLR-01 Page 9
the data in a consistent manner, the Department reports LAUF in million British Thermal Units
(“MMBTU”) and methane emissions in metric tons (“MT”).
B. Gas Leaks on Gas Distribution System
Collectively, the gas distribution companies and municipal gas operators reported a total
of 22,531 leaks on the gas distribution system in 2023 (including leaks carried over from the
prior year and newly identified leaks), classified as follows: (1) 5,033 Grade 1 leaks;
(2) 3,960 Grade 2 leaks; and (3) 13,538 Grade 3 leaks (see Appendix A). As of the end of 2023,
the gas distribution companies and municipal gas operators reported a total of 10,652 gas leaks
remaining on the gas distribution system, classified as follows: (1) 37 Grade 1 leaks;
(2) 593 Grade 2 leaks; and (3) 10,022 Grade 3 leaks (550 SEI and 9,472 non-SEI). The gas
distribution companies and municipal gas operators estimate that it will cost approximately
$17,971,180 to repair the remaining backlog.13 As calculated and described above, the gas
distribution companies and municipal gas operators estimate a total of 341,185.0 MMBTU of
LAUF related to leakage and a total of 16,232.7 MT of methane emissions in 2023.14
Below is a table displaying leak trends categorized by grade since 2014:
13 The time estimates, reported in various ways by each company/operator, are contained in
Appendix A. While there were 10,652 leaks remaining on the distribution system as of
the end of 2023, the companies/operators have already repaired or eliminated a portion of
those leaks during 2024; thus, the repair costs may reflect only part of the backlog that
existed as of the end of 2023.
14 See Appendix A for company/operator-specific information.

Comparing 2023 to 2022, these numbers reflect a 54.17 percent increase in Grade 1
leaks, a 16.36 percent decrease in Grade 2 leaks, a 12.43 percent decrease in Grade 3 leaks, and a

Section 12:
12.52 percent decrease in total leaks. Since 2014, there has been a 56.98 percent decrease in
Grade 1 leaks, a 51.79 percent decrease in Grade 2 leaks, a 48.50 percent decrease in Grade 3
leaks, and a 48.73 percent decrease in total leaks on the system.
The data demonstrate that while the gas distribution companies and municipal gas
operators reported numerous Grade 1, Grade 2, and Grade 3 leaks during calendar year 2023, gas
distribution companies and municipal gas operators also continuously engaged in the ongoing
repair of these leaks, specifically prioritizing Grade 1 leaks, but also repairing significant
numbers of outstanding Grade 2 leaks and Grade 3 leaks. The vast majority of unrepaired leaks
as of the end of calendar year 2023 are those specifically classified as non-hazardous.
Additionally, except for National Grid, all the gas distribution companies and municipal gas
operators repaired their 2023 Grade 1 leaks by the end of 2023.
As discussed above, a significant reason that Grade 1, Grade 2, and Grade 3 gas leaks
continue to be identified and reported is that large portions of the gas distribution system are
D.P.U. 24-GLR-01 Page 11
composed of certain aging infrastructure. We turn now to a discussion of pipeline replacement
programs that are designed to accelerate the repair or replacement of leak-prone pipe and will,
accordingly, result in the elimination of many natural gas leaks.
III. PIPELINE REPLACEMENT PROGRAMS
A. Introduction
The Department has recognized that there may be public safety, service reliability, and
environmental issues associated with the continued existence and aging of leak-prone facilities in
gas companies’ distribution systems. New England Gas Company, D.P.U. 10-114, at 56 (2011);
Bay State Gas Company, D.P.U. 09-30, at 133 (2009). The Department has historically
concluded that a sustained replacement of leak-prone facilities is appropriate and desirable from
a public policy perspective given the potential benefits to public safety, service reliability, and
the environment. D.P.U. 10-114, at 56; Boston Gas Company/Colonial Gas Company/Essex Gas
Company, D.P.U. 10-55, at 121 (2010); D.P.U. 09-30, at 133-134. In the early 1990s, the
Department promulgated regulations (220 CMR 113.00) that prohibited the installation of
cast-iron pipe for gas distribution after April 12, 1991. These regulations required that each gas
distribution company develop and implement cast-iron replacement programs. The regulations
also included a mandatory provision requiring gas distribution companies to immediately replace
cast-iron pipe that has been encroached upon.
Beginning in 2009, the Department approved TIRF programs by which gas distribution
companies could accelerate the repair or replacement of certain types of aging infrastructure.
Specifically, the Department approved proposals to implement TIRF programs for Bay State in
2009, National Grid in 2010, and Liberty in 2010. D.P.U. 10-55, at 122; D.P.U. 09-30, at 134;
D.P.U. 24-GLR-01 Page 12
D.P.U. 10-114, at 56, 76-77. The TIRF programs allowed these companies to recover the
revenue requirement (including depreciation, return on investment, and property taxes) on
investments made to replace leak-prone mains, services, and other facilities through a reconciling
mechanism outside of base rates. D.P.U. 10-55, at 137-138, 145; D.P.U. 10-114, at 35; Bay
State Gas Company, D.P.U. 13-75, at 21 (2014). Through the TIRFs, National Grid, Bay State,
and Liberty Utilities replaced significant amounts of leak-prone infrastructure.15 The TIRF
programs were phased out as the gas distribution companies transitioned to GSEPs for
accelerated pipe replacement. As demonstrated by the TIRFs and now the GSEPs, and as
discussed in greater detail below, Massachusetts has set a course to eliminate leak-prone
infrastructure on an accelerated basis.
B. GSEPs

Section 13:
1. Overview
For those gas distribution companies operating with TIRF programs, the GSEP Statute
replaced the TIRF program for replacement of eligible infrastructure as of January 1, 2015. See
15 Specifically, between 2010 and 2013, Boston Gas eliminated 335 miles of cast iron and
non-cathodically protected steel mains, along with 8,000 services, and Colonial Gas
eliminated 154 miles of cast-iron and non-cathodically protected steel mains, along with
969 services. Boston Gas Company/Colonial Gas Company, D.P.U. 14-132, at 10 n.14
(2015). Between 2010 and 2013, Bay State eliminated 177 miles of cast-iron and
non-cathodically protected steel mains, along with 10,079 services. Bay State Gas
Company d/b/a Columbia Gas of Massachusetts, D.P.U. 14-134, at 9 n.13 (2015).
Finally, between 2010 and 2013, Liberty Utilities eliminated approximately 25 miles of
non-cathodically protected steel or cast-iron/wrought iron mains, along with replacement
of 1,994 services. Liberty Utilities (New England Natural Gas Company) Corp.,
D.P.U. 14-133, Exh. LU-1, at 4 (2015).
D.P.U. 24-GLR-01 Page 13
G.L. c. 164, § 145 (added by St. 2014, c. 149, § 2; amended by St. 2021, c. 8, §§ 87-89,16 St.
2022, c. 179, § 58,17 and St. 2024, c. 239, § 81). There have been several amendments to the
GSEP Statute since its enactment, most recently on November 20, 2024.18 This report addresses
the prevalence of leaks in calendar year 2023. Accordingly, where the Department references
the GSEP Statute in this section, it is referring to the version that was effective August 11, 2022
to November 19, 2024. Pursuant to the GSEP Statute, each gas distribution company annually
submits a plan to accelerate the replacement of leak-prone infrastructure and to address the leak
rate on the gas company’s natural gas infrastructure. G.L. c. 164, § 145(b) (eff. August 11,
2022). The GSEP Statute also provides as follows:
Each company’s gas infrastructure plan shall include interim targets for the department’s
review. The department shall review these interim targets to ensure each gas company is
meeting the appropriate pace to reduce the leak rate on and to replace the gas company’s
natural gas infrastructure in a safe and timely manner. The interim targets shall be for
periods of not more than 6 years or at the conclusion of 2 complete 3-year walking survey
cycles conducted by the gas company. The gas companies shall incorporate these interim
targets into timelines for removing all leak-prone infrastructure filed pursuant to
16 On March 26, 2021, Governor Baker signed An Act Creating a Next-Generation
Roadmap for Massachusetts Climate Policy, St. 2021, c. 8, § 87, which amended G.L.
c. 164, § 145. Key changes include requirements that (1) companies submit GSEPs
annually, (2) companies include interim targets in their GSEPs, and (3) where practical,
moving meters currently located inside a structure to outside locations.
17 On August 11, 2022, Governor Baker signed An Act Driving Clean Energy and Offshore
Wind, St. 2022, c. 179, § 58, which amended the definition of “eligible infrastructure
replacement” under G.L. c. 164, § 145(a) to include the use of advanced leak repair
technology approved by the Department to repair an existing leak-prone gas pipe to
extend the useful life of the such gas pipe by no less than 10 years; and replacing gas
infrastructure with utility-scale non-emitting renewable thermal energy infrastructure.
18 On November 20, 2024, Governor Healey signed An Act Promoting a Clean Energy
Grid, Advancing Equity and Protecting Ratepayers, St. 2024, c. 239, § 81, which made
several amendments to G.L. c. 164, § 145. For the purposes of this report, references to
the GSEP Statute do not reflect the 2024 amendments.
D.P.U. 24-GLR-01 Page 14
subsection (c) and may update them based on overall progress. The department may levy
a penalty against any gas company that fails to meet its interim target in an amount up to
and including the equivalent of 2.5 per cent of such gas company’s transmission and
distribution service revenues for the previous calendar year.
G.L. c. 164, § 145(b) (eff. August 11, 2022).
Any plan filed with the Department shall include, but not be limited to the following: (i) eligible
infrastructure replacement of mains, services, meter sets and other ancillary facilities composed
of non-cathodically protected steel, cast-iron and wrought iron, which are prioritized to
implement the federal gas distribution pipeline integrity management plan annually submitted to
the Department and consistent with the requirements of 49 C.F.R. § 192.1001 through

Section 14:
§ 192.1015; (ii) an anticipated timeline for the completion of each project; (iii) the estimated cost
of each project; (iv) rate change requests; (v) a description of customer costs and benefits under
the plan; (vi) the relocations, where practical, of a meter located inside of a structure to the
outside of said structure for the purpose of improving public safety; and (vii) any other
information the Department considers necessary to evaluate the plan. G.L. c. 164, § 145(c) (eff.
August 11, 2022). Additionally, the GSEP Statute requires that any plan filed include a timeline
for removing all leak-prone infrastructure on an accelerated basis specifying an annual
replacement pace and program end date with a target end date of either (i) not more than 20 years
from the filing of the initial plan or (ii) a reasonable target end date considering the allowable
cost recovery cap established pursuant to subsection (f). G.L. c. 164, § 145(c) (eff. August 11,
2022).19
19 The GSEP Statute further provides that annual changes in the revenue requirement
eligible for recovery pursuant to the plan shall not exceed (i) 1.5 percent of the gas
company’s most recent calendar year total firm revenues, including gas revenues
attributable to sales and transportation customers, or (ii) an amount determined by the
D.P.U. 24-GLR-01 Page 15
If a plan complies with Section 145 and the Department determines that it reasonably
accelerates eligible infrastructure replacement and provides benefits to customers, the
Department must preliminarily accept the plan either in whole or in part. G.L. c. 164, § 145(e)
(eff. August 11, 2022). The gas distribution company may begin recovering the estimated plan
revenue requirement on May 1 of the year following submission of the plan. G.L. c. 164,

Section 15:
§ 145(e) (eff. August 11, 2022). Subsequently, on or before May 1 of each year, the gas
distribution company must file final project documentation for construction completed during the
previous calendar year to demonstrate substantial compliance with the plan and to demonstrate
that the costs were reasonably and prudently incurred. G.L. c. 164, § 145(f) (eff. August 11,
2022).
On October 31, 2014, the seven gas distribution companies noted above (Unitil,
Berkshire, Liberty, National Grid,20 Bay State, and NSTAR Gas) submitted to the Department
Department that is greater than 1.5 percent of the gas company’s most recent calendar
year total firm revenues, including gas revenues attributable to sales and transportation
customers. G.L. c. 164, § 145(f) (eff. August 11, 2022). In 2019, the Department revised
the cap calculation and raised the cap to three percent, stating that this cap would remain
in effect until further ordered. See, e.g., Fitchburg Gas and Electric Light Company,
D.P.U. 18-GSEP-01, at 30 (2019). The Department may modify a plan prior to approval
at the request of a gas company, or it may make other modifications to a plan as a
condition of approval. G.L. c. 164, § 145(d) (eff. August 11, 2022). The Department is
required to consider the costs and benefits of the plan including, but not limited to,
impacts on ratepayers, reductions of LAUF through a reduction in natural gas system
leaks, and improvements to public safety. G.L. c. 164, § 145(d) (eff. August 11, 2022).
The Department is also required to give priority to plans narrowly tailored to addressing
leak-prone infrastructure most immediately in need of replacement. G.L. c. 164, § 145(d)
(eff. August 11, 2022).
20 Boston Gas Company and Colonial Gas Company submitted a joint GSEP under one
docket number.
D.P.U. 24-GLR-01 Page 16
their first annual GSEPs. As part of its proposed GSEP, each company, among other things,
(1) submitted a plan to repair or replace eligible leak-prone infrastructure during calendar year
2015, (2) estimated a revenue requirement associated with that replacement, and (3) provided a
timeline to repair or replace all leak-prone infrastructure in its gas distribution system. On
April 30, 2015, the Department approved each company’s initial GSEP. The gas distribution
companies have submitted their annual GSEPs on or about each October 31 thereafter, and the
Department has approved them, subject to further review and investigation, to become effective
May 1 of the following year.21 The Department is currently reviewing the companies’ eleventh
annual GSEPs, for calendar year 2025.
Additionally, on or about April 29, 2016, pursuant to G.L. c. 164, § 145(f), these same
gas distribution companies submitted to the Department their first annual GSEP reconciliation
filings (“GRECs”), wherein each company reconciled its actual investments with its planned
investment for calendar year 2015. The Department approved the first GRECs, in substantial
part, on October 31, 2016. The gas distribution companies have submitted their annual GRECs
on or about each May 1 thereafter, and the Department has approved them, wholly or in
substantial part, on or about October 31. The following summarizes the GREC information
reported for each GSEP year:
• 2015 GSEPs: $291.6 million expended to replace 221.24 miles of leak-prone mains
and 11,119 leak-prone services, plus related work.
21 Pursuant to G.L. c. 164, § 145(c), the companies submitted with their 2023 GSEPs a
summary of the GSEP replacement progress to date, the work to be completed over the
next five years, and a discussion of related issues that the companies identified as
impacting the continued effectiveness of the GSEPs.

IV. CONCLUSION
Pursuant to Section 9 of the Act, the Department has gathered data from gas distribution
companies and municipal gas operators regarding the prevalence of natural gas leaks on the
natural gas system. As indicated above, that data represent the total, cumulative leaks by grade
during calendar year 2023, as well as system-wide LAUF and methane emissions. The data
demonstrate that while the gas distribution companies and municipal gas operators identified
numerous Grade 1, Grade 2, and Grade 3 leaks during calendar year 2023, the gas distribution
companies and municipal gas operators have also continuously engaged in the ongoing repair of
these leaks. More specifically, the gas distribution companies and municipal gas operators have
specifically prioritized repair of Grade 1 leaks, which are defined as hazardous leaks, but have
also repaired significant numbers of outstanding Grade 2 leaks as well as Grade 3 leaks, both of
which are defined as nonhazardous leaks. With the exception of National Grid’s Grade 1 leaks,
all other Grade 1 leaks that occurred on the gas distribution systems during calendar year 2023
had been repaired by the end of 2023.
As discussed above, a major reason that natural gas leaks occur on Massachusetts’ natural
gas distribution system is the presence of certain types of older infrastructure, including
non-cathodically protected steel, cast-iron pipe, and wrought iron pipe, on significant portions of
the system. The Department has historically recognized public safety and environmental issues
posed by natural gas leaks, and it is confident that those issues are being addressed in several
ways, including through implementation of a cast-iron replacement program and the accelerated
D.P.U. 24-GLR-01 Page 24
replacement of aging infrastructure under the GSEPs submitted by the gas distribution
companies with leak-prone pipes. The Department will continue to monitor the progress of the
gas distribution companies in replacing aging infrastructure through review of the gas
distribution companies’ annual GSEP filings, which detail plans to repair or replace aging or
leak-prone infrastructure the following calendar year, and through review of the companies’
annual GREC filings, which detail the repair or replacement work performed in the previous
calendar year.
On December 6, 2023, the Department issued its Order on Regulatory Principles and
Framework in D.P.U. 20-80, the Department’s investigation into the role of gas companies in
achieving the Commonwealth’s 2050 climate goals. In D.P.U. 20-80-B, the Department adopted
policies designed geared generally “toward minimizing additional investment in pipeline and
distribution mains and achieving decarbonization in the residential, commercial, and industrial
sectors.” D.P.U. 20-80-B at 13. According to the Department’s Order, gas companies must
“move beyond ‘business as usual’ in their gas system planning, whether involving proposed
expansion of service to new areas or investments necessary to maintain the safety of existing
natural gas infrastructure.” D.P.U. 20-80-B at 13-14. A gas company’s GSEP represents its plan
for such investments, and the “different lens [to be] applied to gas infrastructure investments
going forward” that the Department described in D.P.U. 20-80-B at 13 is applicable to our
review of GSEP filings. A related requirement from D.P.U. 20-80-B is the obligation imposed
on LDCs to demonstrate that they considered non-gas pipeline alternatives (“NPAs”) as a
condition of recovering additional investment in pipeline and distribution mains. In its Order on
Joint Motion for Clarification Filed by the Gas Local Distribution Companies, the Department
D.P.U. 24-GLR-01 Page 25
clarified that it “did not carve out GSEP or any other project category as exempt from the NPA
analysis requirement in its Order.” D.P.U. 20-80-C at 21.
Further, the 2024 Amendments to the GSEP Statute modify the definition of “eligible
infrastructure investment” to “eligible infrastructure measure,” and thereby include “retirement
or improvement” in addition to “replacement.” Other sections of the 2024 Amendments refer to
“remediating” or “remediation” as a response to leak-prone infrastructure. These amendments
give the Department more authority to require measures other than replacement to address leak-
prone pipe, and the Department intends to enforce these provisions going forward.
The Department thanks the Joint Committee on Telecommunications, Utilities and
Energy and the Joint Committee on Public Safety and Homeland Security for the opportunity to
present this report addressing gas leaks in the natural gas distribution system. As discussed
above, the Department will continue to monitor and work with the gas distribution companies to
ensure that gas leaks are repaired in a timely and cost-efficient manner and to ensure continued
public safety in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. The Department remains engaged and
encouraged by the continuing discussion around the future of natural gas infrastructure.

I. INTRODUCTION
Pursuant to An Act Relative to Natural Gas Leaks, St. 2014, c. 149, § 9 (“Section 9” of
the “Act”), the Department of Public Utilities (“Department”) submits a report on or before
December 31 annually which addresses the prevalence of natural gas leaks in the natural gas
system to the House and Senate Chairs of the Joint Committee on Telecommunications, Utilities
and Energy, and the House and Senate chairs of the Joint Committee on Public Safety and
Homeland Security. Specifically, the report must include, but not be limited to, the following:
(1) the total number of Grade 1, Grade 2, and Grade 3 leaks as classified in G.L. c. 164, § 144
and reported in the previous year; (2) estimates for lost and unaccounted-for natural gas
(“LAUF”) and methane emissions as a result of such Grade 1, Grade 2, and Grade 3 leaks; and
(3) the time and cost estimates for eliminating the backlog of Grade 1, Grade 2, and Grade 3
leaks. St. 2014, c. 149, § 9. The Department is pleased to present this report to the Joint
Committee on Telecommunications, Utilities and Energy and the Joint Committee on Public
Safety and Homeland Security for the calendar year ended December 31, 2023.
Natural gas leaks occur in the gas distribution system for several reasons, including the
age of the infrastructure, corrosion, and damage from other underground construction projects,
also referred to as encroachment.1 A significant reason for the occurrence of natural gas leaks in
Massachusetts is the presence of certain aging, leak-prone infrastructure, including
1 Encroached pipe includes cast-iron pipe, eight inches or less in diameter, that has been
exposed and undermined by a trench crossing the pipeline or by an adjacent, parallel
excavation. 220 CMR 113.06, 113.07.

D.P.U. 24-GLR-01 Page 2
non-cathodically protected steel,2 cast-iron,3 and wrought iron.4 A 2014 study commissioned by
the Department estimated that there were over 6,000 miles of aging infrastructure in
Massachusetts comprising materials that are vulnerable to natural gas leakage. ICF International,
Report on Lost and Unaccounted for Gas (December 23, 2014).5 The Department has
recognized that there may be public safety, service reliability, and environmental issues
associated with the continued existence and aging of leak-prone facilities in gas companies’
distribution systems. New England Gas Company, D.P.U. 10-114, at 56 (2011); Bay State Gas
Company, D.P.U. 09-30, at 133 (2009). Historically, the Department has determined that a
2 Cathodic protection systems help prevent corrosion from occurring on the exterior of
pipes by substituting a new source of electrons, commonly referred to as either a
“sacrificial anode” or “impressed current anode.” Both systems operate by imparting a
direct current onto the buried pipeline, using devices called rectifiers. As long as the
current is sufficient, corrosion is prevented, or at least mitigated and held in check. Fact

3 Gray cast-iron is a cast ferrous material in which a major part of the carbon content
occurs as free carbon in the form of flakes interspersed through the metal. Because the
carbon flakes do not bond with the ferrous material on the molecular level, the metal is
brittle and susceptible to stress cracking under pressure situations. American Gas
Association, Gas Piping Technology Committee.
4 Together with cast-iron, wrought iron pipelines are among the oldest energy pipelines
constructed in the United States. The degrading nature of iron alloys, the age of the
pipelines, and the pipe joint designs have greatly increased the risk involved with the
continued use of such pipelines. Pipeline Replacement Background, United States

sustained replacement of aging infrastructure facilities is appropriate and desirable from a public
policy perspective, given the potential benefits to public safety, service reliability, and the
environment. Boston Gas Company/Colonial Gas Company/Essex Gas Company, D.P.U. 10-55,
at 121 (2010); D.P.U. 10-114, at 56; D.P.U. 09-30, at 133-134. The Department also
acknowledges continuing stakeholder discussions and legislative and policy changes around the
future of natural gas infrastructure, and the Department will remain engaged in those initiatives.
The Department and the gas industry are addressing the challenges posed by certain
aging infrastructure in several ways. First, recognizing the public safety and environmental
issues posed by natural gas leaks, the Department has taken proactive steps to address issues
regarding the replacement or repair of leak-prone infrastructure. In the early 1990s, the
Department promulgated regulations (220 CMR 113.00) prohibiting the installation of cast-iron
pipe for the distribution of gas after April 12, 1991. Beginning in 2009, the Department began
approving targeted infrastructure replacement factor (“TIRF”) programs for several gas
distribution companies to accelerate the replacement of leak-prone infrastructure. Similarly,
pursuant to G.L. c. 164, § 145 (added by St. 2014, c. 149, § 2; amended by St. 2021, c. 8,
§§ 87-89, St. 2022, c. 179, § 58, and St. 2024, c. 239, § 81) (“GSEP Statute”), gas distribution
companies have submitted to the Department accelerated infrastructure replacement plans to
replace aging or leaking natural gas pipeline infrastructure, in the interest of public safety and to
reduce LAUF. On October 31, 2014, seven of the Commonwealth’s gas distribution companies
submitted to the Department their first annual accelerated infrastructure replacement plans,

D.P.U. 24-GLR-01 Page 4
referred to as gas system enhancement plans (“GSEPs”).6 The Department approved the first
GSEPs (for 2015) on April 30, 2015. The Department has since approved the gas distribution
companies’ 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, and 2024 GSEPs, on or about
April 30 of those years.7 Because the intent of the pipeline replacement programs is to reduce
the number of natural gas leaks in the natural gas system, as well as to reduce LAUF and
methane emissions, we discuss the GSEPs in more detail in Section III, below.8
Further, G.L. c. 164, § 144 prescribes a uniform gas leak classification (Grade 1, Grade 2,
or Grade 3) based on the hazard presented by a gas leak and a timeline in which distribution
companies must repair or monitor each leak depending on its grade. Additionally, G.L. c. 164,
§ 144(d) prioritizes the repair of gas leaks detected within a school zone, and G.L. c. 164,
6 The original seven gas distribution companies were: The Berkshire Gas Company; Bay
State Gas Company d/b/a Columbia Gas of Massachusetts; Liberty Utilities (New
England Natural Gas Company) Corp. d/b/a Liberty Utilities; Boston Gas Company and
Colonial Gas Company each d/b/a National Grid; NSTAR Gas Company
d/b/a Eversource Energy; and Fitchburg Gas and Electric Light Company d/b/a Unitil.
As noted below, there have been some recent organizational changes to these seven
companies. The eighth gas distribution company in Massachusetts as of 2014,
Blackstone Gas Company, did not submit a GSEP because its gas distribution system
contained no leak-prone infrastructure.
Under their GSEPs, the gas distribution companies plan to replace a total of
approximately 6,023 miles of aging infrastructure in Massachusetts over 20 years
(beginning in 2015), with the exception that Colonial Gas Company intends to complete
replacement of its aging infrastructure within eleven years, and NSTAR Gas Company
and Boston Gas Company plan to complete their replacements within 25 years.
7 The Department is currently reviewing the gas distribution companies’ 2025 GSEPs, filed
on October 31, 2024, and will issue final Orders on them no later than April 30, 2025.
8 Section III also provides information on the amount of leak-prone infrastructure within
each gas distribution company’s system.

D.P.U. 24-GLR-01 Page 5
§ 144(e) requires gas distribution companies to provide in their annual service quality reports the
location, classification date, and repair dates of each leak existing as of the date of the report. On
March 8, 2019, the Department promulgated final regulations regarding these requirements and
established specific criteria to identify and repair or eliminate environmentally significant
Grade 3 leaks (“SEI”). Uniform Natural Gas Leaks Classification Rulemaking, D.P.U. 16-31-C
(2019); see 220 CMR 114.00, Uniform Natural Gas Leaks Classification.
Finally, on December 12, 2019, pursuant to St. 2018, c. 227, §§ 19 and 23, the
Department promulgated final regulations and guidelines establishing procedures for all gas
distribution companies and municipal gas operators to report LAUF and the components
thereof -- including fugitive emissions from leaks -- annually to the Department in a uniform
manner. LAUF Rulemaking, D.P.U. 19-44-A (2019); see 220 CMR 115.00. The companies
filed their first LAUF reports pursuant to the new regulations and guidelines on or about
March 15, 2020, and have filed their annual LAUF reports on or about March 15 each year
thereafter.
II. PREVALENCE OF NATURAL GAS LEAKS IN THE NATURAL GAS SYSTEM
A. Introduction
General Laws c. 164, § 144, requires the gas distribution companies and municipal gas
operators to grade all reported natural gas leaks based on the hazard posed by the leak, and it
prescribes a timeline for the companies/operators to repair or monitor natural gas leaks
depending on the hazard posed by the leak, as follows:
• A Grade 1 leak represents an existing or probable hazard to persons or
property, and requires repair “as immediately as possible,” continuous action
until the conditions are no longer hazardous, and continuous surveillance until
the hazard or source of the leak is eliminated. G.L. c. 164, § 144(b)(2).

D.P.U. 24-GLR-01 Page 6
• A Grade 2 leak is recognized as non-hazardous to persons or property at the
time of detection, but justifies scheduled repair based on probable future
hazard. This grade of leak must be repaired, or the main replaced, within
twelve months from the date of classification, and must be re-evaluated at
least once every six months until eliminated. G.L. c. 164, § 144(b)(3).
• A Grade 3 leak is recognized as non-hazardous to persons or property at the
time of detection and can be reasonably expected to remain non-hazardous.
This grade of leak must be re-evaluated during the next scheduled survey or
within twelve months from the date last evaluated, whichever occurs first,
until the leak is eliminated or the main replaced. G.L. c. 164, § 144(b)(4).
For the purposes of this report, the Department gathered gas leak data from the following
local gas distribution companies and municipal gas operators in the Commonwealth: The
Berkshire Gas Company (“Berkshire”); Eversource Gas of Massachusetts d/b/a Eversource
Energy (“EGMA”); Liberty Utilities (New England Natural Gas Company) Corp. d/b/a Liberty
Utilities (“Liberty”); Boston Gas Company and Colonial Gas Company d/b/a National Grid
(“National Grid”);9 NSTAR Gas Company d/b/a Eversource Energy (“NSTAR Gas”); Fitchburg
Gas and Electric Light Company d/b/a Unitil (“Unitil”); Holyoke Gas & Electric Department
(“Holyoke”); Middleborough Gas & Electric Department (“Middleborough”); Wakefield
Municipal Gas and Light Department (“Wakefield”); and Westfield Gas & Electric Light
Department (“Westfield”). Section II.B, below, presents a summary of the gas leak data, as
follows: (1) the number of Grade 1, Grade 2, and Grade 3 gas leaks classified pursuant to
9 On December 16, 2019, the Department approved the merger of Boston Gas Company
and Colonial Gas Company with and into Boston Gas Company, within the National Grid
USA holding company system. Boston Gas Company and Colonial Gas Company,
D.P.U. 19-69 (2019). The merger took effect on March 15, 2020.

D.P.U. 24-GLR-01 Page 7
G.L. c. 164, § 144 and reported to the Department in 2023;10 (2) estimates of LAUF and methane
emissions from such leaks for 2023; and (3) time and cost estimates for eliminating the backlog
of Grade 1, Grade 2, and Grade 3 leaks that existed at the end of 2023. Appendix A, attached to
this report, sets forth the company/operator-specific information regarding gas leaks, LAUF,
methane emissions, and time/cost estimates.
The Department notes three significant aspects of this report. First, while this report
provides the number of Grade 1, Grade 2, and Grade 3 leaks identified and existing during 2023,
these data do not represent the number of ongoing, unrepaired leaks as of the date of this report.
Rather, the actual number of natural gas leaks on the gas distribution system may fluctuate daily
for a number of reasons, including the following: (1) gas distribution companies and municipal
gas operators are required to repair Grade 1 leaks “as immediately as possible”; (2) gas
distribution companies and municipal gas operators engage in ongoing repair of Grade 2 and
Grade 3 leaks; and (3) new Grade 1, Grade 2, and Grade 3 leaks generally occur as a result of
encroachment or certain aging infrastructure. Accordingly, the data provided in this report
should be viewed as a cumulative total of Grade 1, Grade 2, and Grade 3 leaks as reported in
calendar year 2023, along with the associated cost estimates to fix the unrepaired leaks that
10 In late 2016 and early 2017, the Department’s Pipeline Safety Division (“Division”)
directed the gas distribution companies and municipal gas operators to begin providing
quarterly reports of gas leak information, including total numbers of leaks by grade. In
addition, pursuant to G.L. c. 164, § 144, the gas companies are required to report in their
annual service quality reports the location of each Grade 1, Grade 2, and Grade 3 leak
existing as of the date of the report, the date each leak was classified, and the dates of
repairs performed on each Grade 1, Grade 2, and Grade 3 leak. In 2019, the Division
began requesting more specific quarterly data pursuant to the new regulations,
220 CMR 114.00.

D.P.U. 24-GLR-01 Page 8
existed on each reporting entity’s gas distribution system as of the end of calendar year 2023.
The report also identifies the number of unrepaired leaks, by grade, existing as of the end of
calendar year 2023.
Second, the LAUF and methane values contained in this report are not categorized by
leak grade, as there is no standard industry approach for calculating LAUF or methane emissions
by leak grade (i.e., LAUF or methane emissions associated only with Grade 1, Grade 2, or
Grade 3 leaks that exclude other causes). Further, the Department has determined that the LAUF
value associated with leakage, as reported to the Department annually by each gas distribution
company and municipal gas operator, is the appropriate measurement to include in this report.11
Third, all gas distribution companies and municipal gas operators report methane
emissions in accordance with the Department of Environmental Protection’s 310 CMR 7.71,
Reporting of Greenhouse Gas Emissions.12 The gas distribution companies and municipal gas
operators have stated that it is the most widely accepted method used by the natural gas industry
to estimate methane emissions from natural gas facilities and, therefore, all leakage on the
natural gas system. See Gas Leaks Report, D.P.U. 15-GLR-01, at 10 (2015). Finally, to present
11 The Department reviewed the LAUF and methane emission estimates that each operator
submitted in the Massachusetts addendum to its Form PHMSA F 7100.1 1, which each
operator files annually with the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration
(“PHMSA”) of the U.S. Department of Transportation, pursuant to 49 C.F.R. Part 191.
In some cases, the Department also reviewed the LAUF reports.
12 Where applicable, this regulation requires gas distribution companies and municipal gas
operators to estimate the average volume of methane emissions by applying the leak
factors identified in the Greenhouse Gas regulations, 40 C.F.R. Part 98, subpart W,
Table W-7, to various types of pipe material.

D.P.U. 24-GLR-01 Page 9
the data in a consistent manner, the Department reports LAUF in million British Thermal Units
(“MMBTU”) and methane emissions in metric tons (“MT”).
B. Gas Leaks on Gas Distribution System
Collectively, the gas distribution companies and municipal gas operators reported a total
of 22,531 leaks on the gas distribution system in 2023 (including leaks carried over from the
prior year and newly identified leaks), classified as follows: (1) 5,033 Grade 1 leaks;
(2) 3,960 Grade 2 leaks; and (3) 13,538 Grade 3 leaks (see Appendix A). As of the end of 2023,
the gas distribution companies and municipal gas operators reported a total of 10,652 gas leaks
remaining on the gas distribution system, classified as follows: (1) 37 Grade 1 leaks;
(2) 593 Grade 2 leaks; and (3) 10,022 Grade 3 leaks (550 SEI and 9,472 non-SEI). The gas
distribution companies and municipal gas operators estimate that it will cost approximately
$17,971,180 to repair the remaining backlog.13 As calculated and described above, the gas
distribution companies and municipal gas operators estimate a total of 341,185.0 MMBTU of
LAUF related to leakage and a total of 16,232.7 MT of methane emissions in 2023.14
Below is a table displaying leak trends categorized by grade since 2014:
13 The time estimates, reported in various ways by each company/operator, are contained in
Appendix A. While there were 10,652 leaks remaining on the distribution system as of
the end of 2023, the companies/operators have already repaired or eliminated a portion of
those leaks during 2024; thus, the repair costs may reflect only part of the backlog that
existed as of the end of 2023.
14 See Appendix A for company/operator-specific information.

Comparing 2023 to 2022, these numbers reflect a 54.17 percent increase in Grade 1
leaks, a 16.36 percent decrease in Grade 2 leaks, a 12.43 percent decrease in Grade 3 leaks, and a
12.52 percent decrease in total leaks. Since 2014, there has been a 56.98 percent decrease in
Grade 1 leaks, a 51.79 percent decrease in Grade 2 leaks, a 48.50 percent decrease in Grade 3
leaks, and a 48.73 percent decrease in total leaks on the system.
The data demonstrate that while the gas distribution companies and municipal gas
operators reported numerous Grade 1, Grade 2, and Grade 3 leaks during calendar year 2023, gas
distribution companies and municipal gas operators also continuously engaged in the ongoing
repair of these leaks, specifically prioritizing Grade 1 leaks, but also repairing significant
numbers of outstanding Grade 2 leaks and Grade 3 leaks. The vast majority of unrepaired leaks
as of the end of calendar year 2023 are those specifically classified as non-hazardous.
Additionally, except for National Grid, all the gas distribution companies and municipal gas
operators repaired their 2023 Grade 1 leaks by the end of 2023.
As discussed above, a significant reason that Grade 1, Grade 2, and Grade 3 gas leaks
continue to be identified and reported is that large portions of the gas distribution system are

D.P.U. 24-GLR-01 Page 11
composed of certain aging infrastructure. We turn now to a discussion of pipeline replacement
programs that are designed to accelerate the repair or replacement of leak-prone pipe and will,
accordingly, result in the elimination of many natural gas leaks.
III. PIPELINE REPLACEMENT PROGRAMS
A. Introduction
The Department has recognized that there may be public safety, service reliability, and
environmental issues associated with the continued existence and aging of leak-prone facilities in
gas companies’ distribution systems. New England Gas Company, D.P.U. 10-114, at 56 (2011);
Bay State Gas Company, D.P.U. 09-30, at 133 (2009). The Department has historically
concluded that a sustained replacement of leak-prone facilities is appropriate and desirable from
a public policy perspective given the potential benefits to public safety, service reliability, and
the environment. D.P.U. 10-114, at 56; Boston Gas Company/Colonial Gas Company/Essex Gas
Company, D.P.U. 10-55, at 121 (2010); D.P.U. 09-30, at 133-134. In the early 1990s, the
Department promulgated regulations (220 CMR 113.00) that prohibited the installation of
cast-iron pipe for gas distribution after April 12, 1991. These regulations required that each gas
distribution company develop and implement cast-iron replacement programs. The regulations
also included a mandatory provision requiring gas distribution companies to immediately replace
cast-iron pipe that has been encroached upon.
Beginning in 2009, the Department approved TIRF programs by which gas distribution
companies could accelerate the repair or replacement of certain types of aging infrastructure.
Specifically, the Department approved proposals to implement TIRF programs for Bay State in
2009, National Grid in 2010, and Liberty in 2010. D.P.U. 10-55, at 122; D.P.U. 09-30, at 134;

D.P.U. 24-GLR-01 Page 12
D.P.U. 10-114, at 56, 76-77. The TIRF programs allowed these companies to recover the
revenue requirement (including depreciation, return on investment, and property taxes) on
investments made to replace leak-prone mains, services, and other facilities through a reconciling
mechanism outside of base rates. D.P.U. 10-55, at 137-138, 145; D.P.U. 10-114, at 35; Bay
State Gas Company, D.P.U. 13-75, at 21 (2014). Through the TIRFs, National Grid, Bay State,
and Liberty Utilities replaced significant amounts of leak-prone infrastructure.15 The TIRF
programs were phased out as the gas distribution companies transitioned to GSEPs for
accelerated pipe replacement. As demonstrated by the TIRFs and now the GSEPs, and as
discussed in greater detail below, Massachusetts has set a course to eliminate leak-prone
infrastructure on an accelerated basis.
B. GSEPs
1. Overview
For those gas distribution companies operating with TIRF programs, the GSEP Statute
replaced the TIRF program for replacement of eligible infrastructure as of January 1, 2015. See
15 Specifically, between 2010 and 2013, Boston Gas eliminated 335 miles of cast iron and
non-cathodically protected steel mains, along with 8,000 services, and Colonial Gas
eliminated 154 miles of cast-iron and non-cathodically protected steel mains, along with
969 services. Boston Gas Company/Colonial Gas Company, D.P.U. 14-132, at 10 n.14
(2015). Between 2010 and 2013, Bay State eliminated 177 miles of cast-iron and
non-cathodically protected steel mains, along with 10,079 services. Bay State Gas
Company d/b/a Columbia Gas of Massachusetts, D.P.U. 14-134, at 9 n.13 (2015).
Finally, between 2010 and 2013, Liberty Utilities eliminated approximately 25 miles of
non-cathodically protected steel or cast-iron/wrought iron mains, along with replacement
of 1,994 services. Liberty Utilities (New England Natural Gas Company) Corp.,
D.P.U. 14-133, Exh. LU-1, at 4 (2015).

G.L. c. 164, § 145 (added by St. 2014, c. 149, § 2; amended by St. 2021, c. 8, §§ 87-89,16 St.
2022, c. 179, § 58,17 and St. 2024, c. 239, § 81). There have been several amendments to the
GSEP Statute since its enactment, most recently on November 20, 2024.18 This report addresses
the prevalence of leaks in calendar year 2023. Accordingly, where the Department references
the GSEP Statute in this section, it is referring to the version that was effective August 11, 2022
to November 19, 2024. Pursuant to the GSEP Statute, each gas distribution company annually
submits a plan to accelerate the replacement of leak-prone infrastructure and to address the leak
rate on the gas company’s natural gas infrastructure. G.L. c. 164, § 145(b) (eff. August 11,
2022). The GSEP Statute also provides as follows:
Each company’s gas infrastructure plan shall include interim targets for the department’s
review. The department shall review these interim targets to ensure each gas company is
meeting the appropriate pace to reduce the leak rate on and to replace the gas company’s
natural gas infrastructure in a safe and timely manner. The interim targets shall be for
periods of not more than 6 years or at the conclusion of 2 complete 3-year walking survey
cycles conducted by the gas company. The gas companies shall incorporate these interim
targets into timelines for removing all leak-prone infrastructure filed pursuant to
16 On March 26, 2021, Governor Baker signed An Act Creating a Next-Generation
Roadmap for Massachusetts Climate Policy, St. 2021, c. 8, § 87, which amended G.L.
c. 164, § 145. Key changes include requirements that (1) companies submit GSEPs
annually, (2) companies include interim targets in their GSEPs, and (3) where practical,
moving meters currently located inside a structure to outside locations.
17 On August 11, 2022, Governor Baker signed An Act Driving Clean Energy and Offshore
Wind, St. 2022, c. 179, § 58, which amended the definition of “eligible infrastructure
replacement” under G.L. c. 164, § 145(a) to include the use of advanced leak repair
technology approved by the Department to repair an existing leak-prone gas pipe to
extend the useful life of the such gas pipe by no less than 10 years; and replacing gas
infrastructure with utility-scale non-emitting renewable thermal energy infrastructure.
18 On November 20, 2024, Governor Healey signed An Act Promoting a Clean Energy
Grid, Advancing Equity and Protecting Ratepayers, St. 2024, c. 239, § 81, which made
several amendments to G.L. c. 164, § 145. For the purposes of this report, references to
the GSEP Statute do not reflect the 2024 amendments.

D.P.U. 24-GLR-01 Page 14
subsection (c) and may update them based on overall progress. The department may levy
a penalty against any gas company that fails to meet its interim target in an amount up to
and including the equivalent of 2.5 per cent of such gas company’s transmission and
distribution service revenues for the previous calendar year.
G.L. c. 164, § 145(b) (eff. August 11, 2022).
Any plan filed with the Department shall include, but not be limited to the following: (i) eligible
infrastructure replacement of mains, services, meter sets and other ancillary facilities composed
of non-cathodically protected steel, cast-iron and wrought iron, which are prioritized to
implement the federal gas distribution pipeline integrity management plan annually submitted to
the Department and consistent with the requirements of 49 C.F.R. § 192.1001 through
§ 192.1015; (ii) an anticipated timeline for the completion of each project; (iii) the estimated cost
of each project; (iv) rate change requests; (v) a description of customer costs and benefits under
the plan; (vi) the relocations, where practical, of a meter located inside of a structure to the
outside of said structure for the purpose of improving public safety; and (vii) any other
information the Department considers necessary to evaluate the plan. G.L. c. 164, § 145(c) (eff.
August 11, 2022). Additionally, the GSEP Statute requires that any plan filed include a timeline
for removing all leak-prone infrastructure on an accelerated basis specifying an annual
replacement pace and program end date with a target end date of either (i) not more than 20 years
from the filing of the initial plan or (ii) a reasonable target end date considering the allowable
cost recovery cap established pursuant to subsection (f). G.L. c. 164, § 145(c) (eff. August 11,
2022).19
19 The GSEP Statute further provides that annual changes in the revenue requirement
eligible for recovery pursuant to the plan shall not exceed (i) 1.5 percent of the gas
company’s most recent calendar year total firm revenues, including gas revenues
attributable to sales and transportation customers, or (ii) an amount determined by the

D.P.U. 24-GLR-01 Page 15
If a plan complies with Section 145 and the Department determines that it reasonably
accelerates eligible infrastructure replacement and provides benefits to customers, the
Department must preliminarily accept the plan either in whole or in part. G.L. c. 164, § 145(e)
(eff. August 11, 2022). The gas distribution company may begin recovering the estimated plan
revenue requirement on May 1 of the year following submission of the plan. G.L. c. 164,
§ 145(e) (eff. August 11, 2022). Subsequently, on or before May 1 of each year, the gas
distribution company must file final project documentation for construction completed during the
previous calendar year to demonstrate substantial compliance with the plan and to demonstrate
that the costs were reasonably and prudently incurred. G.L. c. 164, § 145(f) (eff. August 11,
2022).
On October 31, 2014, the seven gas distribution companies noted above (Unitil,
Berkshire, Liberty, National Grid,20 Bay State, and NSTAR Gas) submitted to the Department
Department that is greater than 1.5 percent of the gas company’s most recent calendar
year total firm revenues, including gas revenues attributable to sales and transportation
customers. G.L. c. 164, § 145(f) (eff. August 11, 2022). In 2019, the Department revised
the cap calculation and raised the cap to three percent, stating that this cap would remain
in effect until further ordered. See, e.g., Fitchburg Gas and Electric Light Company,
D.P.U. 18-GSEP-01, at 30 (2019). The Department may modify a plan prior to approval
at the request of a gas company, or it may make other modifications to a plan as a
condition of approval. G.L. c. 164, § 145(d) (eff. August 11, 2022). The Department is
required to consider the costs and benefits of the plan including, but not limited to,
impacts on ratepayers, reductions of LAUF through a reduction in natural gas system
leaks, and improvements to public safety. G.L. c. 164, § 145(d) (eff. August 11, 2022).
The Department is also required to give priority to plans narrowly tailored to addressing
leak-prone infrastructure most immediately in need of replacement. G.L. c. 164, § 145(d)
(eff. August 11, 2022).
20 Boston Gas Company and Colonial Gas Company submitted a joint GSEP under one
docket number.

D.P.U. 24-GLR-01 Page 16
their first annual GSEPs. As part of its proposed GSEP, each company, among other things,
(1) submitted a plan to repair or replace eligible leak-prone infrastructure during calendar year
2015, (2) estimated a revenue requirement associated with that replacement, and (3) provided a
timeline to repair or replace all leak-prone infrastructure in its gas distribution system. On
April 30, 2015, the Department approved each company’s initial GSEP. The gas distribution
companies have submitted their annual GSEPs on or about each October 31 thereafter, and the
Department has approved them, subject to further review and investigation, to become effective
May 1 of the following year.21 The Department is currently reviewing the companies’ eleventh
annual GSEPs, for calendar year 2025.
Additionally, on or about April 29, 2016, pursuant to G.L. c. 164, § 145(f), these same
gas distribution companies submitted to the Department their first annual GSEP reconciliation
filings (“GRECs”), wherein each company reconciled its actual investments with its planned
investment for calendar year 2015. The Department approved the first GRECs, in substantial
part, on October 31, 2016. The gas distribution companies have submitted their annual GRECs
on or about each May 1 thereafter, and the Department has approved them, wholly or in
substantial part, on or about October 31. The following summarizes the GREC information
reported for each GSEP year:
• 2015 GSEPs: $291.6 million expended to replace 221.24 miles of leak-prone mains
and 11,119 leak-prone services, plus related work.
21 Pursuant to G.L. c. 164, § 145(c), the companies submitted with their 2023 GSEPs a
summary of the GSEP replacement progress to date, the work to be completed over the
next five years, and a discussion of related issues that the companies identified as
impacting the continued effectiveness of the GSEPs.

D.P.U. 24-GLR-01 Page 17

distribution mains (7.96 miles) and 9.80 percent (1,102) of its services are composed of
unprotected bare or coated steel, 11.21 percent (30.41 miles) of its mains and zero percent of its
services are composed of cast-iron or wrought iron, and 0.27 percent of its mains and zero
percent of its services are composed of ductile iron. D.P.U. 23-GSEP-01, at 10. This means that
approximately 14.41 percent of the distribution mains (39.11 miles) and 9.80 percent (1,102
miles) of the distribution services are composed of leak-prone materials. D.P.U. 23-GSEP-01,
at 10.
Historically, beginning in 2000, Unitil replaced a minimum of two miles of leak-prone
pipe per year. D.P.U. 23-GSEP-01, at 10. Unitil’s initial GSEP established a program to replace
all eligible leak-prone infrastructure, including mains, services, meter sets, and other ancillary
facilities, over a 20-year period, with an anticipated replacement rate of 3.5 miles per year.
D.P.U. 23-GSEP-01, at 10. Unitil estimates retiring 6.00 miles of leak-prone main and replacing
354 associated services in 2024. D.P.U. 23-GSEP-01, at 10. Unitil anticipates that all GSEP-
eligible pipe in its service territory will be replaced by the end of 2034. D.P.U. 23-GSEP-01,

Historically, NSTAR Gas replaced an average of 25 miles of leak-prone pipe per year.
D.P.U. 23-GSEP-06, at 9. Pursuant to its initial GSEP, NSTAR Gas estimated that it would
replace all eligible aging infrastructure over a 25-year period, with an anticipated replacement
rate of 50 miles per year following an initial five-year ramp-up period. D.P.U. 23-GSEP-06,
at 9. In its 2021 GSEP, NSTAR Gas extended the ramp-up period by two years to reach a
replacement rate of 60 miles per year and to reduce the overall GSEP program to less than
25 years. D.P.U. 23-GSEP-06, at 9. NSTAR Gas states that because of a ten-mile shortfall in
2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, it will increase its replacement rate by two miles per year
for the five-year period beginning in 2022. D.P.U. 23-GSEP-06, at 9. In 2024, NSTAR Gas

D.P.U. 24-GLR-01 Page 23
anticipates replacing 62 miles of leak-prone main and 3,000 associated services.

IV. CONCLUSION
Pursuant to Section 9 of the Act, the Department has gathered data from gas distribution
companies and municipal gas operators regarding the prevalence of natural gas leaks on the
natural gas system. As indicated above, that data represent the total, cumulative leaks by grade
during calendar year 2023, as well as system-wide LAUF and methane emissions. The data
demonstrate that while the gas distribution companies and municipal gas operators identified
numerous Grade 1, Grade 2, and Grade 3 leaks during calendar year 2023, the gas distribution
companies and municipal gas operators have also continuously engaged in the ongoing repair of
these leaks. More specifically, the gas distribution companies and municipal gas operators have
specifically prioritized repair of Grade 1 leaks, which are defined as hazardous leaks, but have
also repaired significant numbers of outstanding Grade 2 leaks as well as Grade 3 leaks, both of
which are defined as nonhazardous leaks. With the exception of National Grid’s Grade 1 leaks,
all other Grade 1 leaks that occurred on the gas distribution systems during calendar year 2023
had been repaired by the end of 2023.
As discussed above, a major reason that natural gas leaks occur on Massachusetts’ natural
gas distribution system is the presence of certain types of older infrastructure, including
non-cathodically protected steel, cast-iron pipe, and wrought iron pipe, on significant portions of
the system. The Department has historically recognized public safety and environmental issues
posed by natural gas leaks, and it is confident that those issues are being addressed in several
ways, including through implementation of a cast-iron replacement program and the accelerated

D.P.U. 24-GLR-01 Page 24
replacement of aging infrastructure under the GSEPs submitted by the gas distribution
companies with leak-prone pipes. The Department will continue to monitor the progress of the
gas distribution companies in replacing aging infrastructure through review of the gas
distribution companies’ annual GSEP filings, which detail plans to repair or replace aging or
leak-prone infrastructure the following calendar year, and through review of the companies’
annual GREC filings, which detail the repair or replacement work performed in the previous
calendar year.
On December 6, 2023, the Department issued its Order on Regulatory Principles and
Framework in D.P.U. 20-80, the Department’s investigation into the role of gas companies in
achieving the Commonwealth’s 2050 climate goals. In D.P.U. 20-80-B, the Department adopted
policies designed geared generally “toward minimizing additional investment in pipeline and
distribution mains and achieving decarbonization in the residential, commercial, and industrial
sectors.” D.P.U. 20-80-B at 13. According to the Department’s Order, gas companies must
“move beyond ‘business as usual’ in their gas system planning, whether involving proposed
expansion of service to new areas or investments necessary to maintain the safety of existing
natural gas infrastructure.” D.P.U. 20-80-B at 13-14. A gas company’s GSEP represents its plan
for such investments, and the “different lens [to be] applied to gas infrastructure investments
going forward” that the Department described in D.P.U. 20-80-B at 13 is applicable to our
review of GSEP filings. A related requirement from D.P.U. 20-80-B is the obligation imposed
on LDCs to demonstrate that they considered non-gas pipeline alternatives (“NPAs”) as a
condition of recovering additional investment in pipeline and distribution mains. In its Order on
Joint Motion for Clarification Filed by the Gas Local Distribution Companies, the Department

D.P.U. 24-GLR-01 Page 25
clarified that it “did not carve out GSEP or any other project category as exempt from the NPA
analysis requirement in its Order.” D.P.U. 20-80-C at 21.
Further, the 2024 Amendments to the GSEP Statute modify the definition of “eligible
infrastructure investment” to “eligible infrastructure measure,” and thereby include “retirement
or improvement” in addition to “replacement.” Other sections of the 2024 Amendments refer to
“remediating” or “remediation” as a response to leak-prone infrastructure. These amendments
give the Department more authority to require measures other than replacement to address leak-
prone pipe, and the Department intends to enforce these provisions going forward.
The Department thanks the Joint Committee on Telecommunications, Utilities and
Energy and the Joint Committee on Public Safety and Homeland Security for the opportunity to
present this report addressing gas leaks in the natural gas distribution system. As discussed
above, the Department will continue to monitor and work with the gas distribution companies to
ensure that gas leaks are repaired in a timely and cost-efficient manner and to ensure continued
public safety in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. The Department remains engaged and
encouraged by the continuing discussion around the future of natural gas infrastructure.
By Order of the Department,
