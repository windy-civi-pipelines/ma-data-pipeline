Introduction
Property tax exemptions are a powerful policy tool used by state and municipal governments to increase
the affordability of homeownership for residents. Every state offers some form of property tax exemption
to homeowners with many exemptions associated with veteran status. Several veteran property tax
exemptions are based on VA service-connected disability ratings or injuries sustained as a result of military
service.
United States Department of Veteran Affairs Service-Connected Disability
The United States Department of Veteran Affairs (VA) provides eligible veteran with a service-connected
disability rating between 0% to 100%.1 This rating is a percentage assigned to a veteran's disability that
was caused or aggravated by their military service, indicating the degree to which their condition impacts
their ability to work and live a normal life. To obtain a service-connected disability rating, veterans submit
a claim to the VA, which then reviews the claim and assigns a rating.2 Service-connected disability ratings
may change throughout a veteran’s life based on their health as well as policy changes that expand the
VA’s criteria and eligible conditions.
Trends in the National Veteran Population
The percentage of veterans with a service-connected disability has increased since 2008. One study found
that the national percentage of veterans with a service-connected disability doubled between 2008 and
2022, increasing from 15% to 30%.3 In addition to the increase in the number of veterans with a service-
connected disability, the rating tied to the service-connected disability is also increasing. This same study
found that the percentage of veterans having a “high service-connected disability rating” (70% or more)
increased by fivefold from 2.6% to 12.8% between 2008 and 2022.3 The study further suggested that the
prevalence of high service-connected disability ratings is more common among younger veterans,
including 16% of post-9/11 veterans and 13% of Gulf War veterans.3

Trends in the Massachusetts Veteran Population
According to the 2023 American Community survey, Massachusetts had approximately 234,000 veterans
in the state.4 Approximately 57,000 veterans, 24% of the state’s veteran population, reported having
some degree of service-connected disability.4 This reflects an 8% increase in the total number of veterans
reporting a service-connected disability between 2017 and 2023.4 In addition to a higher percent of
veterans reporting a service-connected disability, Massachusetts veterans are reporting higher service-
connected disability ratings. Between 2017 and 2023, the percentage of veterans reporting a service-
connected disability rating of 70%+ increased by 35% from 16,248 to 21,856.5
Expansion of Service-Connected Disability Eligibility and Ratings
The number of veterans with service-connected disability ratings and the average percentage of ratings
have fluctuated over time due to policy changes and the evolving veteran population. One notable change
has been the number of veterans facing mental health challenges, particularly since the beginning of the
Global War on Terror. The Wounded Warrior Project’s most recent survey of post-9/11 veterans noted
that 75.9% of veterans reported experiencing PTSD, 49.8% reported moderate to severe symptoms of two
or more mental health conditions, such as depression and anxiety, and 28.3% reported having suicidal
thoughts in the last 12 months.5 Given the propensity for medical diagnoses to result in a high service-
connected disability rating, the increase in PTSD diagnoses will likely continue to raise the average service-
connected disability rating. Some have argued that increased focus on mental health disorders among
veterans has led to more parity and equity among disabled veterans.6
In addition to increases in mental health disorder diagnoses, the VA has expanded service-connected
disability eligibility and ratings through policy changes. One recent policy, the 2022 PACT Act, increased
VA benefits and enabled more veterans to qualify for service-connected disabilities.7 Nationally, the PACT
Act allowed 161,706 more veterans to enroll in the Veteran Health Administration by expanding

conditions that provide a VA service-connected disability rating.8 In Massachusetts, 1,838 veterans
enrolled in the Veterans Health Administration program as a result of expanded eligibility.9
(i) Veteran Property Tax Exemptions in Other States
Property Tax Exemptions Nationally vs Massachusetts
Property tax exemptions are a widely used policy tool to provide financial benefits to veterans. Currently,
22 states require a 100% disability rating to receive any property tax exemption, with 18 of these states
offering a full exemption to those veterans.9 Additionally, 30 states require a minimum of 50% disability
for a veteran to receive any property tax exemption.10 Few states, including Texas, Louisiana, and Illinois,
utilize a sliding scale exemption model based on the percentage of a veteran's VA disability rating.10
Massachusetts municipalities offer varying veteran property tax exemptions to veterans based on several
factors, including the type and level of disability.10 Massachusetts municipalities also offer property tax
exemptions to unmarried widows of veterans, as well as certain eligible parents. Massachusetts law
provides property tax exemptions via a local option (i.e., state law that allows municipalities the
opportunity to adopt these exemptions). These exemptions are enumerated in Massachusetts General
Law Chapter 59, Section 5, Clauses 22(a-f), 22A, 22B, 22C, 22D, 22E, and 22F.
In most instances, veterans with a service-connected disability between 10% and 90% are eligible for a
$400 tax exemption, while veterans with a 100% service-connected disability are eligible for either a
$1,000 or $1,500 exemption. Certain paraplegic veterans, surviving spouses of servicemembers killed or
missing in action, and parents of servicemembers killed or missing in action may be entitled to a full
property tax exemption. In FY24, veteran property tax exemptions cost the Commonwealth approximately
$27 million in reimbursements to municipalities.11 A complete summary of these exemptions is available
in the table on the next page:

Impact of the HERO Act
The recent passage of the HERO Act allows Massachusetts municipalities the option to double property
tax exemptions for veterans and their families and/or tie the amount to inflation without requiring a Home
Rule Petition. This change provides municipalities across the Commonwealth more flexibility to offer these
exemptions.

(ii) The Utilization of a Sliding Scale System Based on the Percentage of a Veteran’s Disability
for the Awarding of Exemptions to Veterans and Spouses
Currently, only a handful of states utilize a sliding scale based on the percentage of a veteran’s disability.
Below are a few highlighted examples:
Texas
Texas currently offers a principal residence exemption in addition to differing levels of property tax
exemptions based on disability rating and age. The principal residence exemption allows every resident
to exempt $100,000 of the assessed value of the home and includes a local option to exempt up to 20%
of the home’s value.14 In addition to this, Texas offers a sliding scale for veterans based on their service-
connected disability rating from the VA. Texas organizes these exemptions into three categories: 100%
Disabled Veterans, 10%-90% Disabled Veterans, and 10%-90% Disabled Veterans over 65.15
100% Disabled Veterans are entitled to a full property tax exemption; 10%-90% Disabled Veterans are
entitled to a sliding scale property tax exemption based on VA disability rating, in addition to the principal
residence exemption; 10%-90% Disabled Veterans over 65 are entitled to a sliding scale property tax
exemption based on VA disability rating, in addition to the principal residence exemption and an
additional $10,000 Senior Exemption.22 Currently, the following sliding scale system is in place for 10%-
90% Disabled Veterans:
• 10% – 29%: $5,000
• 30% – 49%: $7,500
• 50% – 69%: $10,000
• 70% – 99%: $12,000
• 100%: Full exemption
Louisiana
Louisiana recently revised its veteran property tax exemption through a constitutional amendment,
instituting two types of property tax exemptions for veterans. Veteran homeowners are entitled to the
principal residence exemption, available to all Louisiana homeowners, which provides a $7,500 property

tax exemption.16 In addition to this exemption, veterans are entitled to a sliding scale exemption based
on disability rating.17 This scale begins at a 50% service-connected disability and are grouped into three
tranches based on service-connected disability. The exemption amount is determined by their disability
rating:
• 50%-70%: $2,500
• 71%-99%: $4,500
• 100%: Full Exemption
Illinois
Illinois provides veterans with a principal residence exemption and a full or partial property tax exemption
to disabled veterans who own homes assessed at less than $250,000. The principal residence exemption
provides a $10,000 exemption to residents of Cook County, a $8,000 exemption to counties contiguous
to Cook County, and a $6,000 exemption in all other counties. In addition to the principal residence
exemption, Illinois offers a sliding scale property tax exemption based on VA disability rating, as well as a
specific exemption for Specially-Adapted Housing. The exemption amount is determined by their disability
rating:
• 30% or 40%: $2,500
• 50% or 60%: $5,000
• 70% or more: Full property tax exemption
• Specially-Adapted Housing: $100,000 reduction on the assessed value

(iii) Determination of the Relation of Tax Abatements and Exemptions to United States
Department of Veterans Affairs Disability Rating
A review of the veteran property tax exemption landscape reveals that states apply different models to
determine the amount and eligibility for this widely offered financial benefit. In addition, these models
continue to change as indicated by the 2023 implementation of Louisiana's new property tax exemption
model. A small number of states utilize a sliding scale model to determine exemption amounts and eligible
disability percentages. The vast majority of states do not offer sliding scale property tax exemptions based
on VA disability rating.
Trends in Massachusetts and nationwide indicate a rise in the number of veterans receiving service-
connected disability awards, as well as an increase in the severity of those ratings. Greater awareness of
mental health disorders and policy changes have contributed to more mental health associated diagnoses,
driving up both the number and level of service-connected disability ratings. As a result, the overall growth
seen in service-connected disability awards across Massachusetts would likely impact exemption amounts
and overall costs if a sliding scale model was implemented.
(iv) Financial Impact These Tax Exemptions Have on Veterans with Disabilities
The following section outlines the number of veterans who received property tax exemptions in
Massachusetts between 2020 and 2024. Veterans may be eligible for a Clause 22(a), 22C, 22E or 22F
exemption based on their disability rating.

(v) Anticipated Monetary Cost that the Exemptions May Cause
Methodology
This study attempts to forecast the impact of potential property tax exemption changes based on a
service-connected disability sliding scale. The number of veterans in Massachusetts receiving VA disability
and their respective percentages is estimated based on results from the 2023 American Community
Survey19 and the current number of Massachusetts veterans receiving property tax exemptions.20
Maintaining the 100% service-connected disabled property tax exemption at $1,000 mirrors the current
property tax rate (i.e., $1,000 for 100% service-connected disabled veterans). This results in a Clause E
total cost of $10,687,000, of which $8,816,775 is to be reimbursed from the state to municipalities based
on current reimbursement rates.
To calculate 70%, 80%, and 90% disabled veterans, this study subtracted the total number of Clause E
exemptions from the estimated population of those 70-100% service connected. This assumes full
utilization of the property tax exemption by 100% service-connected disabled within the ACS estimates.
To calculate the property tax exemptions cost for the remaining service-connected disability groups (e.g.,
10% & 20%, 30% & 40%, 50% & 60%), this study multiplied the ACS tier by a utilization rate taken from
FY24 (i.e., the number of exemptions claimed in FY24 divided by total service-connected disabled
population). Lastly, the total cost for FY24 Clause 22D exemptions for surviving spouses are added to the
total cost.
This potential sliding scale model begins at the lowest current exemption of $400 and increases at regular
intervals to the current 100% service-connected disabled rate of $1,000. It also adopts the current state
reimbursement levels and adapts them for the sliding scale model. The model below provides a total
financial impact of the sliding scale system, as well as the total cost to the state after municipal
reimbursements.

municipalities, for a potential change to veterans' property tax exemptions. Of note, while a sliding scale
model provides an option for reimbursement to veteran, it does not fully account for a change in the state
reimbursement for each group. This study uses a proportional increase in state reimbursement per
disability group (e.g., $225 for 10%-40%, $575 for 50%-90%, $825 for 100%).

Conclusion
This study provides a descriptive analysis of the various forms of veteran property tax exemptions across
the United States with a focus on Massachusetts. Although not common, disability sliding scale models to
determine property tax exemptions have been introduced nationally and are operational in several states.
Utilizing a sliding scale model in Massachusetts may result in several benefits: (1) a simpler and systematic
method to determine benefits; (2) additional financial benefits to veterans; and (3) promoting a more
equitable methodology given the rising mental health diagnoses among veterans.
This study does not take into account any changes as a result of the HERO Act, which allows municipalities
to double the property tax exemption for veterans, servicemembers, and their families and/or tie the
amount to inflation without requiring a Home Rule Petition.
To provide as accurate an estimate as possible, the study makes several assumptions regarding the
veteran population, state reimbursement, and municipal adoption. It relies on 2023 American Community
Survey data, which is based on self-reported disability status. This includes veterans who identified as
having a service-connected disability but did not disclose their specific rating, potentially leading to an
undercount due to concerns about privacy, stigma, or reluctance to share their rating. The study also
assumes an approximately 40% property tax utilization rate for ACS tiers less than 100% service-connected
disabled.
The proposed state reimbursement numbers use the current minimum and maximum rates ($225 and
$825) and included a proportionally increasing reimbursement rate based on current rates. The analysis
presumes near-universal adoption of the sliding scale model by municipalities, although actual adoption
rates may vary.
For the purpose of cost estimation, exemptions under Clauses 22B, 22C, and 22F are factored into the
100% service-connected disabled population. Notably, veterans currently receiving Clauses 22B, 22C, or
22F exemptions may see a decrease in their property tax exemption under the analyzed sliding scale
system. Lastly, the total cost estimates of the sliding scale model do not take into account any exemptions
given to Gold Star families under Clause 22H because it is not reimbursed by the state.
