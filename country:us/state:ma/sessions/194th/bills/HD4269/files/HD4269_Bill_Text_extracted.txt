Acknowledgment
The Massachusetts State Domestic Violence Fatality Review Team would like to thank Governor
Healey and Lt. Governor Driscoll for their commitment to supporting survivors of domestic
violence, sexual assault, and human trafficking across the state.
This year, the Healey-Driscoll Administration has made significant strides with the Governor’s
Council to Address Sexual Assault, Domestic Violence, and Human Trafficking. Governor Healey
has signed several vital pieces of legislation, including:
• An Act Criminalizing Sexual Assault by Fraud Committed by Medical Professionals
• An Act Modernizing Firearms Laws
• An Act to Prevent Abuse and Exploitation
Additionally, the Healey-Driscoll administration filed a supplemental budget, which was
approved. It includes funding for the VOCA Bridge program, which aims to enhance support for
crime victims.
We would also like to thank the Massachusetts District Attorneys Association, the
Commonwealth’s District Attorneys, and staff for continuing to dedicate their time and efforts
to facilitating review sessions.
Last but certainly not least, we would like to thank the local community partners who
participate in local reviews each year. Our work would not be possible without their support
and contributions to these review sessions.
A Note from the Chair
As Chair of the State Domestic Violence Fatality Review Team, I present our annual report with
a heavy heart and a commitment to preventing domestic violence fatalities in our state. Each
case we reviewed represents a life cut short—a family member, friend, or neighbor whose
death was preventable.
This past year, we analyzed three domestic violence fatalities to understand the circumstances
surrounding these tragedies and identify ways to intervene. Our findings highlight patterns and
gaps in our system that, if addressed, could improve our response to domestic violence. The
report includes specific recommendations for enhancing response, social service provision, and
community awareness. Each recommendation stems from the analysis of domestic violence
fatalities in our state.
We owe it to those who have lost their lives and to those impacted by domestic violence to
learn from these tragedies and implement meaningful changes. This report not only serves as a
memorial to those we’ve lost but as a roadmap to prevent future deaths.
I want to extend my gratitude to Anjeza Xhemollari (a true rockstar behind the scenes), the
State Team, Local Teams, and state partners for their commitment to these reviews. Thank you
for your expertise and dedication to preventing future domestic violence fatalities.
I encourage you to read this report with an eye toward action. Whether you're a legislator,
service provider, law enforcement officer, educator, or simply a neighbor, you have the power
to prevent domestic violence fatalities. Let's work together to make a difference.
Sincerely,
Vilma Uribe

*Committee on Judicial Ethics Opinion on Judicial Service on
Statutory Commissions
Under Committee on Judicial Ethics Opinion No. 2014-4, "Serving on Statutory Commissions,"
dated December 10, 2014, judges are not permitted to serve on the State Team,
notwithstanding their inclusion in the statute (Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Trial Court,
2014).
Judges may designate non-judiciary employees as representatives on the state team. These
designees are subject to the same limitations as the judges and cannot exceed the scope of
their delegated authority. When judges serve in consulting roles, their limited participation
must be clearly documented in all commission materials, and they must explicitly state that
they take no position on the commission's findings and recommendations.
The State Team continues to work with the Trial Court and the Family and Probate Court to
identify and designate individuals who can fulfill the limited consulting function outlined below.
Roles and Responsibilities
State Team
The State Domestic Violence Fatality Review Team was created by Chapter 260 of the Acts of
2014, An Act Relative to Domestic Violence. Chapter 260 was passed unanimously by the
Legislature and signed into law on August 8, 2014. The purpose of the State Team is to decrease
preventable domestic violence fatalities. To achieve its purpose, the State Team conducts
comprehensive analyses of domestic violence fatalities, examining the causes, frequency, and
circumstances surrounding these incidents, including murder-suicides, in collaboration with
Local Teams. Based on these reviews, the team provides recommendations to the Governor
and Legislature regarding essential modifications to existing laws, policies, and practices to
prevent domestic violence fatalities.

• Sign and execute a confidentiality agreement to protect sensitive information.
• Collect, maintain, and provide confidential data as the state review team requires for
fatality case reviews.
• In collaboration with the State Team, conduct thorough reviews of individual fatality
cases, utilizing established protocols.
• Recommend strategies to enhance coordination and collaboration between regional
agencies and service providers.
• Provide relevant information to law enforcement or other agencies to support the
protection of domestic violence victims and the accountability of perpetrators.
Philosophy and Process
The Mission Statement, Values, and Process are reviewed and read aloud at the start of all
fatality review sessions. They provide a template for decision-making throughout the review.
Mission Statement
The State Team provides strategic leadership for and conducts collaborative, multi-disciplinary
reviews of domestic violence-related fatalities with local review teams to better understand the
dynamics of such deaths and develop recommendations—without blame—for creative and effective
strategies to reduce the number of domestic violence deaths across the state.
Core Values
The State Team conducts in-depth reviews of three intimate partner homicides and related fatalities
annually, collaborating with Local Teams to ensure a comprehensive examination.
The review team operates under a "no blame, no shame" philosophy. This approach allows the
State Team to conduct impartial investigations without casting blame on individuals or agencies
involved in the fatalities being examined. Instead, the focus is on identifying systemic failures within
local and state response systems that may have contributed to these tragic events.
The team aims to identify systemic issues and develop practical solutions to prevent future
fatalities. These solutions may include public awareness campaigns, education initiatives, and
community empowerment programs.
By fostering collaboration and a nonjudgmental environment, the team strives to gain a
comprehensive understanding of the challenges involved and ultimately improve overall safety
outcomes.
Recommendations are de-identified and provided in general terms to maintain confidentiality for
those involved in each case.
The Review Process
Each review session takes place in the county where the crime was committed and involves a Local
Team chaired by the District Attorney with jurisdiction over the case.
In conjunction with the State Team, the Local Team requests all available information and connects
with relevant parties. This includes consulting with law enforcement and gathering criminal
histories, medical records, autopsy reports, and other case histories. The aim is to gather as much
background information as possible to accurately portray the victim, perpetrator, and those who
knew the individuals who lost their lives.
Before the review, the local review chair creates a timeline of events from all gathered information
and shares this with team members during the discussion. This exercise is designed to expose
strengths and weaknesses in the system, get a better understanding of relationship dynamics,
understand who the formal and informal support networks were and what they knew, determine
any history of help-seeking and offender accountability and the outcomes, and help the review
team understand the circumstances leading up to the fatality. Once the review team convenes, the
members continue to refine the timeline until they have exhausted all available information.
After each session, members identify practical recommendations and measurable objectives. The
State Team monitors the progress and measures the success of any recommendations ultimately
implemented.
The State and Local Teams operate under strict confidentiality. All materials, reports, and timelines
used and created during meetings are not part of the public record.
Data
National Incident-Based Reporting System Data
The National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS) collects detailed data on crimes reported to
police, including offense types and victim and offender characteristics. NIBRS collects demographic
data on victims of crimes, including:
• Sex of Victim: This data element categorizes victims as male, female, or unknown.
• Race of Victim: This data element categorizes victims into specific racial categories, including
White, Black or African American, American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, Native Hawaiian
or Other Pacific Islander, or Unknown.
• Ethnicity of Victim: This optional data element categorizes victims as Hispanic or Latino, Not
Hispanic or Latino, or Unknown.
• Resident Status of Victim: This optional data element indicates whether the victim was a
resident or nonresident of the jurisdiction where the crime occurred, not their immigration
or citizenship status.
It is important to note that NIBRS data may only partially capture the experiences of LGBTQIA+ and
communities of color due to limitations in data collection and reporting practices.1 These groups
may face unique forms of victimization and discrimination that may not be adequately reflected in
current data collection methods.
Massachusetts NIBRS Data
The data below outlines domestic violence-related charges in Massachusetts from 2020 to 2023.
These offenses pertain to individuals such as spouses, intimate partners, children, and other family
members. Aggravated assault charges include assault and battery with a dangerous weapon,
strangulation, and assault on a pregnant woman. Note that these figures reflect the total number of
offenses, not the number of arrests.
In 2023, there were 26,463 domestic violence incidents reported to law enforcement in
Massachusetts. A disproportionate number of domestic violence victims in 2023 were female,
1 The acronym LGBTQIA+ represents a diverse range of gender and sexual identities, including
lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, questioning, intersex, and asexual, as well as those
identities yet to be fully defined.
accounting for 71% of fatalities. Males were victims in 29% of cases. While 70% of offenders were
male and 30% were female.
Domestic Violence Incidents (NIBRS 2023 Data)
Incident Murder And Kidnapping/Abduction Aggravated Simple Intimidation
Date Non- Assault Assault
Negligent
Manslaughter
2020 21 290 5,690 16,026 3,347
2021 18 341 5,739 16,400 3,531
2022 28 299 6,102 16,760 3,498
2023 26 308 6,072 16,566 3,147
Domestic violence-related crime rates declined in several categories in 2023: murder and non-
negligent manslaughter (-7.14%), aggravated assault (-0.05%), simple assault (-1.16%), and
intimidation (-10.03%). However, there has been a slight increase in kidnapping/abduction (3.01%).
While we have seen a decline in most categories, these rates demonstrate the need for improved
prevention programming and continued survivor support.
The Complexities of Domestic Violence Data
Data analysis and fatality reviews are essential tools for unraveling the complexities of domestic
violence fatalities. While data analysis can provide a quantitative overview of trends and patterns, it
often falls short of capturing the nuanced dynamics of domestic violence. Law enforcement data,
frequently focused on isolated incidents, provides limited information on the broader context of
abuse, including, but not limited to, economic control, emotional abuse, and coercive control.
Limited information sharing across jurisdictions and lack of connection between multiple incidents
involving the same parties limit the insights gleaned from these data. These issues often hinder a
comprehensive understanding of the factors leading to domestic violence fatalities.
In-depth domestic violence fatality reviews can complement data analysis by delving into the
specific circumstances of each case. These reviews can identify missed opportunities for
intervention, uncover patterns in system responses, and reveal barriers that prevent victims from
seeking help. This qualitative approach allows for a more comprehensive understanding of the
factors contributing to lethal violence, including economic factors, cultural barriers, and the impact
on children and communities.
By combining detailed data analysis of domestic violence fatalities with in-depth reviews of
individual cases, the State Team develops a comprehensive understanding of the factors
contributing to these tragic events across the state. This integrated approach informs the evidence-
based recommendations presented in this document.
Recommendations
In 2024, we conducted three comprehensive domestic fatality reviews throughout the year in
partnership with designated District Attorneys and their local community partners. Below are the
recommendations developed by the State Teams in collaboration with the Local Teams.
R1: Implement Reverse Search for Active Abuse Protection
Orders
Police officers can access restraining order information in two main ways:
• Board of Probation (BOP) Record: This information is maintained by the courts and is
integrated into the Criminal Justice Information System (CJIS), which is accessible to law
enforcement. It is important to note that BOP records only disclose restraining order
information when the offender's name is queried. The victim’s name appears on the order,
but results will not appear if you search for the victim.
• National Crime Information Center (NCIC) Database: This is a database managed by the
Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and is also populated with information from the courts,
which is then provided to the Department of Criminal Justice Information Services (DCJIS).
Similar to the BOP records, NCIC databases will only return restraining order information
when the offender is queried. The victim’s name is included in the file, and results will not
return if you search for the victim.
It is important to understand that the information contained in CJIS and NCIC does not originate
from DCJIS; instead, it reflects data that has been received from the courts.
Recommendation 1
A reverse search system can significantly enhance law enforcement's situational awareness by
providing real-time access to critical information. This improved access can help reduce response
times and increase safety for both victims and officers.
Importantly, the system would not only flag current abuse protection orders against the individual
being searched, but it would also identify any past orders, orders issued across different
jurisdictions, and any orders the individual may have against someone else. This enhanced
capability enables more comprehensive threat assessments.
Therefore, we recommend implementing real-time access to a reverse search system that is
integrated with local, state, and federal law enforcement and judicial databases. This system should
flag any active protection orders the person has against another individual during routine traffic
stops or in response to calls involving suspects or individuals of concern. This will improve law
enforcement interventions and enhance victim safety.
R2: Expand Access to Virtual Hearings for Abuse Prevention
Orders
The COVID-19 pandemic, though devastating, presented an opportunity for many courts to
reevaluate their operations and make changes that better serve the public. During the pandemic,
courts were forced to adopt technology, such as virtual hearing rooms, to ensure access to justice
despite the global crisis. While it is crucial to understand that technology should not replace the
fundamental principles of justice, there are benefits that extend beyond the pandemic and can
continue to be utilized. In particular, the use of videoconferencing technology during civil abuse
prevention order cases (e.g., 209A and 258E) has proven beneficial.
While remote hearings are not the same as in-person court hearings, there are various examples of
their applicability in cases involving vulnerable individuals. Remote hearings have been used in
criminal cases involving child victims of sexual abuse to protect them from the trauma of facing
their alleged abusers (Carpenter, 2022; Maryland v. Craig, 1990). This precedent suggests that
similar accommodations can be made in 209A and 258E hearings to safeguard victims from further
emotional distress, ensuring their well-being and facilitating their participation in legal proceedings.
Moreover, virtual hearings for abuse protection orders could help streamline the legal process by
reducing delays, particularly amid busy court schedules. Victims can attend hearings from safe
locations, which is particularly beneficial for those with mobility issues, children, or those in rural or
remote areas with limited transportation access.
Lastly, offering virtual hearings could also address the logistical difficulties of in-person court
attendance, which can lead to increased absences or delays. Some domestic violence victims miss
hearings due to scheduling conflicts or fear of re-engagement with the abuser. Virtual hearings can
mitigate these issues, leading to better legal outcomes.
Recommendation 2
The State Team recommends expanding access to optional virtual hearings for abuse prevention
orders in all courts as a measure to prevent domestic violence fatalities. We also recommend
providing clear guidelines for virtual attendance in civil abuse prevention order cases to judges,
court staff, and the public, ensuring victims' privacy and security, and offering virtual notifications to
defendants regarding restraining orders.
R3: Expand High-Risk Teams in All District Attorney Offices
To effectively address the rising prevalence of domestic violence cases, particularly those involving
repeat offenders or escalating violence, the expansion of High-Risk Teams (HRTs) within all District
Attorney (DA) offices is essential. High-risk teams provide a multi-disciplinary approach to managing
these complex cases, ensuring that victims receive the support they need and that offenders are
effectively monitored and managed. Researchers have found that targeted domestic violence
interventions can significantly reduce the risk of homicide for high-risk victims (Jelveh et al., 2024).
These teams typically include law enforcement, prosecutors, victim advocates, and domestic
violence providers, and mental health professionals, working collaboratively to assess risk and
coordinate responses. By identifying lethality factors, such as previous police contact, access to
firearms, and a history of violent behavior, these teams can prioritize cases with the highest risk of
homicide or serious injury. The structured approach increases coordination between criminal justice
agencies and victim services, resulting in better outcomes for victims. Importantly, these teams are
positioned to intervene in cases where other traditional responses may fall short, offering a more
comprehensive and tailored approach to victim safety.
The role of high-risk teams is especially critical for cases that involve repeat offenders or escalating
violence, as they provide a multi-disciplinary approach to managing the risks. Counties with high-risk
teams saw a decrease in repeat incidents of intimate partner violence compared to those without
such specialized teams. These teams, which typically consist of law enforcement, prosecutors,
victim advocates, and mental health professionals, provide a comprehensive approach to managing
high-risk offenders and ensuring that victims receive timely support.
Further, high-risk teams increase coordination between criminal justice agencies and victim
services, leading to better outcomes for victims. High-risk teams are uniquely positioned to
intervene in cases where other responses may be inadequate. The need to expand these teams to
address the growing prevalence of high-risk domestic violence cases, particularly in areas with
limited resources, is crucial. Such teams help to ensure that victims at the highest risk of homicide
or serious injury receive coordinated, tailored support while repeat offenders are more effectively
managed.
Recommendation 3
To prevent future domestic violence fatalities, we recommend expanding domestic violence high-
risk teams to all District Attorney offices across the state. These multidisciplinary teams should
include experts from law enforcement, legal services, victim advocacy organizations, and healthcare
professionals. They will work together to offer a wide range of support services.
A critical component of this expansion is dedicated funding to hire a full-time high-risk coordinator
in each District Attorney's office. The coordinator's responsibilities will include conducting
comprehensive risk assessments, managing case referrals, facilitating multi-agency coordination
across jurisdictions, and developing prevention and intervention strategies. By implementing this
approach, we can create a more proactive, collaborative system to identify and support high-risk
domestic violence situations, ultimately saving lives and protecting vulnerable individuals.
R4: Increase the Awareness of Domestic Violence Resources
Among Immigrant and Refugee Communities
Immigrant communities face unique challenges when it comes to domestic violence awareness and
support. Language barriers, lack of knowledge about available resources, fear of law enforcement
due to concerns about immigration status, and cultural stigmas often prevent individuals from
seeking help. Immigrant victims of domestic violence are less likely to report abuse or seek support
services because of fear of the police, deportation, or the language barriers when trying to access
services (Kasturirangan et al., 2004). To address these barriers, targeted resources are needed for
refugee and immigrant communities, especially in school districts where families often have a
higher presence.
As the United States becomes increasingly linguistically diverse, with the number of non-English
speakers nearly tripling in recent decades (U.S. Department of State, 2024), it is essential for
statewide multilingual campaigns to ensure that domestic violence prevention messages and
resources are accessible to all communities. People are more likely to seek help when they know
resources are available in their native language and tailored to their cultural needs. Providing
culturally and linguistically appropriate services can enhance engagement with victims of domestic
violence from immigrant and non-English-speaking communities.
Recommendation 4
The State Team recommends funding and implementing multilingual social media campaigns to
promote domestic violence resources in Massachusetts. This should involve collaboration with state
agencies to create targeted advertisements and consistently promote these resources, especially in
family welcome centers, shelters, and resettlement agencies.
R5: Increase Access to Child Witness to Violence Programs or
Similar Programs
Comprehensive prevention services are a critical strategy in reducing domestic violence fatalities. By
providing accessible resources, counseling, legal support, and safety planning, communities can
create a protective network that interrupts the escalation of violent patterns and provides survivors
with meaningful alternatives and support.
Children impacted by domestic violence and parental incarceration represent a particularly
vulnerable population that requires targeted, holistic support. Further developing and expanding
dedicated programs for these children should focus on comprehensive, trauma-informed
approaches that address their unique emotional, psychological, and social needs. These programs
should offer counseling, mentorship, educational support, and opportunities for healthy
relationship modeling to help children develop resilience and break potential cycles of violence.
Implementing wrap-around services for children who have witnessed domestic violence is crucial,
drawing inspiration from successful overdose response models. These integrated services should
provide multi-layered support that addresses immediate trauma, long-term psychological impacts,
and potential risk factors. Such comprehensive interventions would include mental health
counseling, family support systems, educational interventions, and community-based resources
designed to create a supportive environment for healing and prevention.
However, these critical support services face significant challenges due to ongoing fiscal challenges
such as federal funding cuts and the post-ARPA fiscal cliff effect. Domestic violence prevention and
support programs are experiencing substantial cuts across multiple funding sources, threatening the
sustainability of essential services. These funding constraints not only limit the scope and reach of
existing programs but also impede the development of innovative approaches to addressing
domestic violence and supporting survivors and their families.
Addressing these challenges requires a coordinated approach involving governmental agencies,
nonprofit organizations, community leaders, and policymakers to ensure stable, comprehensive
support for those affected by domestic violence.
Recommendation 5
In times of fiscal constraint, government leaders face a critical strategic decision: whether to reduce
spending or make strategic investments that create long-term value. Our recommendation is
unequivocal: invest to grow. Specifically, investing in domestic violence prevention and support
programs represents both a moral imperative and a fiscally responsible approach to addressing
domestic violence.
Targeted investments in domestic violence support services, particularly innovative programs
addressing the needs of children impacted by domestic violence and parental incarceration, offer
significant promise. These programs can potentially interrupt intergenerational cycles of trauma,
reduce future social service and criminal justice costs, and support the healthy development of
vulnerable children and families.
The State Team strongly urges the legislature to provide consistent, stable funding for victim
services, with a specific focus on programs experiencing federal funding reductions, such as those
traditionally supported by the Victims of Crime Act (VOCA). By strategically allocating state
resources to bridge funding gaps, the legislature can ensure the continuity of critical support
services, prevent service interruptions, and demonstrate a commitment to protecting the most
vulnerable community members.
This strategic investment addresses the urgent challenge of reducing domestic violence fatalities
while also fostering community resilience, public safety, and long-term social stability. By providing
sustained and targeted support for domestic violence prevention, we are investing in the overall
well-being of our communities.
Looking Forward: 2025
As recommended in previous reports, we look forward to working with the legislature to implement
recommendation two from the 2023 State Team Report.
The goals are to address two issues regarding membership limitations and record-sharing limitations
that need to be addressed to conduct effective reviews, as outlined below.
• Membership Limitations: The current law, MGL Chapter 6A, Section 18N, limits the
participation of necessary state agencies and community stakeholders on the State Team,
impacting the review process and information collection.
Recommendation: In 2017 and 2023, the State Team recommended reviewing and
o
amending the current law to address membership limitations.
• Record Sharing Limitations: The current law, MGL Chapter 6A, Section 18N, also limits the
ability to directly access relevant information from state agencies such as DTA and DCF,
medical institutions, and others.
Recommendation: To address this challenge, as highlighted in previous years, we
o
recommend updating the current law to address record-sharing challenges

domestic violence whose lives were
tragically cut short. May their stories
inspire us to continue the fight for justice
and safety.

Acknowledgment
The Massachusetts State Domestic Violence Fatality Review Team would like to thank Governor
Healey and Lt. Governor Driscoll for their commitment to supporting survivors of domestic
violence, sexual assault, and human trafficking across the state.
This year, the Healey-Driscoll Administration has made significant strides with the Governor’s
Council to Address Sexual Assault, Domestic Violence, and Human Trafficking. Governor Healey
has signed several vital pieces of legislation, including:
• An Act Criminalizing Sexual Assault by Fraud Committed by Medical Professionals
• An Act Modernizing Firearms Laws
• An Act to Prevent Abuse and Exploitation
Additionally, the Healey-Driscoll administration filed a supplemental budget, which was
approved. It includes funding for the VOCA Bridge program, which aims to enhance support for
crime victims.
We would also like to thank the Massachusetts District Attorneys Association, the
Commonwealth’s District Attorneys, and staff for continuing to dedicate their time and efforts
to facilitating review sessions.
Last but certainly not least, we would like to thank the local community partners who
participate in local reviews each year. Our work would not be possible without their support
and contributions to these review sessions.

A Note from the Chair
As Chair of the State Domestic Violence Fatality Review Team, I present our annual report with
a heavy heart and a commitment to preventing domestic violence fatalities in our state. Each
case we reviewed represents a life cut short—a family member, friend, or neighbor whose
death was preventable.
This past year, we analyzed three domestic violence fatalities to understand the circumstances
surrounding these tragedies and identify ways to intervene. Our findings highlight patterns and
gaps in our system that, if addressed, could improve our response to domestic violence. The
report includes specific recommendations for enhancing response, social service provision, and
community awareness. Each recommendation stems from the analysis of domestic violence
fatalities in our state.
We owe it to those who have lost their lives and to those impacted by domestic violence to
learn from these tragedies and implement meaningful changes. This report not only serves as a
memorial to those we’ve lost but as a roadmap to prevent future deaths.
I want to extend my gratitude to Anjeza Xhemollari (a true rockstar behind the scenes), the
State Team, Local Teams, and state partners for their commitment to these reviews. Thank you
for your expertise and dedication to preventing future domestic violence fatalities.
I encourage you to read this report with an eye toward action. Whether you're a legislator,
service provider, law enforcement officer, educator, or simply a neighbor, you have the power
to prevent domestic violence fatalities. Let's work together to make a difference.
Sincerely,
Vilma Uribe

*Committee on Judicial Ethics Opinion on Judicial Service on
Statutory Commissions
Under Committee on Judicial Ethics Opinion No. 2014-4, "Serving on Statutory Commissions,"
dated December 10, 2014, judges are not permitted to serve on the State Team,
notwithstanding their inclusion in the statute (Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Trial Court,
2014).
Judges may designate non-judiciary employees as representatives on the state team. These
designees are subject to the same limitations as the judges and cannot exceed the scope of
their delegated authority. When judges serve in consulting roles, their limited participation
must be clearly documented in all commission materials, and they must explicitly state that
they take no position on the commission's findings and recommendations.
The State Team continues to work with the Trial Court and the Family and Probate Court to
identify and designate individuals who can fulfill the limited consulting function outlined below.

Roles and Responsibilities
State Team
The State Domestic Violence Fatality Review Team was created by Chapter 260 of the Acts of
2014, An Act Relative to Domestic Violence. Chapter 260 was passed unanimously by the
Legislature and signed into law on August 8, 2014. The purpose of the State Team is to decrease
preventable domestic violence fatalities. To achieve its purpose, the State Team conducts
comprehensive analyses of domestic violence fatalities, examining the causes, frequency, and
circumstances surrounding these incidents, including murder-suicides, in collaboration with
Local Teams. Based on these reviews, the team provides recommendations to the Governor
and Legislature regarding essential modifications to existing laws, policies, and practices to
prevent domestic violence fatalities.

Philosophy and Process
The Mission Statement, Values, and Process are reviewed and read aloud at the start of all
fatality review sessions. They provide a template for decision-making throughout the review.
Mission Statement
The State Team provides strategic leadership for and conducts collaborative, multi-disciplinary
reviews of domestic violence-related fatalities with local review teams to better understand the
dynamics of such deaths and develop recommendations—without blame—for creative and effective
strategies to reduce the number of domestic violence deaths across the state.
Core Values
The State Team conducts in-depth reviews of three intimate partner homicides and related fatalities
annually, collaborating with Local Teams to ensure a comprehensive examination.
The review team operates under a "no blame, no shame" philosophy. This approach allows the
State Team to conduct impartial investigations without casting blame on individuals or agencies
involved in the fatalities being examined. Instead, the focus is on identifying systemic failures within
local and state response systems that may have contributed to these tragic events.
The team aims to identify systemic issues and develop practical solutions to prevent future
fatalities. These solutions may include public awareness campaigns, education initiatives, and
community empowerment programs.
By fostering collaboration and a nonjudgmental environment, the team strives to gain a
comprehensive understanding of the challenges involved and ultimately improve overall safety
outcomes.
Recommendations are de-identified and provided in general terms to maintain confidentiality for
those involved in each case.
The Review Process
Each review session takes place in the county where the crime was committed and involves a Local
Team chaired by the District Attorney with jurisdiction over the case.
In conjunction with the State Team, the Local Team requests all available information and connects
with relevant parties. This includes consulting with law enforcement and gathering criminal

histories, medical records, autopsy reports, and other case histories. The aim is to gather as much
background information as possible to accurately portray the victim, perpetrator, and those who
knew the individuals who lost their lives.
Before the review, the local review chair creates a timeline of events from all gathered information
and shares this with team members during the discussion. This exercise is designed to expose
strengths and weaknesses in the system, get a better understanding of relationship dynamics,
understand who the formal and informal support networks were and what they knew, determine
any history of help-seeking and offender accountability and the outcomes, and help the review
team understand the circumstances leading up to the fatality. Once the review team convenes, the
members continue to refine the timeline until they have exhausted all available information.
After each session, members identify practical recommendations and measurable objectives. The
State Team monitors the progress and measures the success of any recommendations ultimately
implemented.
The State and Local Teams operate under strict confidentiality. All materials, reports, and timelines
used and created during meetings are not part of the public record.

Data
National Incident-Based Reporting System Data
The National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS) collects detailed data on crimes reported to
police, including offense types and victim and offender characteristics. NIBRS collects demographic
data on victims of crimes, including:
• Sex of Victim: This data element categorizes victims as male, female, or unknown.
• Race of Victim: This data element categorizes victims into specific racial categories, including
White, Black or African American, American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, Native Hawaiian
or Other Pacific Islander, or Unknown.
• Ethnicity of Victim: This optional data element categorizes victims as Hispanic or Latino, Not
Hispanic or Latino, or Unknown.
• Resident Status of Victim: This optional data element indicates whether the victim was a
resident or nonresident of the jurisdiction where the crime occurred, not their immigration
or citizenship status.
It is important to note that NIBRS data may only partially capture the experiences of LGBTQIA+ and
communities of color due to limitations in data collection and reporting practices.1 These groups
may face unique forms of victimization and discrimination that may not be adequately reflected in
current data collection methods.
Massachusetts NIBRS Data
The data below outlines domestic violence-related charges in Massachusetts from 2020 to 2023.
These offenses pertain to individuals such as spouses, intimate partners, children, and other family
members. Aggravated assault charges include assault and battery with a dangerous weapon,
strangulation, and assault on a pregnant woman. Note that these figures reflect the total number of
offenses, not the number of arrests.
In 2023, there were 26,463 domestic violence incidents reported to law enforcement in
Massachusetts. A disproportionate number of domestic violence victims in 2023 were female,
1 The acronym LGBTQIA+ represents a diverse range of gender and sexual identities, including
lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, questioning, intersex, and asexual, as well as those
identities yet to be fully defined.

accounting for 71% of fatalities. Males were victims in 29% of cases. While 70% of offenders were
male and 30% were female.
Domestic Violence Incidents (NIBRS 2023 Data)
Incident Murder And Kidnapping/Abduction Aggravated Simple Intimidation
Date Non- Assault Assault
Negligent
Manslaughter
2020 21 290 5,690 16,026 3,347
2021 18 341 5,739 16,400 3,531
2022 28 299 6,102 16,760 3,498
2023 26 308 6,072 16,566 3,147
Domestic violence-related crime rates declined in several categories in 2023: murder and non-
negligent manslaughter (-7.14%), aggravated assault (-0.05%), simple assault (-1.16%), and
intimidation (-10.03%). However, there has been a slight increase in kidnapping/abduction (3.01%).
While we have seen a decline in most categories, these rates demonstrate the need for improved
prevention programming and continued survivor support.
The Complexities of Domestic Violence Data
Data analysis and fatality reviews are essential tools for unraveling the complexities of domestic
violence fatalities. While data analysis can provide a quantitative overview of trends and patterns, it
often falls short of capturing the nuanced dynamics of domestic violence. Law enforcement data,
frequently focused on isolated incidents, provides limited information on the broader context of
abuse, including, but not limited to, economic control, emotional abuse, and coercive control.
Limited information sharing across jurisdictions and lack of connection between multiple incidents
involving the same parties limit the insights gleaned from these data. These issues often hinder a
comprehensive understanding of the factors leading to domestic violence fatalities.
In-depth domestic violence fatality reviews can complement data analysis by delving into the
specific circumstances of each case. These reviews can identify missed opportunities for
intervention, uncover patterns in system responses, and reveal barriers that prevent victims from
seeking help. This qualitative approach allows for a more comprehensive understanding of the
factors contributing to lethal violence, including economic factors, cultural barriers, and the impact
on children and communities.

By combining detailed data analysis of domestic violence fatalities with in-depth reviews of
individual cases, the State Team develops a comprehensive understanding of the factors
contributing to these tragic events across the state. This integrated approach informs the evidence-
based recommendations presented in this document.

Recommendations
In 2024, we conducted three comprehensive domestic fatality reviews throughout the year in
partnership with designated District Attorneys and their local community partners. Below are the
recommendations developed by the State Teams in collaboration with the Local Teams.
R1: Implement Reverse Search for Active Abuse Protection
Orders
Police officers can access restraining order information in two main ways:
• Board of Probation (BOP) Record: This information is maintained by the courts and is
integrated into the Criminal Justice Information System (CJIS), which is accessible to law
enforcement. It is important to note that BOP records only disclose restraining order
information when the offender's name is queried. The victim’s name appears on the order,
but results will not appear if you search for the victim.
• National Crime Information Center (NCIC) Database: This is a database managed by the
Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and is also populated with information from the courts,
which is then provided to the Department of Criminal Justice Information Services (DCJIS).
Similar to the BOP records, NCIC databases will only return restraining order information
when the offender is queried. The victim’s name is included in the file, and results will not
return if you search for the victim.
It is important to understand that the information contained in CJIS and NCIC does not originate
from DCJIS; instead, it reflects data that has been received from the courts.
Recommendation 1
A reverse search system can significantly enhance law enforcement's situational awareness by
providing real-time access to critical information. This improved access can help reduce response
times and increase safety for both victims and officers.
Importantly, the system would not only flag current abuse protection orders against the individual
being searched, but it would also identify any past orders, orders issued across different
jurisdictions, and any orders the individual may have against someone else. This enhanced
capability enables more comprehensive threat assessments.
Therefore, we recommend implementing real-time access to a reverse search system that is
integrated with local, state, and federal law enforcement and judicial databases. This system should

flag any active protection orders the person has against another individual during routine traffic
stops or in response to calls involving suspects or individuals of concern. This will improve law
enforcement interventions and enhance victim safety.
R2: Expand Access to Virtual Hearings for Abuse Prevention
Orders
The COVID-19 pandemic, though devastating, presented an opportunity for many courts to
reevaluate their operations and make changes that better serve the public. During the pandemic,
courts were forced to adopt technology, such as virtual hearing rooms, to ensure access to justice
despite the global crisis. While it is crucial to understand that technology should not replace the
fundamental principles of justice, there are benefits that extend beyond the pandemic and can
continue to be utilized. In particular, the use of videoconferencing technology during civil abuse
prevention order cases (e.g., 209A and 258E) has proven beneficial.
While remote hearings are not the same as in-person court hearings, there are various examples of
their applicability in cases involving vulnerable individuals. Remote hearings have been used in
criminal cases involving child victims of sexual abuse to protect them from the trauma of facing
their alleged abusers (Carpenter, 2022; Maryland v. Craig, 1990). This precedent suggests that
similar accommodations can be made in 209A and 258E hearings to safeguard victims from further
emotional distress, ensuring their well-being and facilitating their participation in legal proceedings.
Moreover, virtual hearings for abuse protection orders could help streamline the legal process by
reducing delays, particularly amid busy court schedules. Victims can attend hearings from safe
locations, which is particularly beneficial for those with mobility issues, children, or those in rural or
remote areas with limited transportation access.
Lastly, offering virtual hearings could also address the logistical difficulties of in-person court
attendance, which can lead to increased absences or delays. Some domestic violence victims miss
hearings due to scheduling conflicts or fear of re-engagement with the abuser. Virtual hearings can
mitigate these issues, leading to better legal outcomes.
Recommendation 2
The State Team recommends expanding access to optional virtual hearings for abuse prevention
orders in all courts as a measure to prevent domestic violence fatalities. We also recommend
providing clear guidelines for virtual attendance in civil abuse prevention order cases to judges,
court staff, and the public, ensuring victims' privacy and security, and offering virtual notifications to
defendants regarding restraining orders.

R3: Expand High-Risk Teams in All District Attorney Offices
To effectively address the rising prevalence of domestic violence cases, particularly those involving
repeat offenders or escalating violence, the expansion of High-Risk Teams (HRTs) within all District
Attorney (DA) offices is essential. High-risk teams provide a multi-disciplinary approach to managing
these complex cases, ensuring that victims receive the support they need and that offenders are
effectively monitored and managed. Researchers have found that targeted domestic violence
interventions can significantly reduce the risk of homicide for high-risk victims (Jelveh et al., 2024).
These teams typically include law enforcement, prosecutors, victim advocates, and domestic
violence providers, and mental health professionals, working collaboratively to assess risk and
coordinate responses. By identifying lethality factors, such as previous police contact, access to
firearms, and a history of violent behavior, these teams can prioritize cases with the highest risk of
homicide or serious injury. The structured approach increases coordination between criminal justice
agencies and victim services, resulting in better outcomes for victims. Importantly, these teams are
positioned to intervene in cases where other traditional responses may fall short, offering a more
comprehensive and tailored approach to victim safety.
The role of high-risk teams is especially critical for cases that involve repeat offenders or escalating
violence, as they provide a multi-disciplinary approach to managing the risks. Counties with high-risk
teams saw a decrease in repeat incidents of intimate partner violence compared to those without
such specialized teams. These teams, which typically consist of law enforcement, prosecutors,
victim advocates, and mental health professionals, provide a comprehensive approach to managing
high-risk offenders and ensuring that victims receive timely support.
Further, high-risk teams increase coordination between criminal justice agencies and victim
services, leading to better outcomes for victims. High-risk teams are uniquely positioned to
intervene in cases where other responses may be inadequate. The need to expand these teams to
address the growing prevalence of high-risk domestic violence cases, particularly in areas with
limited resources, is crucial. Such teams help to ensure that victims at the highest risk of homicide
or serious injury receive coordinated, tailored support while repeat offenders are more effectively
managed.
Recommendation 3
To prevent future domestic violence fatalities, we recommend expanding domestic violence high-
risk teams to all District Attorney offices across the state. These multidisciplinary teams should
include experts from law enforcement, legal services, victim advocacy organizations, and healthcare
professionals. They will work together to offer a wide range of support services.

A critical component of this expansion is dedicated funding to hire a full-time high-risk coordinator
in each District Attorney's office. The coordinator's responsibilities will include conducting
comprehensive risk assessments, managing case referrals, facilitating multi-agency coordination
across jurisdictions, and developing prevention and intervention strategies. By implementing this
approach, we can create a more proactive, collaborative system to identify and support high-risk
domestic violence situations, ultimately saving lives and protecting vulnerable individuals.
R4: Increase the Awareness of Domestic Violence Resources
Among Immigrant and Refugee Communities
Immigrant communities face unique challenges when it comes to domestic violence awareness and
support. Language barriers, lack of knowledge about available resources, fear of law enforcement
due to concerns about immigration status, and cultural stigmas often prevent individuals from
seeking help. Immigrant victims of domestic violence are less likely to report abuse or seek support
services because of fear of the police, deportation, or the language barriers when trying to access
services (Kasturirangan et al., 2004). To address these barriers, targeted resources are needed for
refugee and immigrant communities, especially in school districts where families often have a
higher presence.
As the United States becomes increasingly linguistically diverse, with the number of non-English
speakers nearly tripling in recent decades (U.S. Department of State, 2024), it is essential for
statewide multilingual campaigns to ensure that domestic violence prevention messages and
resources are accessible to all communities. People are more likely to seek help when they know
resources are available in their native language and tailored to their cultural needs. Providing
culturally and linguistically appropriate services can enhance engagement with victims of domestic
violence from immigrant and non-English-speaking communities.
Recommendation 4
The State Team recommends funding and implementing multilingual social media campaigns to
promote domestic violence resources in Massachusetts. This should involve collaboration with state
agencies to create targeted advertisements and consistently promote these resources, especially in
family welcome centers, shelters, and resettlement agencies.
R5: Increase Access to Child Witness to Violence Programs or
Similar Programs
Comprehensive prevention services are a critical strategy in reducing domestic violence fatalities. By
providing accessible resources, counseling, legal support, and safety planning, communities can

create a protective network that interrupts the escalation of violent patterns and provides survivors
with meaningful alternatives and support.
Children impacted by domestic violence and parental incarceration represent a particularly
vulnerable population that requires targeted, holistic support. Further developing and expanding
dedicated programs for these children should focus on comprehensive, trauma-informed
approaches that address their unique emotional, psychological, and social needs. These programs
should offer counseling, mentorship, educational support, and opportunities for healthy
relationship modeling to help children develop resilience and break potential cycles of violence.
Implementing wrap-around services for children who have witnessed domestic violence is crucial,
drawing inspiration from successful overdose response models. These integrated services should
provide multi-layered support that addresses immediate trauma, long-term psychological impacts,
and potential risk factors. Such comprehensive interventions would include mental health
counseling, family support systems, educational interventions, and community-based resources
designed to create a supportive environment for healing and prevention.
However, these critical support services face significant challenges due to ongoing fiscal challenges
such as federal funding cuts and the post-ARPA fiscal cliff effect. Domestic violence prevention and
support programs are experiencing substantial cuts across multiple funding sources, threatening the
sustainability of essential services. These funding constraints not only limit the scope and reach of
existing programs but also impede the development of innovative approaches to addressing
domestic violence and supporting survivors and their families.
Addressing these challenges requires a coordinated approach involving governmental agencies,
nonprofit organizations, community leaders, and policymakers to ensure stable, comprehensive
support for those affected by domestic violence.
Recommendation 5
In times of fiscal constraint, government leaders face a critical strategic decision: whether to reduce
spending or make strategic investments that create long-term value. Our recommendation is
unequivocal: invest to grow. Specifically, investing in domestic violence prevention and support
programs represents both a moral imperative and a fiscally responsible approach to addressing
domestic violence.
Targeted investments in domestic violence support services, particularly innovative programs
addressing the needs of children impacted by domestic violence and parental incarceration, offer
significant promise. These programs can potentially interrupt intergenerational cycles of trauma,

reduce future social service and criminal justice costs, and support the healthy development of
vulnerable children and families.
The State Team strongly urges the legislature to provide consistent, stable funding for victim
services, with a specific focus on programs experiencing federal funding reductions, such as those
traditionally supported by the Victims of Crime Act (VOCA). By strategically allocating state
resources to bridge funding gaps, the legislature can ensure the continuity of critical support
services, prevent service interruptions, and demonstrate a commitment to protecting the most
vulnerable community members.
This strategic investment addresses the urgent challenge of reducing domestic violence fatalities
while also fostering community resilience, public safety, and long-term social stability. By providing
sustained and targeted support for domestic violence prevention, we are investing in the overall
well-being of our communities.

Looking Forward: 2025
As recommended in previous reports, we look forward to working with the legislature to implement
recommendation two from the 2023 State Team Report.
The goals are to address two issues regarding membership limitations and record-sharing limitations
that need to be addressed to conduct effective reviews, as outlined below.
• Membership Limitations: The current law, MGL Chapter 6A, Section 18N, limits the
participation of necessary state agencies and community stakeholders on the State Team,
impacting the review process and information collection.
Recommendation: In 2017 and 2023, the State Team recommended reviewing and
o
amending the current law to address membership limitations.
• Record Sharing Limitations: The current law, MGL Chapter 6A, Section 18N, also limits the
ability to directly access relevant information from state agencies such as DTA and DCF,
medical institutions, and others.
Recommendation: To address this challenge, as highlighted in previous years, we
o
recommend updating the current law to address record-sharing challenges
