Annual Report to Support Implementation of
Chapter 205 of the Acts of 2008
An Act Further Protecting Children
Introduction
This report was prepared to comply with Section 5 of Chapter 205 of the Acts of 2008,
"An Act Further Protecting Children" which provides that:
Notwithstanding any general or special law to the contrary, . . . the trial
court shall establish and implement an annual reporting system that shall
provide information to the joint committee on the judiciary relative to the
prosecution and disposition of cases which involve offenses established
under this act. The reporting system shall be established not later than
December 31, 2008, and the first annual report shall be filed with the clerk
of the house and the clerk of the senate and the joint committee on the
judiciary not later than December 31, 2009.
In meeting this reporting requirement, this annual report summarizes the changes made
by the legislation and presents relevant data on this population through state fiscal year
2023.
Chapter 205 Legislative Summary
Chapter 205 of the Acts of 2008, entitled "An Act Further Protecting Children" was
approved on July 24, 2008.1 This legislation made the following changes to the offense
structure in Massachusetts:
 Created three new crimes:
o Indecent A&B on Child, Aggravated
o Rape of Child, Aggravated
o Rape of Child with Force, Aggravated
1 On June 4, 2008 House 4811 was engrossed by a vote of 143 to 3; on July 15, 2008 it was engrossed in
the Senate by a vote of 35 to 1; and on July 24, 2008 it was signed by Governor Patrick.
1

 Broadened the subsequent offender provisions for three crimes:2
o Indecent A&B on Child, Subsequent
o Rape of Child, Subsequent
o Rape of Child with Force, Subsequent
 Established six new mandatory sentencing provisions:
o Indecent A&B on Child, Aggravated
o Rape of Child, Aggravated
o Rape of Child with Force, Aggravated
o Indecent A&B on Child, Subsequent
o Rape of Child, Subsequent
o Rape of Child with Force, Subsequent
Table 1 summarizes changes in the penalty structure and offenses that were created under
this legislation. In this annual report, the focus was placed on those six offenses
representing the new offenses and broadened offense elements. All of those six offenses
involve new mandatory minimum penalties ranging from 10 years to 20 years. All of
these offenses are in the sole jurisdiction of the Superior Court Department in
Massachusetts. Offenders convicted and sentenced under these provisions will be
sentenced to the Department of Correction.
2 Previous requirement was prior conviction of the same offense and current legislation calls for prior
conviction of any enumerated sex offense.

Historical Data on Chapter 205 Related Offenses
As background to the current analysis, relevant information on offenders convicted of sexual
assaults on children is considered. While Chapter 205 impacts only a small proportion of these
offenders – those who meet the subsequent or aggravated provisions provided by the legislation
– this background information should be useful for providing a context for considering the
implementation of these legislative provisions.
The following tables are based on annual statistical reports from the Massachusetts Sentencing
Commission and the Department of Correction and show the following information on selected
sex offenders:
 The number of offenders sentenced in the Superior Court;
 The number of offenders incarcerated in the Department of Correction; and,
 The number of offenders committed to the Department of Correction.
As shown in Table 2, in FY 2018 125 offenders were sentenced for Indecent Assault and Battery
on a Child, Rape of a Child, or Forcible Rape of a Child (including all subsequent or aggravated
offense convictions) in the Superior Court Department in Massachusetts. While these statistics
are based solely on governing offense, this substantially accounts for most sex offenders, as for
most convicted sex offenders, the sex offense is their governing offense.3

3 The Massachusetts Sentencing Commission estimates that 4.3% of sex offenders convicted in the Superior Court
Department were convicted of an offense other than a sex offense as the governing offense. (Massachusetts
Sentencing Commission, Survey of Superior Court Sentencing Practices, FY 2018).
4 The source of these data is the Massachusetts Sentencing Commission, Survey of Sentencing Practices, FY 2010 to
FY 2013, and Massachusetts Sentencing Commission, Survey of Superior Court Sentencing Practices), FY 2018.

Table 3 shows the number of offenders currently incarcerated in the Department of Correction
for selected sex offenses for selected years from the period 2010 to 2024. As shown in Table 3,
as of January 1, 2024 there were 656 offenders incarcerated in Department of Correction
facilities for the offenses of Forcible Rape of Child, Rape of Child, and Indecent Assault and
Battery on a Child.

Chapter 205 Report Statistical Results
As indicated in the reporting plan submitted in December 2008, the types of information
available in the annual report to the legislature would include the number of individuals charged,
the status of the case at the end of the reporting period, the number of defendants sentenced
under this legislation, and the length of sentences imposed. The methodology used to implement
this reporting system is contained in the Appendix.
As noted earlier, Chapter 205 became effective on October 22, 2008. Those who were charged
with any one of the six designated sex offenses on or after that date were subject to the
mandatory sentencing provisions of Chapter 205. The following table shows the results of the
data collection efforts for those charged with a Chapter 205 offense where the offense occurred
between October 22, 2008, and June 30, 2024, the end of FY 2024. This table is limited to those
cases where one or more of the charges were one of the six Chapter 205 offenses (e.g.
subsequent or aggravated charge with an underlying offense of forcible rape of child, rape of
child, or indecent assault and battery of child).
Some of the findings shown in Table 5 are:
 There were 2,036 cases identified where one or more of the charges was potentially
subject to the provisions of Chapter 205;
 These 2,036 cases involve 1,930 individual defendants;
 Of the 2,036 cases, 381 are currently pending and 1,655 have been disposed;
 Of the disposed cases, 1,152 resulted in a conviction and sentence and 503 cases had
some other disposition (e.g. nolle prosequi, not guilty, dismissed, or no bill);
 Of the 1,152 convicted cases, 325 were disposed by a jury trial, 24 were disposed by a
bench trial, and 803 were disposed by a plea of guilty;
 Of the 503 cases that were disposed of in some other manner, 240 were nolle prosequi, 51
were dismissed, 240 were nolle prosequi, and the remaining cases had some other
disposition;7
 Of the 1,152 convicted cases, 1,091 resulted in a period of incarceration including 404
mandatory sentences, 611 other sentences to the Department of Correction, and 76 other
sentences to a house of correction. In the 61 remaining cases, there were four sentences to
probation to be served from and after a sentence to incarceration in the state prison on
another case, 56 other sentences to probation, and one other sentence;
 Of the 404 mandatory sentences imposed, 206 sentences were longer than the mandatory
minimum. Of the 667 Department of Correction sentences for non-mandatory offenses,
67 sentences were 10 years or more in length.
7 In accordance with Commonwealth vs. JF (2023), charges disposed as not guilty, a finding of no probable cause, or
where a grand jury returns no true bill, will be sealed automatically pursuant to G.L. c.276 s. 100C.

Summary
This report is intended to meet the requirements established by the Legislature under
Chapter 205. It is the intention of the Executive Office of the Trial Court to maintain this
annual reporting requirement by continued follow-up of pending cases along with
reporting new cases that come before the court. The Executive Office of the Trial Court
looks forward to continued work with the legislature on the implementation and
monitoring of this legislation and welcomes suggestions or comments for further
improvement of this effort.

Appendix - Chapter 205 Reporting Methodology
As noted in the planning report submitted in December 2008, the annual reporting system
is required to consider the prosecution and disposition of cases under these provisions.
At a minimum the reporting system should include the number of new cases filed, the
number of cases resulting in a conviction, and the sentence imposed for those cases. The
governing offense and secondary offenses were included. In order to be fiscally
responsible, the reporting strategy relied on existing automated systems or statistical
reporting systems.
The legislation requires that the annual reports be submitted no later than December 31.
As recommended in the planning report submitted in December 2008, the annual reports
submitted to the legislature include the most recent state fiscal year as well as a follow-up
of cases identified in prior reports. The initial study sample was all defendants arraigned
in Superior Court with one or more charges for a sex offense. From this initial broader
sample, those cases where the specific provisions of Chapter 205 applied were selected
for further data collection and analysis.
Chapter 205 was approved effective July 24, 2008 and became effective on
October 22, 2008. All of the cases that were classified as potential Chapter 205 that were
charged during the period July 1, 2008 through October 31, 2008 were considered to be
charged under the old law. District court arraignment dates were reviewed to determine
the status of those cases charged from November 2008 through June 2009 which are
currently disposed to ascertain the applicability of the Chapter 205 provisions. For those
cases charged in FY 2010 or later, it was assumed that the provisions of Chapter 205
were applicable.
Two data sources were used to measure the number of cases charged under the new and
revised section of the legislation – the Trial Court's case management system
(MassCourts) and the Office of the Commissioner of Probation criminal records system
(CARI database). The Office of the Commissioner of Probation has information on
arraignments and provided the number of new arraignments for selected offenses over the
sampling period for FY 2009 – FY 2017. The Trial Court's case management system was
used to identify the number of new arraignments for selected offenses for FY 2018 – FY
2024.
All the offense and descriptive information was reviewed to identify sex offense charges.
All cases involving kidnapping, "Attempt to Commit a Crime" or "Conspiracy" were
further reviewed to determine if the offense should be considered a sexual offense. Some
of the sex offense related cases might have other types of charges associated with them.
For example, a case might involve a sex offense and a weapons offense charge. For each
case involving at least one sex offense charge, all of the charges were selected,
representing those individuals arraigned in a superior court with one or more charges for
a sex offense.
9

All charges from the MassCourts database were included even if some were arraigned at
a prior period of time. For purposes of this analysis at least one of the charges was
arraigned in the current sampling period. The unit of analysis for this report is a case and
individual defendants can be in the sample more than once if they have multiple cases.
Further analysis was done of those cases from the initial sample with one or more charges
for a sex offense. Based on those charges, defendants in the sample were assigned to one
of four groups:
 Chapter 205 sex offenses (one or more charges for an offense impacted by
Chapter 205);
 Child sex offenses (one or more charges for an offense not covered by Chapter
205 but involving a child victim);
 Other sex offenses (one or more charges of any other type of sex offense); and,
 Other offenses (one or more charges for attempt of a sex offense or other charges
under a separate docket arraigned on the same date as a sex offense case).
For both FY 2018-2024 cases and previously identified cases, the current status of the
case was determined from both the CARI database and the MassCourts database. The
status of the case was determined through December 31, 2024. Cases were assigned to
one of two statuses: pending (including active and suspended cases) and disposed.8
Cases that were awaiting sentencing were considered pending. All the offenses that are
subject to the provisions of Chapter 205 are under the jurisdiction of the Superior Court
Department and are subject to the Criminal Case Management standards adopted by the
Trial Court.9 Cases involving rape are assigned to track "C" and other sex offense cases
are assigned to track "B" with presumptive trial dates of 360 days and 270 days
respectively. In this annual report, it is expected that many of the cases subject to the
provisions of Chapter 205 will be active at the time of the data collection for this report.
For those cases that have been disposed, the type of disposition and sentence was
collected using the data available in both the CARI database and the MassCourts
database. Data collection on sentence structure was based on the method used by the
Massachusetts Sentencing Commission in the on-going survey of sentencing practices.
Type of disposition included the following categories: dismissed, nolle prosequi, not
guilty finding, not guilty verdict, guilty plea, guilty finding, and guilty verdict.
Where the offender had multiple charges in the case, the disposition reflects the most
serious disposition in the case (e.g. guilty, not guilty, dismissed, nolle prosequi). For
purposes of reporting the longest sentence is used to classify the case. In some instances,
an offender may be convicted of a less serious offense than the Chapter 205 offense and
this is reported.
8 As part of this review, a case previously reported in the 15 year mandatory category for the FY 2011
cohort was re-assigned to the 10 year mandatory category. This defendant has two cases: the first case
resulted in a conviction for a 10 year mandatory for an FY 2011 case and the second case resulted in a
sentence of 15 years but this was re-classified as a non-mandatory sex offense.
