CHAIRMAN'S WELCOME
On behalf of the Advisory Council, we are delighted to present to you the Massachusetts Workers' Compensation Advisory Council Annual
Report for FY 2024. The Council appreciates the meaningful work of the Department of Industrial Accidents (DIA). In FY 2024, the DIA
leaned into multi-year IT modernization projects that include automating the safety grant application process, digitizing insurance
records that are currently on microfilm, and reimagining the DIA website so that it is easily accessible. As we look ahead, the DIA team is
in the process of updating its stakeholder publications; it is a good trend and these efforts should continue. The DIA seniorleadership
continues to have conversations on the medical reimbursement fee structure with the Executive Office of Health and Human Services,
which sets the rates for payment for hospitals, physicians, and other health care providers. Lastly, the DIA senior leadership team is
cognizant of its operating expenses and the potential impacts on the annual assessment rate; and has worked stabilize the assessment
rate to reduce major shifts year over year.
We'd like to thank DIA Director Sheri Bowles for continuing to effectively lead the team and overseeing the management of teams,
especially in a hybrid work environment. Thank you also to Senior Judge Omar Hernández for leading the adjudicatory process and for the
success of the mediation program, and to the entire DIA management team for their dedication to the Commonwealth of Massachusetts
Workers’ Compensation System.
Over the past year, DIA has welcomed new employees and recognized the retirement of a few employees--we thank all employees for
their contributions and dedication to supporting injured workers and DIA’s mission.
The Council believes that the Massachusetts Workers' Compensation system remains a system that is held in high regard inthis country. As
we look ahead, the Council will continue its focus on collaborating with all stakeholders to enhance the system.
Notable highlights from FY24 include:
❑ Maintained the stability of the assessment rate
❑ Maintained the integrity of the administrative processes and pursued system upgrades and IT modernization
❑ Expanded the mediation program
❑ Listened to all stakeholders concerns about the medical reimbursement rates and the impartial fee schedule regulations
andunderstanding that revisions will be helpful to the Workers’ Compensation system.
Respectfully,
John A.Pulgini, Esq. Todd R. Johnson JD, AIC, ARM-P, ARM-E 2

DIA | Division of Dispute Resolution
Mediation Process
 Under the supervision of the senior judge, the Division of
Dispute Resolution assists in the voluntary settlement of cases
through a fair and efficient system for solving disputed
workers' compensation cases.
 The DIA instituted court sponsored mediations in 2016.
Mediations were created by Senior Judge Omar Hernández of
the DIA as well as several attorneys working with the
Massachusetts Bar Association's Workers' Compensation
Section Council. The mediation process was brought in to
bring trials down while bringing up claims resolutions –
mediation adds another dispute resolution step to the
workers' compensation litigation practice and generally takes
place before the case is tried at an evidentiary hearing.
 200+ mediations (on average) have taken place at the DIA
over the last fiscal year.
 The dedication of the Administrative Judges and attorneys is
what makes the mediation program successful. The feedback
has been overwhelmingly positive, parties are taking
advantage of the added process, and no case is too small for
mediation.

DIA | Opioid
Alternative Treatment
Pathway
 DIA's Opioid Alternative Treatment Pathway (OATP)
continues to be an effective resource for those injured
workers who unfortunately have become dependent on
high levels of opioids.
 The insurer or injured worker can initiate a request to
participate in the OATP. If both parties agree to
participate, the insurer incurs the cost of the program
including alternative medical treatment for the injured
worker. There is minimal cost (staff/scheduling)
incurred by the DIA for the program.
 In FY 2024, three more individuals successfully entered
the OATP.
 With support from the Massachusetts Department of
Public Health Occupational Health Surveillance
Program, the Department of Industrial Accidents, and
the support of several of their colleagues, Cora
Roelofs,ScD, produced a guidance document to assist
providers in reducing or eliminating long-term opioid
therapy through tapering for their injured worker
patients. Cora developed a comprehensive best
practice guide to help primary care providers overcome
the numerous barriers to reducing opioid dependence
to patients with legitimate prescriptions.

“
"The Office of Investigations continued on its mission to ensure all
employers are in compliance with Massachusetts General Laws
governing Workers’ Compensation. Investigators issued Stop Work
Orders (SWOs) to a wide variety of employers, ensuring equal
enforcement across all levels of employment. As a result
of the proactive enforcement efforts, over 4,100 additional employees
are now covered by workers’ compensation insurance. While
