About the JJPAD Board
In April 2018, the Legislature passed An Act Relative to Criminal Justice Reform, which created the
Juvenile Justice Policy and Data (JJPAD) Board under M.G.L. Chapter 119, Section 89. The Legislature
charged the JJPAD Board with evaluating juvenile justice system policies and procedures, making
recommendations to improve outcomes based on that analysis, and reporting annually to the
Governor, the Chief Justice of the Trial Court, and the Legislature.

Executive Summary
Massachusetts has made a concerted effort to directly and indirectly decrease the use of
pretrial detention for youth over the past decade-plus by limiting the circumstances in which
youth are detained pretrial, as well as limiting overall youth contact with the juvenile justice
system. This effort has been driven by a growing body of research showing pretrial detention
stays – for any length of time – can be harmful and result in negative outcomes for youth and
public safety.1
At the same time, the effort to keep youth out of pretrial detention has impacted other aspects
of the juvenile justice system, specifically throughout the pretrial phase (post-arraignment and
pre-disposition). However, until this report, those impacts have not been publicly assessed or
reported.
This report is particularly timely in light of the increase in juvenile justice cases in Massachusetts
following the Covid-19 pandemic, even though overall numbers remain lower than pre-
pandemic levels. Between FY21 and FY23, there was a striking 110% increase in the number of
cases assigned pretrial conditions of release, rising from 628 cases with pretrial conditions of
release in FY21 to 1,316 in FY23. Although this increase can partly be attributed to a 70%
increase in arraignments, the data also shows a concerning shift away from releasing youth on
personal recognizance (PR) over the same time period. In FY23, only 62% of youth were initially
released on PR, down from 68% in FY21.
Additionally, there was a 39% increase in pretrial detention admissions, from 553 in FY21 to 768
in FY23. On average, about a third of all detention admissions in this period are due to a bail or
PR revocation. These trends underline the importance of addressing the rising reliance on
detention and pretrial conditions while ensuring youth have the supports they need to be
successful and avoid future delinquency.

The Juvenile Justice Policy and Data (JJPAD) Board, which was created by An Act Relative to
Criminal Justice Reform (2018), was charged by the Legislature with evaluating juvenile justice
system policies and procedures and making recommendations to improve outcomes based on
that analysis.2 In 2023, the Board launched a project to study the pretrial phase in
Massachusetts.
What is the “juvenile pretrial phase” in Massachusetts?
The “juvenile pretrial phase” encompasses juvenile justice processes and proceedings after a
youth is arraigned in Juvenile Court (“post-arraignment”) and before their case is disposed via an
adjudication, a dismissal, or Continued Without a Finding “CWOF” (“pre-disposition”). Events
during this phase can include, but are not limited to:
• Bail hearings
• 58A “Dangerousness” hearings
• Placement on pretrial monitoring or supervision by the Massachusetts Probation Services
• Placement in detention with the Department of Youth Services (“pretrial detention”)
This report largely focuses on delinquency cases. However, many of the themes, findings, and
recommendations can apply to youthful offender cases as well.
Findings
Based on information gathered from over 70 stakeholder interviews, national research, dozens
of JJPAD subcommittee discussions and presentations, an analysis of available data, and a
review of Massachusetts’ and other states’ policies, the Board has found:

Section 2:
1. Pretrial conditions for youth can be developmentally inappropriate or not tailored to their
specific cases. Stakeholders interviewed for this report repeatedly expressed that “kids are
different,” and the current pretrial system is not designed with the unique circumstances
and developmental stage of youth in mind. The time in which youth can be involved in
Juvenile Court – adolescence (i.e., 12-17 years old in MA) – is a distinct period in life, one in
which the brain is still anatomically developing, making some aspects of the pretrial phase
particularly difficult for youth to comply with. Interviewees mentioned that a common
reason youth violate their pretrial conditions is because the conditions were not appropriate
and/or were unachievable for a youth.

task-force
8
This concept was reflected in the national research reviewed for this project as well.
Research suggests conditions of release should be developmentally appropriate, focus on
safety, and relate to the underlying offense.

Section 3:
2. Restrictive conditions, most notably GPS and home confinement, are overused. Many
Massachusetts professionals are concerned that restrictive conditions like GPS monitoring
and home confinement conditions are overused in the state’s juvenile justice system as an
unintended consequence and result of the state’s effort to limit the use of detention. While
the Board does not have data to measure this perceived shift, many stakeholders could
point to instances in which GPS was overused or used in inappropriate circumstances. Those
interviewed generally agreed that being released on GPS was the “lesser of two evils” when
compared to being detained. At the same time, many felt as though the harm caused by
being placed on a GPS unit was not well understood across all Massachusetts juvenile court
stakeholders, and some professionals are skeptical that the adoption of GPS was effective at
limiting detention admissions.
National research generally shows that GPS and other forms of electronic monitoring (EM)
as a condition of release are developmentally inappropriate and not necessarily effective at
promoting public safety or improving failure to appear rates.

Section 4:
3. The pretrial process lasts too long, causing harm to youth. While the Juvenile Court time
standards clearly state delinquency proceedings are to be disposed within six to eight
months, in practice, the pretrial phase can extend much longer. In fact, in the Board’s
interviews, it was not uncommon for professionals to cite examples of a youth’s case taking
years to reach disposition. There are many ways in which the pretrial phase can be
extended, some of which can “pause” the clock for time standards, some of which are due
to systemic challenges, and others which are a result of ensuring individuals’ rights are
upheld. Research suggests that a lengthy pretrial phase can be harmful for all parties,
including the youth, any alleged victims or witnesses, and the system itself.

Section 5:
4. There are vastly different regional practices at this stage, leading to concerns about equity.
The juvenile pretrial phase operates differently across Massachusetts’ counties. While in
some cases this may be a reasonable response to variations in local circumstances, it can
also raise concerns about equity: the zip code a youth is arrested in can significantly impact
how their case proceeds, with similarly situated youth receiving different treatment based
on the county or even court in which their case is handled. (Evidence of other kinds of
disparities, such as racial disparities, are further discussed in Finding 5).
9
Examples of county-by-county differences include:
• Whether youth are released on personal recognizance/assigned to be monitored
by the MPS Pretrial Unit or supervised at the local probation level.3 In FY23,
estimates ranged from 59% (n=126) of youth arraigned being released on personal
recognizance/monitored in Plymouth County (41% supervised by probation) to 92%
(n=265) of all youth being released on personal recognizance/cases monitored in
Barnstable County (and 8% supervised by probation).
• Whether youth are placed on GPS: Although the Board does not currently have data
on all conditions set, point-in-time data from August 2023 suggests that Suffolk
County uses GPS at a higher rate than other counties compared to the proportion of
state arraignments coming from Suffolk.
• Use of cash bail: Compared to the rest of the state, youth who are detained in
Hampden, Norfolk, and Suffolk Counties are more likely to be detained due to
inability to make bail than because they were held without the possibility of bail
than in other counties.
• Whether youth are placed on pretrial probation as a disposition: Pretrial probation
as a disposition is used much more frequently in Bristol, Middlesex, and Norfolk
counties than the rest of the state. Of the pretrial probation as a disposition cases
supervised at the local level, 68% (n=105) are supervised in those three counties
(which represent just 28% of arraignments in the state).
• Use of 58A Hearings: Essex County has the highest number of 58A Hearings when
compared to other counties, representing 25% (n=85) of the state total, despite
making up only 15% (n=376) of the state’s felony arraignments. Further, it appears
these dangerousness hearings result in detention less frequently than the state total;
while Essex conducts more 58A Hearings than any other county, youth held without
bail due to being found dangerous account for only 25% of Essex’s detention
admissions where youth are held without bail.

Section 6:
5. The pretrial statutory framework is unclear and does not account for all relevant
circumstances. The Board heard significant concerns from many professionals interviewed
for this report about when and how cash bail and other conditions of release are set in
certain cases. In some cases, this may be the result of an unclear statutory framework,
further complicated by case law, that does not account for all relevant circumstances.
3 Due to the way data are reported, county level estimates of youth released on personal recognizance include youth monitored
on conditions supervised by the statewide Pretrial Unit.
10
As discussed further in this report, MGL Ch. 276 Section 58 and 58A state that the intention
of setting cash bail during this phase of the system is to make sure youth appear in court
and, in the case of 58A, ensure the safety of a victim or another individual. However, in
making that determination, the state can legally weigh a number of factors that – research
indicates— do not relate to a youth’s “flight risk” and seem unlikely to be related to victim
safety. Based on interviews with stakeholders and analysis of the data, the Board has
concluded that cash bail is being used at times due to reasons other than flight risk – albeit
reasons that in many cases are related to protecting a child’s safety or other system
constraints. Examples include:
• Holding youth with DCF involvement, specifically due to lack of other placement
options.
• Holding youth being, or perceived as being, commercially sexually exploited (CSEC).
• Holding youth whose parents refuse to take them home.

Section 7:
6. There are disparities in who is detained pretrial, who gets placed on pretrial
monitoring/supervision, and who is released on personal recognizance. The Board has
documented the persistent racial and ethnic disparities in the Commonwealth’s juvenile
justice system each year since its inception. The pretrial phase is no exception. In fact, in
FY23, Black and Latino youth remained overrepresented at each pretrial process point in the
juvenile justice system.4 Further, the Board heard concerns from court stakeholders that
certain groups of youth, namely girls and youth with DCF involvement, were more likely to
be detained pretrial for reasons other than concerns regarding failure to appear or
community safety. This is reflected in the data.
• In FY23, compared to white youth detained at the initial arraignment,
Hispanic/Latino youth were 1.32 times more likely to be detained pretrial and 1.47
times more likely to be detained as a result of bail being set.
• In FY23, compared to white youth detained at the initial arraignment, Black/African
American youth were 1.07 times more likely to be detained pretrial and 1.37 times
more likely to be detained as a result of bail being set. Of youth who were detained
as a result of bail being set, Black/African American youth had higher bail amounts
set.
• While girls made up 14% (n=106) of all detention admissions in FY23, they made up
21% (n=44) of detention admissions as a result of bail being set and are held for
lower amounts compared to boys. As further discussed in this report, many

11
professionals believed that girls were being detained with bail set for reasons other
than flight risk.
• In FY23, 6% (n=47) of pretrial detention admissions were for youth who identified as
LGBTQ+. LGBTQ+ youth were held on cash bail more frequently, and held for lower
amounts when compared to youth who did not identify as LGBTQ+.
• Youth with DCF involvement represent more than half (51%, n=395) of all pretrial
detention admissions.5,6 Youth with DCF involvement are detained with bail set more
frequently and held for lower amounts compared to youth with no DCF involvement.

Section 8:
7. There are cohorts of youth who could be diverted away from pretrial detention, pretrial
supervision/monitoring, or the system entirely. The Board found that youth could be
diverted more frequently:
• Pre-arraignment: Many professionals interviewed for this report felt there are still
too many youth at arraignment with lower-level underlying offenses who could
benefit from diversion away from the system entirely, rather than keeping them
involved in the formal juvenile court process. This is reflected in the data: in FY23, a
third (36%, n=1,458) of FY23 arraignments were for misdemeanors.
• From pretrial supervision/monitoring: In recent years the percent of cases in which
youth are released on their personal recognizance has decreased, directly correlating
with the increase in the percent of cases monitored/supervised by probation.
Professionals interviewed suggested more youth could be released without any
conditions. Some professionals highlighted cases for youth who had “Category A”
conditions of release set (n=770, representing 59% of pretrial cases with conditions
of release set) and are assigned to be monitored by the statewide Pretrial Unit as
those that could more frequently be released on their own recognizance instead.
• From pretrial detention: Professionals interviewed highlighted that there are youth
who could be diverted from detention who need intermediate options and more
active case management than the current pretrial probation supervision/monitoring
structure provides. Specifically, professionals mentioned youth who are detained for
a misdemeanor/lower “grid” level offense (n=353, 46% of detention admissions) as
good candidates for diversion from detention if the right community supports and
options are in place for youth and families.

case with DCF.

Recommendations
Increases in the use of pretrial conditions of release, including more restrictive conditions like
GPS and home confinement, are at least partially a result of a shift away from the use of pretrial
detention for youth in Massachusetts over the past decade-plus. Yet an increasingly large body
of research, Massachusetts data, and practitioner experience suggest that just as more critical
examination of detention began over a decade ago, a similar examination is now needed
regarding how and when pretrial conditions of release are used. To help spur this change in
practice and culture, the Board offers the following recommendations to continue the progress
made over the past decade-plus and ensure that our pretrial system promotes equity and
positive outcomes for youth, protects alleged victims and witnesses, and supports the
professionals doing this work each day.
In order to achieve these goals, the JJPAD Board recommends Massachusetts:
Improve how conditions of release are set and re-visited throughout the pretrial process. This
includes:

Section 9:
1. Providing more guidance on setting pretrial conditions of release for youth

Section 10:
2. Developing a new “order of pretrial conditions of release” form

Section 11:
3. Providing guidance on the process for revising pretrial conditions of release for youth
and addressing violations
Divert more youth from detention and juvenile court involvement by expanding the range of
pretrial supervision and pre-arraignment diversion options. This includes:

Section 12:
4. Creating a continuum of interventions for supervision in the community during the
pretrial period

Section 13:
5. Improving GPS technology

Section 14:
6. Diverting more youth pre-arraignment by expanding opportunities for state diversion
Support implementation of pretrial reforms and continue to measure the impact. This
includes:

Section 15:
7. Requiring training on aspects of the pretrial phase across state entities and encouraging
cross-entity trainings when possible

Section 16:
8. Increasing the number of juvenile court judges to reduce the pretrial timeline and
support reform implementation

Section 17:
9. Expanding the availability, and promoting the use of, social workers in delinquency
related cases

Section 18:
10. Increasing data availability to support continuous quality improvement and data-
informed policymaking

Introduction
The Juvenile Justice Policy and Data (JJPAD) Board, which was created by An Act Relative to
Criminal Justice Reform (2018), was charged by the Legislature with evaluating juvenile justice
system policies and procedures and making recommendations to improve outcomes based on
that analysis. In particular, the JJPAD Board is charged with assessing “the system of community-
based services for children and juveniles who are under the supervision, care or custody of the
department of youth services or the juvenile court.”7
Massachusetts has made a concerted effort to directly and indirectly decrease the use of
detention for youth over the past decade-plus by limiting the circumstances in which youth are
detained pretrial, as well as limiting overall youth contact with the juvenile justice system. (See
the text box “State Efforts to Limit Detention,” below). This effort has been driven by a growing
body of research showing pretrial detention stays – for any length of time – can be harmful and
result in negative outcomes for youth and public safety.8
At the same time, the effort to keep youth out of pretrial detention has impacted other aspects
of the juvenile justice system, specifically throughout the pretrial phase (post-arraignment and
pre-disposition). However, until this report, those impacts have not been publicly assessed or
reported.
Further, in recent years juvenile detention admissions and use of the pretrial system overall
have increased. Between FY22 and FY23:
• Arraignments increased by 34% and have exceeded pre-pandemic numbers. (In FY19,
there were 3,322 arraignments compared to 4,025 in FY23). On average, over the past
five fiscal years, more than half (55%) of all arraignments do not reach a disposition.9
• Youth placed on pretrial monitoring/supervision increased by 68%.10
• Pretrial detention admissions increased by 14%. Pretrial detention admissions are still
down, however, compared to pre-pandemic numbers: in FY19 there were 893 detention

9 This includes cases that are not resolved with a CWOF or do not result in a plea/trial. These cases are dismissed or diverted
prior to that point. Cases may be dismissed for several reasons, including lack of probable cause or lack of sufficient evidence at
any point pre- or during a trial. Cases may be diverted either formally or informally.

admissions, compared to 768 in FY23. On average over the past five years, about half of
all admissions (45%) were for “lower-grid level”11 offenses.
Based on these considerations, the JJPAD Board launched a project in 2023 to study the pretrial
phase in Massachusetts with the goal of making recommendations to:

Section 19:
1. Improve this part of the system to support better outcomes for youth and public safety.

Section 20:
2. Identify cohorts of youth that may benefit from diversion from detention and/or pretrial
supervision.

Section 21:
3. Improve pretrial community-based supports for youth.
This report includes the following:
• A description of the pretrial phase, a review of the research on best practices during this
phase, and an analysis of the available data
• Findings on the pretrial phase based on the Board’s qualitative and quantitative research
and policy analysis
• Recommendations to the state for improvement
11 DYS measures offense severity by a numerical (1-7) “grid level.” Grid levels 1 and 2 are categorized as low, grid level 3 is
considered “medium” severity and grid levels 4 through 7 is considered “high” severity. Most “lower-grid level” offenses are
misdemeanor offenses.

State Efforts to Limit Detention
Efforts to keep youth out of pretrial detention have largely been successful. Between FY15 to FY24,
pretrial detention admissions were cut by more than half from 2,101 pretrial detention admissions
in FY15 to 899 admissions in FY24.
State efforts include:
• Annie E. Casey’s Juvenile Detention Alternatives Initiative (JDAI), based at DYS. Since 2006,
the MA JDAI team has led state and local conversations on the dangers of detention and
coordinated a variety of state and local efforts to divert youth from detention. JDAI
operates at the court county level in six counties and convenes several statewide
committees.
• A concerted effort by professionals to keep youth out of detention in light of the COVID-19
pandemic that highlighted the negative physical and mental consequences of congregate
care facilities. However, many youth who remained in detention during this time were held
for longer periods of time awaiting court as a result of the pandemic.
• Provisions in the 2018 Criminal Justice Reform Act that aimed to limit the number of youth
coming into contact with the juvenile justice system, and therefore, the number of youth
detained pretrial. This included giving judges the statutory authority to divert youth pre-
arraignment for some offenses.
• The creation and funding of the Massachusetts Youth Diversion Program (MYDP). The
MYDP is a state-funded diversion program administered by the Department of Youth
Services (DYS) and operated by community-based organizations.
• The establishment of an administrative review process by Massachusetts Probation
Services (MPS), along with a rewards/graduated sanction protocol to support
reinforcement of positive behavior and intervene effectively with negative behaviors short
of a formal probation violation – understanding that each time a youth is given a Notice of
Probation Violation, they are brought back into court and risk detention.
• An increased effort to build community-based systems that are focused on supporting
youth prior to Juvenile Court involvement, such as the Executive Office of Public Safety and
Security (EOPSS) Shannon Gang Prevention grants, the Executive Office of Health and
Human Services (EOHHS) Safe and Successful Youth Initiative, and the Department of Public
Health Violence Prevention grants to name just a few.

Key Terminology
Arraignment: The formal reading of charges against the youth in court, and the point at which youth
officially have a Juvenile Court entry record.
Cash bail: A cash amount that must be posted to secure a youth’s release from DYS pretrial detention
between arraignment and disposition. Bail is determined and the amount is set at a bail hearing, if a
judge determines the youth is at risk of failing to appear at future court proceedings.
Disposition: The outcome of a case and the end of the “pretrial phase.”
Failure to appear: Missing a court appearance.
Notice of Violation: If a youth violates one of their imposed conditions of release, Massachusetts
Probation Services (MPS) will send a notice detailing the alleged violation to the District Attorney’s
Office (DAO).
Pretrial conditions of release: Terms youth must comply with, which are set by a judge. Depending
on the court's order, probation either monitors the pretrial conditions or actively supervises the
individual to ensure compliance with the conditions of release while they remain in the community as
their case is pending.
Pretrial detention: Detention occurs when a judge has placed a youth in the care of the Department
of Youth Services (DYS) before their trial. This occurs after a youth has been arrested and arraigned.
Detention stays can last from a couple of hours to weeks or months depending on a variety of factors.
Pretrial probation as a disposition: Youth can be placed on pretrial probation as a “disposition” post-
arraignment by a judge. If the youth complies with all the conditions set by a judge, the matter will
ultimately be dismissed by the prosecution. If youth fail to comply, the prosecution of the matter may
resume (at the discretion of the district attorney).
58A “Dangerousness” Hearing: Allows the prosecution to request at arraignment that a youth be
detained without bail if the DA believes the youth is a threat to public safety. If a judge finds a youth
to be dangerous and that there are no conditions that would assure a youth and community’s safety,
the youth is held in detention prior to their trial.
Methodology
The following questions guided the Board’s research:

Section 22:
1. How can we improve pretrial success rates (i.e., compliance with conditions) and reduce
the need for detention?

Section 23:
2. What practices can help us improve long-term outcomes for youth and protect public
safety?
17

Section 24:
3. What do victims want during this phase?

Section 25:
4. Can any of the youth who are being placed on pretrial probation and/or detained be
diverted and served through community-based services?

Section 26:
5. What community-based interventions or supports need to exist in order to divert more
of this population from detention and/or the justice system entirely?
To answer these questions the Board employed a mixed methods research approach. OCA staff
led the research, the JJPAD Board Community-Based Interventions (CBI) Subcommittee
discussed findings from the qualitative methods, and the Data Subcommittee discussed findings
from the quantitative methods. Collectively, the Board spent about two years reviewing and
analyzing the pretrial phase.
73 interviews with stakeholders across sectors: OCA staff conducted interviews with
professionals, stakeholders, and people with experience in the juvenile justice system to learn
about experiences and practices within these systems. The goal of these interviews was to
identify common gaps, challenges, and areas of strength; gain insight on stakeholder ideas for
further system improvement; and assess potential shifts in policy and practice that could
potentially improve the pretrial phase. The OCA made significant efforts to invite a wide variety
of stakeholders to participate in the interview process, including direct outreach to specific
individuals and organizations representing stakeholder groups as well as regular “open”
invitations through the JJPAD Board’s monthly newsletter.

Informational Interviews by Stakeholder Group (n=73)
Analysis of the available data: The Data Subcommittee analyzed available aggregate data
reported by the Trial Courts, DYS, and MPS. The analysis informed the data section of this report
as well as the findings and recommendations.
Subcommittee presentations: The CBI Subcommittee dedicated all or part of their meetings in
calendar year 2023 and 2024 to learn about the pretrial phase, guide the OCA’s research, and
analyze the findings. Meetings included presentations from the OCA staff on research (see
below), as well as representatives of JJPAD Board member organizations:
• The Committee for Public Council Services (CPCS), who presented on each court process
point in the juvenile pretrial phase, including an overview of practice considerations,
and relevant statutes and case law.12
• MPS, who presented on the juvenile pretrial supervision process and practice.13
• DYS, who presented on the juvenile pretrial detention process and detention services.14
National Research: To inform the findings of this report, OCA staff conducted a review of the
national research to better understand what evidence-based best practices exist at the pretrial
phase. Areas of focus included conditions of release, the use of monetary bail, youth failure to
appear rates, and the impacts and efficacy of GPS monitoring for juveniles.15 This review also
included an overview of pretrial policy changes in other jurisdictions.
Review of Massachusetts Policy: OCA staff reviewed relevant statutes, case law, and any agency
standards/guidance that pertained to the pretrial phase. A full list of what was reviewed can be
found in the appendix.
Taken together, the five methods provided the Board with a holistic approach to studying the
pretrial phase.
Limitations
There are strengths and limitations to each of the above methods. For example, academic
research specific to the juvenile pretrial phase is limited. Therefore, research from the adult
system and research conducted on the juvenile system post-adjudication was included to
supplement the Board’s understanding.

Further, the data presented in this report is reported to the OCA at the aggregate level, limiting
the Board’s ability to do causal analysis or analysis at the individual level (e.g., understanding
the intersection of measures like race and gender of youth held on low bail amount).
Additionally, there are some data elements that are captured by two different agencies, but the
totals do not always match and/or there are other discrepancies, likely due to differences in
how different agencies report and collect the data.
MPS first began reporting data to the JJPAD Board on new “case starts” for youth released on
pretrial conditions of release in FY21, which was during the COVID-19 pandemic. In FY21, the
JJPAD Board found that there was a decrease in the utilization of the juvenile justice system
during the pandemic as a result of shifts in “circumstantial” factors (e.g., limited contact with
peers) that are tied to decreased likelihood of delinquent behavior as well as a concerted effort
by juvenile justice system stakeholders to divert youth away from the juvenile court at this
time.16 Therefore, it is likely that the increase in utilization between FY21 and FY23, described
later in this report, was greater than would have been observed if the analysis included data
from pre-pandemic years. Additionally, it is likely that the pandemic caused delays in pretrial
proceedings, resulting in an increase in the length of time a youth’s case spent in the pretrial
phase. To address these concerns, pre-pandemic data was included in the analysis when
available.
Finally, while much of what was learned in stakeholder interviews was echoed in the
quantitative data, some quantitative data is unavailable to validate key themes heard across
stakeholders. As a result, that information is anecdotal and cannot be objectively measured
(e.g., the number and types of conditions of release). Additionally, the number of interviews
within each stakeholder group varied. The OCA did extensive outreach and issued numerous
invitations to relevant organizations to participate in the interview process. Some organizations
connected the OCA to numerous people within the organization to provide a range of
viewpoints within the agencies, while others declined participation or only allowed for one or
two individuals to participate.
The findings in this report are informed by a mixed-methods research approach to ameliorate
the limitations of any one method.

The Pretrial Phase in Context of the Greater Juvenile Justice System
21
Massachusetts’ Juvenile Pretrial Phase
This section reviews the pretrial phase and:
• Defines the pretrial phase in context of the greater juvenile justice system
• Presents the available state data.
The Pretrial Phase Process
The pretrial phase begins after a youth has been arraigned and officially “charged” with a
delinquent offense by a prosecutor.17 Once a youth has been arraigned, the incident will appear
on a youth’s court record.
Presumptive Innocence
After a youth is arraigned, there are several ways a

date.19 At this hearing, the judge makes a
determination as to whether the youth is unlikely to appear for future court hearings (referred
to as “risk of failure to appear” or “a flight risk”) and may set monetary bail as a condition of
release, and/or set other pretrial conditions of release.20,21 If youth do not comply with the
conditions of release, they may be subject to a violation hearing and detained as a result.
17 Per the Juvenile Court’s Standing Order 2-18: Time Standards, arraignments should be held within 15 days from the issuance
of the complaint, unless the juvenile has been referred to diversion. For more information see: Massachusetts Court System.
(2018). Juvenile Court Standing Order 2-18: Time standards. https://www.mass.gov/juvenile-court-rules/juvenile-court-
standing-order-2-18-time-standards
18 A bail warning at arraignment informs youth that if they are charged with a new offense while their case is pending their bail
may be revoked, and as a result, the youth will be detained.
19 Bail hearings may also be held during the pendency of the pretrial phase if new information becomes available that may
warrant a change in bail status. For example, if a youth is found to have violated one of their conditions of release, a bail hearing
may be held to revoke the youth’s bail, and they may be ordered to be detained pretrial as a result.
20 M.G.L Ch.276 Section 58; a complete list of statutes and case law relevant to the pretrial phase can be found in Appendix A.
21 M.G.L. Ch. 276 Section 87; a complete list of statutes and case law relevant to the pretrial phase can be found in Appendix A.
22
Judges must consider the youth’s financial resources if they set bail.22 Additionally, the judge
can set stipulations of a youth’s release if they are able to post bail. For example, for youth in
the custody of the Department of Children and Families (DCF), the judge can set the stipulation
that they only be released to the Department’s custody. If the youth is unable to post the
monetary bail and/or meet other pretrial release conditions, they are detained before their trial
(called “pretrial detention”).
If a judge sets any pretrial conditions of release, the youth is placed on pretrial monitoring
and/or supervision, which is overseen by the Massachusetts Probation Services (MPS).
Setting Conditions of Release in Juvenile Court
In Juvenile Court, judges primarily set conditions pursuant to:
• M.G.L Ch.276 Section 58, which allows judges to set conditions to ensure the
defendant’s appearance in court or that specify restrictions on personal
associations or conduct (e.g., stay away orders from a named victim or witness). It
also allows judges to set cash bail as a condition of release if there is concern that
the youth will fail to appear to future court dates. Setting conditions under Section
58 does not require the youth’s consent.
• M.G.L. Ch 276 Section 58A, which allows judges to set conditions to ensure the
safety of any other individual or the community. Setting conditions under Section
58A does not require the youth’s consent.
• M.G.L. Ch. 276 Section 87, which allows judges to set broader conditions
compared to those set under Section 58, such as “cooperate in a mental health or
substance use disorder evaluation and treatment.” Setting conditions under

Section 27:
Section 87 require the youth’s consent.
As discussed in Finding 4, interviews suggest that judges are not consistently tying the
setting of specific conditions to the specific statute, and in practice, statutes are frequently
used interchangeably. The JJPAD Board does not have data to address this point.
22 M.G.L Ch.276 Section 58 ; Commonwealth vs. Brangan (2017) ; a complete list of statutes and case law relevant to the pretrial
phase can be found in Appendix A.
23
The specific conditions of release ordered by a judge determine if a youth’s case is either
monitored or supervised by MPS Pretrial:23
• Cases that are monitored by MPS are pretrial cases that are not actively supervised by a
probation officer at the local level. Rather, they are monitored by the statewide Pretrial
Unit. Youth with pretrial cases monitored by MPS have conditions set under a category
called “Category A.” Examples of Category A conditions include:
Obey all laws and court orders
o
Obey any no contact or stay away orders
o
Refrain from illegal drugs, recreational marijuana, and/or alcohol
o
• Cases that are supervised by MPS are pretrial cases that are actively supervised by a
probation officer at the local level. Youth with pretrial cases supervised by MPS have
conditions set under a category called “Category B.” Examples of Category B conditions
include:
Drug testing
o
Cooperate with mental health and/or substance use treatment
o
GPS monitoring
o
Home confinement
o
MPS Pretrial Services Unit
Established in 2019 as a result of the state’s Criminal Justice Reform Act, MPS’ Pretrial
Services Division is a system of collaborative partnerships that includes the court,
criminal justice agencies, and community service providers that enables a set of
policies, guidelines, and practices aimed to improve pretrial services statewide while
minimizing unnecessary pretrial detention. Along with monitoring cases with
conditions of release and pretrial probation as a disposition cases, the Pretrial Services
Division has also implemented other pretrial services, including issuing new pretrial
supervision and standards and the eReminder Program, an automated text message
system that provides reminders of upcoming court dates.

ncarceration.
24
Youth are assigned a probation officer, who is then charged with supervising the youth’s
compliance with their conditions of release. Probation officers will notify the prosecutor
if a youth violates a condition.
A judge determines a youth is a danger to the community and must be detained pretrial or
sets conditions of release.24
Youth charged with certain offenses can be detained without the opportunity of bail if the
prosecution moves for an order of pretrial detention based on dangerousness.25 Youth can be
detained while awaiting a 58A Hearing for up to 7 days.26 Following a hearing, called a “58A
Hearing” or “dangerousness hearing,” a judge will determine what, if any, conditions of release
will reasonably assure the safety of any other person or the community. If a judge determines
that no conditions of release will reasonably assure the safety of any other person or the
community, the youth is held for up to 120 days in detention prior to their trial.27
A judge may also place a youth on “pretrial probation as a disposition” post-arraignment.
If a youth placed on pretrial probation as disposition is successful in complying with the
conditions of probation set, the matter will ultimately be dismissed by the prosecution. This is
one way of resolving the case without having to proceed to plea or trial. However, if the youth
fails to comply, the prosecution of the matter may resume (at the discretion of the district
attorney). The ordering of pretrial probation as a disposition requires the consent of the
prosecutor.28
Violations of pretrial conditions
Regardless of the case type or supervision level or if a youth is released on their own PR, if a
youth violates any of their conditions of release or commits a new alleged offense, the county
MPS office notifies the prosecutor. The prosecutor has discretion as to whether they bring the
case back into court to revoke bail or personal recognizance. The prosecution does not have
discretion to unilaterally modify conditions at this point. If a case is revoked, a judge determines
24 Per the 58A Statute, a dangerousness hearing shall be held immediately upon the person’s first appearance before the court,
unless either attorney requests a continuance. A continuance may not exceed 7 days, during which the youth will be held in
pretrial detention at DYS. For more information, see M.G.L Ch.276 Section 58A
25 M.G.L Ch.276 Section 58A; a complete list of statutes and case law relevant to the pretrial phase can be found in Appendix A.
26 MGL Ch. 276 Section 58A states, “The hearing shall be held immediately upon the person's first appearance before the court
unless that person, or the attorney for the commonwealth, seeks a continuance. Except for good cause, a continuance on
motion of the person may not exceed seven days, and a continuance on motion of the attorney for the commonwealth may not
exceed three business days. During a continuance, the individual shall be detained upon a showing that there existed probable
cause to arrest the person.”
27 After 120 days, the law states that youth should be released from detention. However, there are a variety of legal reasons
youth may be (and, indeed, are) held beyond 120 days. See Finding 3, for more information on the length of time this phase
takes.
28 A Juvenile Court judge may place a youth on pretrial probation based on the statutory authorization of MGL Ch. 276,

Section 29:
Section87. MGL Ch. 276, Section 87 also establishes statutory authorization for pretrial conditions of release, which are distinct
from pretrial probation. The SJC reiterates this distinction in Commonwealth v. Jake J., a juvenile, and Commonwealth v. Tim T., a
juvenile.
25
whether they should detain the youth or modify conditions of release.29 During this hearing,
defense counsel and prosecution can present recommendations for modified conditions to the
court or the prosecution can ask to detain the youth.30
The pretrial phase officially ends if a youth’s case is dismissed or once the case is resolved. Cases
can be resolved through a plea, trial, or a plea resulting in a “continuance without a finding
(CWOF).”
How long does the pretrial phase last?
The Juvenile Court adopted time standards for all court proceedings in October 2018, and
include the following lengths of time for delinquency and youthful offender cases:
• Filing of complaint or indictment to adjudication/disposition (bench trial): Six months
(180 days)^
• Filing of complaint or indictment to adjudication/disposition (jury trial): Eight months
(240 days)
Benchmarks* include:
• Arraignment: within 15 days from the issuance of the complaint, unless the juvenile
has been referred to diversion.
• Pretrial Conference: within 30 days from the arraignment.
^Indictment of a juvenile as a Youthful Offender proceeds only at the option of the District Attorney; there are no
time requirements for the exercise of that option.
*Benchmarks are not part of the time standards but are provided to offer guidance in achieving compliance with
the standards.

29 Per MGL. Ch. 276 Section. 58B, “a person who has been released after a hearing pursuant to sections 42A, 58, 58A or 87 and
who has violated a condition of his release, shall be subject to a revocation of release and an order of detention.”
30 If the condition violated was set under M.G.L Ch.276 Section 58, prosecutors have the discretion to either motion to revoke
youth’s bail, or not. If the condition of release violated was set under M.G.L. Ch. 276 Section 87, prosecutors have the discretion
to modify the conditions, if the youth and their defense attorney agree. If the youth and their defense attorney do not agree to
modify conditions set under Section 87, then prosecutors have the discretion to either motion to revoke youth’s bail, or not.

Decisions that Can Result in a Youth Being Held Pretrial
27
Victim Experience
It’s important to note that one goal of the pretrial process is to make sure any potential alleged
victim(s) are safe while a youth’s case is pending. This could be one reason why a judge decides to
detain or set conditions of release rather than releasing a youth on personal recognizance.
Throughout the Board’s research, victim advocates expressed that victims want an individualized
approach at each phase of the system. At the pretrial phase, some alleged victims want a youth to
be detained, others want youth to be diverted completely, and others want something in
between.
Advocates also stated that many alleged victims – at this stage—weren’t consulted or actively
listened to regarding conditions that would make them feel safe.
The Board heard from victim advocates that alleged victims typically want accountability and for
their safety to be considered during the pretrial phase. This sentiment aligns with national
research on victim expectations and experiences:
• Victims want the process to be centered on their voices being heard, accountability,
and safety
• Alternative responses like restorative justice practices can be developmentally
appropriate and support victims
• Many victims do not report crime and/or do not engage at this phase and therefore,
interventions that take place outside of the court system may serve a wider array of
impacted people.
Finally, it is important to note research indicates a strong connection between experiences of
victimization and the likelihood of perpetrating violence. This cyclical connection between victim
and perpetrator of violence makes it particularly challenging and critical to stopping violence.

Research on Best Practices During the Pretrial Phase
The JJPAD Board reviewed peer reviewed research, government reports from other
jurisdictions, as well as policy papers published by national organizations related to the
following aspects of the pretrial phase:
• Diversion
• Setting Conditions of Release
• Using GPS
• Using Cash Bail
• Pretrial Detention
Additionally, the Board reviewed key findings from research on adolescent brain development
to consider at each phase. Research on adolescent psychology demonstrates that young people
have difficulty appropriately weighing the consequences of their immediate actions with their
long-term goals. Indeed, “neurobiological research suggests that the parts of the brain that
govern impulse control, planning ahead, weighing risks and rewards, and coordinating emotion
and cognition continue to mature throughout adolescence.”31 Youth likely experience the
pretrial phase differently than adults in the adult criminal justice system.
The following subsections summarize the JJPAD’s review of the research, by topic.
When Possible, Youth Should be Diverted
As discussed in Finding 7, the Board’s interview findings and data analysis suggests there is
room for improvement in diverting youth away from the juvenile justice system across multiple
“off ramps” (i.e., pre-arraignment and pretrial). Research suggests diversion can be an effective
tool to increase public safety and improve youth outcomes compared to the traditional juvenile
justice system.
• Diversion improves public safety: One meta-analysis of 45 studies showed that
diversion was more effective in reducing recidivism than traditional court processing.
Another meta-analysis of 19 studies specific to police-based diversion showed that
youth were less likely to reoffend when they received diversion.32
• Diversion helps reduce justice system contact and reduces the risk of future justice
system involvement: Relative to diverted youth, a 2020 study showed that youth who

were formally processed were more likely to be re-arrested, more likely to be
incarcerated, engaged in more violence, reported a greater affiliation with delinquent
peers, reported lower school enrollment, were less likely to graduate high school within
5 years, reported less ability to suppress aggression, and had lower perceptions of
opportunities as compared to similarly-situated youth who were diverted.33
Conditions of Release Should be Developmentally Appropriate and Focus on Assuring Safety
As discussed in Findings 1 and 2, the Board’s interview findings and data analysis suggests there
is an overreliance on conditions of release for youth. Research suggests conditions of release
should be developmentally appropriate, focus on safety, and relate to the underlying offense.
Conditions should be developmentally appropriate. If the conditions being set are not
developmentally appropriate, this creates an extremely difficult bar for youth to meet. Some
conditions of release remove youth from prosocial activities, impacting the youth’s well-being.
This runs contrary to a body of research which shows that these positive connections and
participation in prosocial activities are vital to youth’s mental health and wellbeing.34 This loss
of prosocial activities is not only detrimental to a youth’s physical and emotional well-being, but
it also increases their risk of further delinquency.35 Factors that negatively impact youth’s
mental and physical health include:
• Social isolation, disintegration of support networks, and restrictions on practicing
developmentally appropriate skills (e.g., spending time with their peers)
• Isolation and abrupt separation from friends and family members
• Loss and/or disruption of their daily routines, leading to dysregulation
• Lack of freedom of movement and access to recreational facilities
The impact of loneliness and isolation on youth’s mental health has been extensively
demonstrated in over sixty studies, particularly its long-term association with anxiety and
depression.36

Conditions of release should be focused on ensuring safety and related to the underlying
offense. Research on probation condition setting post-adjudication shows that youth have a
hard time remembering all of the conditions set, and that setting numerous conditions
increases a youth’s chance of violating.37 In fact, one study in Washington State found that
youth only recalled approximately one-third of conditions imposed on them.38
Further, research shows the “one-size fits all” approach to condition setting is not an efficient
use of staff time or resources. As one study states, “This is because surveillance alone has little
to no impact on reoffending; adolescents are unable, developmentally, to make progress on
multiple goals; and standardized approaches don’t address the varying factors that contribute
to youth’s delinquent behavior.”39 Conditions that are overly broad, such as “obey all school
rules” are difficult for youth to comply with and increase their chances of violating.40 Research
on youth placed on supervision post-adjudication suggests that conditions that target specific
risk factors and are related to the offense the youth was adjudicated delinquent of result in
better outcomes for youth.41
Cash Bail Should Only be Used to Assure Court Appearance – and Most Youth Will Appear
Without any Need for Cash Bail
As discussed in Finding 5 of this report, the Massachusetts General Laws dictate that cash bail
be set only for the purposes of ensuring youth appear to court, or – in certain cases (e.g.,
allegations of domestic violence) – to ensure the safety of the alleged victim or witness, any
other individual, or the community. However, research suggests that cash bail is not effective at
improving failure to appear rates or public safety, and disproportionately impacts poor people.

Cash Bail and Failure to Appear
Research shows that most individuals show up to their court hearings, and the risk of failing to
appear is low across-the-board (i.e., whether cash bail is used or not). For example, one study
conducted involving over 3,900 adults in Virginia found that those who were released on
personal recognizance appeared at a very high rate of 96%.42
Cash bail has a limited effect on failure to appear (FTA) rates. A review of the current research
on FTA rates in jurisdictions (e.g., Kentucky, Philadelphia) before and after they passed reforms
that limited the use of cash bail found that limiting the use of monetary release conditions did
not result in substantial change in the rate at which defendants fail to appear in court.43
Failure to appear is a system-wide issue rather than solely an issue related to an individual
defendant. When people do not appear, it is often due to factors outside of their control (e.g.,
transportation issues, work or school obligations) rather than an intention to evade the justice
system.44 One study done in Philadelphia found that failure to appear was an issue across court
stakeholders rather than just with defendants. The study found that:
• An essential witness or lawyer failed to appear for at least one hearing in 53% of all
cases, compared to a 19% FTA rate for defendants.
• The defense attorney (both public & private) failed to appear for at least one hearing in
36% of cases.
• Police officers fail to appear on a subpoena almost twice as often as defendants.45
Reforms successful in reducing failure to appear rates tend to address the more mundane
reasons that defendants tend to miss their court date. In Santa Clara County, the introduction
of automated text message court date reminders reduced warrants issued for missed court
dates by 20%.46 At the time of this report’s publication, Massachusetts has re-introduced a
similar test-messaging system in juvenile court to remind youth of upcoming court hearings.47

Cash Bail and Public Safety
Research suggests that the use of cash bail may not result in improved public safety. One review
of bail reforms implemented between 2010-2020 in four states and nine cities and counties
found that all jurisdictions saw decreases or negligible increases in crime or re-arrest rates after
implementing reforms.48 Highlights include:
• New Mexico: After implementing a voter approved constitutional amendment that
prohibits judges from detaining defendants solely due to inability to post bail, the safety
rate (the number of people released pretrial who are not charged with committing a
new crime) increased from 74% to 83% after the reform took effect.
• Washington D.C.: Judges cannot set monetary bail that results in someone’s pretrial
detention, and there are limits to the amount of time people can spend in jail after their
arrest. In FY22, 93% of people were not re-arrested when released pretrial.
Cash Bail and Ability to Pay
Cash bail disproportionately affects low-income families, exacerbating existing inequalities in
the juvenile justice system and leading to worse outcomes for disadvantaged youth.49 It has
been widely documented that cash bail in the adult criminal system is regressive and
disproportionately impacts poor people.50 According to some estimates, adults jailed pretrial
had a median annual income of about $15,109 prior to incarceration, which was less than half
(48%) of the median income for non-incarcerated people of similar ages.51 Further, the burden
of paying cash bail is often placed on families of loved ones.52 For youth in the juvenile justice
system, this means additional burden on parents/caregivers, and the impossible financial
decision of whether to bail their child out or be able to pay essential bills.
GPS Should be Used Sparingly for Youth Given its Harmful Impact and Limited Effectiveness
As discussed in Finding 2 of this report, the Board heard from many individuals who were
concerned about the overreliance and overuse of GPS for youth in Massachusetts.

GPS Use and Adolescent Development and Well-being
Research generally shows that GPS and other forms of electronic monitoring (EM) as a condition
of release are developmentally inappropriate. Because of this, youth have a difficult time being
successful while released on them. GPS requires advanced planning skills that most youth have
not yet fully developed. Because the monitors must always remain charged to avoid any
violations, youth are required to schedule charging times at appropriate increments. Being
supervised on GPS also requires advanced notice be granted from probation officers for youth
to leave their inclusion zones for necessary activities.53
In summary, research shows:
GPS can result in a harmful labeling effect and weaken positive relationships.
Research shows that youth who society perceives as “bad kids” are more likely to go on to make
additional poor choices in their lives.54 The social stigma associated with wearing an electronic
monitor, a visible symbol of being deemed a “bad kid”, can lead to judgements by teachers,
peers, and other adults in a youth’s life. This—in turn—can result in psychological damage to
the youth wearing it, and other negative consequences.
• This stigma can lead to children avoiding school, removing their monitors, and being
isolated from their peers.55
• In one study designed to understand a person’s experience on EM in the adult system,
almost half of those interviewed reported that it negatively impacted their personal
relationships, and 89% of probation officers reported that EM pretrial weakened
participants’ ties with friends and family and hurt relationships.56 This effect of
electronic monitoring directly contradicts delinquency prevention research showing
prosocial connections can prevent further delinquency involvement.57
Further, the emotional, mental, and physical toll that GPS takes on a youth is significant.

• A study conducted in three New York counties found that “of 115 juveniles involved with
the EM program, 64% of juveniles who failed to complete their term of EM cut off their
ankle bracelets, generally thought to be the result of coping difficulties.”58 Additionally,
some youth report living in constant fear of unintentionally violating conditions.59 This
can lead to youth experiencing “the anger and frustration, anxiety and stress, fear and
intimidation, misery, powerless and helplessness that is found at moderate to high rates
among individuals detained pretrial.”60
• The GPS devices themselves can cause physical harm to the wearer, with some reporting
welts and rashes from the devices.61
• Additionally, being on strict surveillance, with conditions that often require extensive
documentation and advance notice to deviate from, also creates serious obstacles to
receiving medical care. This can mean a delay in receiving critical routine, preventative,
or diagnostic care, a delay that could be especially harmful for a “population beset by
many often-untreated mental health illnesses, substance use problems, and chronic
health conditions.”62
GPS Use, Public Safety, and Failure to Appear Rates
Separate from research on GPS and adolescent development, research also suggests that GPS is
not effective at promoting public safety or improving failure to appear rates. The research
reviewed for this report includes:
• A 2020 international meta-analysis of 34 studies on the use electronic monitoring (post-
adjudication), which found that the use of electronic monitoring does not have a
statistically significant impact on reducing re-offending (except for individuals convicted
of a sex offense). In terms of improving FTA rates, there was a mix ranging from no effect
to “inconclusive.”63

• In its 2020 report, the Illinois Supreme Court reviewed a study looking at pretrial GPS
use for individuals facing intimate partner violence charges, leading the Court to
conclude: “there is no research that indicates this condition [electronic monitoring]
promotes public safety or court appearance,” although use of GPS did reduce the risk of
failing to appear to meetings with pretrial probation officers.64
Electronic Monitoring Technology and its Impact on Youth Compliance
Research on jurisdictions that have introduced EM devices with more advanced
technology have shown that these improvements to the devices themselves do not
necessarily result in higher compliance from youth.
In a 2019, a New York pilot program conducted for youth 16-18 replaced traditional
forms of EM (e.g., a GPS ankle bracelet) with a small ankle bracelet which was
connected via Bluetooth to the participating youth’s phone. The ankle bracelet had no
GPS capabilities and did not need to be charged throughout the project; its only purpose
was to ensure the cell phone was physically with the youth.
The program found that this system resulted in an average of four notice of violation
alerts (i.e., youth was out of compliance). However, only 5% of all alerts represented
actual violations – with the other 95% representing violations due to the participants
not adequately charging their cell phone.
Ultimately, the pilot was unsuccessful, with the researchers noting that “keeping a cell
phone charged was not an easy task for many of the young people in our program.”

• Is not effective in promoting public safety: Studies have shown that detention does not
reduce delinquent behavior and increases youth’s likelihood of being re-arrested – with
longer stays in detention increasing recidivism.65
• Increases the odds that youth will become further justice system involved: Pretrial
detention increases the likelihood that youth will be placed in residential custody if a
court adjudicates them delinquent. Further, studies that track youth longer term
outcomes have found that a large portion of youth detained are later involved in the
adult criminal legal system.66
• Disrupts youths’ education: Studies show that school re-enrollment rates for youth
after they are detained are low. Further, youth who are detained are less likely to
graduate high school, enroll in and/or complete college, and have lower employment
and earning opportunities in adulthood.67,68,69
• Has a negative impact on youth’s health and well-being: Youth in detention have
higher rates of physical and behavioral health issues compared to youth generally.
Detention can exacerbate these health problems. In fact, studies find that detention or
commitment during adolescence leads to poorer health in adulthood.70

State Data by Pretrial Process Point71
The Board analyzed available aggregate data reported by the Trial Courts, DYS, and MPS to
inform its research into the juvenile pretrial phase. This section outlines that data by pretrial
process point.
Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on the Data
As mentioned in the Limitations section of this report, the COVID-19 pandemic impacted
juvenile justice system operations and decision-making. There was a concerted effort across
decision-makers to keep youth out of custodial settings as a precautionary measure to
prevent contagion. This meant that the number of youth who were in contact with the
state’s juvenile justice system in FY21 (and to a lesser extent FY20 and FY22) was at an all-
time low. Some of the increases in system use can be attribute to the system resuming
“normal” operations in FY23.
When possible, data pre-pandemic is provided in the following section. However, one of the
most central data elements in this report, condition of release case starts, is only available
from FY21 onward.
For more information on the pandemic’s impact on the juvenile justice system and youth
involved with the system, see the JJPAD Board’s 2021 report:

report-october-2021/download
Key Takeaways

Section 32:
1. Recently, the percent of cases placed on pretrial conditions of release has increased:
Between FY21 and FY23, there was an 110% increase in the number of cases with
pretrial conditions of release. In FY21, there were 628 cases with pretrial conditions of
release and in FY23 that number increased to 1,316.72,73
71 Select data by county and by demographics can be found in the Findings section of this report.
72 As is discussed in the Limitations section of this report, data on COR case starts became available beginning in FY21. During
FY21, there was a concerted effort among juvenile justice stakeholders to divert youth away from the juvenile justice system
during the COVID-19 pandemic. It is likely this resulted in more youth being released on PR when compared to other more
“typical” years.
73 As is discussed in the Limitations section of this report, data on COR case starts became available beginning in FY21. During

“typical” years.
38

Section 33:
2. Arraignments increased as well during this time. Data suggests that some of the
increase in the number of cases placed on pretrial conditions of release may be due to
the 70% increase in the number of arraignments during the same time. In some cases,
conditions of release may be used as alternatives to detention for cases with 58A
Hearings: over this period, the number of 58A hearings have gone up, but the percent
resulting in a detention admission is down.

Section 34:
3. However, over this same time period, a lower percentage of cases were placed on PR –
which means the increase in arraignments does not fully explain the increase in the
number of cases placed on COR. In FY21, an estimated 68% of cases not detained at the
initial arraignment were released on PR. In FY23, this percent dropped to 62% of cases at
this stage.74

Section 35:
4. On average, over the past three fiscal years, bail/personal recognizance revocations
accounted for about a third (33%) of all detention admissions. Most of these
admissions were for youth charged with “lower grid level” offenses. On average, over
the past three fiscal years, about 39% of notices of violation of probation (pre and post
adjudication) are for non-delinquency related reasons. Taken together, the data indicates
a subset of youth are being detained without bail as a result of non-delinquency
related notices of violation of pretrial probation conditions of release.

Section 36:
5. Further, there has been an increase in youth detained on low bail amounts in recent
years. Between FY21 and FY23, there was a 26% increase in detention admissions in
which bail was set. Further, the number of admissions in which bail was set below $100
increased 95%.75 The increase in the percent of cases detained on low bail amounts may
be due – in part – to the requirement that judges must take financial resources into
consideration when setting bail now, but as discussed further in the Findings section of
this report, youth may have bail set for reasons other than flight risk.
74 At the time of this report, the number of youth released pretrial on their own personal recognizances is not reported.
Therefore, the Board has estimated the number by taking the total number of youth not detained pretrial and subtracting the
number of youth released on pretrial conditions of release and pretrial probation as a disposition.
75 As was discussed in the Introduction section of this report, there was a concerted effort by juvenile justice stakeholders to
keep youth out of detention during the COVID-19 pandemic. It is likely this resulted in fewer youth being detained when
compared to other more “typical” years.

In January 2024, the Trial Court began publicly reporting data on initial release decisions at
arraignment on delinquency cases. In FY23, there were 3,977 initial detention/release decisions
made at initial arraignment:
• 3,431 resulted in a youth not being detained (representing about 85% of arraignments)
• 546 resulted in a youth being detained with or without conditions of release
(representing about 14% of arraignments)77

Youth Not Detained at the Initial Arraignment
In FY23, of the youth who were not detained at their first arraignment appearance:
• Over half (51%, n = 1,746) were charged with an alleged persons offense (compared to
40%, n=273 of youth detained at the initial arraignment)
• 39% (n=1,343) were charged with an alleged misdemeanor offense (compared to 16%,
n=86 of youth detained at the initial arraignment)
As is discussed in greater detail in the Background section of this report, youth not detained can
be released either on their own personal recognizance, with conditions of release which are
monitored/supervised by MPS or, in rare occasions, on pretrial probation as a disposition.

estimated calculation by OCA by subtracting the number of COR and from the total number of arraignments
reports by the Trial Court on its public dashboards.
78 At the time of this report, the number of youth released pretrial on their own personal recognizances is not reported.
Therefore, the Board has estimated the number by taking the total number of youth not detained pretrial and subtracting the
number of youth released on pretrial conditions of release and pretrial probation as a disposition.
79 As is discussed in the Limitations section of this report, data on COR case starts became available beginning in FY21. During
FY21, there was a concerted effort among juvenile justice stakeholders to divert youth away from the juvenile justice system
during the COVID-19 pandemic. It is likely this resulted in more youth being released on PR when compared to other more
“typical” years.
80 Youth can be placed on Pretrial Probation as a Disposition at initial arraignment and not detained as a result. However, in
practice this is extremely rare, and therefore, pretrial probation as a disposition cases are presented in this section but omitted
from the Board’s calculations estimating the number of youth who were released on personal recognizance.

Pretrial Conditions of Release
In FY23, there were 1,316 pretrial conditions of release cases started.81 This is more than two
times the number of cases that started in FY21. As is discussed in the Limitations section of this
report, data on COR case starts became available beginning in FY21. During FY21, there was a
concerted effort among juvenile justice stakeholders to divert youth away from the juvenile
justice system during the COVID-19 pandemic. It is likely this resulted in more youth being
released on PR when compared to other more “typical” years.
The increase in pretrial condition of release cases reflects an increase in both cases that are
monitored and supervised by probation, but the majority of cases during this time were
monitored by the Pretrial Services Unit. As Figure 7 shows, more than half of the cases that start
each year are monitored by the Pretrial Services Unit and not supervised by the local office.

Pretrial Detention Admissions to DYS as a Result of Personal Recognizance or Bail Being Revoked
If youth do not comply with their conditions of release, or are charged with a new alleged
offense, their bail may be revoked, and they may be detained pretrial without bail. In FY23, 42%
(n=234) of detention admissions without bail were due to a youth’s bail or personal
recognizance being revoked.

*Probation violation hearings can include both pretrial and post disposition cases.
**This means the court documents sent to DYS do not list a reason for detaining without bail. Unknowns have

Juvenile Detention Alternative Initiative (JDAI).
Source: Data retrieved from the JJPAD FY23 Annual Report
In FY23, the majority of detention admissions where youth were detained without bail as a
result of bail or personal recognizance being revoked were for underlying persons offenses
(58%, n=136), and about half were for “lower grid level” offenses (49%, n=115).
Historically, MPS has not disaggregated pretrial and post-disposition notices of violation of
probation in its public data reporting.82 On average, over the past three fiscal years, about 39%
of probation violation notices (both pre- and post-adjudication) were for non-delinquency
related reasons.
82 Beginning in April of 2024, MPS started collecting violation notice data disaggregated by pre and post adjudication with plans
to begin publicly reporting that data on their Tableau Public Dashboard.

As discussed in the Findings section below, stakeholder interviews revealed that probation
officers have more discretion when handling violations post-disposition than pretrial. Therefore,
it may be the case that some non-delinquency (“technical”) violation notices occur during the
pretrial phase and are contributing to the detention admissions that stemmed from a
revocation.

Youth Detained at Initial Arraignment
In FY23, of the 546 cases that resulted in youth being detained at the initial arraignment:83
• About 38% (n=205) were detained with bail set
• About 20% (n=108) were detained as a result of, or pending a, 58A Hearing
• About 14% (n=75) were detained for unknown reasons
• Fewer than 1% (n=5) were detained for a 68A Evaluation
Youth Detained with Bail Set
In FY23, about a quarter (27%, n= 205) of all detention admissions (n=768) were for youth with
bail set, about a third of which (37%, n=76) were held on less than $100. Nearly half (46%,
n=94) of the youth detained with bail included the stipulation that they be released to their
parent/guardian.84
Over half (59%, n=120) of youth detained with bail set were detained for “lower-level grid
offenses”, most of which (51%, n=62) were for youth who had bail set under $100.85 In FY23,
83 Total does not add up to 100% due to differences in reporting by DYS and the Juvenile Court.
84Legally, all youth must be released to a parent or legal guardian unless otherwise specified by the Court, but anyone can post
bail for the youth. The Board will explore this topic as part of the group’s dually involved youth project in 2025.
85 DYS measures offense severity by a numerical (1-7) “grid level.” Grid levels 1-2 are categorized as low, grid level 3 is
categorized as medium, and grid levels 4-7 are categorized as high.

However, most 58A hearings do not result in a detention admission. In FY23, there were 339
58A Hearings held, but only about 32% (n=108) of those hearings resulted in a detention
admission.86 The other 231 hearings may have resulted in:
• the youth being found not dangerous and released with conditions of release being set
• the youth being found dangerous and released with conditions of release being set
Currently, outcomes of 58A Hearings are not reported by the Trial Court.
Most youth held as a result of a 58A Hearing are held for “higher grid level” (90%, n=97) and
persons related offenses (56%, n=60).
86 This is an estimated calculation based on the number of detention admissions to DYS for 58A Hearings divided by the number

Findings
The pretrial process of the juvenile justice system is complex – and requires the balancing of a
number of competing priorities:
• Youth are, at this phase, presumed innocent, which means they have a variety of legal
rights that must be protected. These legal rights mean that there are limits on judges
mandating certain conditions related to treatment, punishment, or restorative practices
as compared to how they might set conditions post-disposition when youth are
adjudicated delinquent or admit sufficient facts (i.e., a CWOF). Youth can refuse
voluntary services in the pretrial phase – even if some or all of the adults in the system
believe such participation would lead to the best long-term outcomes for the youth.
• Youth are entitled to a speedy trial. However, the judicial process is (often
intentionally) slow to protect a youth’s right to due process. A lengthy pretrial period is
often harmful to the youth, and yet sometimes it is necessary to ensure they have full
access to the various legal proceedings – including discovery and the opportunity to
prepare for trial – to which they are entitled.
• The Juvenile Court is required by law to treat children “not as criminals, but as
children in need of aid, encouragement and guidance,” and the “care, custody and
discipline of the children brought before the court shall approximate as nearly as
possible that which they should receive from their parents.”87 However, many of the
mechanisms in place during this time are the same mechanisms in place for adults (e.g.,
detention, cash bail, pretrial supervision) with limited modifications for youth. The
Juvenile Court must balance this mandate with its mission to “…protect the public
from delinquent and criminal activity” during this part of the system.
• Victims and witnesses also have rights and needs. Safeguarding the rights and needs of
an alleged victim or witness, without infringing on a youth’s presumed innocence at this
stage, can, in some circumstances, be challenging. As is discussed in The Pretrial Process

Section 37:
section of this report, victim advocates stress that victims are not a monolith, and have
unique needs and ways in which they want to be included in the court process.
However, prosecutors and judges have limited mechanisms in which they are able
address victim’s needs at this phase.
87M.G.L. Ch.119 Section 53
51
Complicating things further, there are particular considerations at this phase that are unique to
youth – as many stakeholders interviewed for this report noted, “kids are different.” These
considerations include:
• The different developmental needs of youth, and the increased level of harm they can
experience, compared to adults, from certain interventions or restrictions.
• The added imperative to consider a child’s safety in decision-making.
• The difference in how children experience time as compared to adults.
• Youth have parents/guardians that have legal obligations, rights, and expectations that
can – at times – support or conflict with court proceedings and considerations.
Despite these complications, it is clear that the Commonwealth will benefit when youth are
able to succeed during the pretrial phase – and receive the support they need to do so.
On the other hand, when youth are harmed by the pretrial process – including the harms that
can come from detention or overly restrictive pretrial conditions of release, or from being
treated unfairly – the child, their family, and citizens of the Commonwealth suffer the
consequences directly and indirectly. Although the youth and their families feel those harms
most acutely, youth who “finish” the pretrial period more isolated from their communities, with
more difficulties in school, fewer pro-social connections, and more exacerbated behavioral
health challenges are ultimately more likely to commit delinquent acts in the future, making us
all less safe.
The goal, then, is a pretrial system that treats youth, their families, and victims fairly, sets
youth up to succeed, and does not cause more harm than good. Based on the numerous
interviews conducted for this report, an analysis of the available data, and a review of national
research and best practices at this phase, however, the Board concludes that our pretrial
system is not systematically achieving this goal.
In particular, the Board finds that our pretrial process:
• Sets pretrial conditions for youth that can be developmentally inappropriate or not
tailored to their specific cases – increasing the likelihood youth will violate those
conditions and leading to detentions that could have been avoided.
• Overuses “control” mechanisms, most notably GPS monitoring and home confinement,
that pose multiple harms to youth without necessarily increasing public safety.
• Lasts too long, causing harm to youth, and results in youth missing time from school and
other prosocial activities and delaying treatment and services that might help prevent
delinquent behavior.
• Is directed by a pretrial statutory framework that is unclear and does not account for
all relevant circumstances.
52
The Board also stresses that the state’s pretrial process should be equitable: a youth’s
demographics, family circumstances, or the zip code they are arrested in should not
dramatically influence the trajectory of their case. While some level of variation to respond to
individual circumstances and community needs is to be expected, the Commonwealth should
strive for a basic level of fairness and equitable treatment of all youth across the state. The
Board’s review of quantitative and qualitative data makes clear, however, that:
• There are vastly different regional practices at this stage, leading to concerns about
equity
• There are disparities in who is detained pretrial, who gets placed on pretrial
monitoring/supervision, and who is released on personal recognizance
Each of the Board’s findings are detailed below.
Finding 1: Pretrial Conditions for Youth can Fail to be Developmentally Appropriate
or Tailored to a Youth’s Specific Case
Stakeholders interviewed for this report repeatedly expressed that “kids are different”, and that
the current pretrial system is not designed with the unique circumstances and developmental
stage of youth in mind.
Interviewees regularly noted that current statute, case law, guidance, and standards are
geared toward the adult system, and believed that the Juvenile Court should have specific
guidance, forms, and practices for youth. For example, the readability of the state’s conditions
of release form is at an eleventh-grade level, well above the recommended fifth grade level
suggested for other Trial Court publications.88
Further, as highlighted in the Research section above, the time in which youth can be involved in
Juvenile Court – adolescence (i.e., 12-17 years old in MA) – is a distinct period in life, one in
which the brain is still anatomically developing, making some aspects of the pretrial phase
particularly difficult for youth to comply with.
Additionally, research on juvenile probation conditions suggests that a “one-size” fits all
approach is not effective for youth. Rather, research on youth placed on supervision post-
adjudication suggests that conditions that target specific risk factors and are related to the
offense the youth was adjudicated delinquent of result in better outcomes for youth.
Interviewees noted that a common reason youth violate their pretrial conditions is because the
conditions were not appropriate and/or were unachievable for a youth. Probation is required to
88 For more information see: Massachusetts Trial Court. (2018). Readability Guidelines for Printed Self-Help Materials and Forms.
https://www.mass.gov/doc/readability-guidelines-for-printed-self-help-materials-and-forms/download
53
notify the DAO whenever they become aware of a violation of probation during this phase.
Many probation officers cited inappropriate conditions causing these violations, and thought
the violations could often be better addressed outside of the courtroom. For example:
• Professionals interviewed expressed concerns about frequently used conditions of
release (specifically about GPS, home confinement, and curfews) that remove youth
from their community and prosocial activities. As detailed in the Research section above,
research shows that positive connections and participating in prosocial activities are vital
to youth’s mental health and wellbeing, and when removed, can contribute to
delinquency.
• Some professionals caution against the use of treatment-related conditions at this stage,
noting the “Juvenile Court is not a service provider,” and in many cases these types of
conditions assume guilt. Further, individuals emphasized the challenge of when services
are tied to a delinquency case/process, the services end when the case ends. Often,
treatment-based services require long, ongoing relationships beyond the length of the
delinquency court process, and this disruption in service delivery can be problematic. On
the other hand, some professionals noted that when youth do well on their treatment-
related pretrial conditions, that can help their case at the dispositional stage (i.e., a less
severe sanction).
• In many interviews, professionals expressed concern that judges are setting too many
conditions of release for youth, making it difficult for youth to keep track of, and comply
with, all of the conditions. This ultimately increases the youth’s chances of violating their
conditions and risking detention.
• Stakeholders noted that restrictive conditions can be the hardest for youth to follow, and
cited numerous examples where restrictive conditions were set that were unrelated to
the alleged offense, the facts of a case, or an alleged victim or witness, such as:
Youth being ordered to periodic drug testing, regardless of if the alleged offense
o
was drug related
Youth being ordered to adhere to a nightly curfew, even if the alleged offense
o
happened during the day or afternoon
Youth being ordered not use social media or their cell phone even if the alleged
o
offense did not involve the use of social media or relate to their phone
54
• The Board also heard instances of youth being placed on conditions that were in direct
conflict with each other, such as setting a condition to attend school daily, as well as
setting an exclusion zone that includes their school.
Professionals and young adults also reported that families often were unsure who their
probation officer was when their case was monitored by the Pretrial Unit and what their
requirements were during this time. Youth and families were left frustrated trying to understand
who their probation officer was when their case was monitored at the state level, and who they
could go to for support.
As described above, and further explored in Finding 5, there are a variety of laws that govern
the setting of pretrial conditions of release, and some conditions can only legally be set with the
permission of the youth. Although in some cases the youth may technically agree, through their
attorney, to certain conditions, stakeholders noted that the notion of consent in such situations
is complicated, particularly if the alternative on the table is detention. For this reason, some
stakeholders suggested that the onus should be on all adults in the system – prosecutors
requesting conditions, judges agreeing to conditions, and defense attorneys advising their
clients and arguing for or against conditions – to ensure that conditions are developmentally
appropriate, and that youth are set up to succeed during this pretrial phase.
Bright Spots: MPS’ eReminder Program
Research shows that many youth (as well as adults) miss court dates for mundane
reasons (e.g., lack of transportation, forgetting their court date) rather than
intentionally fleeing justice. Programs targeting these barriers have better results in
improving failure to appear rates when compared to systems that just rely on cash bail.
Understanding this, MPS, in partnership with the Trial Court’s Information Technology
Department, worked to develop an eReminder text message system that sends
reminders to defendants of their court date. The program was piloted in 2022 at a few
district courts and has since been expanded. An evaluation of the program’s impact on
failure to appear rates for pretrial hearings found that in the text reminder group, 11%
of defendant’s failed to appear at their pretrial hearing, compared to 14% for the no
text reminder group. Further, the failure to appear rate at pretrial hearing events was
consistently lower for the text reminder group regardless of age, race/ethnicity,
gender, or offense severity.
As of the writing of this report, MPS and the Juvenile Courts have begun
implementation in delinquency cases.

Finding 2: Restrictive Conditions, Most Notably GPS and Home Confinement, are
Overused
In almost every interview conducted for this report across sectors, professionals expressed
concern about the overuse of overly restrictive conditions, most notably GPS, during the pretrial
phase.
Many professionals believed that the increase in GPS use was an unintended consequence to
Massachusetts limiting the use of detention in Juvenile Court. As discussed earlier in this report,
Massachusetts has made a concerted effort to decrease the use of pretrial detention for youth,
resulting in a 57% decrease in admissions between FY15 and FY24. The Board does not have
annual data on GPS use throughout the same time period or other data pertaining to GPS use,
but many professionals believed it has gone up.
Those interviewed generally agreed that being released on GPS was the “lesser of two evils”
when compared to being detained, and that there are times when a youth can successfully
avoid further juvenile justice system involvement after successfully complying with their GPS
conditions.89 At the same time, many felt as though the harm caused by being placed on a GPS
unit was not well documented or understood across all Massachusetts Juvenile Court
stakeholders.
Some professionals interviewed are skeptical that the adoption of GPS was effective at limiting
detention admissions, however. While it may be the case that the adoption of GPS as a
condition of release is resulting in some youth being diverted from detention, that is not the
case for all youth on GPS. In interviews, professionals cited examples including:
• GPS is often used in cases where youth may have otherwise been released pretrial and,
in some cases, were not even eligible for detention (e.g., there was insufficient evidence
to detain youth as a result of a 58A Hearing).
• Youth in Massachusetts have been held in detention waiting for an ankle monitor,
despite state policies that say youth should not be held for equipment for more than 24
hours.90,91
89 This is reflected in national research as well, and in several law review articles. For example: Crump, Catherine, Tracking the
Trackers: An Examination of Electronic Monitoring of Youth in Practice (2019). UC Davis Law Review, Vol. 53, No. 2, 2019,
https://ssrn.com/abstract=3414273
90 Per Massachusetts Probation Service policy individuals should not be detained for more than 24 hours waiting for equipment.
91 This appears to be a national phenomenon. For example, in one San Francisco study, individuals placed on pretrial electronic
monitoring were held for a median of seven days, compared to three days for those who were released to supervision. Skog, A.
& Lacoe, J. (2022). Pretrial Electronic Monitoring in San Francisco. California Policy Lab. https://www.capolicylab.org/wp-
content/uploads/2022/11/Pretrial-Electronic-Monitoring-in-San-Francisco.pdf
56
• GPS can contribute to “net widening” due to an increase in technical violations related
to the GPS equipment.
In the Board’s review of relevant statutes, case law, and official guidance, it found that there is
no statute providing legal guidance for the use of GPS pretrial in Juvenile Court, and the case
law is conflicting. Many interviewees felt there should be more guidance on the appropriate use
of GPS pretrial.
Specific concerns about using GPS as a condition expressed by interviewees include:
• GPS is not developmentally appropriate for youth, as it requires long-term planning
skills that are still developing in adolescence. The Board heard several examples of youth
having a difficult time keeping devices charged, resulting in youth receiving “false alarm”
violations.
• GPS contributes to a “labeling effect”, which is harmful for youth and families. The
labeling effect refers to the well-documented process by which youth labeled as “bad
kids” adopt those labels as part of their identity, leading to increased likelihood of future
delinquent behavior.92
The Board heard these same sentiments expressed in interviews with young adults who
were placed on GPS as youth. In one interview, the young adult shared how complying
with the conditions of his GPS disrupted his personal relationships, making him feel
further isolated from other youth. In another extreme example, the Board heard of a
youth having two GPS monitors at once – potentially exacerbating the labeling impact.
• GPS when coupled with home confinement is detrimental to youth’s physical and
mental wellbeing. The Board heard numerous examples of youth whose mental and
physical health were severely diminished as a result of being placed on GPS, especially
when it was coupled with home confinement. Examples shared include:
Youth were unable to maintain positive connections with their families and
o
community.
Youth were unable to participate in prosocial activities.
o
Youth experienced negative impacts on their physical and mental wellbeing due
o
to the lack of space and recreation options available to them while on GPS.

https://doi.org/10.2307/2575560 This theory is also supported in juvenile justice system research. For example: Rowan, Z., et.
Al. (2023). Labeling effects of initial juvenile justice system processing decision on youth interpersonal ties. Criminology, Vol. 61,

In fact, in a point-in-time data sample pulled from MPS regarding 217 youth on GPS
monitoring, 80% (n=174) had a “home confinement” condition. About 24% (n=52) had
an “exclusion zone” condition, and about 20% (n=43) had a “curfew” condition.93
The Board heard several examples from professionals of youth who had to delay
preventative medical care due to the burden associated with getting their conditions of
release modified to accommodate medical appointments. While MPS is allowed to make
day-to-day modifications to conditions (e.g., opening a time window to be out of the
house), any changes to the conditions themselves need to be brought into court. This
theme is discussed further in the Research section of this report.
• GPS technology can be unreliable, resulting in youth violating their conditions of
release. Professionals shared several examples of the judicial system citing youth for
technical violations due to faulty or failing technology, such as the GPS suddenly losing
connection.
• GPS is resource-intensive for both court stakeholders and youth and their families. The
Board heard in interviews that both placing a GPS on a youth and responding to
frequent violations due to the unreliable nature of the technology strained Probation’s
resources. Additionally, professionals also shared examples of how disruptive/resource
intensive wearing a GPS unit was for youth and their families. Examples frequently cited
include:
Youth and families having to notify the court/MPS frequently in order to get the
o
conditions of the GPS modified so the youth could attend medical appointments
Youth and families having to drive to MPS’ Electronic Monitoring Program
o
(ELMO) Unit in Clinton or Quincy to address a device that is having technical
difficulties
• Youth are on GPS devices for too long. The Board heard concerns of youth being on GPS
for extended periods, in some instances years, during the pretrial phase. As discussed in
the Research Section of this report, extended use of GPS exacerbates the negative
outcomes associated with its use in adolescents and can also increase the youth’s
likelihood that they will violate and as a result be detained.
It’s clear from both stakeholder interviews and the available research that GPS, as it is currently
used, is resulting in harmful outcomes for youth and their families. Further, due to the lack of
93 Data obtained by OCA from MPS on 12/3/2024.

data on usage in Massachusetts, and the lack of a shared “benchmark” for how GPS should be
used, it is difficult to assess its impact on both public safety and failure to appear rates.
Finding 3: The Pretrial Process Lasts Too Long, Causing Harm to Youth
While the Juvenile Court time standards94 state that delinquency proceedings are to be
disposed within six to eight months, in practice, the pretrial phase can extend much longer. In
fact, in the Board’s interviews, it was not uncommon for professionals to cite examples of a
youth’s cases taking years to reach disposition. There are many ways in which the pretrial
phase can be extended:
• The introduction of evidence that requires forensic or scientific testing (e.g., DNA
testing, drug analysis) or the request of third-party records.
• Motions to dismiss/suppress statements, evidence, search warrants or identifications.
• Requests for a court-ordered delay of a hearing, trial, or other proceeding, referred to as
a continuance, due to the unavailability of a victim, witness, or court personnel, or to
prepare additional evidence for submission. Some continuances have time-limits set in
statute (e.g., a continuance for a 58A Hearing can be no longer than 7 days) while others
are up to the judge’s discretion.
• Requests for court services, such as obtaining interpreters from the Office of Language
Access.
• Finding and scheduling a trial date. Juvenile Courts often schedule trials during certain
days of the week/month, which impacts other court proceedings moving forward during
that time and can create a backlog of trials. Many interviewees noted trials were being
scheduled 6 or more months out.95
• Impacts of other Juvenile Court cases. Delinquency cases represent just part of the cases
judges oversee in Juvenile Court. In addition to delinquency cases, judges hear many
other types of cases including Child Requiring Assistance (CRA) and Care & Protection
(C&P) cases. Emergency hearings for these cases require courts to be flexible and
constantly re-prioritize cases, which can impact case processing time.
• Limited staffing and/or resources across state entities to address the current caseload of
delinquency cases including a limited number of Juvenile Court judges and a shortage of
defense attorneys.
Not only do each of these circumstances take time, but certain court processes (e.g., filing
certain motions) also “pause” the clock tracking how long the pretrial phase lasts (this is

Once a youth’s education and prosocial activities are disrupted, it’s difficult for youth to make
that time up. Research shows that any amount of time away from school can be detrimental to
a youth’s learning, and it can take youth years to recover from that disruption.96 Similarly, as is
discussed in the Research section of this report, disruption or removal from prosocial activities
has been shown to have a negative impact on youth’s physical and mental well-being.
Having a legal case hanging over a youth’s head can significantly impact their mental health. The
stress and uncertainty of pending legal decisions can lead to anxiety, depression, and feelings of

hopelessness, which may hinder their overall development and coping abilities. This constant
pressure can also exacerbate existing mental health issues.97
Further, research shows that children perceive time differently than adults, often experiencing it
as more fluid and less linear, which can influence their understanding of events and memory
formation. Youth often remember events based on emotional impact rather than chronological
order, while adults usually have a clearer sense of past and future events and how they relate.
Kids can experience moments as feeling longer or shorter based on their engagement in
activities.98,99 Adults, with their greater experience, often have a more consistent sense of
duration.100
This impacts how youth remember the juvenile justice system experience and perceive it in real
time. Research shows youth’s perceptions of procedural fairness often center on process rather
than outcomes, which can significantly influence their attitudes and behaviors.101
Finally, research suggests that the longer a case takes to reach disposition, the less impactful
any sanction is on future deterrence. The theory of "swiftness" suggests that timely
consequences for delinquent behavior are crucial for effective individual deterrence in youth.
Research shows when youth experience immediate sanctions for their actions, it enhances their
understanding of the consequences. This reinforces the connection between behavior and
outcomes, which can lead to a reduction in recidivism.102
Alleged victims and witnesses: Depending on the case, victims and witnesses may be asked to
come into court or meet with court personnel on multiple occasions, interrupting daily life
(including school attendance for victims and witnesses who are also youth) and serving as a
reminder of the alleged offense. Prolonged Juvenile Court processes can lead to increased
anxiety and emotional distress for victims and witnesses, as uncertainty about outcomes and

delays in justice can exacerbate feelings of vulnerability.103 Lengthy processes may result in
witnesses being less likely to participate in court proceedings, potentially leading to reduced
testimony and impacting the overall effectiveness of the justice system.104 For victims, delays in
resolution can hinder their psychological recovery and sense of closure, prolonging trauma
associated with the incident.105
Further, research shows that most victims (whether they are children or adults) live in close
proximity – even the same neighborhoods – to the individuals accused of committing
delinquent acts.106 The longer a case is unresolved, the longer potential stressors in a
community are felt, which can lead to delinquency and feelings of vulnerability, as mentioned.
When cases take a long time to be resolved, a community’s perception of the system can
worsen and question legitimacy, which erodes trust.107
Juvenile Justice System/System Personnel: A prolonged Juvenile Court case can overburden
staff across the Juvenile Court, Probation, CPCS/YAD, DAOs, police, DYS, and other state entities,
and can lead to inefficiencies and delays in subsequent cases, leading to a vicious cycle.108
Finding 4: There are Vastly Different Regional Practices at this Stage, Leading to
Concerns about Equity
As documented by the JJPAD Board in previous reports, the juvenile justice system operates
differently across counties. While in some cases this may be a reasonable response to variations
in local circumstances, it can also raise concerns about equity: the zip code a youth is arrested in
can significantly impact how their case proceeds, with similarly situated youth receiving
different treatment based on the county or even court in which their case is handled. (Evidence
of other kinds of disparities, such as racial disparities, are further discussed in Finding 6).

The pretrial phase is no exception. During interviews, the Board heard instances in which
differences across district attorneys’ offices, defense attorneys, probation officers, and judges
led to disparate outcomes for youth.
While the Board does not have all the data necessary to validate the concerns expressed in
interviews, it is clear from what is available that the pretrial phase does operate differently
county to county, and there are indeed disparities in who gets detained, placed on pretrial
monitoring and supervision, or released on personal recognizance. These differences include:
Whether youth are released on personal recognizance or assigned to be monitored by the
MPS Pretrial Unit.109 Based on the Board’s estimated calculations, the percent of youth
released on personal recognizance/sent to be monitored by the Pretrial Unit across counties
varies widely. In FY23, estimates ranged from 59% (n=126) of youth arraigned being released on
personal recognizance/cases monitored in Plymouth County to 92% (n=265) of all youth being
released on personal recognizance/cases monitored in Barnstable County.

Whether youth are assigned conditions of release: In FY23, 42% (n= 561) of pretrial cases with
conditions of release were supervised at the county level. Franklin/Hampshire, Plymouth,
Suffolk, and Worcester counties are more likely to require a youth be supervised pretrial than
other counties. Although the Board does not currently have data on all conditions set, point-in-
time data from August 2023 suggests that Suffolk County uses GPS at a higher rate than other
counties compared to the proportion of state arraignments coming from Suffolk.

Use of cash bail: Compared to the rest of the state, youth who are detained in Hampden,
Norfolk, and Suffolk Counties are more likely to be detained due to inability to make bail than
because they were held without the possibility of bail than in other counties. Of the youth who
are detained with bail set in Hampden County, 76% (n=32) are held on amounts of $50 or less.
In Norfolk, 46% (n=9) of youth detained with bail set are held on amounts of $50 or less.

Whether youth are placed on pretrial probation as a disposition: Of the pretrial probation as a
disposition cases supervised at the local level, 68% (n=105) are supervised in Bristol, Middlesex,
and Norfolk Counties. In comparison, 28% of cases in the state are arraigned in those three
counties. In other words, pretrial probation as a disposition is used much more frequently in
those counties than the rest of the state. In comparison, pretrial probation as a disposition is
rarely if ever used in Plymouth, Barnstable, Franklin/Hampshire, Suffolk, or Worcester counties.
Between FY22 and FY23, Bristol more than doubled the amount of pretrial probation as a
disposition cases, while these cases in Norfolk increased by 78%.

Use of 58A Hearings: Essex County has the highest number of 58A Hearings when compared to
other counties, representing 25% (n=85) of the state total, despite making up only 15% (n=376)
of the state’s felony arraignments. Further, it appears these dangerousness hearings result in
detention less frequently than the state total; while Essex conducts more 58A Hearings than any
other county, youth held without bail due to being found dangerous account for only 25% of
Essex’s detention admissions where youth are held without bail (Table 6 below). Berkshire,
Bristol, Middlesex, Suffolk and Worcester counties were slightly overrepresented in 58A
Hearings, compared to their proportion of state felony arraignments. This means that, while the
level of severity of offense (misdemeanor vs. felony) accounts for some of the differences in 58A
Hearings from county to county, it does not account for all of it.

Finding 5: The Pretrial Statutory Framework is Unclear and Does Not Account for
All Relevant Circumstances
As discussed above and further described below, the Board heard significant concerns from
many professionals interviewed for this report about when and how cash bail and other
conditions of release are set in certain cases. In some cases, this may be the result of an unclear
statutory framework, further complicated by case law, that does not account for all relevant
circumstances. At times, this lack of clarity of intent meant that it was hard for the Board to
measure if the laws are having their intended impact.
Cash Bail
As discussed in the Massachusetts’ Pretrial Phase section of this report, MGL Ch. 276 Section
58110 and 58A111 state that the intention of setting cash bail during this phase of the system is to
make sure youth appear in court and, in the case of 58A, ensure the safety of a victim or
another individual. This statutory focus on flight risk in Section 58 has been reiterated by the SJC
as well.112
However, in making that determination, the state can legally weigh a number of factors that –
research indicates – do not relate to a youth’s “flight risk” and seem unlikely to be related to
victim safety. For example, the statute states that a judge should consider a person’s
employment record and history of mental illness.

Based on interviews with stakeholders and analysis of the data, the Board has concluded that
cash bail is being used at times due to reasons other than flight risk – albeit reasons that in
many cases are related to protecting a child’s safety or responding to other system constraints.
Examples include:
• Holding youth with DCF involvement, specifically due to lack of other placement
options. Youth with DCF involvement represent over half (51%, n=395) of total detention
admissions, and 57% (n=116) of youth held as a result of bail being set.113 Professionals
across sectors expressed concern that youth with DCF involvement are overrepresented
in detention admissions, and that detention is being used in lieu of other placement
options.
• Holding youth being, or perceived as being, commercially sexually exploited (CSEC).
Many professionals believed that youth, particularly girls, are more likely to be held due
to concerns that they are at risk, or are currently being sexually exploited, even if that
was not reflected in the alleged offense.
• Holding youth whose parents refuse to take them home. Some professionals cited bail
being set when a parent/caregiver in court asks the judge to detain their child. According
to interviews, caregivers request youth be held for a variety of reasons such as “teaching
them a lesson” or safety concerns for other household members. Further, only
parents/caregivers have the authority to bail youth out, and for youth whose legal
custodian is DCF, the agency’s practice is to not post bail.
Additionally, it is unclear whether judges are documenting if cash bail is set with the financial
considerations of the youth in mind as required by law. Some interviewees argued that
Massachusetts has already deemed all youth as “indigent” by assigning all youth – regardless of
financial status of their parents/guardians – counsel.114 Interviewees noted that setting cash bail
as a condition of release contradicts that sentiment.
Conditions of Release
As discussed in the Background section of this report, conditions of release set under Section 58
are by law meant to ensure that youth appear in court.115 Further, under Commonwealth v.
Norman (2020), the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court clarified that “the only permissible
113 Further data on youth with DCF involvement can be found in Finding 6 of this report.

goals of pretrial conditions of release [set under Section 58] … were ensuring the defendant's
return to court and his presence at trial and safeguarding the integrity of the judicial process by
protecting witnesses from intimidation and other forms of influence.” (Conditions of release
related to ensuring public safety can only be set for certain offenses under Section 58A or for
cases related to domestic violence under Section 58).
However, stakeholders interviewed for this report noted numerous situations where conditions
were set, even though there were no concerns of a flight risk or witness intimidation. In
interviews, professionals often cited examples of cases where the youth and their family had
been diligent in appearing to court, had a stable living situation, and were attending school, but
still, several conditions were imposed.
While other, broader conditions can permissibly be set under MGL Ch. 267 Section 87, as
discussed above, those conditions are only supposed to be set with the consent of the youth –
which, as the SJC has noted, is an unclear concept when pretrial detention is the alternative to
“consenting.”116
It is unclear to many stakeholders the extent to which judges are being clear about whether
conditions are being set under Section 58 or Section 87 – and, thus, whether a youth’s consent
is truly and meaningful being obtained for all conditions being sent. Indeed, many individuals
interviewed noted seeing “all the boxes checked” on the bail form, suggesting that judges are
not always clearly indicating for the record under which statute the condition is set.
116 The “coercive quality of the circumstance in which a defendant seeks to avoid incarceration by obtaining probation on
certain conditions makes principles of waiver and consent generally inapplicable.” Norman, 484 Mass. at 335, quoting
Commonwealth v. Feliz, 481 Mass. 689, 702 (2019).

Failure to Appear in Massachusetts and the J-PAST
In Massachusetts, the Juvenile Probation Arraignment/Appearance Screening Tool (J-PAST)
was implemented in 2015 as part of the state’s JDAI efforts. The screener predicts youth’s
risk of failing to appear for a court hearing, and calculates that risk based on five factors: 1)
Current open warrants, 2) Number of felony adjudications, 3) School attendance, 4) Prior
failures to appear, 5) History of mental health disorder. The J-PAST was validated using
Massachusetts data, and the factors used to calculate risk somewhat aligns with available
research done in other jurisdictions.
The Board heard in interviews that most youth show up to their court hearings, regardless
of whether or not cash bail is set, and that the J-PAST is not consistently conducted or used.
The intended use of the J-PAST is for a probation officer to screen youth prior to
arraignment. The results of the screener are then supposed to be made available to judges.
However, in practice, it does not appear that the J-PAST is consistently conducted or, when it
is, that judges are asking for its results, nor using the results to inform their decision making.
The Board does not know why the J-PAST was not fully implemented, but in interviews
professionals cited:
• Most youth appear to their court date, even youth who score as a “high” risk for
failing to appear.
• Professionals interviewed expressed concern that there may be biases in the tool
contributing to disparities and racialized outcomes in who scored high and were
detained as a result.
• A lack of understanding of the purpose of the tool (e.g., claiming it took away
discretion, when it was intended to be one of many factors judges could use).
• Lack of implementation monitoring and assessment to see if the tool’s results were
accurate and implementation of the new tool had its intended effect.
• Lack of buy-in from system partners (e.g., judges, DAOs, CPCS, etc.).
• Implementation challenges as a result of a roll-out spanning across the two chief
justices: Chief Justice Edgerton, who was then succeeded then by Chief Justice
Nechtem.

Finding 6: There are Disparities in Who is Detained Pretrial, Who Gets Placed on
Pretrial Monitoring/Supervision, and Who is Released on Personal Recognizance
The Board has documented the persistent racial and ethnic disparities in the Commonwealth’s
juvenile justice system each year since its inception. The pretrial phase is no exception. In fact,
in FY23, Black and Latino youth remained overrepresented at each pretrial process point in the
juvenile justice system.117
Further, the Board heard concerns from court stakeholders that certain groups of youth, namely
girls and youth with DCF involvement, are more likely to be detained pretrial for reasons other
than concerns regarding failure to appear or community safety.
Racial and Ethnic Disparities
To better understand racial and ethnic disparities in pretrial decision-making, the Board
examined Trial Court data on initial decisions on whether to detain a youth on a delinquency
case at the initial arraignment hearing.
Youth detained at the initial arraignment:
In FY23, compared to white youth detained at the initial arraignment,
• Hispanic/Latino youth were 1.32 times more likely to be detained pretrial and 1.47 times
more likely to be detained as a result of bail being set.
• Black/African American youth were 1.07 times more likely to be detained pretrial and

Section 40:
1.37 times more likely to be detained as a result of bail being set. Of youth who were
detained as a result of bail being set, Black/African American youth had higher bail
amounts set (Figure 16).
Youth not detained at the initial arraignment:
In FY23 compared to non-Hispanic/Latino118 youth not detained at the initial arraignment in the
state, Hispanic/Latino youth were 1.88 times more likely to have conditions of release set and

Section 41:
1.71 times more likely to be placed on pretrial probation as a disposition.
In FY23, compared to white youth not detained at the initial arraignment in the state,
Black/African American youth were 1.10 times more likely to be placed on conditions of release
and 0.63 times less likely to be placed on pretrial probation as a disposition.

Gender Disparities
As with the rest of the juvenile justice system, boys represent the majority of admissions in the
pretrial phase when compared to girls. While girls only represent a small number of admissions,
it is clear from the data that both detention and pretrial probation as a disposition are used
differently for girls, including:
• While girls made up 14% (n=106) of all detention admissions in FY23, they made up 21%
(n=44) of detention admissions as a result of bail being set and are held for lower
amounts compared to boys. As discussed throughout this report, many professionals
believed that girls are being detained with bail set for reasons other than flight risks.

LGBTQ+ Disparities
DYS reports the sexual orientation, transgender status, and intersex status of youth in their care
and custody.119 In FY23, 6% (n=47) of pretrial detention admissions were for youth who
identified as LGBTQ+. As the MA LGBTQ Youth Commission has highlighted in recent reports, 6%
of the detention population identifying as LGBTQ+ is below national estimates,120 and as the
Board has highlighted previously, it is unknown if this is a positive sign, or the result of
underreporting by detained youth who may decide not to disclose their gender identity or
sexual orientation status at intake.121
Further, LGBTQ+ youth were held on cash bail more frequently, and held for lower amounts
when compared to youth who did not identify as LGBTQ+.
119 Currently, DYS is the only juvenile justice system entity in Massachusetts that collects and reports data on sexual orientation
and gender identity/transgender/intersex status.
120 According to an OJJDP literature review published in 2014: “available research has estimated that LGBT youths represent 5%
to 7% of the nation’s overall youth population, but they compose 13% to 15% of those currently in the juvenile justice system.

• As discussed in this report, professionals cited examples of youth with DCF involvement
being held on cash bail due to a lack of DCF placement options, rather than due to
failure to appear or safety concerns. DCF does not post bail for youth in their custody
who are detained. Further, when another individual posts bail for youth with DCF
involvement, but a stipulation of “Release to DCF only” is listed, DYS and the entity
posting bail must work with DCF to organize a pickup and DCF must have a placement
for that youth when they are bailed out.

Finding 7: There are Cohorts of Youth Who Could be Diverted Away from Pretrial
Detention, Pretrial Supervision/Monitoring, or the System Entirely
As in previous JJPAD reports, the Board has found that there are cohorts of youth that can be
diverted away from the Juvenile Court system. In interviews, professionals cited that more
youth could be diverted:
• Pre-arraignment: Many professionals felt there are still too many youth at arraignment
with lower-level underlying offenses who could benefit from diversion away from the
system entirely, rather than keeping them involved in the formal Juvenile Court process.
This is reflected in the data: in FY23, a third (36%, n=1,458) of FY23 arraignments were
for misdemeanors.
• From pretrial supervision/monitoring: As discussed in the Data section of this report, in
recent years the percent of cases in which youth are released on their personal
recognizance has decreased, directly correlating with the increase in the percent of
cases monitored/supervised by probation. Professionals interviewed suggested more
youth could be released without any conditions. Some professionals highlighted cases
for youth who had “Category A” conditions of release set (n = 770, representing 59% of
pretrial cases with conditions of release set) and are assigned to be monitored by the
statewide Pretrial Unit as those that could more frequently be released on their own
recognizance instead. Stakeholders argued that this would help concentrate MPS
resources on cases that require active supervision, including cases diverted from
detention (as discussed, below). Many people suggested MPS should focus resources
during this part of the system on cases in which youth are determined to be a flight risk
or safety risk to a victim or the community.
• From pretrial detention. While Massachusetts has been successful in its effort to limit
pretrial detention, professionals interviewed mentioned there are still cohorts of youth
who could be better served in the community. Individuals highlighted there are youth
who could be diverted from detention who needed intermediate options and more
active case management than the current supervision/monitoring structure of probation
during this time. Specifically, professionals mentioned youth who are detained for a
misdemeanor/lower “grid” level offense (n=353, 46% of detention admissions) as good
candidates for diversion from detention once the necessary community-based options
or supports exists.
Additionally, professionals expressed concerns in interviews that there is an over-representation
of youth with unmet needs in pretrial detention. This is confirmed by the data. In FY23,
78
• More than half of youth detained pretrial had an individualized education plan (IEP),
twice the rate of Massachusetts’ students generally.
• A quarter of youth detained pretrial had previously experienced physical or sexual abuse
or had been sexually exploited.
• About a third of youth detained pretrial had identified feelings of depression/anxiety,
almost twice the rate of Massachusetts’ youth population.
Stakeholders shared what they felt are more effective services than detention or conditions of
release:
• Family programming
• Mentoring programs (with credible messengers and other people with lived experience)
• Behavioral health programming
• Substance use programs
• Recreational programs
• Educational programs
Interviewees differed as to whether these services should be court-mandated and court-
provided, or if participation should be voluntary and the emphasis should be on consistent,
warm handoffs to community-based organizations. Several individuals noted the importance of
community-based supports rather than court-based to make sure services don’t end when legal
processes do.
Others noted that youth have the legal right to refuse to participate in services pretrial – and
that some youth do, even if the adults in their life believe it would be in their best interests
(both for a successful resolution of their legal case as well as for their overall life outcomes) to
participate in treatment. Some cited this as a reason to move toward adjudication in certain
cases rather than divert the youth, as participation in services can be required as part of a
disposition.
79
Recommendations for Improvement
As this report describes, Massachusetts has, over the past decade-plus, made significant shifts
to limit the use of detention and increase diversion of youth away from the system – a result
this Board applauds. While some of these shifts were a result of a change of statute (most
notably, provisions of the 2018 Criminal Justice Reform Act), many of the positive changes in the
system were the result of changes in practice by individual judges, prosecutors, probation
officers, defense attorneys, clerk magistrates, and police officers.
These shifts in practice represent a change in culture, prompted by training, by an ever-growing
body of research supporting these practices, and by the development of new supervision and
service options that gave practitioners the tools they needed to try a different approach. At the
core, the shifts have been the result of individual practitioners trying a new approach and
seeing, with their own eyes, the positive impacts.
The moment is ripe for a new shift in practice and culture. Increases in the use of pretrial
conditions of release, including more restrictive conditions like GPS and home confinement, are
at least partially a result of the shift away from the use of detention. Yet an increasingly large
body of research, Massachusetts data, and practitioner experience suggest that just as more
critical examination of the use of detention began over a decade ago, a similar examination is
now needed regarding how and when pretrial conditions of release are used.
Similarly, just as the state has put more resources toward expanding diversion options in recent
years, the Commonwealth must also consider ways to expand services and supports during the
pretrial phase for youth who have not been diverted, but who also do not need to be detained.
In doing so, Massachusetts can improve outcomes for youth who become involved with the
justice system – and in the process, protect public safety by reducing the likelihood of future
delinquency.
To help spur this change in practice and culture, the Board offers the following
recommendations to continue the progress made over the past decade-plus and ensure that
our pretrial system promotes equity and positive outcomes for youth defendants, protects
alleged victims and witnesses, and supports the professionals doing this work each day.
In order to achieve these goals, the JJPAD Board recommends Massachusetts:
• Improve how conditions of release are set and re-visited throughout the pretrial
process
• Divert more youth from detention and Juvenile Court involvement by expanding the
range of pretrial supervision and pre-arraignment diversion options
• Support implementation of pretrial reforms and continue to measure the impact
80
Improve How Conditions of Release are Set and Re-visited
Throughout the Pretrial Process
As described in Findings 1 and 2, the Board found that many pretrial conditions are not
developmentally tailored for the individual youth – increasing the likelihood they will violate
those conditions and leading to detentions that could have been avoided. In particular, the
Board is concerned about overuse of “control” mechanisms, most notably GPS and home
confinement, that harm youth without necessarily increasing public safety.
Although there was widespread agreement among individuals interviewed for this report that
pretrial condition-setting is an area of concern, there was less agreement as to why. In
particular, professionals working in the system differed on the extent to which judges should
focus solely on setting conditions that relate to ensuring court appearance and protecting
alleged victims and witnesses at this stage, versus setting conditions that connect youth
defendants to treatment interventions as soon as possible or are otherwise set “for the good of
the youth” (e.g., attend school daily). There was not universal agreement as to which approach
leads to better outcomes.
Guidance in statute and case law is also limited. In 2020, the Supreme Judicial Court held in
Commonwealth v. Norman that pretrial conditions ordered under the bail statute124 must be
narrowly tailored toward ensuring a defendant’s presence at trial and protecting the integrity of
the judicial process. However, under Jake J v. Commonwealth (2000),125 nearly any condition of
release may be set by the judge with the youth’s consent. (The notion of “consent” is, however,
complicated when the alternative is detention – a concept the Supreme Judicial Court has also
recognized.126)
Finally, many stakeholders interviewed for this report noted the impact of fear on the condition-
setting process. No prosecutor or judge wants to be the person to release a youth from
detention or not use GPS or not set a curfew for a youth who goes on to commit a new alleged
offense – and then find their decisions excoriated in the local press.127 Conversely, some
defense attorneys expressed fear that objecting – at all or “too vociferously” – to certain

126 The “coercive quality of the circumstance in which a defendant seeks to avoid incarceration by obtaining probation on certain
conditions makes principles of waiver and consent generally inapplicable.” Norman, 484 Mass. at 335, quoting Commonwealth
v. Feliz, 481 Mass. 689, 702 (2019).
127 For example, in 2024 the following stories involved individuals during the pretrial phase:

monitoring/?p1=BGSearch_Overlay_Results
81
conditions, even if those conditions were clearly setting their client up to fail, could ultimately
lead to worse outcomes for their clients.
These are not easy decisions – and while research findings alone cannot tell professionals what
the “right” decision is for any individual case, they can help point us in the right direction. Just
as a better understanding of the research on the longer-term harms of detention has led
Massachusetts to reduce the use of detention over time, so too can a better understanding of
the longer-term harms of GPS, home confinement, and other conditions that restrict youth
engagement with pro-social activities help inform decision-making in this arena.
The state should not assume every practitioner in the court has the time to keep abreast of all
of the relevant research, however. The juvenile justice system professionals who work in the
field day in and day out deserve evidence-based guidance and state support to help make
informed decisions based on each youth’s case and the alleged victims.
Therefore, the Board recommends that the state provide a greater level of guidance and – as
discussed in Recommendation 7, training – to Juvenile Court practitioners on setting and
revising pretrial conditions of release.
Recommendation 1: Provide More Guidance on Setting Pretrial Conditions of
Release for Youth
While the Trial Court published guidance on this topic in 2016, the JJPAD Board believes the
Juvenile Court should set its own guidance for court processes at this stage, building on the
unique mission of the Juvenile Court.128 Similar to the Juvenile Court’s 2019 guidance on
dispositional and sentencing best practices, and drawing on statute, case law, and the best
available research on topics like adolescent brain development and the negative impacts that
certain conditions can have on youth, the Juvenile Court should provide detailed guidance for
judges. This guidance would aim to assist judges in determining when they should release a
youth on personal recognizance, when to set conditions of release and what those conditions
should be, when to revoke bail or modify conditions, and when to detain a youth pretrial.129
This guidance could take a variety of forms and should be explained and reinforced with regular
training (see Recommendation 7).
Based on the Board’s research, the Juvenile Court should consider including the following
concepts when developing this guidance:

• Determining whether conditions of release are needed and starting with a
presumption of release on personal recognizance. As this report highlights, data
suggests judges are releasing youth on personal recognizance less and using conditions
of release (particularly those that don’t require active probation supervision) more.
According to numerous stakeholder interviews, many of those youth could, instead, be
released on personal recognizance without negative public safety consequences. One
group that may be appropriate to release on personal recognizance, for example, are
youth released on “Category A” conditions monitored by the state Pretrial Unit. Indeed,
these cases increased 77% since FY21.
• Avoiding the use of restrictive conditions that conflict or prevent participation in a
youth’s current prosocial activities unless necessary given the facts and circumstances
of the case, or in order to permit an alleged victim’s participation in prosocial
programs. Research shows that positive connections and participating in prosocial
activities are vital to youth’s mental health and wellbeing.130 However, many conditions
of release remove youth from their community and any prosocial activities. This loss of
prosocial activities is not only detrimental to a youth’s physical and emotional well-
being, but it also increases their risk of further delinquency.131 When determining
if/when restrictive conditions are necessary for the youth, judges should consider:
Starting with the least restrictive option possible (accounting for the circumstances
o
of the alleged offense and other relevant factors) and making modifications (more or
less restrictions) based on the youth’s behavior (see Recommendation 3 for more
details on this idea).
Setting the most focused restrictions possible with the goal of ensuring alleged
o
victim/witness safety while also avoiding the detrimental impact isolation can have
on a youth’s long-term outcomes.132 For example, a judge could start by imposing a

curfew rather than home confinement. If a youth is unable to follow the curfew
condition, curfew could be limited even further, and then finally, a judge may
choose to impose home confinement.
Only using GPS as an alternative for cases in which a judge would otherwise detain a
o
youth,133 or as a last option before revoking bail and detaining a youth and ensuring
that GPS restrictions are limited to specific exclusion zones rather than being overly
broad.
Avoiding the use of home confinement, restricting the use to situations where there
o
is evidence before the court establishing that a youth presents a flight risk or an
imminent danger (e.g., as determined by MGL c. 276 Section 58A) to the community.
In setting a condition of home confinement, judges should also consider the mental
health impact on the youth, the safety of the youth in their home, and the negative
impact that home confinement can have on their participation in prosocial activities,
and their family dynamics.
• Limiting the number of conditions. As this report details, “less is more” when it comes
to supervising youth, and research shows individualized condition setting is more
effective at reducing recidivism.134 This principle can also apply to conditions set at the
pretrial phase. Therefore, judges should make every effort to only set conditions that
are directly related to the youth’s risk of failing to appear at future court dates and the
safety of any alleged victims and witnesses, rather than a list of conditions that are
“good for youth.” This can help youth be successful and not violate their terms of
release. One way to limit the number of conditions set at this stage is to focus on the
individual facts of the case by relating conditions to the underlying alleged offense.
For example, if a youth is not charged with a drug-related offense and substance use
was not a factor in the underlying offense, drug testing should not be set as a condition.
Judges should also ensure the concerns of alleged victims and witnesses regarding
personal safety are heard and take that input into consideration when setting
conditions.
133 The court may consider modeling guidance off of Illinois law that states GPS should be used when there is no less restrictive
condition that would ensure appearance in court or protect an identifiable person from imminent threat from serious physical
harm. https://www.ilga.gov/legislation/101/HB/PDF/10100HB3653lv.pdf
134 As one study states, “This is because surveillance alone has little to no impact on reoffending; adolescents are unable,
developmentally, to make progress on multiple goals; and standardized approaches don’t address the varying factors that
contribute to youth’s delinquent behavior.” The Council of State Governments. (n.d.). Breaking the Rules: Rethinking Condition
Setting and Enforcement in Juvenile Probation. https://projects.csgjusticecenter.org/breaking-the-rules/
84
The legislature may want to consider revisiting the General Laws to determine whether
there is a need to adopt changes that ensure that conditions set in the Juvenile Court
are developmentally appropriate for youth and are limited to the facts and
circumstances of the underlying case.
• Determining when to use prosocial, treatment, or service-related conditions.
Professionals interviewed for this report varied on when it is helpful to set prosocial,
treatment, or service-related conditions (e.g., drug treatment, behavioral health
assessments, counseling, mentorships, attending community programming, attend
school). Some suggested using these types of conditions when a youth’s needs were
urgent and delaying the service would hurt the youth’s opportunity for success. Others
thought the treatment/service-related conditions should be used to promote positive
youth life outcomes beyond the scope of the legal case. Others thought these conditions
should only be used if related to the underlying offense (e.g., if a youth was alleged of
committing a drug offense, a drug-related counseling condition would be appropriate).
Others felt these types of conditions should not be used at all pretrial, as they may
assume guilt. Research suggests overly broad conditions such as “Obey all school rules”
are difficult for youth to comply with and increase their chances of violating.135
These conditions can typically only be set under G. L. c. 276, Section 87, which means a
youth’s consent is required. Even if that consent is given, however, setting such
conditions may not always be in their long-term best interests. While there are many
considerations to balance, it would be useful for the Juvenile Court to provide guidance
on how judges can determine when a prosocial, treatment, or service-related condition
is the best course of action, and how judges can avoid broad/generalized conditions. In
particular, the Juvenile Court should consider how judges can determine if a youth’s
consent was “freely and voluntarily given…unfettered by coercion, express or
implied.”136
The legislature may consider a review of the data in this report to consider whether
there is a need to revisit G. L. c. 276, Section 87 in order to ensure that there is greater
clarity under the law that offers when, and what type, of service-based conditions are
appropriate and developmentally appropriate so that the onus of consent is not squarely
placed on still-developing youth.

85
• Judges should clearly put on the record which statute they are tying conditions to, so
youth know what they are consenting to and why, and professionals understand what
pretrial supervision is for in each specific case (i.e., flight risk, public safety risk).137 It
was clear in the interviews that informed this report that court professionals across
roles (prosecutors, defense, judges, and probation officers) are not always consistent in
aligning conditions with statutes. While the Board does not have data to verify this,
several stakeholders referenced situations where judges used Section 87 and Section 58
interchangeably – contra to the holding in Jake J.138
There also may be a role for the legislature to revisit the statutory framework currently
in place to determine whether there is a way to streamline and avoid this type of
confusion.
The Juvenile Court should consider additional tools to support implementation of this guidance
such as developing bench cards and, as outlined in Recommendation 7, training judges.
Recommendation 2: Develop a New “Order of Pretrial Conditions of Release”
Form
To encourage condition setting in accordance with the above-recommended guidance, the
Juvenile Court and MPS should develop a new “Order of Pretrial Conditions of Release” form
specifically for Juvenile Court use.
The current “Order of Pretrial Conditions of Release” form reads at an 11th grade level and is
the same one used in adult court. It is also constructed in a way that sets up a “check list of
conditions.” Stakeholders interviewed for this report suggested that this “check list” format
encourages judges to set a number of conditions quickly, without necessarily pausing to reflect
on the applicability of each condition to each individual case.
The Juvenile Court and MPS should craft a specific order form for its court processes. MPS is
currently undergoing a restructure of the order of conditions for post-disposition supervision.
137 As cited in http://masscases.com/cases/sjc/433/433mass70.html
138 “Where the Juvenile Court intends to set conditions of release, we emphasize the need to be clear on the record that the
juvenile is being released on bail or personal recognizance pursuant to G. L. c. 276, § 58, and that, with his consent and
agreement, he is simultaneously being placed on probation pursuant to § 87. Further, it should be explained to the juvenile that
any agreed-on conditions of probation also constitute the conditions of his release. … Finally, the judge should explain the
consequences of violating any of the agreed-on conditions. We stress that these requirements are matters of substance, not
merely of form. Placing a juvenile on conditions of release under § 87 should be more than -[a]rtful nomenclature,"
Commonwealth v. Taylor, supra at 626, or the reference to one statute rather than another.”
http://masscases.com/cases/sjc/433/433mass70.html
86
The Board is encouraged by this and recommends the pretrial order form also be updated with
the following considerations:
• Placing the box for “Other” conditions set at the top of the form to make it more
prominent. This is to encourage judges to set individualized conditions at this stage and
to limit the “checklist” effect of selecting all conditions on the form. The name of the
category could also be changed – to, for example, “Individualized Conditions.”
• Remove adult-specific conditions to focus on research-supported conditions for youth.
For example, the current form includes “pretrial services” and treatment at Community
Corrections Centers as a condition, which are currently only available for adult
defendants, not youth.
• Clearly indicate which conditions are being set under which statute (Sections 42A, 58,
58A, or 87), especially when conditions are set under multiple statutes. This should also
indicate why a judge sets a condition (i.e., a flight risk vs. victim/witness safety
considerations).
• Make the form accessible at the 5th grade level to match court guidance.139 This revision
can also help ensure youth are able to understand, and therefore abide by, their
conditions.
• Make the form available in multiple languages.
Recommendation 3: Provide Guidance on the Process for Revising Pretrial
Conditions of Release for Youth and Addressing Violations
While pretrial conditions of release can already be revisited when there is a change of
circumstance, the Board heard that this was not happening consistently across the state for all
youth defendants, and that many youth could benefit from more frequent revisiting of
conditions. Based on interviews, there are several reasons why conditions of release may not be
consistently revisited, including resource allocation, attorneys’ strategies, and/or lack of options
to actually modify conditions.
Many professionals interviewed for this report believed that additional guidance from the state
on when and how pretrial conditions should be revisited throughout the life of a case, and in
particular how violations of pretrial conditions should be addressed, would be helpful for
ensuring greater consistency across the state in pretrial proceedings and in promoting
evidence-informed practices.

Forms. https://www.mass.gov/doc/readability-guidelines-for-printed-self-help-materials-and-forms/download
87
The state has already started to do this for post-disposition violations of probation with MPS’
graduated response system, which many stakeholders interviewed for this report pointed to as
a successful and important reform in recent years.140
The Board recommends the Juvenile Court (in collaboration with MPS, DAOs, and CPCS/YAD)
develop a standardized protocol for revisiting conditions of release during the pretrial phase
and addressing violations. The Board recommends the following concepts be included in any
standard protocol:
• A mechanism for incenting compliance/positive behavior: Professionals interviewed
for this report believed that it would be useful to have clear mechanisms for revising
conditions of release in response to youth behaviors, and to be able to communicate
those mechanisms to youth in advance. Research is clear that youth are more motivated
by potential rewards than potential punishments;141 giving youth the opportunity to
“earn their way off of” certain restrictive conditions (e.g. GPS, drug testing) could help
incent positive behavior. Creating recommended, standardized timelines for when these
conditions should be revisited could prompt judges to set review hearings in advance
and/or give defense attorneys clear guidance on when a motion to revisit a condition
would likely be successful.
• Mechanism for adjusting conditions in response to violations without requiring a
motion for revocation: Stakeholders interviewed for this report also noted that
sometimes probation will report that a youth has violated a condition, but there will be
no response from the system. This is likely due to the fact that a DAO does not believe
the violation is significant enough to warrant moving for a revocation. While avoiding
unnecessary revocations is an important goal, this can send mixed messages to a youth
about whether they really have to follow conditions, or not.142 Creating guidelines for
how the system might respond to violations that do not warrant revocation, coupled
with more flexibility in when and how a DAO could motion for reconsideration of
conditions in lieu of requesting a revocation, might allow for more equitable,
predictable, and measured responses to youth behaviors. Such a process may also
140 MPS implemented an administrative hearing process as part of their post-disposition violation process and starting using
incentives to encourage positive behavior. Probation has also started to implement the Carey Guides to assist in case
management, concepts which may be helpful to think about in collaboration with other court stakeholders when developing a
court system response pretrial.

offense. See for example: Loughran, T., et. Al. (2015). Studying Deterrence Among High-Risk Adolescents. OJJDP Juvenile Justice
Bulletin. https://ojjdp.ojp.gov/sites/g/files/xyckuh176/files/pubs/248617.pdf
88
promote stakeholders to consider at the outset whether a condition is important
enough that a violation would always prompt a system response.
Figure 25:
Behavior-Based Conditions of Release Modifications
• Timeframes for revisiting conditions: The protocol should provide guidance on
when/how often conditions should be revisited. This report highlights that the pretrial
phase of Massachusetts’ legal process can last a long time. Conditions of release are set
relatively early in that process. Judges may set conditions that seem appropriate at the
time of arraignment, but these same conditions may not be appropriate some days,
weeks, months, or even years later.
While some temporary modifications can be made by probation without a court
hearing, changing the terms or conditions entirely requires bringing the youth back into
court. The current practice is for attorneys to bring a motion for a change of conditions
based on information that shows a change of circumstance, but there are barriers that
exist to doing so in a timely manner. For example, it requires a youth to plan ahead and
alert their attorney to any predictable change in circumstance and communicate that
with their attorneys. Attorneys then need to file a motion to change the terms, a
prosecutor may need time to respond, and a judge must set a date to convene all
parties for a court hearing.
Time standards should include process points where system practitioners are expected
to discuss adjusting pretrial conditions. For example, the court may want to revisit
conditions shortly after arraignment. Often youth meet their attorney for the first time
at an arraignment, and counsel has a limited amount of information on the youth they
89
are representing, the case, and what conditions a youth can actually abide by. Yet,
judges often need to set conditions at this process point, namely, to protect any alleged
victims/witnesses. If pretrial conditions could be revisited more easily shortly after an
arraignment, this provides defense counsel the opportunity, preferably in partnership
with a social worker, to provide additional information to inform the setting of
conditions.
Additionally, time standards might be tied to specific conditions. For example, when
setting GPS monitoring as a condition of release, judges may want to impose that for a
set number of days, after which a hearing would be scheduled to see if the GPS
conditions needed to be modified. This is the case, for example, in California, which by
law limits the amount of time a youth can be placed on GPS to 30 days, after which a
case is brought back into court to revisit if GPS is still necessary.143
• Processes/expectations for probation input: Professionals interviewed for this report
noted that there are differences from courtroom to courtroom as to whether probation
is consulted in determining conditions to set at this stage, and when in the process that
happens. This difference in practice can contribute to disparities across the state. Any
standard protocol should clearly outline probation’s role in recommending conditions of
release and reporting changes in a youth’s circumstances and behaviors. One way to
streamline this could be for probation to make recommendations shortly after initial
conditions are set at arraignment about the appropriateness of the initial conditions.
(Such a process would likely require MPS to issue standards for how probation officers
should make these recommendations – for example, what information they should
consider.)
• Processes/expectations for victim input: While the Board did not have the opportunity
to interview victim/witness advocates across all DAOs, the Board did hear from other
stakeholders that victims were not consistently given the chance to be heard on what
conditions would be supportive for them during the pretrial phase. Any standard
protocol should clearly outline alleged victims’ rights and how a victim’s requests should
be considered in condition-setting, including any revisitation of conditions throughout
the pretrial process.
• The ability to conduct these hearings virtually. Court practitioners may be reluctant to
bring system stakeholders together to revisit conditions as often as might be useful for a
143 California Assembly Bill No. 2658, CH. 796
90
given case, given the fact that even quick in-person conferences can add up in a system
that already has a backlog of cases.144 Virtual hearings are less of a resource strain and
can encourage revisiting conditions more frequently without interrupting long term case
processes. Courts might consider setting a regular date and time for virtual hearing to
reconsider pretrial conditions. Court officials and defense attorneys should make sure
youth are able to attend these virtual hearings and meet with their attorney. Further,
before relying on virtual hearings, challenges regarding stable internet connections that
can impede a youth’s ability to participate in a hearing should be resolved.
Divert More Youth from Detention and Juvenile Court
Involvement by Expanding the Range of Pretrial Supervision and
Pre-arraignment Diversion Options
As detailed in Finding 7, despite the positive results of a concerted statewide effort to limit the
number of youth coming into contact with the Juvenile Court process, this Board’s research
suggests there are still cohorts of youth that can be diverted from detention, pretrial
supervision/monitoring, or arraignments generally.
As this report highlights, research supports diverting youth away from the formal justice system
whenever possible. Research suggests diversion can be an effective tool to increase public
safety145 and improve youth outcomes compared to the traditional juvenile justice system.146
For cases that cannot be diverted from the system entirely, diversion from custodial settings
(e.g., pretrial detention, residential commitments) can reduce some potential negative
consequences.147
Additionally, diverting youth away from detention, probation, or the system generally allows the
state to focus on the limited number of youth who require a higher level of supervision during
this time.
144 In some cases, a change to a youth’s conditions might not require a formal virtual hearing. For example, currently, MPS can
adjust certain conditions for short time frames (e.g., to travel for an emergency), which should continue to be practice in those
circumstances.

91
The Board encourages the development and use of additional “off ramps” at each of these
process points to continue to divert youth away from system involvement and focus state
resources during the pretrial phase on the limited number of youth who need the higher level
of supervision.
Recommendation 4: Create a Well-resourced Continuum of Interventions for
Supervision in the Community During the Pretrial Period
In its research, the Board learned that supervision options during the pretrial phrase are limited.
Youth can be:

Section 42:
1. Monitored by the MPS statewide Pretrial Unit. These cases include conditions set under
“Category A” and are not actively supervised by probation.

Section 43:
2. Supervised by the local probation office, which primarily entails a probation officer
checking in with the youth prior to each court date, regardless of the condition set as
long as it is a “Category B” condition. The only exception is a GPS condition, which is
monitored 24/7. Any violations are issued by the local probation office. Community
supervision or face-to-face meetings with probation officers only take place when a
judge orders those as conditions. These are the same standards for both adult and
juvenile pretrial probation supervision.

Section 44:
3. Detained pretrial in a DYS staff secure or hardware secure facility. In some regions across
the state, DYS can place detained youth in DYS-contracted foster homes and provide
case management for youth placed there. These beds are limited.
These options leave little flexibility in tailoring this part of the system to fit the individual
circumstances of the youth. As numerous professionals interviewed for this report noted, to
those working in the field it can feel sometimes like the options are “diversion or detention”
with nothing in between.
For example, there are limited options (beyond GPS) for youth who may need a higher level of
supervision to address pressing needs or to ensure public safety, but who do not need to be
detained. In the same vein, youth who are released from pretrial detention back into the
community may need a higher level of supervision and/or support to ensure success – and
judges may feel more comfortable releasing a youth from detention prior to disposition if they
knew those supports existed.
Indeed, a review of the available data suggests that there are some youth being held in
detention that could, with the right supports, be safely maintained in the community. For
example, of all detention admissions in FY23:
92
• 46% (n=353) were for youth with underlying lower-level severity offenses, such as
misdemeanor assault and battery
• 27% (n=205) were for youth held on cash bail (as opposed to being held for
dangerousness)
In fact, most youth who are detained are not ultimately committed to DYS. Just 16% (n=120) of
detention admissions in FY23 were for youth who were ultimately committed to DYS for the
underlying case when their case was resolved.
A number of these admissions are likely for youth who do present a flight risk or a threat to a
victim, witness, or community safety. However, many stakeholders interviewed for this report
cited examples of situations where pretrial detention was used for reasons other than
community safety or assuring a youth appeared in court.
Finally, several stakeholders mentioned underlying, potentially unmet needs, driving behavior
that can lead to a violation of probation, bail revocation, and eventual detention admission.
For all these reasons, Board members and numerous stakeholders interviewed for this report
wanted more tools and options to respond to those types of cases as a way to focus
supervision on individual needs while continuing to decrease the number of youth that are
held in a detention facility.
For the state to successfully implement changes to how conditions of release are set and
revisited throughout the pretrial phase, there must be a continuum of supervision and case
management options. In other words, if youth “fail” with their current conditions, the state
needs options to adjust either the supervision levels or conditions.
Similarly, additional service options could help youth who spend some number of days in
detention navigate re-entry and provide more of a “step down” option from a residential
placement back to the community. For example, numerous stakeholders mentioned challenges
with schools re-engaging with youth coming home from detention, and many youth face
educational challenges as a result. Other stakeholders noted youth returning home who face
pressures of gang involvement and who don’t have the supports in place to avoid that or stay
safe themselves.
Some examples of what the state could consider in this continuum include:
• MPS could enhance its internal processes for making voluntary service referrals and
streamline collaboration with referral networks, like the Family Resource Centers, for
youth on their caseload.
93
• MPS and/or EOHHS could offer wraparound supports or additional services for youth
who need a higher level of support during the pretrial period who might otherwise be
detained. Some examples of these services could be:
those procured by DCF to support child wellbeing for youth with open DCF cases
o
as part of their family support and stabilization program;
DPH BSAS programs expanding substance abuse programming for youth pretrial;
o
DMH Children, Youth, and Family services expanding connections to youth in the
o
pretrial process;
DMH Juvenile Court Clinics expanding in-house treatment, bridge therapy, and
o
service referral;
MPS offering additional services for youth pretrial, similar to what is currently
o
offered for adult defendants through Justice Support Centers. JSCs offer
numerous programs pretrial, including cognitive behavioral therapy, employment
counseling, and educational supports such as GED/HiSET and post-secondary
preparation.148
DYS could expand eligibility for and increase the number and type of community-
o
based options for detained youth, including but not limited to DYS contracted
foster home placements.
Some of these options may require additional funding from the legislature to support new
contracts with community-based providers. When considering funding, the Board recommends
including funds to hire additional staff to build capacity. Additionally, funds should be made
available to create ongoing professional development opportunities for that staff, which should
include additional trainings focused on diversity, equity and inclusion, implicit bias, cultural
competency, and cultural humility in addition to the trainings outlined in Recommendation 7. To
avoid duplication of services and promote efficiency, MPS, EOHHS, and the Juvenile Court
should collaborate when re-procuring services and align referrals whenever possible.
Recommendation 5: Improve GPS technology
As detailed in Finding 2, many stakeholders reported technological challenges with the current
GPS units for youth in Massachusetts. Individuals specifically mentioned the immense
difficulties getting youth to 1) remember to charge the device and 2) find time to sit next to the
device to charge it for hours. Interviewees also highlighted the “false alarm” notifications that
went off throughout the day when youth were in approved areas (like their school), but out of
cell phone range.
148 MPS previously offered JRCs for youth but closed these programs due to declines in funding and low utilization at the time.
Of note, this was prior to many of the systems-level changes that have led to an increase in the utilization of pretrial probation
for youth.
94
As referenced in Recommendation 1 of this report, the use of restrictive conditions should be
limited and conditions such as GPS should be used as a last option. However, given that GPS is
increasingly being used as an alternative to detention, and this Board is recommending an
expansion of supervision options during the pretrial phase, the state should improve GPS
technology in order to support effective supervision.
As of this report, MPS recently closed a bid to procure a GPS contract. MPS also reports working
on best practices for GPS supervision. The Board is enthused about both initiatives and
encourages MPS to take the Board’s research and findings into consideration when selecting a
contract, for ongoing contract monitoring, and to inform GPS supervision standards.
Recommendation 6: Divert More Youth Pre-Arraignment by Expanding
Opportunities for State Diversion
In the Board’s 2019 report on community-based interventions for youth involved in the juvenile
justice system, the JJPAD Board found that there were no statewide standards or guidelines in
Massachusetts regarding the use of diversion, and no entity that provided oversight for
diversion practices. 149 That report recommended the creation of a statewide diversion program
to ensure that youth across the Commonwealth had equitable access to high quality, state
funded diversion programming.
-
As a result of that report, with funding allocated by the Legislature in the state budget, the OCA
partnered with DYS to launch the Massachusetts Youth Diversion Program (MYDP), a multiphase
state funded youth diversion initiative that provides high quality, evidence based programming
that can serve as an alternative to arresting youth or prosecuting them through the Juvenile
- - -
Court.
Since 2021, the MYDP has expanded to seven counties, with the goal of expanding statewide. In
2024, UMass published an evaluation of the program and noted its success.150 In its FY25
budget, the Legislature made the MYDP a permanent state service when it transferred the
operating budget to DYS’ line item 4200-0700 as part of DYS’ mandate for evidence-based
delinquency prevention.151
Due to the success of the model, as well as continued inequities in which youth remain in the
Commonwealth’s traditional justice system (i.e., youth of color, youth with unmet needs, youth

in certain counties), the JJPAD Board recommends the Legislature continue to fully fund and
expand this program to cover all counties in the Commonwealth.
In addition to funding the MYDP, the Board recommends the Legislature also expand the list
offenses eligible for judicial diversion.152 Juvenile judicial diversion was created as a result of
the 2018 CJRA153 to keep youth with low level offenses out of the juvenile system. Judicial
diversion gives judges, a neutral party, the opportunity to decide if youth charged with certain
offenses would benefit from a youth’s participation in diversion programming rather than the
formal court process.
Although data is not available yet for all judicially diverted cases, it is available for cases diverted
to the MYDP. For cases referred to the MYDP in the first two years of its existence, judges
represented 48% (n=198) of all referrals, representing an interest in judicial diversion.154 In the
same timeframe, of the judicial cases that were closed, 85% (n=116) of those completed the
program successfully. Since the implementation of judicial diversion, however, the list of eligible
cases has only been updated one time, when the state included sexting-related offenses in the
list of eligible charges.155
Support the Commonwealth’s Capacity to Implement Reforms
and Measure the Impact
As this report highlights, there have been several initiatives, policy reforms, and procedural
changes to the juvenile justice system over the past decade. Many of these shifts represent
improvements based on evidence-based best practices and current research. However, it has
also meant potential unintended consequences and challenges for professionals working in the
system every day.
Changes in policies and procedures must be accompanied by sufficient training to support
culture shift and buy-in from the professionals asked to implement these changes. Similarly, in
some cases additional resources are needed to ensure implementation – and data to track the
impact of changes can help us measure the extent to which we are or are not achieving our

implementation goals. Policies are only as good as the people and systems that implement
them, and reforms without proper implementation support often fail to achieve their intended
impact.
To support the implementation of the other recommendations in this report, the Board
recommends providing training on aspects of the pretrial system for all system practitioners,
increasing court capacity, providing additional supports for case practitioners, and increasing
data availability to continue to inform policy and practice.
Recommendation 7: Require Training on Aspects of the Pretrial Phase across State
Entities and Encourage Cross-Entity Trainings When Possible
Turnover in the judicial system – including turnover driven by the state’s mandatory retirement
age for judges – means that we must have systems in place for constantly ensuring new
practitioners receive training that will help support them in performing their jobs.
A review of the professional background of recently appointed Juvenile Court judges shows that
most have extensive backgrounds in the child welfare system but more limited experience in
delinquency cases. In fact, only half (n=11) of the 22 judges that were appointed to the Juvenile
Court between 2016 and 2023 had experience practicing in the juvenile delinquency system
immediately prior to their nomination.156
This may therefore be a particularly important moment to ensure all Juvenile Court judges have
received training on the best-available research on juvenile delinquency, adolescent brain
development, risk and protective factors, positive youth development, and other factors that
are highly relevant to delinquency-related practice and law. While these trainings are
recommended for delinquency case practices, the fundamental concepts can apply to other
areas of judicial practice including both Care and Protection and Child Requiring Assistance case
practice.
Juvenile justice system stakeholders are often trained on similar topics, but each through their
own agency. To accompany the above-recommended shifts in pretrial processes, the Board
recommends that the Juvenile Court implement a combined judicial system training for judges,
clerks, DAOs, defense counsel, and probation that address the following topics:
• Adolescent development, and how that should inform condition setting for youth, as
highlighted in the research section of this report
156 In order to ascertain the prior experience of judges nominated to the Juvenile Court, the JJPAD reviewed sources from State
House News pertaining to the nomination. These sources contained information such as most recent role and general work
history – but did not provide comprehensive, or complete information on each judge’s professional history. Therefore, the
JJPAD’s assessment of the judge’s prior experience is likely incomplete. A full list of the sources reviewed can be found in
Appendix C.
97
• Setting conditions of release in Juvenile Court in alignment with the guidelines
developed under Recommendation 1. Data related to condition setting and the “pretrial
phase” should also inform training curriculum and discussions.
• Using a Positive Youth Development framework (e.g., involving youth in the process) to
inform condition-setting
By holding joint trainings, the state can ensure clear, consistent communication is provided to all
the relevant practitioners.
Recommendation 8: Increase the Number of Juvenile Court Judges to Reduce the
Pretrial Timeline and Support Reform Implementation
As previously mentioned, one of the challenges with the pretrial process is that it can last a long
time. As Finding 3 explained, cases are extended for a number of reasons, and increases in the
length of time until case resolution can have negative consequences for public safety, the youth
defendant, any alleged victim or witness, and the system generally.
One of the reasons the pretrial phase lasts a long time for some youth is because trials are
regularly scheduled for six or more months out due to judge and courtroom availability. There
are currently five Juvenile Court vacancies, with three more on the horizon due to judges
reaching the mandatory retirement age in the coming months or taking new positions within
the Trial Court. These vacancies have put significant strain on the system, leading to trial delays
and requiring some judges to travel between counties, and even multiple locations in one day,
to provide the necessary coverage. The delays and time pressures could be a contributing factor
in the differences in which the justice system operates county to county or courthouse to
courthouse.157 As mentioned in Finding 3, Juvenile Court judges also hear other non-
delinquency related case matters, which have emergency hearings that can delay proceedings
for other court matters.
Even when all of the vacancies are filled, however, state law caps the number of Juvenile Court
judges at 42 – a number that has only increased once (from 41) since the cap was implemented
in 1906.158 One way the state can address the significant delays in delinquency proceedings
without impacting other cases like child welfare matters is to increase the cap on the number of
Juvenile Court judges. The Board recommends the state increase the cap and the governor’s
office work expeditiously to fill remaining vacancies in the Juvenile Court. This would also
provide an important opportunity to increase diversity on the bench (e.g., race, ethnicity,
gender, LGBTQ+). If increased, the state should also adequately increase and fund other court

98
personnel (e.g., clerks, law clerks, court officers) and facility resources (e.g., courtrooms and
judicial lobbies) to support the increased number of judges.
Reduce Length of Time
If the number of judges increases, the Board recommends the judiciary revisit time
standards.159 While the Juvenile Court currently has time standards for when certain hearings
and trials need to happen, several court stakeholders mentioned these are not consistently
adhered to or are extended for a variety of reasons.160 No data on this is available, however. The
Board recognizes any change to the time standards would have significant consequences to
court practices, state resources, and youth. Therefore, the Board recommends the Juvenile
Court, MPS, CPCS/YAD, MDAA/DAOs, DYS, and OCA convene to address the problem of
extended case lengths and make recommendations for state improvements.161
Recommendation 9: Expand the Availability, and Promote the Use of, Social
Workers in Delinquency Related Cases
While many professionals interact with and may advocate on behalf of youth throughout the
pretrial phase, it is the defense attorney’s job to advocate for their client. The JJPAD Board
heard from a significant number of YAD staff attorneys and bar advocates in stakeholder
interviews. Most defense attorneys argued that their clients would be better served in the
community than in detention or strict restrictive conditions of release. However, many also cited
the long waitlists, dearth of services, and insufficient resources to navigate the service-provider
world themselves as barriers.
While waitlists and service gaps are larger challenges across the human services sector, ensuring
youth have access to effective and well trained “system navigators” can at least somewhat help
improve youth access to services. The Board encourages the continued and expanded use of
social workers by YAD staff and private attorneys (bar advocates). To this end, the Board
recommends the state continue to fund CPCS’s budget to allow social workers who assist
defense counsel in connecting youth clients to appropriate services. These professionals can
support defense attorneys in identifying alternatives to detention or supervision that the court
can consider when making its pretrial determination.
In cases where youth are represented by bar advocates who do not have access to in house

160 Although the COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated the pretrial length of time for cases for a period of time, the Juvenile Court
resumed in person operations in 2021. However, the impact of the pandemic, specifically staff shortages and frequent absences
due to COVID, were ongoing throughout the year. As of 2024, practitioners continued to note concerns with the length of time
to disposition, suggesting this challenge persists for reasons other than the impact of the pandemic on court operations.
161 Other jurisdictions have addressed case length of time through the Juvenile Detention Alternatives Initiative (JDAI).
Massachusetts should explore whether the states’ JDAI has capacity to lead this work here.
99
social workers and who, reportedly, do not universally petition the court for resources to work
with social workers for clients at this stage, the Board encourages them to petition for funds to
hire social workers to support their clients and court case-planning. The Board also encourages
CPCS to continue to provide training and support to bar advocates toward this end. Further, the
Juvenile Court should consider streamlining the petition process (e.g., making the process
administrative rather than an in-person court hearing) for court funds for social workers,
something that is not consistently happening across all courthouses.
Recommendation 10: Increase Data Availability to Support Continuous Quality
Improvement and Data-Informed Policymaking
In recent years, Massachusetts has made significant progress increasing the volume and
complexity of publicly reported data related to the state’s juvenile justice system.162 As a result,
the JJPAD Board is able to report a substantial amount of data across the entire system from the
beginning of the court process through dispositions. Of course, there is still room for
improvement, but this achievement is worth recognition.
As highlighted in the Limitations section of this report, the Board was unable to answer several
research questions with Massachusetts-based data due to data unavailability. Further, the Board
did not have data to inform key themes heard in stakeholder interviews (e.g., How many youth
violate pretrial conditions of release? What conditions are used more frequently?).
As a result, the Board has had to rely on estimated calculations and key stakeholder interviews
while researching this topic. The table below highlights key pretrial research questions and steps
various entities could take to ensure data to answer those questions is available in the future.163
It is the Board’s recommendation that any additional data should be reported annually. As
recommended in the JJPAD Board’s 2022 report on data availability, the state should make sure
there are adequate resources (i.e., additional funding, for staff and reporting infrastructure) to
support state entities in increasing their data reporting.164

https://www.mass.gov/doc/improving-access-to-massachusetts-juvenile-justice-system-data-2022-update/download
163 Entities should also regularly review other states’ data reporting on these topics. At the time of this report other
states were not reporting statewide data yet, but the Board heard of California and Illinois working to improve their
statewide public data reporting on pretrial concepts like flight risk and GPS use, with public data anticipated in the
future.

Conclusion
There have been a significant number of reforms to the Massachusetts’ juvenile justice system
over the past two decades. These reforms have had various intended and unintended impacts
for the pretrial phase of the system specifically. The findings and recommendations in this
report aim to continue to build on the success of these reforms and address challenges that
remain.
The JJPAD Board will monitor implementation of these reforms and continue to research the
topics that emerged during this research that the Board was unable to address in its
recommendations for this project, including:
Use of cash bail: The JJPAD Board will continue to study state alternatives to detention for
vulnerable populations, especially for youth currently held on cash bail.
As documented above, youth detained pretrial as a result of cash bail being set are –
anecdotally—being held for reasons other than flight risk. While the CBI Subcommittee
discussed the possibility of eliminating cash bail, as a result of a growing body of research
documenting its ineffectiveness,165 the Board was not ready to make that recommendation until
the state can safely respond to the needs of the youth currently detained on bail. This includes,
but is not limited to, ensuring there are appropriate DCF placements available for youth.
The JJPAD Board is currently researching the topic of “dually involved youth” (youth involved in
both DYS and DCF) and will be making recommendations for state improvements on this project
in 2025. As part of that work, the group will further investigate why youth involved with DCF
are held on low amounts of cash bail, sometimes as low as $1 and determine what
alternatives to detention exist for this cohort and make recommendations for improvement.
Delinquency prevention and intervention programming: Since the Board’s inception, members
have highlighted a wide array of community-based delinquency prevention and intervention
programs that exist throughout the state. At the same time, members reported the service gaps
(and sometimes service deserts) that exist, and a complex, disparate system that makes it hard
to navigate eligibility, criteria, and effectiveness of these programs for youth in the juvenile
justice system. Furthermore, when quality services do exist, they may not have adequate
funding or resources to serve youth impacted by the state’s juvenile justice system. Board
members have also noted there may be gaps in community-based delinquency prevention and
intervention programs meeting the current level of need for the cohorts of youth that remain in
the state’s juvenile justice system. Members mentioned that individuals arraigned in Juvenile
165 As further discussed in the Research section of this report.
103
Court today have complex needs and face challenges that cannot be addressed by the current
landscape of community-based programs.
This theme was highlighted again in the group’s initial research questions for the pretrial
project. Specifically, the Board asked, “What community-based interventions or supports need
to exist in order to divert more of this population from detention and/or the justice system
entirely?”
Further, as highlighted throughout this report, victim services are not always considered when
thinking about delinquency prevention/intervention services, despite research showing victims
of violences are more likely to go on to commit violent acts and therefore, services that support
victims are some of the best crime prevention strategies.
Therefore, in order to continue to make informed policy recommendations and decisions, the
Board will study the landscape of community-based delinquency-related prevention and
intervention programs in Massachusetts and make recommendations for funding, expansion,
and strategies to fill landscape gaps.
The state’s commitment to implementing these reforms and the Board’s continued study of
these important topics can ensure the Commonwealth’s juvenile justice system policies and
practices are research-informed, equitable, and impactful.

Executive Summary
Massachusetts has made a concerted effort to directly and indirectly decrease the use of
pretrial detention for youth over the past decade-plus by limiting the circumstances in which
youth are detained pretrial, as well as limiting overall youth contact with the juvenile justice
system. This effort has been driven by a growing body of research showing pretrial detention
stays – for any length of time – can be harmful and result in negative outcomes for youth and
public safety.1
At the same time, the effort to keep youth out of pretrial detention has impacted other aspects
of the juvenile justice system, specifically throughout the pretrial phase (post-arraignment and
pre-disposition). However, until this report, those impacts have not been publicly assessed or
reported.
This report is particularly timely in light of the increase in juvenile justice cases in Massachusetts
following the Covid-19 pandemic, even though overall numbers remain lower than pre-
pandemic levels. Between FY21 and FY23, there was a striking 110% increase in the number of
cases assigned pretrial conditions of release, rising from 628 cases with pretrial conditions of
release in FY21 to 1,316 in FY23. Although this increase can partly be attributed to a 70%
increase in arraignments, the data also shows a concerning shift away from releasing youth on
personal recognizance (PR) over the same time period. In FY23, only 62% of youth were initially
released on PR, down from 68% in FY21.
Additionally, there was a 39% increase in pretrial detention admissions, from 553 in FY21 to 768
in FY23. On average, about a third of all detention admissions in this period are due to a bail or
PR revocation. These trends underline the importance of addressing the rising reliance on
detention and pretrial conditions while ensuring youth have the supports they need to be
successful and avoid future delinquency.

The Juvenile Justice Policy and Data (JJPAD) Board, which was created by An Act Relative to
Criminal Justice Reform (2018), was charged by the Legislature with evaluating juvenile justice
system policies and procedures and making recommendations to improve outcomes based on
that analysis.2 In 2023, the Board launched a project to study the pretrial phase in
Massachusetts.
What is the “juvenile pretrial phase” in Massachusetts?
The “juvenile pretrial phase” encompasses juvenile justice processes and proceedings after a
youth is arraigned in Juvenile Court (“post-arraignment”) and before their case is disposed via an
adjudication, a dismissal, or Continued Without a Finding “CWOF” (“pre-disposition”). Events
during this phase can include, but are not limited to:
• Bail hearings
• 58A “Dangerousness” hearings
• Placement on pretrial monitoring or supervision by the Massachusetts Probation Services
• Placement in detention with the Department of Youth Services (“pretrial detention”)
This report largely focuses on delinquency cases. However, many of the themes, findings, and
recommendations can apply to youthful offender cases as well.
Findings
Based on information gathered from over 70 stakeholder interviews, national research, dozens
of JJPAD subcommittee discussions and presentations, an analysis of available data, and a
review of Massachusetts’ and other states’ policies, the Board has found:
1. Pretrial conditions for youth can be developmentally inappropriate or not tailored to their
specific cases. Stakeholders interviewed for this report repeatedly expressed that “kids are
different,” and the current pretrial system is not designed with the unique circumstances
and developmental stage of youth in mind. The time in which youth can be involved in
Juvenile Court – adolescence (i.e., 12-17 years old in MA) – is a distinct period in life, one in
which the brain is still anatomically developing, making some aspects of the pretrial phase
particularly difficult for youth to comply with. Interviewees mentioned that a common
reason youth violate their pretrial conditions is because the conditions were not appropriate
and/or were unachievable for a youth.

task-force
8

This concept was reflected in the national research reviewed for this project as well.
Research suggests conditions of release should be developmentally appropriate, focus on
safety, and relate to the underlying offense.
2. Restrictive conditions, most notably GPS and home confinement, are overused. Many
Massachusetts professionals are concerned that restrictive conditions like GPS monitoring
and home confinement conditions are overused in the state’s juvenile justice system as an
unintended consequence and result of the state’s effort to limit the use of detention. While
the Board does not have data to measure this perceived shift, many stakeholders could
point to instances in which GPS was overused or used in inappropriate circumstances. Those
interviewed generally agreed that being released on GPS was the “lesser of two evils” when
compared to being detained. At the same time, many felt as though the harm caused by
being placed on a GPS unit was not well understood across all Massachusetts juvenile court
stakeholders, and some professionals are skeptical that the adoption of GPS was effective at
limiting detention admissions.
National research generally shows that GPS and other forms of electronic monitoring (EM)
as a condition of release are developmentally inappropriate and not necessarily effective at
promoting public safety or improving failure to appear rates.
3. The pretrial process lasts too long, causing harm to youth. While the Juvenile Court time
standards clearly state delinquency proceedings are to be disposed within six to eight
months, in practice, the pretrial phase can extend much longer. In fact, in the Board’s
interviews, it was not uncommon for professionals to cite examples of a youth’s case taking
years to reach disposition. There are many ways in which the pretrial phase can be
extended, some of which can “pause” the clock for time standards, some of which are due
to systemic challenges, and others which are a result of ensuring individuals’ rights are
upheld. Research suggests that a lengthy pretrial phase can be harmful for all parties,
including the youth, any alleged victims or witnesses, and the system itself.
4. There are vastly different regional practices at this stage, leading to concerns about equity.
The juvenile pretrial phase operates differently across Massachusetts’ counties. While in
some cases this may be a reasonable response to variations in local circumstances, it can
also raise concerns about equity: the zip code a youth is arrested in can significantly impact
how their case proceeds, with similarly situated youth receiving different treatment based
on the county or even court in which their case is handled. (Evidence of other kinds of
disparities, such as racial disparities, are further discussed in Finding 5).
9

Examples of county-by-county differences include:
• Whether youth are released on personal recognizance/assigned to be monitored
by the MPS Pretrial Unit or supervised at the local probation level.3 In FY23,
estimates ranged from 59% (n=126) of youth arraigned being released on personal
recognizance/monitored in Plymouth County (41% supervised by probation) to 92%
(n=265) of all youth being released on personal recognizance/cases monitored in
Barnstable County (and 8% supervised by probation).
• Whether youth are placed on GPS: Although the Board does not currently have data
on all conditions set, point-in-time data from August 2023 suggests that Suffolk
County uses GPS at a higher rate than other counties compared to the proportion of
state arraignments coming from Suffolk.
• Use of cash bail: Compared to the rest of the state, youth who are detained in
Hampden, Norfolk, and Suffolk Counties are more likely to be detained due to
inability to make bail than because they were held without the possibility of bail
than in other counties.
• Whether youth are placed on pretrial probation as a disposition: Pretrial probation
as a disposition is used much more frequently in Bristol, Middlesex, and Norfolk
counties than the rest of the state. Of the pretrial probation as a disposition cases
supervised at the local level, 68% (n=105) are supervised in those three counties
(which represent just 28% of arraignments in the state).
• Use of 58A Hearings: Essex County has the highest number of 58A Hearings when
compared to other counties, representing 25% (n=85) of the state total, despite
making up only 15% (n=376) of the state’s felony arraignments. Further, it appears
these dangerousness hearings result in detention less frequently than the state total;
while Essex conducts more 58A Hearings than any other county, youth held without
bail due to being found dangerous account for only 25% of Essex’s detention
admissions where youth are held without bail.
5. The pretrial statutory framework is unclear and does not account for all relevant
circumstances. The Board heard significant concerns from many professionals interviewed
for this report about when and how cash bail and other conditions of release are set in
certain cases. In some cases, this may be the result of an unclear statutory framework,
further complicated by case law, that does not account for all relevant circumstances.
3 Due to the way data are reported, county level estimates of youth released on personal recognizance include youth monitored
on conditions supervised by the statewide Pretrial Unit.
10

As discussed further in this report, MGL Ch. 276 Section 58 and 58A state that the intention
of setting cash bail during this phase of the system is to make sure youth appear in court
and, in the case of 58A, ensure the safety of a victim or another individual. However, in
making that determination, the state can legally weigh a number of factors that – research
indicates— do not relate to a youth’s “flight risk” and seem unlikely to be related to victim
safety. Based on interviews with stakeholders and analysis of the data, the Board has
concluded that cash bail is being used at times due to reasons other than flight risk – albeit
reasons that in many cases are related to protecting a child’s safety or other system
constraints. Examples include:
• Holding youth with DCF involvement, specifically due to lack of other placement
options.
• Holding youth being, or perceived as being, commercially sexually exploited (CSEC).
• Holding youth whose parents refuse to take them home.
6. There are disparities in who is detained pretrial, who gets placed on pretrial
monitoring/supervision, and who is released on personal recognizance. The Board has
documented the persistent racial and ethnic disparities in the Commonwealth’s juvenile
justice system each year since its inception. The pretrial phase is no exception. In fact, in
FY23, Black and Latino youth remained overrepresented at each pretrial process point in the
juvenile justice system.4 Further, the Board heard concerns from court stakeholders that
certain groups of youth, namely girls and youth with DCF involvement, were more likely to
be detained pretrial for reasons other than concerns regarding failure to appear or
community safety. This is reflected in the data.
• In FY23, compared to white youth detained at the initial arraignment,
Hispanic/Latino youth were 1.32 times more likely to be detained pretrial and 1.47
times more likely to be detained as a result of bail being set.
• In FY23, compared to white youth detained at the initial arraignment, Black/African
American youth were 1.07 times more likely to be detained pretrial and 1.37 times
more likely to be detained as a result of bail being set. Of youth who were detained
as a result of bail being set, Black/African American youth had higher bail amounts
set.
• While girls made up 14% (n=106) of all detention admissions in FY23, they made up
21% (n=44) of detention admissions as a result of bail being set and are held for
lower amounts compared to boys. As further discussed in this report, many
4 Massachusetts Juvenile Justice Data and Policy Board (JJPAD). (2024). 2023 JJPAD Annual Report.
https://www.mass.gov/doc/jjpad-2023-annual-report/download
11

professionals believed that girls were being detained with bail set for reasons other
than flight risk.
• In FY23, 6% (n=47) of pretrial detention admissions were for youth who identified as
LGBTQ+. LGBTQ+ youth were held on cash bail more frequently, and held for lower
amounts when compared to youth who did not identify as LGBTQ+.
• Youth with DCF involvement represent more than half (51%, n=395) of all pretrial
detention admissions.5,6 Youth with DCF involvement are detained with bail set more
frequently and held for lower amounts compared to youth with no DCF involvement.
7. There are cohorts of youth who could be diverted away from pretrial detention, pretrial
supervision/monitoring, or the system entirely. The Board found that youth could be
diverted more frequently:
• Pre-arraignment: Many professionals interviewed for this report felt there are still
too many youth at arraignment with lower-level underlying offenses who could
benefit from diversion away from the system entirely, rather than keeping them
involved in the formal juvenile court process. This is reflected in the data: in FY23, a
third (36%, n=1,458) of FY23 arraignments were for misdemeanors.
• From pretrial supervision/monitoring: In recent years the percent of cases in which
youth are released on their personal recognizance has decreased, directly correlating
with the increase in the percent of cases monitored/supervised by probation.
Professionals interviewed suggested more youth could be released without any
conditions. Some professionals highlighted cases for youth who had “Category A”
conditions of release set (n=770, representing 59% of pretrial cases with conditions
of release set) and are assigned to be monitored by the statewide Pretrial Unit as
those that could more frequently be released on their own recognizance instead.
• From pretrial detention: Professionals interviewed highlighted that there are youth
who could be diverted from detention who need intermediate options and more
active case management than the current pretrial probation supervision/monitoring
structure provides. Specifically, professionals mentioned youth who are detained for
a misdemeanor/lower “grid” level offense (n=353, 46% of detention admissions) as
good candidates for diversion from detention if the right community supports and
options are in place for youth and families.

Recommendations
Increases in the use of pretrial conditions of release, including more restrictive conditions like
GPS and home confinement, are at least partially a result of a shift away from the use of pretrial
detention for youth in Massachusetts over the past decade-plus. Yet an increasingly large body
of research, Massachusetts data, and practitioner experience suggest that just as more critical
examination of detention began over a decade ago, a similar examination is now needed
regarding how and when pretrial conditions of release are used. To help spur this change in
practice and culture, the Board offers the following recommendations to continue the progress
made over the past decade-plus and ensure that our pretrial system promotes equity and
positive outcomes for youth, protects alleged victims and witnesses, and supports the
professionals doing this work each day.
In order to achieve these goals, the JJPAD Board recommends Massachusetts:
Improve how conditions of release are set and re-visited throughout the pretrial process. This
includes:
1. Providing more guidance on setting pretrial conditions of release for youth
2. Developing a new “order of pretrial conditions of release” form
3. Providing guidance on the process for revising pretrial conditions of release for youth
and addressing violations
Divert more youth from detention and juvenile court involvement by expanding the range of
pretrial supervision and pre-arraignment diversion options. This includes:
4. Creating a continuum of interventions for supervision in the community during the
pretrial period
5. Improving GPS technology
6. Diverting more youth pre-arraignment by expanding opportunities for state diversion
Support implementation of pretrial reforms and continue to measure the impact. This
includes:
7. Requiring training on aspects of the pretrial phase across state entities and encouraging
cross-entity trainings when possible
8. Increasing the number of juvenile court judges to reduce the pretrial timeline and
support reform implementation
9. Expanding the availability, and promoting the use of, social workers in delinquency
related cases
10. Increasing data availability to support continuous quality improvement and data-
informed policymaking

Introduction
The Juvenile Justice Policy and Data (JJPAD) Board, which was created by An Act Relative to
Criminal Justice Reform (2018), was charged by the Legislature with evaluating juvenile justice
system policies and procedures and making recommendations to improve outcomes based on
that analysis. In particular, the JJPAD Board is charged with assessing “the system of community-
based services for children and juveniles who are under the supervision, care or custody of the
department of youth services or the juvenile court.”7
Massachusetts has made a concerted effort to directly and indirectly decrease the use of
detention for youth over the past decade-plus by limiting the circumstances in which youth are
detained pretrial, as well as limiting overall youth contact with the juvenile justice system. (See
the text box “State Efforts to Limit Detention,” below). This effort has been driven by a growing
body of research showing pretrial detention stays – for any length of time – can be harmful and
result in negative outcomes for youth and public safety.8
At the same time, the effort to keep youth out of pretrial detention has impacted other aspects
of the juvenile justice system, specifically throughout the pretrial phase (post-arraignment and
pre-disposition). However, until this report, those impacts have not been publicly assessed or
reported.
Further, in recent years juvenile detention admissions and use of the pretrial system overall
have increased. Between FY22 and FY23:
• Arraignments increased by 34% and have exceeded pre-pandemic numbers. (In FY19,
there were 3,322 arraignments compared to 4,025 in FY23). On average, over the past
five fiscal years, more than half (55%) of all arraignments do not reach a disposition.9
• Youth placed on pretrial monitoring/supervision increased by 68%.10
• Pretrial detention admissions increased by 14%. Pretrial detention admissions are still
down, however, compared to pre-pandemic numbers: in FY19 there were 893 detention

prior to that point. Cases may be dismissed for several reasons, including lack of probable cause or lack of sufficient evidence at
any point pre- or during a trial. Cases may be diverted either formally or informally.

admissions, compared to 768 in FY23. On average over the past five years, about half of
all admissions (45%) were for “lower-grid level”11 offenses.
Based on these considerations, the JJPAD Board launched a project in 2023 to study the pretrial
phase in Massachusetts with the goal of making recommendations to:
1. Improve this part of the system to support better outcomes for youth and public safety.
2. Identify cohorts of youth that may benefit from diversion from detention and/or pretrial
supervision.
3. Improve pretrial community-based supports for youth.
This report includes the following:
• A description of the pretrial phase, a review of the research on best practices during this
phase, and an analysis of the available data
• Findings on the pretrial phase based on the Board’s qualitative and quantitative research
and policy analysis
• Recommendations to the state for improvement
11 DYS measures offense severity by a numerical (1-7) “grid level.” Grid levels 1 and 2 are categorized as low, grid level 3 is
considered “medium” severity and grid levels 4 through 7 is considered “high” severity. Most “lower-grid level” offenses are
misdemeanor offenses.
15

State Efforts to Limit Detention
Efforts to keep youth out of pretrial detention have largely been successful. Between FY15 to FY24,
pretrial detention admissions were cut by more than half from 2,101 pretrial detention admissions
in FY15 to 899 admissions in FY24.
State efforts include:
• Annie E. Casey’s Juvenile Detention Alternatives Initiative (JDAI), based at DYS. Since 2006,
the MA JDAI team has led state and local conversations on the dangers of detention and
coordinated a variety of state and local efforts to divert youth from detention. JDAI
operates at the court county level in six counties and convenes several statewide
committees.
• A concerted effort by professionals to keep youth out of detention in light of the COVID-19
pandemic that highlighted the negative physical and mental consequences of congregate
care facilities. However, many youth who remained in detention during this time were held
for longer periods of time awaiting court as a result of the pandemic.
• Provisions in the 2018 Criminal Justice Reform Act that aimed to limit the number of youth
coming into contact with the juvenile justice system, and therefore, the number of youth
detained pretrial. This included giving judges the statutory authority to divert youth pre-
arraignment for some offenses.
• The creation and funding of the Massachusetts Youth Diversion Program (MYDP). The
MYDP is a state-funded diversion program administered by the Department of Youth
Services (DYS) and operated by community-based organizations.
• The establishment of an administrative review process by Massachusetts Probation
Services (MPS), along with a rewards/graduated sanction protocol to support
reinforcement of positive behavior and intervene effectively with negative behaviors short
of a formal probation violation – understanding that each time a youth is given a Notice of
Probation Violation, they are brought back into court and risk detention.
• An increased effort to build community-based systems that are focused on supporting
youth prior to Juvenile Court involvement, such as the Executive Office of Public Safety and
Security (EOPSS) Shannon Gang Prevention grants, the Executive Office of Health and
Human Services (EOHHS) Safe and Successful Youth Initiative, and the Department of Public
Health Violence Prevention grants to name just a few.

Key Terminology
Arraignment: The formal reading of charges against the youth in court, and the point at which youth
officially have a Juvenile Court entry record.
Cash bail: A cash amount that must be posted to secure a youth’s release from DYS pretrial detention
between arraignment and disposition. Bail is determined and the amount is set at a bail hearing, if a
judge determines the youth is at risk of failing to appear at future court proceedings.
Disposition: The outcome of a case and the end of the “pretrial phase.”
Failure to appear: Missing a court appearance.
Notice of Violation: If a youth violates one of their imposed conditions of release, Massachusetts
Probation Services (MPS) will send a notice detailing the alleged violation to the District Attorney’s
Office (DAO).
Pretrial conditions of release: Terms youth must comply with, which are set by a judge. Depending
on the court's order, probation either monitors the pretrial conditions or actively supervises the
individual to ensure compliance with the conditions of release while they remain in the community as
their case is pending.
Pretrial detention: Detention occurs when a judge has placed a youth in the care of the Department
of Youth Services (DYS) before their trial. This occurs after a youth has been arrested and arraigned.
Detention stays can last from a couple of hours to weeks or months depending on a variety of factors.
Pretrial probation as a disposition: Youth can be placed on pretrial probation as a “disposition” post-
arraignment by a judge. If the youth complies with all the conditions set by a judge, the matter will
ultimately be dismissed by the prosecution. If youth fail to comply, the prosecution of the matter may
resume (at the discretion of the district attorney).
58A “Dangerousness” Hearing: Allows the prosecution to request at arraignment that a youth be
detained without bail if the DA believes the youth is a threat to public safety. If a judge finds a youth
to be dangerous and that there are no conditions that would assure a youth and community’s safety,
the youth is held in detention prior to their trial.
Methodology
The following questions guided the Board’s research:
1. How can we improve pretrial success rates (i.e., compliance with conditions) and reduce
the need for detention?
2. What practices can help us improve long-term outcomes for youth and protect public
safety?
17

3. What do victims want during this phase?
4. Can any of the youth who are being placed on pretrial probation and/or detained be
diverted and served through community-based services?
5. What community-based interventions or supports need to exist in order to divert more
of this population from detention and/or the justice system entirely?
To answer these questions the Board employed a mixed methods research approach. OCA staff
led the research, the JJPAD Board Community-Based Interventions (CBI) Subcommittee
discussed findings from the qualitative methods, and the Data Subcommittee discussed findings
from the quantitative methods. Collectively, the Board spent about two years reviewing and
analyzing the pretrial phase.
73 interviews with stakeholders across sectors: OCA staff conducted interviews with
professionals, stakeholders, and people with experience in the juvenile justice system to learn
about experiences and practices within these systems. The goal of these interviews was to
identify common gaps, challenges, and areas of strength; gain insight on stakeholder ideas for
further system improvement; and assess potential shifts in policy and practice that could
potentially improve the pretrial phase. The OCA made significant efforts to invite a wide variety
of stakeholders to participate in the interview process, including direct outreach to specific
individuals and organizations representing stakeholder groups as well as regular “open”
invitations through the JJPAD Board’s monthly newsletter.

Informational Interviews by Stakeholder Group (n=73)

Analysis of the available data: The Data Subcommittee analyzed available aggregate data
reported by the Trial Courts, DYS, and MPS. The analysis informed the data section of this report
as well as the findings and recommendations.
Subcommittee presentations: The CBI Subcommittee dedicated all or part of their meetings in
calendar year 2023 and 2024 to learn about the pretrial phase, guide the OCA’s research, and
analyze the findings. Meetings included presentations from the OCA staff on research (see
below), as well as representatives of JJPAD Board member organizations:
• The Committee for Public Council Services (CPCS), who presented on each court process
point in the juvenile pretrial phase, including an overview of practice considerations,
and relevant statutes and case law.12
• MPS, who presented on the juvenile pretrial supervision process and practice.13
• DYS, who presented on the juvenile pretrial detention process and detention services.14
National Research: To inform the findings of this report, OCA staff conducted a review of the
national research to better understand what evidence-based best practices exist at the pretrial
phase. Areas of focus included conditions of release, the use of monetary bail, youth failure to
appear rates, and the impacts and efficacy of GPS monitoring for juveniles.15 This review also
included an overview of pretrial policy changes in other jurisdictions.
Review of Massachusetts Policy: OCA staff reviewed relevant statutes, case law, and any agency
standards/guidance that pertained to the pretrial phase. A full list of what was reviewed can be
found in the appendix.
Taken together, the five methods provided the Board with a holistic approach to studying the
pretrial phase.
Limitations
There are strengths and limitations to each of the above methods. For example, academic
research specific to the juvenile pretrial phase is limited. Therefore, research from the adult
system and research conducted on the juvenile system post-adjudication was included to
supplement the Board’s understanding.

Further, the data presented in this report is reported to the OCA at the aggregate level, limiting
the Board’s ability to do causal analysis or analysis at the individual level (e.g., understanding
the intersection of measures like race and gender of youth held on low bail amount).
Additionally, there are some data elements that are captured by two different agencies, but the
totals do not always match and/or there are other discrepancies, likely due to differences in
how different agencies report and collect the data.
MPS first began reporting data to the JJPAD Board on new “case starts” for youth released on
pretrial conditions of release in FY21, which was during the COVID-19 pandemic. In FY21, the
JJPAD Board found that there was a decrease in the utilization of the juvenile justice system
during the pandemic as a result of shifts in “circumstantial” factors (e.g., limited contact with
peers) that are tied to decreased likelihood of delinquent behavior as well as a concerted effort
by juvenile justice system stakeholders to divert youth away from the juvenile court at this
time.16 Therefore, it is likely that the increase in utilization between FY21 and FY23, described
later in this report, was greater than would have been observed if the analysis included data
from pre-pandemic years. Additionally, it is likely that the pandemic caused delays in pretrial
proceedings, resulting in an increase in the length of time a youth’s case spent in the pretrial
phase. To address these concerns, pre-pandemic data was included in the analysis when
available.
Finally, while much of what was learned in stakeholder interviews was echoed in the
quantitative data, some quantitative data is unavailable to validate key themes heard across
stakeholders. As a result, that information is anecdotal and cannot be objectively measured
(e.g., the number and types of conditions of release). Additionally, the number of interviews
within each stakeholder group varied. The OCA did extensive outreach and issued numerous
invitations to relevant organizations to participate in the interview process. Some organizations
connected the OCA to numerous people within the organization to provide a range of
viewpoints within the agencies, while others declined participation or only allowed for one or
two individuals to participate.
The findings in this report are informed by a mixed-methods research approach to ameliorate
the limitations of any one method.

The Pretrial Phase in Context of the Greater Juvenile Justice System
21

Massachusetts’ Juvenile Pretrial Phase
This section reviews the pretrial phase and:
• Defines the pretrial phase in context of the greater juvenile justice system
• Presents the available state data.
The Pretrial Phase Process
The pretrial phase begins after a youth has been arraigned and officially “charged” with a
delinquent offense by a prosecutor.17 Once a youth has been arraigned, the incident will appear
on a youth’s court record.
Presumptive Innocence
After a youth is arraigned, there are several ways a

date.19 At this hearing, the judge makes a
determination as to whether the youth is unlikely to appear for future court hearings (referred
to as “risk of failure to appear” or “a flight risk”) and may set monetary bail as a condition of
release, and/or set other pretrial conditions of release.20,21 If youth do not comply with the
conditions of release, they may be subject to a violation hearing and detained as a result.
17 Per the Juvenile Court’s Standing Order 2-18: Time Standards, arraignments should be held within 15 days from the issuance
of the complaint, unless the juvenile has been referred to diversion. For more information see: Massachusetts Court System.
(2018). Juvenile Court Standing Order 2-18: Time standards. https://www.mass.gov/juvenile-court-rules/juvenile-court-
standing-order-2-18-time-standards
18 A bail warning at arraignment informs youth that if they are charged with a new offense while their case is pending their bail
may be revoked, and as a result, the youth will be detained.
19 Bail hearings may also be held during the pendency of the pretrial phase if new information becomes available that may
warrant a change in bail status. For example, if a youth is found to have violated one of their conditions of release, a bail hearing
may be held to revoke the youth’s bail, and they may be ordered to be detained pretrial as a result.
20 M.G.L Ch.276 Section 58; a complete list of statutes and case law relevant to the pretrial phase can be found in Appendix A.
21 M.G.L. Ch. 276 Section 87; a complete list of statutes and case law relevant to the pretrial phase can be found in Appendix A.
22

Judges must consider the youth’s financial resources if they set bail.22 Additionally, the judge
can set stipulations of a youth’s release if they are able to post bail. For example, for youth in
the custody of the Department of Children and Families (DCF), the judge can set the stipulation
that they only be released to the Department’s custody. If the youth is unable to post the
monetary bail and/or meet other pretrial release conditions, they are detained before their trial
(called “pretrial detention”).
If a judge sets any pretrial conditions of release, the youth is placed on pretrial monitoring
and/or supervision, which is overseen by the Massachusetts Probation Services (MPS).
Setting Conditions of Release in Juvenile Court
In Juvenile Court, judges primarily set conditions pursuant to:
• M.G.L Ch.276 Section 58, which allows judges to set conditions to ensure the
defendant’s appearance in court or that specify restrictions on personal
associations or conduct (e.g., stay away orders from a named victim or witness). It
also allows judges to set cash bail as a condition of release if there is concern that
the youth will fail to appear to future court dates. Setting conditions under Section
58 does not require the youth’s consent.
• M.G.L. Ch 276 Section 58A, which allows judges to set conditions to ensure the
safety of any other individual or the community. Setting conditions under Section
58A does not require the youth’s consent.
• M.G.L. Ch. 276 Section 87, which allows judges to set broader conditions
compared to those set under Section 58, such as “cooperate in a mental health or
substance use disorder evaluation and treatment.” Setting conditions under
Section 87 require the youth’s consent.
As discussed in Finding 4, interviews suggest that judges are not consistently tying the
setting of specific conditions to the specific statute, and in practice, statutes are frequently
used interchangeably. The JJPAD Board does not have data to address this point.
22 M.G.L Ch.276 Section 58 ; Commonwealth vs. Brangan (2017) ; a complete list of statutes and case law relevant to the pretrial
phase can be found in Appendix A.
23

The specific conditions of release ordered by a judge determine if a youth’s case is either
monitored or supervised by MPS Pretrial:23
• Cases that are monitored by MPS are pretrial cases that are not actively supervised by a
probation officer at the local level. Rather, they are monitored by the statewide Pretrial
Unit. Youth with pretrial cases monitored by MPS have conditions set under a category
called “Category A.” Examples of Category A conditions include:
Obey all laws and court orders
o
Obey any no contact or stay away orders
o
Refrain from illegal drugs, recreational marijuana, and/or alcohol
o
• Cases that are supervised by MPS are pretrial cases that are actively supervised by a
probation officer at the local level. Youth with pretrial cases supervised by MPS have
conditions set under a category called “Category B.” Examples of Category B conditions
include:
Drug testing
o
Cooperate with mental health and/or substance use treatment
o
GPS monitoring
o
Home confinement
o
MPS Pretrial Services Unit
Established in 2019 as a result of the state’s Criminal Justice Reform Act, MPS’ Pretrial
Services Division is a system of collaborative partnerships that includes the court,
criminal justice agencies, and community service providers that enables a set of
policies, guidelines, and practices aimed to improve pretrial services statewide while
minimizing unnecessary pretrial detention. Along with monitoring cases with
conditions of release and pretrial probation as a disposition cases, the Pretrial Services
Division has also implemented other pretrial services, including issuing new pretrial
supervision and standards and the eReminder Program, an automated text message
system that provides reminders of upcoming court dates.

24

Youth are assigned a probation officer, who is then charged with supervising the youth’s
compliance with their conditions of release. Probation officers will notify the prosecutor
if a youth violates a condition.
A judge determines a youth is a danger to the community and must be detained pretrial or
sets conditions of release.24
Youth charged with certain offenses can be detained without the opportunity of bail if the
prosecution moves for an order of pretrial detention based on dangerousness.25 Youth can be
detained while awaiting a 58A Hearing for up to 7 days.26 Following a hearing, called a “58A
Hearing” or “dangerousness hearing,” a judge will determine what, if any, conditions of release
will reasonably assure the safety of any other person or the community. If a judge determines
that no conditions of release will reasonably assure the safety of any other person or the
community, the youth is held for up to 120 days in detention prior to their trial.27
A judge may also place a youth on “pretrial probation as a disposition” post-arraignment.
If a youth placed on pretrial probation as disposition is successful in complying with the
conditions of probation set, the matter will ultimately be dismissed by the prosecution. This is
one way of resolving the case without having to proceed to plea or trial. However, if the youth
fails to comply, the prosecution of the matter may resume (at the discretion of the district
attorney). The ordering of pretrial probation as a disposition requires the consent of the
prosecutor.28
Violations of pretrial conditions
Regardless of the case type or supervision level or if a youth is released on their own PR, if a
youth violates any of their conditions of release or commits a new alleged offense, the county
MPS office notifies the prosecutor. The prosecutor has discretion as to whether they bring the
case back into court to revoke bail or personal recognizance. The prosecution does not have
discretion to unilaterally modify conditions at this point. If a case is revoked, a judge determines
24 Per the 58A Statute, a dangerousness hearing shall be held immediately upon the person’s first appearance before the court,
unless either attorney requests a continuance. A continuance may not exceed 7 days, during which the youth will be held in
pretrial detention at DYS. For more information, see M.G.L Ch.276 Section 58A
25 M.G.L Ch.276 Section 58A; a complete list of statutes and case law relevant to the pretrial phase can be found in Appendix A.
26 MGL Ch. 276 Section 58A states, “The hearing shall be held immediately upon the person's first appearance before the court
unless that person, or the attorney for the commonwealth, seeks a continuance. Except for good cause, a continuance on
motion of the person may not exceed seven days, and a continuance on motion of the attorney for the commonwealth may not
exceed three business days. During a continuance, the individual shall be detained upon a showing that there existed probable
cause to arrest the person.”
27 After 120 days, the law states that youth should be released from detention. However, there are a variety of legal reasons
youth may be (and, indeed, are) held beyond 120 days. See Finding 3, for more information on the length of time this phase
takes.
28 A Juvenile Court judge may place a youth on pretrial probation based on the statutory authorization of MGL Ch. 276,
Section87. MGL Ch. 276, Section 87 also establishes statutory authorization for pretrial conditions of release, which are distinct
from pretrial probation. The SJC reiterates this distinction in Commonwealth v. Jake J., a juvenile, and Commonwealth v. Tim T., a
juvenile.
25

whether they should detain the youth or modify conditions of release.29 During this hearing,
defense counsel and prosecution can present recommendations for modified conditions to the
court or the prosecution can ask to detain the youth.30
The pretrial phase officially ends if a youth’s case is dismissed or once the case is resolved. Cases
can be resolved through a plea, trial, or a plea resulting in a “continuance without a finding
(CWOF).”
How long does the pretrial phase last?
The Juvenile Court adopted time standards for all court proceedings in October 2018, and
include the following lengths of time for delinquency and youthful offender cases:
• Filing of complaint or indictment to adjudication/disposition (bench trial): Six months
(180 days)^
• Filing of complaint or indictment to adjudication/disposition (jury trial): Eight months
(240 days)
Benchmarks* include:
• Arraignment: within 15 days from the issuance of the complaint, unless the juvenile
has been referred to diversion.
• Pretrial Conference: within 30 days from the arraignment.
^Indictment of a juvenile as a Youthful Offender proceeds only at the option of the District Attorney; there are no
time requirements for the exercise of that option.
*Benchmarks are not part of the time standards but are provided to offer guidance in achieving compliance with
the standards.

29 Per MGL. Ch. 276 Section. 58B, “a person who has been released after a hearing pursuant to sections 42A, 58, 58A or 87 and
who has violated a condition of his release, shall be subject to a revocation of release and an order of detention.”
30 If the condition violated was set under M.G.L Ch.276 Section 58, prosecutors have the discretion to either motion to revoke
youth’s bail, or not. If the condition of release violated was set under M.G.L. Ch. 276 Section 87, prosecutors have the discretion
to modify the conditions, if the youth and their defense attorney agree. If the youth and their defense attorney do not agree to
modify conditions set under Section 87, then prosecutors have the discretion to either motion to revoke youth’s bail, or not.

Victim Experience
It’s important to note that one goal of the pretrial process is to make sure any potential alleged
victim(s) are safe while a youth’s case is pending. This could be one reason why a judge decides to
detain or set conditions of release rather than releasing a youth on personal recognizance.
Throughout the Board’s research, victim advocates expressed that victims want an individualized
approach at each phase of the system. At the pretrial phase, some alleged victims want a youth to
be detained, others want youth to be diverted completely, and others want something in
between.
Advocates also stated that many alleged victims – at this stage—weren’t consulted or actively
listened to regarding conditions that would make them feel safe.
The Board heard from victim advocates that alleged victims typically want accountability and for
their safety to be considered during the pretrial phase. This sentiment aligns with national
research on victim expectations and experiences:
• Victims want the process to be centered on their voices being heard, accountability,
and safety
• Alternative responses like restorative justice practices can be developmentally
appropriate and support victims
• Many victims do not report crime and/or do not engage at this phase and therefore,
interventions that take place outside of the court system may serve a wider array of
impacted people.
Finally, it is important to note research indicates a strong connection between experiences of
victimization and the likelihood of perpetrating violence. This cyclical connection between victim
and perpetrator of violence makes it particularly challenging and critical to stopping violence.

Research on Best Practices During the Pretrial Phase
The JJPAD Board reviewed peer reviewed research, government reports from other
jurisdictions, as well as policy papers published by national organizations related to the
following aspects of the pretrial phase:
• Diversion
• Setting Conditions of Release
• Using GPS
• Using Cash Bail
• Pretrial Detention
Additionally, the Board reviewed key findings from research on adolescent brain development
to consider at each phase. Research on adolescent psychology demonstrates that young people
have difficulty appropriately weighing the consequences of their immediate actions with their
long-term goals. Indeed, “neurobiological research suggests that the parts of the brain that
govern impulse control, planning ahead, weighing risks and rewards, and coordinating emotion
and cognition continue to mature throughout adolescence.”31 Youth likely experience the
pretrial phase differently than adults in the adult criminal justice system.
The following subsections summarize the JJPAD’s review of the research, by topic.
When Possible, Youth Should be Diverted
As discussed in Finding 7, the Board’s interview findings and data analysis suggests there is
room for improvement in diverting youth away from the juvenile justice system across multiple
“off ramps” (i.e., pre-arraignment and pretrial). Research suggests diversion can be an effective
tool to increase public safety and improve youth outcomes compared to the traditional juvenile
justice system.
• Diversion improves public safety: One meta-analysis of 45 studies showed that
diversion was more effective in reducing recidivism than traditional court processing.
Another meta-analysis of 19 studies specific to police-based diversion showed that
youth were less likely to reoffend when they received diversion.32
• Diversion helps reduce justice system contact and reduces the risk of future justice
system involvement: Relative to diverted youth, a 2020 study showed that youth who

were formally processed were more likely to be re-arrested, more likely to be
incarcerated, engaged in more violence, reported a greater affiliation with delinquent
peers, reported lower school enrollment, were less likely to graduate high school within
5 years, reported less ability to suppress aggression, and had lower perceptions of
opportunities as compared to similarly-situated youth who were diverted.33
Conditions of Release Should be Developmentally Appropriate and Focus on Assuring Safety
As discussed in Findings 1 and 2, the Board’s interview findings and data analysis suggests there
is an overreliance on conditions of release for youth. Research suggests conditions of release
should be developmentally appropriate, focus on safety, and relate to the underlying offense.
Conditions should be developmentally appropriate. If the conditions being set are not
developmentally appropriate, this creates an extremely difficult bar for youth to meet. Some
conditions of release remove youth from prosocial activities, impacting the youth’s well-being.
This runs contrary to a body of research which shows that these positive connections and
participation in prosocial activities are vital to youth’s mental health and wellbeing.34 This loss
of prosocial activities is not only detrimental to a youth’s physical and emotional well-being, but
it also increases their risk of further delinquency.35 Factors that negatively impact youth’s
mental and physical health include:
• Social isolation, disintegration of support networks, and restrictions on practicing
developmentally appropriate skills (e.g., spending time with their peers)
• Isolation and abrupt separation from friends and family members
• Loss and/or disruption of their daily routines, leading to dysregulation
• Lack of freedom of movement and access to recreational facilities
The impact of loneliness and isolation on youth’s mental health has been extensively
demonstrated in over sixty studies, particularly its long-term association with anxiety and
depression.36

Conditions of release should be focused on ensuring safety and related to the underlying
offense. Research on probation condition setting post-adjudication shows that youth have a
hard time remembering all of the conditions set, and that setting numerous conditions
increases a youth’s chance of violating.37 In fact, one study in Washington State found that
youth only recalled approximately one-third of conditions imposed on them.38
Further, research shows the “one-size fits all” approach to condition setting is not an efficient
use of staff time or resources. As one study states, “This is because surveillance alone has little
to no impact on reoffending; adolescents are unable, developmentally, to make progress on
multiple goals; and standardized approaches don’t address the varying factors that contribute
to youth’s delinquent behavior.”39 Conditions that are overly broad, such as “obey all school
rules” are difficult for youth to comply with and increase their chances of violating.40 Research
on youth placed on supervision post-adjudication suggests that conditions that target specific
risk factors and are related to the offense the youth was adjudicated delinquent of result in
better outcomes for youth.41
Cash Bail Should Only be Used to Assure Court Appearance – and Most Youth Will Appear
Without any Need for Cash Bail
As discussed in Finding 5 of this report, the Massachusetts General Laws dictate that cash bail
be set only for the purposes of ensuring youth appear to court, or – in certain cases (e.g.,
allegations of domestic violence) – to ensure the safety of the alleged victim or witness, any
other individual, or the community. However, research suggests that cash bail is not effective at
improving failure to appear rates or public safety, and disproportionately impacts poor people.

Cash Bail and Failure to Appear
Research shows that most individuals show up to their court hearings, and the risk of failing to
appear is low across-the-board (i.e., whether cash bail is used or not). For example, one study
conducted involving over 3,900 adults in Virginia found that those who were released on
personal recognizance appeared at a very high rate of 96%.42
Cash bail has a limited effect on failure to appear (FTA) rates. A review of the current research
on FTA rates in jurisdictions (e.g., Kentucky, Philadelphia) before and after they passed reforms
that limited the use of cash bail found that limiting the use of monetary release conditions did
not result in substantial change in the rate at which defendants fail to appear in court.43
Failure to appear is a system-wide issue rather than solely an issue related to an individual
defendant. When people do not appear, it is often due to factors outside of their control (e.g.,
transportation issues, work or school obligations) rather than an intention to evade the justice
system.44 One study done in Philadelphia found that failure to appear was an issue across court
stakeholders rather than just with defendants. The study found that:
• An essential witness or lawyer failed to appear for at least one hearing in 53% of all
cases, compared to a 19% FTA rate for defendants.
• The defense attorney (both public & private) failed to appear for at least one hearing in
36% of cases.
• Police officers fail to appear on a subpoena almost twice as often as defendants.45
Reforms successful in reducing failure to appear rates tend to address the more mundane
reasons that defendants tend to miss their court date. In Santa Clara County, the introduction
of automated text message court date reminders reduced warrants issued for missed court
dates by 20%.46 At the time of this report’s publication, Massachusetts has re-introduced a
similar test-messaging system in juvenile court to remind youth of upcoming court hearings.47

Cash Bail and Public Safety
Research suggests that the use of cash bail may not result in improved public safety. One review
of bail reforms implemented between 2010-2020 in four states and nine cities and counties
found that all jurisdictions saw decreases or negligible increases in crime or re-arrest rates after
implementing reforms.48 Highlights include:
• New Mexico: After implementing a voter approved constitutional amendment that
prohibits judges from detaining defendants solely due to inability to post bail, the safety
rate (the number of people released pretrial who are not charged with committing a
new crime) increased from 74% to 83% after the reform took effect.
• Washington D.C.: Judges cannot set monetary bail that results in someone’s pretrial
detention, and there are limits to the amount of time people can spend in jail after their
arrest. In FY22, 93% of people were not re-arrested when released pretrial.
Cash Bail and Ability to Pay
Cash bail disproportionately affects low-income families, exacerbating existing inequalities in
the juvenile justice system and leading to worse outcomes for disadvantaged youth.49 It has
been widely documented that cash bail in the adult criminal system is regressive and
disproportionately impacts poor people.50 According to some estimates, adults jailed pretrial
had a median annual income of about $15,109 prior to incarceration, which was less than half
(48%) of the median income for non-incarcerated people of similar ages.51 Further, the burden
of paying cash bail is often placed on families of loved ones.52 For youth in the juvenile justice
system, this means additional burden on parents/caregivers, and the impossible financial
decision of whether to bail their child out or be able to pay essential bills.
GPS Should be Used Sparingly for Youth Given its Harmful Impact and Limited Effectiveness
As discussed in Finding 2 of this report, the Board heard from many individuals who were
concerned about the overreliance and overuse of GPS for youth in Massachusetts.

GPS Use and Adolescent Development and Well-being
Research generally shows that GPS and other forms of electronic monitoring (EM) as a condition
of release are developmentally inappropriate. Because of this, youth have a difficult time being
successful while released on them. GPS requires advanced planning skills that most youth have
not yet fully developed. Because the monitors must always remain charged to avoid any
violations, youth are required to schedule charging times at appropriate increments. Being
supervised on GPS also requires advanced notice be granted from probation officers for youth
to leave their inclusion zones for necessary activities.53
In summary, research shows:
GPS can result in a harmful labeling effect and weaken positive relationships.
Research shows that youth who society perceives as “bad kids” are more likely to go on to make
additional poor choices in their lives.54 The social stigma associated with wearing an electronic
monitor, a visible symbol of being deemed a “bad kid”, can lead to judgements by teachers,
peers, and other adults in a youth’s life. This—in turn—can result in psychological damage to
the youth wearing it, and other negative consequences.
• This stigma can lead to children avoiding school, removing their monitors, and being
isolated from their peers.55
• In one study designed to understand a person’s experience on EM in the adult system,
almost half of those interviewed reported that it negatively impacted their personal
relationships, and 89% of probation officers reported that EM pretrial weakened
participants’ ties with friends and family and hurt relationships.56 This effect of
electronic monitoring directly contradicts delinquency prevention research showing
prosocial connections can prevent further delinquency involvement.57
Further, the emotional, mental, and physical toll that GPS takes on a youth is significant.

• A study conducted in three New York counties found that “of 115 juveniles involved with
the EM program, 64% of juveniles who failed to complete their term of EM cut off their
ankle bracelets, generally thought to be the result of coping difficulties.”58 Additionally,
some youth report living in constant fear of unintentionally violating conditions.59 This
can lead to youth experiencing “the anger and frustration, anxiety and stress, fear and
intimidation, misery, powerless and helplessness that is found at moderate to high rates
among individuals detained pretrial.”60
• The GPS devices themselves can cause physical harm to the wearer, with some reporting
welts and rashes from the devices.61
• Additionally, being on strict surveillance, with conditions that often require extensive
documentation and advance notice to deviate from, also creates serious obstacles to
receiving medical care. This can mean a delay in receiving critical routine, preventative,
or diagnostic care, a delay that could be especially harmful for a “population beset by
many often-untreated mental health illnesses, substance use problems, and chronic
health conditions.”62
GPS Use, Public Safety, and Failure to Appear Rates
Separate from research on GPS and adolescent development, research also suggests that GPS is
not effective at promoting public safety or improving failure to appear rates. The research
reviewed for this report includes:
• A 2020 international meta-analysis of 34 studies on the use electronic monitoring (post-
adjudication), which found that the use of electronic monitoring does not have a
statistically significant impact on reducing re-offending (except for individuals convicted
of a sex offense). In terms of improving FTA rates, there was a mix ranging from no effect
to “inconclusive.”63

• In its 2020 report, the Illinois Supreme Court reviewed a study looking at pretrial GPS
use for individuals facing intimate partner violence charges, leading the Court to
conclude: “there is no research that indicates this condition [electronic monitoring]
promotes public safety or court appearance,” although use of GPS did reduce the risk of
failing to appear to meetings with pretrial probation officers.64
Electronic Monitoring Technology and its Impact on Youth Compliance
Research on jurisdictions that have introduced EM devices with more advanced
technology have shown that these improvements to the devices themselves do not
necessarily result in higher compliance from youth.
In a 2019, a New York pilot program conducted for youth 16-18 replaced traditional
forms of EM (e.g., a GPS ankle bracelet) with a small ankle bracelet which was
connected via Bluetooth to the participating youth’s phone. The ankle bracelet had no
GPS capabilities and did not need to be charged throughout the project; its only purpose
was to ensure the cell phone was physically with the youth.
The program found that this system resulted in an average of four notice of violation
alerts (i.e., youth was out of compliance). However, only 5% of all alerts represented
actual violations – with the other 95% representing violations due to the participants
not adequately charging their cell phone.
Ultimately, the pilot was unsuccessful, with the researchers noting that “keeping a cell
phone charged was not an easy task for many of the young people in our program.”

• Is not effective in promoting public safety: Studies have shown that detention does not
reduce delinquent behavior and increases youth’s likelihood of being re-arrested – with
longer stays in detention increasing recidivism.65
• Increases the odds that youth will become further justice system involved: Pretrial
detention increases the likelihood that youth will be placed in residential custody if a
court adjudicates them delinquent. Further, studies that track youth longer term
outcomes have found that a large portion of youth detained are later involved in the
adult criminal legal system.66
• Disrupts youths’ education: Studies show that school re-enrollment rates for youth
after they are detained are low. Further, youth who are detained are less likely to
graduate high school, enroll in and/or complete college, and have lower employment
and earning opportunities in adulthood.67,68,69
• Has a negative impact on youth’s health and well-being: Youth in detention have
higher rates of physical and behavioral health issues compared to youth generally.
Detention can exacerbate these health problems. In fact, studies find that detention or
commitment during adolescence leads to poorer health in adulthood.70

State Data by Pretrial Process Point71
The Board analyzed available aggregate data reported by the Trial Courts, DYS, and MPS to
inform its research into the juvenile pretrial phase. This section outlines that data by pretrial
process point.
Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on the Data
As mentioned in the Limitations section of this report, the COVID-19 pandemic impacted
juvenile justice system operations and decision-making. There was a concerted effort across
decision-makers to keep youth out of custodial settings as a precautionary measure to
prevent contagion. This meant that the number of youth who were in contact with the
state’s juvenile justice system in FY21 (and to a lesser extent FY20 and FY22) was at an all-
time low. Some of the increases in system use can be attribute to the system resuming
“normal” operations in FY23.
When possible, data pre-pandemic is provided in the following section. However, one of the
most central data elements in this report, condition of release case starts, is only available
from FY21 onward.
For more information on the pandemic’s impact on the juvenile justice system and youth
involved with the system, see the JJPAD Board’s 2021 report:

Key Takeaways
1. Recently, the percent of cases placed on pretrial conditions of release has increased:
Between FY21 and FY23, there was an 110% increase in the number of cases with
pretrial conditions of release. In FY21, there were 628 cases with pretrial conditions of
release and in FY23 that number increased to 1,316.72,73
71 Select data by county and by demographics can be found in the Findings section of this report.
72 As is discussed in the Limitations section of this report, data on COR case starts became available beginning in FY21. During
FY21, there was a concerted effort among juvenile justice stakeholders to divert youth away from the juvenile justice system
during the COVID-19 pandemic. It is likely this resulted in more youth being released on PR when compared to other more
“typical” years.

2. Arraignments increased as well during this time. Data suggests that some of the
increase in the number of cases placed on pretrial conditions of release may be due to
the 70% increase in the number of arraignments during the same time. In some cases,
conditions of release may be used as alternatives to detention for cases with 58A
Hearings: over this period, the number of 58A hearings have gone up, but the percent
resulting in a detention admission is down.
3. However, over this same time period, a lower percentage of cases were placed on PR –
which means the increase in arraignments does not fully explain the increase in the
number of cases placed on COR. In FY21, an estimated 68% of cases not detained at the
initial arraignment were released on PR. In FY23, this percent dropped to 62% of cases at
this stage.74
4. On average, over the past three fiscal years, bail/personal recognizance revocations
accounted for about a third (33%) of all detention admissions. Most of these
admissions were for youth charged with “lower grid level” offenses. On average, over
the past three fiscal years, about 39% of notices of violation of probation (pre and post
adjudication) are for non-delinquency related reasons. Taken together, the data indicates
a subset of youth are being detained without bail as a result of non-delinquency
related notices of violation of pretrial probation conditions of release.
5. Further, there has been an increase in youth detained on low bail amounts in recent
years. Between FY21 and FY23, there was a 26% increase in detention admissions in
which bail was set. Further, the number of admissions in which bail was set below $100
increased 95%.75 The increase in the percent of cases detained on low bail amounts may
be due – in part – to the requirement that judges must take financial resources into
consideration when setting bail now, but as discussed further in the Findings section of
this report, youth may have bail set for reasons other than flight risk.
74 At the time of this report, the number of youth released pretrial on their own personal recognizances is not reported.
Therefore, the Board has estimated the number by taking the total number of youth not detained pretrial and subtracting the
number of youth released on pretrial conditions of release and pretrial probation as a disposition.
75 As was discussed in the Introduction section of this report, there was a concerted effort by juvenile justice stakeholders to
keep youth out of detention during the COVID-19 pandemic. It is likely this resulted in fewer youth being detained when
compared to other more “typical” years.

In January 2024, the Trial Court began publicly reporting data on initial release decisions at
arraignment on delinquency cases. In FY23, there were 3,977 initial detention/release decisions
made at initial arraignment:
• 3,431 resulted in a youth not being detained (representing about 85% of arraignments)
• 546 resulted in a youth being detained with or without conditions of release
(representing about 14% of arraignments)77
77 The data presented reflects outcomes at the first arraignment event on delinquency cases, and therefore may include youth
held pending a 58A Hearing or as a result of bail being set. This count does not include detention decisions as a result of bail/PR
being revoked later on in a case.

Youth Not Detained at the Initial Arraignment
In FY23, of the youth who were not detained at their first arraignment appearance:
• Over half (51%, n = 1,746) were charged with an alleged persons offense (compared to
40%, n=273 of youth detained at the initial arraignment)
• 39% (n=1,343) were charged with an alleged misdemeanor offense (compared to 16%,

As is discussed in greater detail in the Background section of this report, youth not detained can
be released either on their own personal recognizance, with conditions of release which are
monitored/supervised by MPS or, in rare occasions, on pretrial probation as a disposition.

reports by the Trial Court on its public dashboards.
78 At the time of this report, the number of youth released pretrial on their own personal recognizances is not reported.
Therefore, the Board has estimated the number by taking the total number of youth not detained pretrial and subtracting the
number of youth released on pretrial conditions of release and pretrial probation as a disposition.
79 As is discussed in the Limitations section of this report, data on COR case starts became available beginning in FY21. During

during the COVID-19 pandemic. It is likely this resulted in more youth being released on PR when compared to other more

80 Youth can be placed on Pretrial Probation as a Disposition at initial arraignment and not detained as a result. However, in
practice this is extremely rare, and therefore, pretrial probation as a disposition cases are presented in this section but omitted
from the Board’s calculations estimating the number of youth who were released on personal recognizance.

Pretrial Conditions of Release
In FY23, there were 1,316 pretrial conditions of release cases started.81 This is more than two
times the number of cases that started in FY21. As is discussed in the Limitations section of this
report, data on COR case starts became available beginning in FY21. During FY21, there was a
concerted effort among juvenile justice stakeholders to divert youth away from the juvenile
justice system during the COVID-19 pandemic. It is likely this resulted in more youth being
released on PR when compared to other more “typical” years.
The increase in pretrial condition of release cases reflects an increase in both cases that are
monitored and supervised by probation, but the majority of cases during this time were
monitored by the Pretrial Services Unit. As Figure 7 shows, more than half of the cases that start
each year are monitored by the Pretrial Services Unit and not supervised by the local office.

Pretrial Detention Admissions to DYS as a Result of Personal Recognizance or Bail Being Revoked
If youth do not comply with their conditions of release, or are charged with a new alleged
offense, their bail may be revoked, and they may be detained pretrial without bail. In FY23, 42%
(n=234) of detention admissions without bail were due to a youth’s bail or personal
recognizance being revoked.

*Probation violation hearings can include both pretrial and post disposition cases.
**This means the court documents sent to DYS do not list a reason for detaining without bail. Unknowns have

Juvenile Detention Alternative Initiative (JDAI).
Source: Data retrieved from the JJPAD FY23 Annual Report
In FY23, the majority of detention admissions where youth were detained without bail as a
result of bail or personal recognizance being revoked were for underlying persons offenses
(58%, n=136), and about half were for “lower grid level” offenses (49%, n=115).
Historically, MPS has not disaggregated pretrial and post-disposition notices of violation of
probation in its public data reporting.82 On average, over the past three fiscal years, about 39%
of probation violation notices (both pre- and post-adjudication) were for non-delinquency
related reasons.
82 Beginning in April of 2024, MPS started collecting violation notice data disaggregated by pre and post adjudication with plans
to begin publicly reporting that data on their Tableau Public Dashboard.

As discussed in the Findings section below, stakeholder interviews revealed that probation
officers have more discretion when handling violations post-disposition than pretrial. Therefore,
it may be the case that some non-delinquency (“technical”) violation notices occur during the
pretrial phase and are contributing to the detention admissions that stemmed from a
revocation.

Youth Detained at Initial Arraignment
In FY23, of the 546 cases that resulted in youth being detained at the initial arraignment:83
• About 38% (n=205) were detained with bail set
• About 20% (n=108) were detained as a result of, or pending a, 58A Hearing
• About 14% (n=75) were detained for unknown reasons
• Fewer than 1% (n=5) were detained for a 68A Evaluation
Youth Detained with Bail Set
In FY23, about a quarter (27%, n= 205) of all detention admissions (n=768) were for youth with
bail set, about a third of which (37%, n=76) were held on less than $100. Nearly half (46%,
n=94) of the youth detained with bail included the stipulation that they be released to their
parent/guardian.84
Over half (59%, n=120) of youth detained with bail set were detained for “lower-level grid
offenses”, most of which (51%, n=62) were for youth who had bail set under $100.85 In FY23,
83 Total does not add up to 100% due to differences in reporting by DYS and the Juvenile Court.
84Legally, all youth must be released to a parent or legal guardian unless otherwise specified by the Court, but anyone can post
bail for the youth. The Board will explore this topic as part of the group’s dually involved youth project in 2025.
85 DYS measures offense severity by a numerical (1-7) “grid level.” Grid levels 1-2 are categorized as low, grid level 3 is
categorized as medium, and grid levels 4-7 are categorized as high.

However, most 58A hearings do not result in a detention admission. In FY23, there were 339
58A Hearings held, but only about 32% (n=108) of those hearings resulted in a detention
admission.86 The other 231 hearings may have resulted in:
• the youth being found not dangerous and released with conditions of release being set
• the youth being found dangerous and released with conditions of release being set
Currently, outcomes of 58A Hearings are not reported by the Trial Court.
Most youth held as a result of a 58A Hearing are held for “higher grid level” (90%, n=97) and
persons related offenses (56%, n=60).
86 This is an estimated calculation based on the number of detention admissions to DYS for 58A Hearings divided by the number
of 58A Hearings.

Findings
The pretrial process of the juvenile justice system is complex – and requires the balancing of a
number of competing priorities:
• Youth are, at this phase, presumed innocent, which means they have a variety of legal
rights that must be protected. These legal rights mean that there are limits on judges
mandating certain conditions related to treatment, punishment, or restorative practices
as compared to how they might set conditions post-disposition when youth are
adjudicated delinquent or admit sufficient facts (i.e., a CWOF). Youth can refuse
voluntary services in the pretrial phase – even if some or all of the adults in the system
believe such participation would lead to the best long-term outcomes for the youth.
• Youth are entitled to a speedy trial. However, the judicial process is (often
intentionally) slow to protect a youth’s right to due process. A lengthy pretrial period is
often harmful to the youth, and yet sometimes it is necessary to ensure they have full
access to the various legal proceedings – including discovery and the opportunity to
prepare for trial – to which they are entitled.
• The Juvenile Court is required by law to treat children “not as criminals, but as
children in need of aid, encouragement and guidance,” and the “care, custody and
discipline of the children brought before the court shall approximate as nearly as
possible that which they should receive from their parents.”87 However, many of the
mechanisms in place during this time are the same mechanisms in place for adults (e.g.,
detention, cash bail, pretrial supervision) with limited modifications for youth. The
Juvenile Court must balance this mandate with its mission to “…protect the public
from delinquent and criminal activity” during this part of the system.
• Victims and witnesses also have rights and needs. Safeguarding the rights and needs of
an alleged victim or witness, without infringing on a youth’s presumed innocence at this
stage, can, in some circumstances, be challenging. As is discussed in The Pretrial Process
section of this report, victim advocates stress that victims are not a monolith, and have
unique needs and ways in which they want to be included in the court process.
However, prosecutors and judges have limited mechanisms in which they are able
address victim’s needs at this phase.
87M.G.L. Ch.119 Section 53
51

Complicating things further, there are particular considerations at this phase that are unique to
youth – as many stakeholders interviewed for this report noted, “kids are different.” These
considerations include:
• The different developmental needs of youth, and the increased level of harm they can
experience, compared to adults, from certain interventions or restrictions.
• The added imperative to consider a child’s safety in decision-making.
• The difference in how children experience time as compared to adults.
• Youth have parents/guardians that have legal obligations, rights, and expectations that
can – at times – support or conflict with court proceedings and considerations.
Despite these complications, it is clear that the Commonwealth will benefit when youth are
able to succeed during the pretrial phase – and receive the support they need to do so.
On the other hand, when youth are harmed by the pretrial process – including the harms that
can come from detention or overly restrictive pretrial conditions of release, or from being
treated unfairly – the child, their family, and citizens of the Commonwealth suffer the
consequences directly and indirectly. Although the youth and their families feel those harms
most acutely, youth who “finish” the pretrial period more isolated from their communities, with
more difficulties in school, fewer pro-social connections, and more exacerbated behavioral
health challenges are ultimately more likely to commit delinquent acts in the future, making us
all less safe.
The goal, then, is a pretrial system that treats youth, their families, and victims fairly, sets
youth up to succeed, and does not cause more harm than good. Based on the numerous
interviews conducted for this report, an analysis of the available data, and a review of national
research and best practices at this phase, however, the Board concludes that our pretrial
system is not systematically achieving this goal.
In particular, the Board finds that our pretrial process:
• Sets pretrial conditions for youth that can be developmentally inappropriate or not
tailored to their specific cases – increasing the likelihood youth will violate those
conditions and leading to detentions that could have been avoided.
• Overuses “control” mechanisms, most notably GPS monitoring and home confinement,
that pose multiple harms to youth without necessarily increasing public safety.
• Lasts too long, causing harm to youth, and results in youth missing time from school and
other prosocial activities and delaying treatment and services that might help prevent
delinquent behavior.
• Is directed by a pretrial statutory framework that is unclear and does not account for
all relevant circumstances.

The Board also stresses that the state’s pretrial process should be equitable: a youth’s
demographics, family circumstances, or the zip code they are arrested in should not
dramatically influence the trajectory of their case. While some level of variation to respond to
individual circumstances and community needs is to be expected, the Commonwealth should
strive for a basic level of fairness and equitable treatment of all youth across the state. The
Board’s review of quantitative and qualitative data makes clear, however, that:
• There are vastly different regional practices at this stage, leading to concerns about
equity
• There are disparities in who is detained pretrial, who gets placed on pretrial
monitoring/supervision, and who is released on personal recognizance
Each of the Board’s findings are detailed below.
Finding 1: Pretrial Conditions for Youth can Fail to be Developmentally Appropriate
or Tailored to a Youth’s Specific Case
Stakeholders interviewed for this report repeatedly expressed that “kids are different”, and that
the current pretrial system is not designed with the unique circumstances and developmental
stage of youth in mind.
Interviewees regularly noted that current statute, case law, guidance, and standards are
geared toward the adult system, and believed that the Juvenile Court should have specific
guidance, forms, and practices for youth. For example, the readability of the state’s conditions
of release form is at an eleventh-grade level, well above the recommended fifth grade level
suggested for other Trial Court publications.88
Further, as highlighted in the Research section above, the time in which youth can be involved in
Juvenile Court – adolescence (i.e., 12-17 years old in MA) – is a distinct period in life, one in
which the brain is still anatomically developing, making some aspects of the pretrial phase
particularly difficult for youth to comply with.
Additionally, research on juvenile probation conditions suggests that a “one-size” fits all
approach is not effective for youth. Rather, research on youth placed on supervision post-
adjudication suggests that conditions that target specific risk factors and are related to the
offense the youth was adjudicated delinquent of result in better outcomes for youth.
Interviewees noted that a common reason youth violate their pretrial conditions is because the
conditions were not appropriate and/or were unachievable for a youth. Probation is required to
88 For more information see: Massachusetts Trial Court. (2018). Readability Guidelines for Printed Self-Help Materials and Forms.

53

notify the DAO whenever they become aware of a violation of probation during this phase.
Many probation officers cited inappropriate conditions causing these violations, and thought
the violations could often be better addressed outside of the courtroom. For example:
• Professionals interviewed expressed concerns about frequently used conditions of
release (specifically about GPS, home confinement, and curfews) that remove youth
from their community and prosocial activities. As detailed in the Research section above,
research shows that positive connections and participating in prosocial activities are vital
to youth’s mental health and wellbeing, and when removed, can contribute to
delinquency.
• Some professionals caution against the use of treatment-related conditions at this stage,
noting the “Juvenile Court is not a service provider,” and in many cases these types of
conditions assume guilt. Further, individuals emphasized the challenge of when services
are tied to a delinquency case/process, the services end when the case ends. Often,
treatment-based services require long, ongoing relationships beyond the length of the
delinquency court process, and this disruption in service delivery can be problematic. On
the other hand, some professionals noted that when youth do well on their treatment-
related pretrial conditions, that can help their case at the dispositional stage (i.e., a less
severe sanction).
• In many interviews, professionals expressed concern that judges are setting too many
conditions of release for youth, making it difficult for youth to keep track of, and comply
with, all of the conditions. This ultimately increases the youth’s chances of violating their
conditions and risking detention.
• Stakeholders noted that restrictive conditions can be the hardest for youth to follow, and
cited numerous examples where restrictive conditions were set that were unrelated to
the alleged offense, the facts of a case, or an alleged victim or witness, such as:
Youth being ordered to periodic drug testing, regardless of if the alleged offense
o
was drug related
Youth being ordered to adhere to a nightly curfew, even if the alleged offense
o
happened during the day or afternoon
Youth being ordered not use social media or their cell phone even if the alleged
o
offense did not involve the use of social media or relate to their phone
54

• The Board also heard instances of youth being placed on conditions that were in direct
conflict with each other, such as setting a condition to attend school daily, as well as
setting an exclusion zone that includes their school.
Professionals and young adults also reported that families often were unsure who their
probation officer was when their case was monitored by the Pretrial Unit and what their
requirements were during this time. Youth and families were left frustrated trying to understand
who their probation officer was when their case was monitored at the state level, and who they
could go to for support.
As described above, and further explored in Finding 5, there are a variety of laws that govern
the setting of pretrial conditions of release, and some conditions can only legally be set with the
permission of the youth. Although in some cases the youth may technically agree, through their
attorney, to certain conditions, stakeholders noted that the notion of consent in such situations
is complicated, particularly if the alternative on the table is detention. For this reason, some
stakeholders suggested that the onus should be on all adults in the system – prosecutors
requesting conditions, judges agreeing to conditions, and defense attorneys advising their
clients and arguing for or against conditions – to ensure that conditions are developmentally
appropriate, and that youth are set up to succeed during this pretrial phase.
Bright Spots: MPS’ eReminder Program
Research shows that many youth (as well as adults) miss court dates for mundane
reasons (e.g., lack of transportation, forgetting their court date) rather than
intentionally fleeing justice. Programs targeting these barriers have better results in
improving failure to appear rates when compared to systems that just rely on cash bail.
Understanding this, MPS, in partnership with the Trial Court’s Information Technology
Department, worked to develop an eReminder text message system that sends
reminders to defendants of their court date. The program was piloted in 2022 at a few
district courts and has since been expanded. An evaluation of the program’s impact on
failure to appear rates for pretrial hearings found that in the text reminder group, 11%
of defendant’s failed to appear at their pretrial hearing, compared to 14% for the no
text reminder group. Further, the failure to appear rate at pretrial hearing events was
consistently lower for the text reminder group regardless of age, race/ethnicity,
gender, or offense severity.
As of the writing of this report, MPS and the Juvenile Courts have begun
implementation in delinquency cases.

Finding 2: Restrictive Conditions, Most Notably GPS and Home Confinement, are
Overused
In almost every interview conducted for this report across sectors, professionals expressed
concern about the overuse of overly restrictive conditions, most notably GPS, during the pretrial
phase.
Many professionals believed that the increase in GPS use was an unintended consequence to
Massachusetts limiting the use of detention in Juvenile Court. As discussed earlier in this report,
Massachusetts has made a concerted effort to decrease the use of pretrial detention for youth,
resulting in a 57% decrease in admissions between FY15 and FY24. The Board does not have
annual data on GPS use throughout the same time period or other data pertaining to GPS use,
but many professionals believed it has gone up.
Those interviewed generally agreed that being released on GPS was the “lesser of two evils”
when compared to being detained, and that there are times when a youth can successfully
avoid further juvenile justice system involvement after successfully complying with their GPS
conditions.89 At the same time, many felt as though the harm caused by being placed on a GPS
unit was not well documented or understood across all Massachusetts Juvenile Court
stakeholders.
Some professionals interviewed are skeptical that the adoption of GPS was effective at limiting
detention admissions, however. While it may be the case that the adoption of GPS as a
condition of release is resulting in some youth being diverted from detention, that is not the
case for all youth on GPS. In interviews, professionals cited examples including:
• GPS is often used in cases where youth may have otherwise been released pretrial and,
in some cases, were not even eligible for detention (e.g., there was insufficient evidence
to detain youth as a result of a 58A Hearing).
• Youth in Massachusetts have been held in detention waiting for an ankle monitor,
despite state policies that say youth should not be held for equipment for more than 24
hours.90,91
89 This is reflected in national research as well, and in several law review articles. For example: Crump, Catherine, Tracking the
Trackers: An Examination of Electronic Monitoring of Youth in Practice (2019). UC Davis Law Review, Vol. 53, No. 2, 2019,
https://ssrn.com/abstract=3414273
90 Per Massachusetts Probation Service policy individuals should not be detained for more than 24 hours waiting for equipment.
91 This appears to be a national phenomenon. For example, in one San Francisco study, individuals placed on pretrial electronic
monitoring were held for a median of seven days, compared to three days for those who were released to supervision. Skog, A.
& Lacoe, J. (2022). Pretrial Electronic Monitoring in San Francisco. California Policy Lab. https://www.capolicylab.org/wp-
content/uploads/2022/11/Pretrial-Electronic-Monitoring-in-San-Francisco.pdf
56

• GPS can contribute to “net widening” due to an increase in technical violations related
to the GPS equipment.
In the Board’s review of relevant statutes, case law, and official guidance, it found that there is
no statute providing legal guidance for the use of GPS pretrial in Juvenile Court, and the case
law is conflicting. Many interviewees felt there should be more guidance on the appropriate use
of GPS pretrial.
Specific concerns about using GPS as a condition expressed by interviewees include:
• GPS is not developmentally appropriate for youth, as it requires long-term planning
skills that are still developing in adolescence. The Board heard several examples of youth
having a difficult time keeping devices charged, resulting in youth receiving “false alarm”
violations.
• GPS contributes to a “labeling effect”, which is harmful for youth and families. The
labeling effect refers to the well-documented process by which youth labeled as “bad
kids” adopt those labels as part of their identity, leading to increased likelihood of future
delinquent behavior.92
The Board heard these same sentiments expressed in interviews with young adults who
were placed on GPS as youth. In one interview, the young adult shared how complying
with the conditions of his GPS disrupted his personal relationships, making him feel
further isolated from other youth. In another extreme example, the Board heard of a
youth having two GPS monitors at once – potentially exacerbating the labeling impact.
• GPS when coupled with home confinement is detrimental to youth’s physical and
mental wellbeing. The Board heard numerous examples of youth whose mental and
physical health were severely diminished as a result of being placed on GPS, especially
when it was coupled with home confinement. Examples shared include:
Youth were unable to maintain positive connections with their families and
o
community.
Youth were unable to participate in prosocial activities.
o
Youth experienced negative impacts on their physical and mental wellbeing due
o
to the lack of space and recreation options available to them while on GPS.

https://doi.org/10.2307/2575560 This theory is also supported in juvenile justice system research. For example: Rowan, Z., et.
Al. (2023). Labeling effects of initial juvenile justice system processing decision on youth interpersonal ties. Criminology, Vol. 61,
No. 4, 2023, p. 731-757. https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1745-9125.12348
57

In fact, in a point-in-time data sample pulled from MPS regarding 217 youth on GPS
monitoring, 80% (n=174) had a “home confinement” condition. About 24% (n=52) had
an “exclusion zone” condition, and about 20% (n=43) had a “curfew” condition.93
The Board heard several examples from professionals of youth who had to delay
preventative medical care due to the burden associated with getting their conditions of
release modified to accommodate medical appointments. While MPS is allowed to make
day-to-day modifications to conditions (e.g., opening a time window to be out of the
house), any changes to the conditions themselves need to be brought into court. This
theme is discussed further in the Research section of this report.
• GPS technology can be unreliable, resulting in youth violating their conditions of
release. Professionals shared several examples of the judicial system citing youth for
technical violations due to faulty or failing technology, such as the GPS suddenly losing
connection.
• GPS is resource-intensive for both court stakeholders and youth and their families. The
Board heard in interviews that both placing a GPS on a youth and responding to
frequent violations due to the unreliable nature of the technology strained Probation’s
resources. Additionally, professionals also shared examples of how disruptive/resource
intensive wearing a GPS unit was for youth and their families. Examples frequently cited
include:
Youth and families having to notify the court/MPS frequently in order to get the
o
conditions of the GPS modified so the youth could attend medical appointments
Youth and families having to drive to MPS’ Electronic Monitoring Program
o
(ELMO) Unit in Clinton or Quincy to address a device that is having technical
difficulties
• Youth are on GPS devices for too long. The Board heard concerns of youth being on GPS
for extended periods, in some instances years, during the pretrial phase. As discussed in
the Research Section of this report, extended use of GPS exacerbates the negative
outcomes associated with its use in adolescents and can also increase the youth’s
likelihood that they will violate and as a result be detained.
It’s clear from both stakeholder interviews and the available research that GPS, as it is currently
used, is resulting in harmful outcomes for youth and their families. Further, due to the lack of
93 Data obtained by OCA from MPS on 12/3/2024.
58

data on usage in Massachusetts, and the lack of a shared “benchmark” for how GPS should be
used, it is difficult to assess its impact on both public safety and failure to appear rates.
Finding 3: The Pretrial Process Lasts Too Long, Causing Harm to Youth
While the Juvenile Court time standards94 state that delinquency proceedings are to be
disposed within six to eight months, in practice, the pretrial phase can extend much longer. In
fact, in the Board’s interviews, it was not uncommon for professionals to cite examples of a
youth’s cases taking years to reach disposition. There are many ways in which the pretrial
phase can be extended:
• The introduction of evidence that requires forensic or scientific testing (e.g., DNA
testing, drug analysis) or the request of third-party records.
• Motions to dismiss/suppress statements, evidence, search warrants or identifications.
• Requests for a court-ordered delay of a hearing, trial, or other proceeding, referred to as
a continuance, due to the unavailability of a victim, witness, or court personnel, or to
prepare additional evidence for submission. Some continuances have time-limits set in
statute (e.g., a continuance for a 58A Hearing can be no longer than 7 days) while others
are up to the judge’s discretion.
• Requests for court services, such as obtaining interpreters from the Office of Language
Access.
• Finding and scheduling a trial date. Juvenile Courts often schedule trials during certain
days of the week/month, which impacts other court proceedings moving forward during
that time and can create a backlog of trials. Many interviewees noted trials were being
scheduled 6 or more months out.95
• Impacts of other Juvenile Court cases. Delinquency cases represent just part of the cases
judges oversee in Juvenile Court. In addition to delinquency cases, judges hear many
other types of cases including Child Requiring Assistance (CRA) and Care & Protection
(C&P) cases. Emergency hearings for these cases require courts to be flexible and
constantly re-prioritize cases, which can impact case processing time.
• Limited staffing and/or resources across state entities to address the current caseload of
delinquency cases including a limited number of Juvenile Court judges and a shortage of
defense attorneys.
Not only do each of these circumstances take time, but certain court processes (e.g., filing
certain motions) also “pause” the clock tracking how long the pretrial phase lasts (this is

entire soccer season. If a youth is detained for
three months, they have missed an entire quarter
of education at their school.
Once a youth’s education and prosocial activities are disrupted, it’s difficult for youth to make
that time up. Research shows that any amount of time away from school can be detrimental to
a youth’s learning, and it can take youth years to recover from that disruption.96 Similarly, as is
discussed in the Research section of this report, disruption or removal from prosocial activities
has been shown to have a negative impact on youth’s physical and mental well-being.
Having a legal case hanging over a youth’s head can significantly impact their mental health. The
stress and uncertainty of pending legal decisions can lead to anxiety, depression, and feelings of

hopelessness, which may hinder their overall development and coping abilities. This constant
pressure can also exacerbate existing mental health issues.97
Further, research shows that children perceive time differently than adults, often experiencing it
as more fluid and less linear, which can influence their understanding of events and memory
formation. Youth often remember events based on emotional impact rather than chronological
order, while adults usually have a clearer sense of past and future events and how they relate.
Kids can experience moments as feeling longer or shorter based on their engagement in
activities.98,99 Adults, with their greater experience, often have a more consistent sense of
duration.100
This impacts how youth remember the juvenile justice system experience and perceive it in real
time. Research shows youth’s perceptions of procedural fairness often center on process rather
than outcomes, which can significantly influence their attitudes and behaviors.101
Finally, research suggests that the longer a case takes to reach disposition, the less impactful
any sanction is on future deterrence. The theory of "swiftness" suggests that timely
consequences for delinquent behavior are crucial for effective individual deterrence in youth.
Research shows when youth experience immediate sanctions for their actions, it enhances their
understanding of the consequences. This reinforces the connection between behavior and
outcomes, which can lead to a reduction in recidivism.102
Alleged victims and witnesses: Depending on the case, victims and witnesses may be asked to
come into court or meet with court personnel on multiple occasions, interrupting daily life
(including school attendance for victims and witnesses who are also youth) and serving as a
reminder of the alleged offense. Prolonged Juvenile Court processes can lead to increased
anxiety and emotional distress for victims and witnesses, as uncertainty about outcomes and

delays in justice can exacerbate feelings of vulnerability.103 Lengthy processes may result in
witnesses being less likely to participate in court proceedings, potentially leading to reduced
testimony and impacting the overall effectiveness of the justice system.104 For victims, delays in
resolution can hinder their psychological recovery and sense of closure, prolonging trauma
associated with the incident.105
Further, research shows that most victims (whether they are children or adults) live in close
proximity – even the same neighborhoods – to the individuals accused of committing
delinquent acts.106 The longer a case is unresolved, the longer potential stressors in a
community are felt, which can lead to delinquency and feelings of vulnerability, as mentioned.
When cases take a long time to be resolved, a community’s perception of the system can
worsen and question legitimacy, which erodes trust.107
Juvenile Justice System/System Personnel: A prolonged Juvenile Court case can overburden
staff across the Juvenile Court, Probation, CPCS/YAD, DAOs, police, DYS, and other state entities,
and can lead to inefficiencies and delays in subsequent cases, leading to a vicious cycle.108
Finding 4: There are Vastly Different Regional Practices at this Stage, Leading to
Concerns about Equity
As documented by the JJPAD Board in previous reports, the juvenile justice system operates
differently across counties. While in some cases this may be a reasonable response to variations
in local circumstances, it can also raise concerns about equity: the zip code a youth is arrested in
can significantly impact how their case proceeds, with similarly situated youth receiving
different treatment based on the county or even court in which their case is handled. (Evidence
of other kinds of disparities, such as racial disparities, are further discussed in Finding 6).

The pretrial phase is no exception. During interviews, the Board heard instances in which
differences across district attorneys’ offices, defense attorneys, probation officers, and judges
led to disparate outcomes for youth.
While the Board does not have all the data necessary to validate the concerns expressed in
interviews, it is clear from what is available that the pretrial phase does operate differently
county to county, and there are indeed disparities in who gets detained, placed on pretrial
monitoring and supervision, or released on personal recognizance. These differences include:
Whether youth are released on personal recognizance or assigned to be monitored by the
MPS Pretrial Unit.109 Based on the Board’s estimated calculations, the percent of youth
released on personal recognizance/sent to be monitored by the Pretrial Unit across counties
varies widely. In FY23, estimates ranged from 59% (n=126) of youth arraigned being released on
personal recognizance/cases monitored in Plymouth County to 92% (n=265) of all youth being
released on personal recognizance/cases monitored in Barnstable County.

Whether youth are assigned conditions of release: In FY23, 42% (n= 561) of pretrial cases with
conditions of release were supervised at the county level. Franklin/Hampshire, Plymouth,
Suffolk, and Worcester counties are more likely to require a youth be supervised pretrial than
other counties. Although the Board does not currently have data on all conditions set, point-in-
time data from August 2023 suggests that Suffolk County uses GPS at a higher rate than other
counties compared to the proportion of state arraignments coming from Suffolk.

Use of cash bail: Compared to the rest of the state, youth who are detained in Hampden,
Norfolk, and Suffolk Counties are more likely to be detained due to inability to make bail than
because they were held without the possibility of bail than in other counties. Of the youth who
are detained with bail set in Hampden County, 76% (n=32) are held on amounts of $50 or less.
In Norfolk, 46% (n=9) of youth detained with bail set are held on amounts of $50 or less.

Whether youth are placed on pretrial probation as a disposition: Of the pretrial probation as a
disposition cases supervised at the local level, 68% (n=105) are supervised in Bristol, Middlesex,
and Norfolk Counties. In comparison, 28% of cases in the state are arraigned in those three
counties. In other words, pretrial probation as a disposition is used much more frequently in
those counties than the rest of the state. In comparison, pretrial probation as a disposition is
rarely if ever used in Plymouth, Barnstable, Franklin/Hampshire, Suffolk, or Worcester counties.
Between FY22 and FY23, Bristol more than doubled the amount of pretrial probation as a
disposition cases, while these cases in Norfolk increased by 78%.

Use of 58A Hearings: Essex County has the highest number of 58A Hearings when compared to
other counties, representing 25% (n=85) of the state total, despite making up only 15% (n=376)
of the state’s felony arraignments. Further, it appears these dangerousness hearings result in
detention less frequently than the state total; while Essex conducts more 58A Hearings than any
other county, youth held without bail due to being found dangerous account for only 25% of
Essex’s detention admissions where youth are held without bail (Table 6 below). Berkshire,
Bristol, Middlesex, Suffolk and Worcester counties were slightly overrepresented in 58A
Hearings, compared to their proportion of state felony arraignments. This means that, while the
level of severity of offense (misdemeanor vs. felony) accounts for some of the differences in 58A
Hearings from county to county, it does not account for all of it.

Finding 5: The Pretrial Statutory Framework is Unclear and Does Not Account for
All Relevant Circumstances
As discussed above and further described below, the Board heard significant concerns from
many professionals interviewed for this report about when and how cash bail and other
conditions of release are set in certain cases. In some cases, this may be the result of an unclear
statutory framework, further complicated by case law, that does not account for all relevant
circumstances. At times, this lack of clarity of intent meant that it was hard for the Board to
measure if the laws are having their intended impact.
Cash Bail
As discussed in the Massachusetts’ Pretrial Phase section of this report, MGL Ch. 276 Section
58110 and 58A111 state that the intention of setting cash bail during this phase of the system is to
make sure youth appear in court and, in the case of 58A, ensure the safety of a victim or
another individual. This statutory focus on flight risk in Section 58 has been reiterated by the SJC
as well.112
However, in making that determination, the state can legally weigh a number of factors that –
research indicates – do not relate to a youth’s “flight risk” and seem unlikely to be related to
victim safety. For example, the statute states that a judge should consider a person’s
employment record and history of mental illness.
110 M.G.L. Ch. 276 Section 58
111 M.G.L. Ch. 276 Section 58A
112 Commonwealth v. Norman
68

Based on interviews with stakeholders and analysis of the data, the Board has concluded that
cash bail is being used at times due to reasons other than flight risk – albeit reasons that in
many cases are related to protecting a child’s safety or responding to other system constraints.
Examples include:
• Holding youth with DCF involvement, specifically due to lack of other placement
options. Youth with DCF involvement represent over half (51%, n=395) of total detention
admissions, and 57% (n=116) of youth held as a result of bail being set.113 Professionals
across sectors expressed concern that youth with DCF involvement are overrepresented
in detention admissions, and that detention is being used in lieu of other placement
options.
• Holding youth being, or perceived as being, commercially sexually exploited (CSEC).
Many professionals believed that youth, particularly girls, are more likely to be held due
to concerns that they are at risk, or are currently being sexually exploited, even if that
was not reflected in the alleged offense.
• Holding youth whose parents refuse to take them home. Some professionals cited bail
being set when a parent/caregiver in court asks the judge to detain their child. According
to interviews, caregivers request youth be held for a variety of reasons such as “teaching
them a lesson” or safety concerns for other household members. Further, only
parents/caregivers have the authority to bail youth out, and for youth whose legal
custodian is DCF, the agency’s practice is to not post bail.
Additionally, it is unclear whether judges are documenting if cash bail is set with the financial
considerations of the youth in mind as required by law. Some interviewees argued that
Massachusetts has already deemed all youth as “indigent” by assigning all youth – regardless of
financial status of their parents/guardians – counsel.114 Interviewees noted that setting cash bail
as a condition of release contradicts that sentiment.
Conditions of Release
As discussed in the Background section of this report, conditions of release set under Section 58
are by law meant to ensure that youth appear in court.115 Further, under Commonwealth v.
Norman (2020), the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court clarified that “the only permissible
113 Further data on youth with DCF involvement can be found in Finding 6 of this report.

goals of pretrial conditions of release [set under Section 58] … were ensuring the defendant's
return to court and his presence at trial and safeguarding the integrity of the judicial process by
protecting witnesses from intimidation and other forms of influence.” (Conditions of release
related to ensuring public safety can only be set for certain offenses under Section 58A or for
cases related to domestic violence under Section 58).
However, stakeholders interviewed for this report noted numerous situations where conditions
were set, even though there were no concerns of a flight risk or witness intimidation. In
interviews, professionals often cited examples of cases where the youth and their family had
been diligent in appearing to court, had a stable living situation, and were attending school, but
still, several conditions were imposed.
While other, broader conditions can permissibly be set under MGL Ch. 267 Section 87, as
discussed above, those conditions are only supposed to be set with the consent of the youth –
which, as the SJC has noted, is an unclear concept when pretrial detention is the alternative to
“consenting.”116
It is unclear to many stakeholders the extent to which judges are being clear about whether
conditions are being set under Section 58 or Section 87 – and, thus, whether a youth’s consent
is truly and meaningful being obtained for all conditions being sent. Indeed, many individuals
interviewed noted seeing “all the boxes checked” on the bail form, suggesting that judges are
not always clearly indicating for the record under which statute the condition is set.
116 The “coercive quality of the circumstance in which a defendant seeks to avoid incarceration by obtaining probation on
certain conditions makes principles of waiver and consent generally inapplicable.” Norman, 484 Mass. at 335, quoting
Commonwealth v. Feliz, 481 Mass. 689, 702 (2019).

Failure to Appear in Massachusetts and the J-PAST
In Massachusetts, the Juvenile Probation Arraignment/Appearance Screening Tool (J-PAST)
was implemented in 2015 as part of the state’s JDAI efforts. The screener predicts youth’s
risk of failing to appear for a court hearing, and calculates that risk based on five factors: 1)
Current open warrants, 2) Number of felony adjudications, 3) School attendance, 4) Prior
failures to appear, 5) History of mental health disorder. The J-PAST was validated using
Massachusetts data, and the factors used to calculate risk somewhat aligns with available
research done in other jurisdictions.
The Board heard in interviews that most youth show up to their court hearings, regardless
of whether or not cash bail is set, and that the J-PAST is not consistently conducted or used.
The intended use of the J-PAST is for a probation officer to screen youth prior to
arraignment. The results of the screener are then supposed to be made available to judges.
However, in practice, it does not appear that the J-PAST is consistently conducted or, when it
is, that judges are asking for its results, nor using the results to inform their decision making.
The Board does not know why the J-PAST was not fully implemented, but in interviews
professionals cited:
• Most youth appear to their court date, even youth who score as a “high” risk for
failing to appear.
• Professionals interviewed expressed concern that there may be biases in the tool
contributing to disparities and racialized outcomes in who scored high and were
detained as a result.
• A lack of understanding of the purpose of the tool (e.g., claiming it took away
discretion, when it was intended to be one of many factors judges could use).
• Lack of implementation monitoring and assessment to see if the tool’s results were
accurate and implementation of the new tool had its intended effect.
• Lack of buy-in from system partners (e.g., judges, DAOs, CPCS, etc.).
• Implementation challenges as a result of a roll-out spanning across the two chief
justices: Chief Justice Edgerton, who was then succeeded then by Chief Justice
Nechtem.

Finding 6: There are Disparities in Who is Detained Pretrial, Who Gets Placed on
Pretrial Monitoring/Supervision, and Who is Released on Personal Recognizance
The Board has documented the persistent racial and ethnic disparities in the Commonwealth’s
juvenile justice system each year since its inception. The pretrial phase is no exception. In fact,
in FY23, Black and Latino youth remained overrepresented at each pretrial process point in the
juvenile justice system.117
Further, the Board heard concerns from court stakeholders that certain groups of youth, namely
girls and youth with DCF involvement, are more likely to be detained pretrial for reasons other
than concerns regarding failure to appear or community safety.
Racial and Ethnic Disparities
To better understand racial and ethnic disparities in pretrial decision-making, the Board
examined Trial Court data on initial decisions on whether to detain a youth on a delinquency
case at the initial arraignment hearing.
Youth detained at the initial arraignment:
In FY23, compared to white youth detained at the initial arraignment,
• Hispanic/Latino youth were 1.32 times more likely to be detained pretrial and 1.47 times
more likely to be detained as a result of bail being set.
• Black/African American youth were 1.07 times more likely to be detained pretrial and
1.37 times more likely to be detained as a result of bail being set. Of youth who were
detained as a result of bail being set, Black/African American youth had higher bail
amounts set (Figure 16).
Youth not detained at the initial arraignment:
In FY23 compared to non-Hispanic/Latino118 youth not detained at the initial arraignment in the
state, Hispanic/Latino youth were 1.88 times more likely to have conditions of release set and
1.71 times more likely to be placed on pretrial probation as a disposition.
In FY23, compared to white youth not detained at the initial arraignment in the state,
Black/African American youth were 1.10 times more likely to be placed on conditions of release
and 0.63 times less likely to be placed on pretrial probation as a disposition.

Gender Disparities
As with the rest of the juvenile justice system, boys represent the majority of admissions in the
pretrial phase when compared to girls. While girls only represent a small number of admissions,
it is clear from the data that both detention and pretrial probation as a disposition are used
differently for girls, including:
• While girls made up 14% (n=106) of all detention admissions in FY23, they made up 21%
(n=44) of detention admissions as a result of bail being set and are held for lower
amounts compared to boys. As discussed throughout this report, many professionals
believed that girls are being detained with bail set for reasons other than flight risks.

LGBTQ+ Disparities
DYS reports the sexual orientation, transgender status, and intersex status of youth in their care
and custody.119 In FY23, 6% (n=47) of pretrial detention admissions were for youth who
identified as LGBTQ+. As the MA LGBTQ Youth Commission has highlighted in recent reports, 6%
of the detention population identifying as LGBTQ+ is below national estimates,120 and as the
Board has highlighted previously, it is unknown if this is a positive sign, or the result of
underreporting by detained youth who may decide not to disclose their gender identity or
sexual orientation status at intake.121
Further, LGBTQ+ youth were held on cash bail more frequently, and held for lower amounts
when compared to youth who did not identify as LGBTQ+.
119 Currently, DYS is the only juvenile justice system entity in Massachusetts that collects and reports data on sexual orientation
and gender identity/transgender/intersex status.
120 According to an OJJDP literature review published in 2014: “available research has estimated that LGBT youths represent 5%
to 7% of the nation’s overall youth population, but they compose 13% to 15% of those currently in the juvenile justice system.

• As discussed in this report, professionals cited examples of youth with DCF involvement
being held on cash bail due to a lack of DCF placement options, rather than due to
failure to appear or safety concerns. DCF does not post bail for youth in their custody
who are detained. Further, when another individual posts bail for youth with DCF
involvement, but a stipulation of “Release to DCF only” is listed, DYS and the entity
posting bail must work with DCF to organize a pickup and DCF must have a placement
for that youth when they are bailed out.

Detention, Pretrial Supervision/Monitoring, or the System Entirely
As in previous JJPAD reports, the Board has found that there are cohorts of youth that can be
diverted away from the Juvenile Court system. In interviews, professionals cited that more
youth could be diverted:
• Pre-arraignment: Many professionals felt there are still too many youth at arraignment
with lower-level underlying offenses who could benefit from diversion away from the
system entirely, rather than keeping them involved in the formal Juvenile Court process.
This is reflected in the data: in FY23, a third (36%, n=1,458) of FY23 arraignments were
for misdemeanors.
• From pretrial supervision/monitoring: As discussed in the Data section of this report, in
recent years the percent of cases in which youth are released on their personal
recognizance has decreased, directly correlating with the increase in the percent of
cases monitored/supervised by probation. Professionals interviewed suggested more
youth could be released without any conditions. Some professionals highlighted cases
for youth who had “Category A” conditions of release set (n = 770, representing 59% of
pretrial cases with conditions of release set) and are assigned to be monitored by the
statewide Pretrial Unit as those that could more frequently be released on their own
recognizance instead. Stakeholders argued that this would help concentrate MPS
resources on cases that require active supervision, including cases diverted from
detention (as discussed, below). Many people suggested MPS should focus resources
during this part of the system on cases in which youth are determined to be a flight risk
or safety risk to a victim or the community.
• From pretrial detention. While Massachusetts has been successful in its effort to limit
pretrial detention, professionals interviewed mentioned there are still cohorts of youth
who could be better served in the community. Individuals highlighted there are youth
who could be diverted from detention who needed intermediate options and more
active case management than the current supervision/monitoring structure of probation
during this time. Specifically, professionals mentioned youth who are detained for a
misdemeanor/lower “grid” level offense (n=353, 46% of detention admissions) as good
candidates for diversion from detention once the necessary community-based options
or supports exists.
Additionally, professionals expressed concerns in interviews that there is an over-representation
of youth with unmet needs in pretrial detention. This is confirmed by the data. In FY23,
78

• More than half of youth detained pretrial had an individualized education plan (IEP),
twice the rate of Massachusetts’ students generally.
• A quarter of youth detained pretrial had previously experienced physical or sexual abuse
or had been sexually exploited.
• About a third of youth detained pretrial had identified feelings of depression/anxiety,
almost twice the rate of Massachusetts’ youth population.
Stakeholders shared what they felt are more effective services than detention or conditions of
release:
• Family programming
• Mentoring programs (with credible messengers and other people with lived experience)
• Behavioral health programming
• Substance use programs
• Recreational programs
• Educational programs
Interviewees differed as to whether these services should be court-mandated and court-
provided, or if participation should be voluntary and the emphasis should be on consistent,
warm handoffs to community-based organizations. Several individuals noted the importance of
community-based supports rather than court-based to make sure services don’t end when legal
processes do.
Others noted that youth have the legal right to refuse to participate in services pretrial – and
that some youth do, even if the adults in their life believe it would be in their best interests
(both for a successful resolution of their legal case as well as for their overall life outcomes) to
participate in treatment. Some cited this as a reason to move toward adjudication in certain
cases rather than divert the youth, as participation in services can be required as part of a
disposition.

Recommendations for Improvement
As this report describes, Massachusetts has, over the past decade-plus, made significant shifts
to limit the use of detention and increase diversion of youth away from the system – a result
this Board applauds. While some of these shifts were a result of a change of statute (most
notably, provisions of the 2018 Criminal Justice Reform Act), many of the positive changes in the
system were the result of changes in practice by individual judges, prosecutors, probation
officers, defense attorneys, clerk magistrates, and police officers.
These shifts in practice represent a change in culture, prompted by training, by an ever-growing
body of research supporting these practices, and by the development of new supervision and
service options that gave practitioners the tools they needed to try a different approach. At the
core, the shifts have been the result of individual practitioners trying a new approach and
seeing, with their own eyes, the positive impacts.
The moment is ripe for a new shift in practice and culture. Increases in the use of pretrial
conditions of release, including more restrictive conditions like GPS and home confinement, are
at least partially a result of the shift away from the use of detention. Yet an increasingly large
body of research, Massachusetts data, and practitioner experience suggest that just as more
critical examination of the use of detention began over a decade ago, a similar examination is
now needed regarding how and when pretrial conditions of release are used.
Similarly, just as the state has put more resources toward expanding diversion options in recent
years, the Commonwealth must also consider ways to expand services and supports during the
pretrial phase for youth who have not been diverted, but who also do not need to be detained.
In doing so, Massachusetts can improve outcomes for youth who become involved with the
justice system – and in the process, protect public safety by reducing the likelihood of future
delinquency.
To help spur this change in practice and culture, the Board offers the following
recommendations to continue the progress made over the past decade-plus and ensure that
our pretrial system promotes equity and positive outcomes for youth defendants, protects
alleged victims and witnesses, and supports the professionals doing this work each day.
In order to achieve these goals, the JJPAD Board recommends Massachusetts:
• Improve how conditions of release are set and re-visited throughout the pretrial
process
• Divert more youth from detention and Juvenile Court involvement by expanding the
range of pretrial supervision and pre-arraignment diversion options
• Support implementation of pretrial reforms and continue to measure the impact
80

Improve How Conditions of Release are Set and Re-visited
Throughout the Pretrial Process
As described in Findings 1 and 2, the Board found that many pretrial conditions are not
developmentally tailored for the individual youth – increasing the likelihood they will violate
those conditions and leading to detentions that could have been avoided. In particular, the
Board is concerned about overuse of “control” mechanisms, most notably GPS and home
confinement, that harm youth without necessarily increasing public safety.
Although there was widespread agreement among individuals interviewed for this report that
pretrial condition-setting is an area of concern, there was less agreement as to why. In
particular, professionals working in the system differed on the extent to which judges should
focus solely on setting conditions that relate to ensuring court appearance and protecting
alleged victims and witnesses at this stage, versus setting conditions that connect youth
defendants to treatment interventions as soon as possible or are otherwise set “for the good of
the youth” (e.g., attend school daily). There was not universal agreement as to which approach
leads to better outcomes.
Guidance in statute and case law is also limited. In 2020, the Supreme Judicial Court held in
Commonwealth v. Norman that pretrial conditions ordered under the bail statute124 must be
narrowly tailored toward ensuring a defendant’s presence at trial and protecting the integrity of
the judicial process. However, under Jake J v. Commonwealth (2000),125 nearly any condition of
release may be set by the judge with the youth’s consent. (The notion of “consent” is, however,
complicated when the alternative is detention – a concept the Supreme Judicial Court has also
recognized.126)
Finally, many stakeholders interviewed for this report noted the impact of fear on the condition-
setting process. No prosecutor or judge wants to be the person to release a youth from
detention or not use GPS or not set a curfew for a youth who goes on to commit a new alleged
offense – and then find their decisions excoriated in the local press.127 Conversely, some
defense attorneys expressed fear that objecting – at all or “too vociferously” – to certain
124 M.G.L Ch.276 Section 58
125 Commonwealth v. J. Jake
126 The “coercive quality of the circumstance in which a defendant seeks to avoid incarceration by obtaining probation on certain
conditions makes principles of waiver and consent generally inapplicable.” Norman, 484 Mass. at 335, quoting Commonwealth
v. Feliz, 481 Mass. 689, 702 (2019).
127 For example, in 2024 the following stories involved individuals during the pretrial phase:

conditions, even if those conditions were clearly setting their client up to fail, could ultimately
lead to worse outcomes for their clients.
These are not easy decisions – and while research findings alone cannot tell professionals what
the “right” decision is for any individual case, they can help point us in the right direction. Just
as a better understanding of the research on the longer-term harms of detention has led
Massachusetts to reduce the use of detention over time, so too can a better understanding of
the longer-term harms of GPS, home confinement, and other conditions that restrict youth
engagement with pro-social activities help inform decision-making in this arena.
The state should not assume every practitioner in the court has the time to keep abreast of all
of the relevant research, however. The juvenile justice system professionals who work in the
field day in and day out deserve evidence-based guidance and state support to help make
informed decisions based on each youth’s case and the alleged victims.
Therefore, the Board recommends that the state provide a greater level of guidance and – as
discussed in Recommendation 7, training – to Juvenile Court practitioners on setting and
revising pretrial conditions of release.
Recommendation 1: Provide More Guidance on Setting Pretrial Conditions of
Release for Youth
While the Trial Court published guidance on this topic in 2016, the JJPAD Board believes the
Juvenile Court should set its own guidance for court processes at this stage, building on the
unique mission of the Juvenile Court.128 Similar to the Juvenile Court’s 2019 guidance on
dispositional and sentencing best practices, and drawing on statute, case law, and the best
available research on topics like adolescent brain development and the negative impacts that
certain conditions can have on youth, the Juvenile Court should provide detailed guidance for
judges. This guidance would aim to assist judges in determining when they should release a
youth on personal recognizance, when to set conditions of release and what those conditions
should be, when to revoke bail or modify conditions, and when to detain a youth pretrial.129
This guidance could take a variety of forms and should be explained and reinforced with regular
training (see Recommendation 7).
Based on the Board’s research, the Juvenile Court should consider including the following
concepts when developing this guidance:
128 Massachusetts Trial Court. (2016). Trial Court Guidelines for Pretrial Conditions of Release. https://www.mass.gov/doc/trial-
court-guidelines-for-pretrial-release/download

82

• Determining whether conditions of release are needed and starting with a
presumption of release on personal recognizance. As this report highlights, data
suggests judges are releasing youth on personal recognizance less and using conditions
of release (particularly those that don’t require active probation supervision) more.
According to numerous stakeholder interviews, many of those youth could, instead, be
released on personal recognizance without negative public safety consequences. One
group that may be appropriate to release on personal recognizance, for example, are
youth released on “Category A” conditions monitored by the state Pretrial Unit. Indeed,
these cases increased 77% since FY21.
• Avoiding the use of restrictive conditions that conflict or prevent participation in a
youth’s current prosocial activities unless necessary given the facts and circumstances
of the case, or in order to permit an alleged victim’s participation in prosocial
programs. Research shows that positive connections and participating in prosocial
activities are vital to youth’s mental health and wellbeing.130 However, many conditions
of release remove youth from their community and any prosocial activities. This loss of
prosocial activities is not only detrimental to a youth’s physical and emotional well-
being, but it also increases their risk of further delinquency.131 When determining
if/when restrictive conditions are necessary for the youth, judges should consider:
Starting with the least restrictive option possible (accounting for the circumstances
o
of the alleged offense and other relevant factors) and making modifications (more or
less restrictions) based on the youth’s behavior (see Recommendation 3 for more
details on this idea).
Setting the most focused restrictions possible with the goal of ensuring alleged
o
victim/witness safety while also avoiding the detrimental impact isolation can have
on a youth’s long-term outcomes.132 For example, a judge could start by imposing a

curfew rather than home confinement. If a youth is unable to follow the curfew
condition, curfew could be limited even further, and then finally, a judge may
choose to impose home confinement.
Only using GPS as an alternative for cases in which a judge would otherwise detain a
o
youth,133 or as a last option before revoking bail and detaining a youth and ensuring
that GPS restrictions are limited to specific exclusion zones rather than being overly
broad.
Avoiding the use of home confinement, restricting the use to situations where there
o
is evidence before the court establishing that a youth presents a flight risk or an
imminent danger (e.g., as determined by MGL c. 276 Section 58A) to the community.
In setting a condition of home confinement, judges should also consider the mental
health impact on the youth, the safety of the youth in their home, and the negative
impact that home confinement can have on their participation in prosocial activities,
and their family dynamics.
• Limiting the number of conditions. As this report details, “less is more” when it comes
to supervising youth, and research shows individualized condition setting is more
effective at reducing recidivism.134 This principle can also apply to conditions set at the
pretrial phase. Therefore, judges should make every effort to only set conditions that
are directly related to the youth’s risk of failing to appear at future court dates and the
safety of any alleged victims and witnesses, rather than a list of conditions that are
“good for youth.” This can help youth be successful and not violate their terms of
release. One way to limit the number of conditions set at this stage is to focus on the
individual facts of the case by relating conditions to the underlying alleged offense.
For example, if a youth is not charged with a drug-related offense and substance use
was not a factor in the underlying offense, drug testing should not be set as a condition.
Judges should also ensure the concerns of alleged victims and witnesses regarding
personal safety are heard and take that input into consideration when setting
conditions.
133 The court may consider modeling guidance off of Illinois law that states GPS should be used when there is no less restrictive
condition that would ensure appearance in court or protect an identifiable person from imminent threat from serious physical
harm. https://www.ilga.gov/legislation/101/HB/PDF/10100HB3653lv.pdf
134 As one study states, “This is because surveillance alone has little to no impact on reoffending; adolescents are unable,
developmentally, to make progress on multiple goals; and standardized approaches don’t address the varying factors that
contribute to youth’s delinquent behavior.” The Council of State Governments. (n.d.). Breaking the Rules: Rethinking Condition
Setting and Enforcement in Juvenile Probation. https://projects.csgjusticecenter.org/breaking-the-rules/
84

The legislature may want to consider revisiting the General Laws to determine whether
there is a need to adopt changes that ensure that conditions set in the Juvenile Court
are developmentally appropriate for youth and are limited to the facts and
circumstances of the underlying case.
• Determining when to use prosocial, treatment, or service-related conditions.
Professionals interviewed for this report varied on when it is helpful to set prosocial,
treatment, or service-related conditions (e.g., drug treatment, behavioral health
assessments, counseling, mentorships, attending community programming, attend
school). Some suggested using these types of conditions when a youth’s needs were
urgent and delaying the service would hurt the youth’s opportunity for success. Others
thought the treatment/service-related conditions should be used to promote positive
youth life outcomes beyond the scope of the legal case. Others thought these conditions
should only be used if related to the underlying offense (e.g., if a youth was alleged of
committing a drug offense, a drug-related counseling condition would be appropriate).
Others felt these types of conditions should not be used at all pretrial, as they may
assume guilt. Research suggests overly broad conditions such as “Obey all school rules”
are difficult for youth to comply with and increase their chances of violating.135
These conditions can typically only be set under G. L. c. 276, Section 87, which means a
youth’s consent is required. Even if that consent is given, however, setting such
conditions may not always be in their long-term best interests. While there are many
considerations to balance, it would be useful for the Juvenile Court to provide guidance
on how judges can determine when a prosocial, treatment, or service-related condition
is the best course of action, and how judges can avoid broad/generalized conditions. In
particular, the Juvenile Court should consider how judges can determine if a youth’s
consent was “freely and voluntarily given…unfettered by coercion, express or
implied.”136
The legislature may consider a review of the data in this report to consider whether
there is a need to revisit G. L. c. 276, Section 87 in order to ensure that there is greater
clarity under the law that offers when, and what type, of service-based conditions are
appropriate and developmentally appropriate so that the onus of consent is not squarely
placed on still-developing youth.
135 Ibid.
136 Commonwealth v. Norman
85

• Judges should clearly put on the record which statute they are tying conditions to, so
youth know what they are consenting to and why, and professionals understand what
pretrial supervision is for in each specific case (i.e., flight risk, public safety risk).137 It
was clear in the interviews that informed this report that court professionals across
roles (prosecutors, defense, judges, and probation officers) are not always consistent in
aligning conditions with statutes. While the Board does not have data to verify this,
several stakeholders referenced situations where judges used Section 87 and Section 58
interchangeably – contra to the holding in Jake J.138
There also may be a role for the legislature to revisit the statutory framework currently
in place to determine whether there is a way to streamline and avoid this type of
confusion.
The Juvenile Court should consider additional tools to support implementation of this guidance
such as developing bench cards and, as outlined in Recommendation 7, training judges.
Recommendation 2: Develop a New “Order of Pretrial Conditions of Release”
Form
To encourage condition setting in accordance with the above-recommended guidance, the
Juvenile Court and MPS should develop a new “Order of Pretrial Conditions of Release” form
specifically for Juvenile Court use.
The current “Order of Pretrial Conditions of Release” form reads at an 11th grade level and is
the same one used in adult court. It is also constructed in a way that sets up a “check list of
conditions.” Stakeholders interviewed for this report suggested that this “check list” format
encourages judges to set a number of conditions quickly, without necessarily pausing to reflect
on the applicability of each condition to each individual case.
The Juvenile Court and MPS should craft a specific order form for its court processes. MPS is
currently undergoing a restructure of the order of conditions for post-disposition supervision.
137 As cited in http://masscases.com/cases/sjc/433/433mass70.html
138 “Where the Juvenile Court intends to set conditions of release, we emphasize the need to be clear on the record that the
juvenile is being released on bail or personal recognizance pursuant to G. L. c. 276, § 58, and that, with his consent and
agreement, he is simultaneously being placed on probation pursuant to § 87. Further, it should be explained to the juvenile that
any agreed-on conditions of probation also constitute the conditions of his release. … Finally, the judge should explain the
consequences of violating any of the agreed-on conditions. We stress that these requirements are matters of substance, not
merely of form. Placing a juvenile on conditions of release under § 87 should be more than -[a]rtful nomenclature,"
Commonwealth v. Taylor, supra at 626, or the reference to one statute rather than another.”
http://masscases.com/cases/sjc/433/433mass70.html
86

The Board is encouraged by this and recommends the pretrial order form also be updated with
the following considerations:
• Placing the box for “Other” conditions set at the top of the form to make it more
prominent. This is to encourage judges to set individualized conditions at this stage and
to limit the “checklist” effect of selecting all conditions on the form. The name of the
category could also be changed – to, for example, “Individualized Conditions.”
• Remove adult-specific conditions to focus on research-supported conditions for youth.
For example, the current form includes “pretrial services” and treatment at Community
Corrections Centers as a condition, which are currently only available for adult
defendants, not youth.
• Clearly indicate which conditions are being set under which statute (Sections 42A, 58,
58A, or 87), especially when conditions are set under multiple statutes. This should also
indicate why a judge sets a condition (i.e., a flight risk vs. victim/witness safety
considerations).
• Make the form accessible at the 5th grade level to match court guidance.139 This revision
can also help ensure youth are able to understand, and therefore abide by, their
conditions.
• Make the form available in multiple languages.
Recommendation 3: Provide Guidance on the Process for Revising Pretrial
Conditions of Release for Youth and Addressing Violations
While pretrial conditions of release can already be revisited when there is a change of
circumstance, the Board heard that this was not happening consistently across the state for all
youth defendants, and that many youth could benefit from more frequent revisiting of
conditions. Based on interviews, there are several reasons why conditions of release may not be
consistently revisited, including resource allocation, attorneys’ strategies, and/or lack of options
to actually modify conditions.
Many professionals interviewed for this report believed that additional guidance from the state
on when and how pretrial conditions should be revisited throughout the life of a case, and in
particular how violations of pretrial conditions should be addressed, would be helpful for
ensuring greater consistency across the state in pretrial proceedings and in promoting
evidence-informed practices.

Forms. https://www.mass.gov/doc/readability-guidelines-for-printed-self-help-materials-and-forms/download
87

The state has already started to do this for post-disposition violations of probation with MPS’
graduated response system, which many stakeholders interviewed for this report pointed to as
a successful and important reform in recent years.140
The Board recommends the Juvenile Court (in collaboration with MPS, DAOs, and CPCS/YAD)
develop a standardized protocol for revisiting conditions of release during the pretrial phase
and addressing violations. The Board recommends the following concepts be included in any
standard protocol:
• A mechanism for incenting compliance/positive behavior: Professionals interviewed
for this report believed that it would be useful to have clear mechanisms for revising
conditions of release in response to youth behaviors, and to be able to communicate
those mechanisms to youth in advance. Research is clear that youth are more motivated
by potential rewards than potential punishments;141 giving youth the opportunity to
“earn their way off of” certain restrictive conditions (e.g. GPS, drug testing) could help
incent positive behavior. Creating recommended, standardized timelines for when these
conditions should be revisited could prompt judges to set review hearings in advance
and/or give defense attorneys clear guidance on when a motion to revisit a condition
would likely be successful.
• Mechanism for adjusting conditions in response to violations without requiring a
motion for revocation: Stakeholders interviewed for this report also noted that
sometimes probation will report that a youth has violated a condition, but there will be
no response from the system. This is likely due to the fact that a DAO does not believe
the violation is significant enough to warrant moving for a revocation. While avoiding
unnecessary revocations is an important goal, this can send mixed messages to a youth
about whether they really have to follow conditions, or not.142 Creating guidelines for
how the system might respond to violations that do not warrant revocation, coupled
with more flexibility in when and how a DAO could motion for reconsideration of
conditions in lieu of requesting a revocation, might allow for more equitable,
predictable, and measured responses to youth behaviors. Such a process may also
140 MPS implemented an administrative hearing process as part of their post-disposition violation process and starting using
incentives to encourage positive behavior. Probation has also started to implement the Carey Guides to assist in case
management, concepts which may be helpful to think about in collaboration with other court stakeholders when developing a
court system response pretrial.

promote stakeholders to consider at the outset whether a condition is important
enough that a violation would always prompt a system response.
Figure 25:
Behavior-Based Conditions of Release Modifications
• Timeframes for revisiting conditions: The protocol should provide guidance on
when/how often conditions should be revisited. This report highlights that the pretrial
phase of Massachusetts’ legal process can last a long time. Conditions of release are set
relatively early in that process. Judges may set conditions that seem appropriate at the
time of arraignment, but these same conditions may not be appropriate some days,
weeks, months, or even years later.
While some temporary modifications can be made by probation without a court
hearing, changing the terms or conditions entirely requires bringing the youth back into
court. The current practice is for attorneys to bring a motion for a change of conditions
based on information that shows a change of circumstance, but there are barriers that
exist to doing so in a timely manner. For example, it requires a youth to plan ahead and
alert their attorney to any predictable change in circumstance and communicate that
with their attorneys. Attorneys then need to file a motion to change the terms, a
prosecutor may need time to respond, and a judge must set a date to convene all
parties for a court hearing.
Time standards should include process points where system practitioners are expected
to discuss adjusting pretrial conditions. For example, the court may want to revisit
conditions shortly after arraignment. Often youth meet their attorney for the first time
at an arraignment, and counsel has a limited amount of information on the youth they
89

are representing, the case, and what conditions a youth can actually abide by. Yet,
judges often need to set conditions at this process point, namely, to protect any alleged
victims/witnesses. If pretrial conditions could be revisited more easily shortly after an
arraignment, this provides defense counsel the opportunity, preferably in partnership
with a social worker, to provide additional information to inform the setting of
conditions.
Additionally, time standards might be tied to specific conditions. For example, when
setting GPS monitoring as a condition of release, judges may want to impose that for a
set number of days, after which a hearing would be scheduled to see if the GPS
conditions needed to be modified. This is the case, for example, in California, which by
law limits the amount of time a youth can be placed on GPS to 30 days, after which a
case is brought back into court to revisit if GPS is still necessary.143
• Processes/expectations for probation input: Professionals interviewed for this report
noted that there are differences from courtroom to courtroom as to whether probation
is consulted in determining conditions to set at this stage, and when in the process that
happens. This difference in practice can contribute to disparities across the state. Any
standard protocol should clearly outline probation’s role in recommending conditions of
release and reporting changes in a youth’s circumstances and behaviors. One way to
streamline this could be for probation to make recommendations shortly after initial
conditions are set at arraignment about the appropriateness of the initial conditions.
(Such a process would likely require MPS to issue standards for how probation officers
should make these recommendations – for example, what information they should
consider.)
• Processes/expectations for victim input: While the Board did not have the opportunity
to interview victim/witness advocates across all DAOs, the Board did hear from other
stakeholders that victims were not consistently given the chance to be heard on what
conditions would be supportive for them during the pretrial phase. Any standard
protocol should clearly outline alleged victims’ rights and how a victim’s requests should
be considered in condition-setting, including any revisitation of conditions throughout
the pretrial process.
• The ability to conduct these hearings virtually. Court practitioners may be reluctant to
bring system stakeholders together to revisit conditions as often as might be useful for a
143 California Assembly Bill No. 2658, CH. 796
90

given case, given the fact that even quick in-person conferences can add up in a system
that already has a backlog of cases.144 Virtual hearings are less of a resource strain and
can encourage revisiting conditions more frequently without interrupting long term case
processes. Courts might consider setting a regular date and time for virtual hearing to
reconsider pretrial conditions. Court officials and defense attorneys should make sure
youth are able to attend these virtual hearings and meet with their attorney. Further,
before relying on virtual hearings, challenges regarding stable internet connections that
can impede a youth’s ability to participate in a hearing should be resolved.

As detailed in Finding 7, despite the positive results of a concerted statewide effort to limit the
number of youth coming into contact with the Juvenile Court process, this Board’s research
suggests there are still cohorts of youth that can be diverted from detention, pretrial
supervision/monitoring, or arraignments generally.
As this report highlights, research supports diverting youth away from the formal justice system
whenever possible. Research suggests diversion can be an effective tool to increase public
safety145 and improve youth outcomes compared to the traditional juvenile justice system.146
For cases that cannot be diverted from the system entirely, diversion from custodial settings
(e.g., pretrial detention, residential commitments) can reduce some potential negative
consequences.147
Additionally, diverting youth away from detention, probation, or the system generally allows the
state to focus on the limited number of youth who require a higher level of supervision during
this time.
144 In some cases, a change to a youth’s conditions might not require a formal virtual hearing. For example, currently, MPS can
adjust certain conditions for short time frames (e.g., to travel for an emergency), which should continue to be practice in those
circumstances.

The Board encourages the development and use of additional “off ramps” at each of these
process points to continue to divert youth away from system involvement and focus state
resources during the pretrial phase on the limited number of youth who need the higher level
of supervision.
Recommendation 4: Create a Well-resourced Continuum of Interventions for
Supervision in the Community During the Pretrial Period
In its research, the Board learned that supervision options during the pretrial phrase are limited.
Youth can be:
1. Monitored by the MPS statewide Pretrial Unit. These cases include conditions set under
“Category A” and are not actively supervised by probation.
2. Supervised by the local probation office, which primarily entails a probation officer
checking in with the youth prior to each court date, regardless of the condition set as
long as it is a “Category B” condition. The only exception is a GPS condition, which is
monitored 24/7. Any violations are issued by the local probation office. Community
supervision or face-to-face meetings with probation officers only take place when a
judge orders those as conditions. These are the same standards for both adult and
juvenile pretrial probation supervision.
3. Detained pretrial in a DYS staff secure or hardware secure facility. In some regions across
the state, DYS can place detained youth in DYS-contracted foster homes and provide
case management for youth placed there. These beds are limited.
These options leave little flexibility in tailoring this part of the system to fit the individual
circumstances of the youth. As numerous professionals interviewed for this report noted, to
those working in the field it can feel sometimes like the options are “diversion or detention”
with nothing in between.
For example, there are limited options (beyond GPS) for youth who may need a higher level of
supervision to address pressing needs or to ensure public safety, but who do not need to be
detained. In the same vein, youth who are released from pretrial detention back into the
community may need a higher level of supervision and/or support to ensure success – and
judges may feel more comfortable releasing a youth from detention prior to disposition if they
knew those supports existed.
Indeed, a review of the available data suggests that there are some youth being held in
detention that could, with the right supports, be safely maintained in the community. For
example, of all detention admissions in FY23:
92

• 46% (n=353) were for youth with underlying lower-level severity offenses, such as
misdemeanor assault and battery
• 27% (n=205) were for youth held on cash bail (as opposed to being held for
dangerousness)
In fact, most youth who are detained are not ultimately committed to DYS. Just 16% (n=120) of
detention admissions in FY23 were for youth who were ultimately committed to DYS for the
underlying case when their case was resolved.
A number of these admissions are likely for youth who do present a flight risk or a threat to a
victim, witness, or community safety. However, many stakeholders interviewed for this report
cited examples of situations where pretrial detention was used for reasons other than
community safety or assuring a youth appeared in court.
Finally, several stakeholders mentioned underlying, potentially unmet needs, driving behavior
that can lead to a violation of probation, bail revocation, and eventual detention admission.
For all these reasons, Board members and numerous stakeholders interviewed for this report
wanted more tools and options to respond to those types of cases as a way to focus
supervision on individual needs while continuing to decrease the number of youth that are
held in a detention facility.
For the state to successfully implement changes to how conditions of release are set and
revisited throughout the pretrial phase, there must be a continuum of supervision and case
management options. In other words, if youth “fail” with their current conditions, the state
needs options to adjust either the supervision levels or conditions.
Similarly, additional service options could help youth who spend some number of days in
detention navigate re-entry and provide more of a “step down” option from a residential
placement back to the community. For example, numerous stakeholders mentioned challenges
with schools re-engaging with youth coming home from detention, and many youth face
educational challenges as a result. Other stakeholders noted youth returning home who face
pressures of gang involvement and who don’t have the supports in place to avoid that or stay
safe themselves.
Some examples of what the state could consider in this continuum include:
• MPS could enhance its internal processes for making voluntary service referrals and
streamline collaboration with referral networks, like the Family Resource Centers, for
youth on their caseload.
93

• MPS and/or EOHHS could offer wraparound supports or additional services for youth
who need a higher level of support during the pretrial period who might otherwise be
detained. Some examples of these services could be:
those procured by DCF to support child wellbeing for youth with open DCF cases
o
as part of their family support and stabilization program;
DPH BSAS programs expanding substance abuse programming for youth pretrial;
o
DMH Children, Youth, and Family services expanding connections to youth in the
o
pretrial process;
DMH Juvenile Court Clinics expanding in-house treatment, bridge therapy, and
o
service referral;
MPS offering additional services for youth pretrial, similar to what is currently
o
offered for adult defendants through Justice Support Centers. JSCs offer
numerous programs pretrial, including cognitive behavioral therapy, employment
counseling, and educational supports such as GED/HiSET and post-secondary
preparation.148
DYS could expand eligibility for and increase the number and type of community-
o
based options for detained youth, including but not limited to DYS contracted
foster home placements.
Some of these options may require additional funding from the legislature to support new
contracts with community-based providers. When considering funding, the Board recommends
including funds to hire additional staff to build capacity. Additionally, funds should be made
available to create ongoing professional development opportunities for that staff, which should
include additional trainings focused on diversity, equity and inclusion, implicit bias, cultural
competency, and cultural humility in addition to the trainings outlined in Recommendation 7. To
avoid duplication of services and promote efficiency, MPS, EOHHS, and the Juvenile Court
should collaborate when re-procuring services and align referrals whenever possible.
Recommendation 5: Improve GPS technology
As detailed in Finding 2, many stakeholders reported technological challenges with the current
GPS units for youth in Massachusetts. Individuals specifically mentioned the immense
difficulties getting youth to 1) remember to charge the device and 2) find time to sit next to the
device to charge it for hours. Interviewees also highlighted the “false alarm” notifications that
went off throughout the day when youth were in approved areas (like their school), but out of
cell phone range.
148 MPS previously offered JRCs for youth but closed these programs due to declines in funding and low utilization at the time.
Of note, this was prior to many of the systems-level changes that have led to an increase in the utilization of pretrial probation
for youth.
94

As referenced in Recommendation 1 of this report, the use of restrictive conditions should be
limited and conditions such as GPS should be used as a last option. However, given that GPS is
increasingly being used as an alternative to detention, and this Board is recommending an
expansion of supervision options during the pretrial phase, the state should improve GPS
technology in order to support effective supervision.
As of this report, MPS recently closed a bid to procure a GPS contract. MPS also reports working
on best practices for GPS supervision. The Board is enthused about both initiatives and
encourages MPS to take the Board’s research and findings into consideration when selecting a
contract, for ongoing contract monitoring, and to inform GPS supervision standards.
Recommendation 6: Divert More Youth Pre-Arraignment by Expanding
Opportunities for State Diversion
In the Board’s 2019 report on community-based interventions for youth involved in the juvenile
justice system, the JJPAD Board found that there were no statewide standards or guidelines in
Massachusetts regarding the use of diversion, and no entity that provided oversight for
diversion practices. 149 That report recommended the creation of a statewide diversion program
to ensure that youth across the Commonwealth had equitable access to high quality, state
funded diversion programming.
-
As a result of that report, with funding allocated by the Legislature in the state budget, the OCA
partnered with DYS to launch the Massachusetts Youth Diversion Program (MYDP), a multiphase
state funded youth diversion initiative that provides high quality, evidence based programming
that can serve as an alternative to arresting youth or prosecuting them through the Juvenile
- - -
Court.
Since 2021, the MYDP has expanded to seven counties, with the goal of expanding statewide. In
2024, UMass published an evaluation of the program and noted its success.150 In its FY25
budget, the Legislature made the MYDP a permanent state service when it transferred the
operating budget to DYS’ line item 4200-0700 as part of DYS’ mandate for evidence-based
delinquency prevention.151
Due to the success of the model, as well as continued inequities in which youth remain in the
Commonwealth’s traditional justice system (i.e., youth of color, youth with unmet needs, youth

in certain counties), the JJPAD Board recommends the Legislature continue to fully fund and
expand this program to cover all counties in the Commonwealth.
In addition to funding the MYDP, the Board recommends the Legislature also expand the list
offenses eligible for judicial diversion.152 Juvenile judicial diversion was created as a result of
the 2018 CJRA153 to keep youth with low level offenses out of the juvenile system. Judicial
diversion gives judges, a neutral party, the opportunity to decide if youth charged with certain
offenses would benefit from a youth’s participation in diversion programming rather than the
formal court process.
Although data is not available yet for all judicially diverted cases, it is available for cases diverted
to the MYDP. For cases referred to the MYDP in the first two years of its existence, judges
represented 48% (n=198) of all referrals, representing an interest in judicial diversion.154 In the
same timeframe, of the judicial cases that were closed, 85% (n=116) of those completed the
program successfully. Since the implementation of judicial diversion, however, the list of eligible
cases has only been updated one time, when the state included sexting-related offenses in the
list of eligible charges.155
Support the Commonwealth’s Capacity to Implement Reforms
and Measure the Impact
As this report highlights, there have been several initiatives, policy reforms, and procedural
changes to the juvenile justice system over the past decade. Many of these shifts represent
improvements based on evidence-based best practices and current research. However, it has
also meant potential unintended consequences and challenges for professionals working in the
system every day.
Changes in policies and procedures must be accompanied by sufficient training to support
culture shift and buy-in from the professionals asked to implement these changes. Similarly, in
some cases additional resources are needed to ensure implementation – and data to track the
impact of changes can help us measure the extent to which we are or are not achieving our

implementation goals. Policies are only as good as the people and systems that implement
them, and reforms without proper implementation support often fail to achieve their intended
impact.
To support the implementation of the other recommendations in this report, the Board
recommends providing training on aspects of the pretrial system for all system practitioners,
increasing court capacity, providing additional supports for case practitioners, and increasing
data availability to continue to inform policy and practice.
Recommendation 7: Require Training on Aspects of the Pretrial Phase across State
Entities and Encourage Cross-Entity Trainings When Possible
Turnover in the judicial system – including turnover driven by the state’s mandatory retirement
age for judges – means that we must have systems in place for constantly ensuring new
practitioners receive training that will help support them in performing their jobs.
A review of the professional background of recently appointed Juvenile Court judges shows that
most have extensive backgrounds in the child welfare system but more limited experience in
delinquency cases. In fact, only half (n=11) of the 22 judges that were appointed to the Juvenile
Court between 2016 and 2023 had experience practicing in the juvenile delinquency system
immediately prior to their nomination.156
This may therefore be a particularly important moment to ensure all Juvenile Court judges have
received training on the best-available research on juvenile delinquency, adolescent brain
development, risk and protective factors, positive youth development, and other factors that
are highly relevant to delinquency-related practice and law. While these trainings are
recommended for delinquency case practices, the fundamental concepts can apply to other
areas of judicial practice including both Care and Protection and Child Requiring Assistance case
practice.
Juvenile justice system stakeholders are often trained on similar topics, but each through their
own agency. To accompany the above-recommended shifts in pretrial processes, the Board
recommends that the Juvenile Court implement a combined judicial system training for judges,
clerks, DAOs, defense counsel, and probation that address the following topics:
• Adolescent development, and how that should inform condition setting for youth, as
highlighted in the research section of this report
156 In order to ascertain the prior experience of judges nominated to the Juvenile Court, the JJPAD reviewed sources from State
House News pertaining to the nomination. These sources contained information such as most recent role and general work
history – but did not provide comprehensive, or complete information on each judge’s professional history. Therefore, the
JJPAD’s assessment of the judge’s prior experience is likely incomplete. A full list of the sources reviewed can be found in
Appendix C.
97

• Setting conditions of release in Juvenile Court in alignment with the guidelines
developed under Recommendation 1. Data related to condition setting and the “pretrial
phase” should also inform training curriculum and discussions.
• Using a Positive Youth Development framework (e.g., involving youth in the process) to
inform condition-setting
By holding joint trainings, the state can ensure clear, consistent communication is provided to all
the relevant practitioners.
Recommendation 8: Increase the Number of Juvenile Court Judges to Reduce the
Pretrial Timeline and Support Reform Implementation
As previously mentioned, one of the challenges with the pretrial process is that it can last a long
time. As Finding 3 explained, cases are extended for a number of reasons, and increases in the
length of time until case resolution can have negative consequences for public safety, the youth
defendant, any alleged victim or witness, and the system generally.
One of the reasons the pretrial phase lasts a long time for some youth is because trials are
regularly scheduled for six or more months out due to judge and courtroom availability. There
are currently five Juvenile Court vacancies, with three more on the horizon due to judges
reaching the mandatory retirement age in the coming months or taking new positions within
the Trial Court. These vacancies have put significant strain on the system, leading to trial delays
and requiring some judges to travel between counties, and even multiple locations in one day,
to provide the necessary coverage. The delays and time pressures could be a contributing factor
in the differences in which the justice system operates county to county or courthouse to
courthouse.157 As mentioned in Finding 3, Juvenile Court judges also hear other non-
delinquency related case matters, which have emergency hearings that can delay proceedings
for other court matters.
Even when all of the vacancies are filled, however, state law caps the number of Juvenile Court
judges at 42 – a number that has only increased once (from 41) since the cap was implemented
in 1906.158 One way the state can address the significant delays in delinquency proceedings
without impacting other cases like child welfare matters is to increase the cap on the number of
Juvenile Court judges. The Board recommends the state increase the cap and the governor’s
office work expeditiously to fill remaining vacancies in the Juvenile Court. This would also
provide an important opportunity to increase diversity on the bench (e.g., race, ethnicity,
gender, LGBTQ+). If increased, the state should also adequately increase and fund other court

98

personnel (e.g., clerks, law clerks, court officers) and facility resources (e.g., courtrooms and
judicial lobbies) to support the increased number of judges.
Reduce Length of Time
If the number of judges increases, the Board recommends the judiciary revisit time
standards.159 While the Juvenile Court currently has time standards for when certain hearings
and trials need to happen, several court stakeholders mentioned these are not consistently
adhered to or are extended for a variety of reasons.160 No data on this is available, however. The
Board recognizes any change to the time standards would have significant consequences to
court practices, state resources, and youth. Therefore, the Board recommends the Juvenile
Court, MPS, CPCS/YAD, MDAA/DAOs, DYS, and OCA convene to address the problem of
extended case lengths and make recommendations for state improvements.161
Recommendation 9: Expand the Availability, and Promote the Use of, Social
Workers in Delinquency Related Cases
While many professionals interact with and may advocate on behalf of youth throughout the
pretrial phase, it is the defense attorney’s job to advocate for their client. The JJPAD Board
heard from a significant number of YAD staff attorneys and bar advocates in stakeholder
interviews. Most defense attorneys argued that their clients would be better served in the
community than in detention or strict restrictive conditions of release. However, many also cited
the long waitlists, dearth of services, and insufficient resources to navigate the service-provider
world themselves as barriers.
While waitlists and service gaps are larger challenges across the human services sector, ensuring
youth have access to effective and well trained “system navigators” can at least somewhat help
improve youth access to services. The Board encourages the continued and expanded use of
social workers by YAD staff and private attorneys (bar advocates). To this end, the Board
recommends the state continue to fund CPCS’s budget to allow social workers who assist
defense counsel in connecting youth clients to appropriate services. These professionals can
support defense attorneys in identifying alternatives to detention or supervision that the court
can consider when making its pretrial determination.
In cases where youth are represented by bar advocates who do not have access to in house

160 Although the COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated the pretrial length of time for cases for a period of time, the Juvenile Court
resumed in person operations in 2021. However, the impact of the pandemic, specifically staff shortages and frequent absences
due to COVID, were ongoing throughout the year. As of 2024, practitioners continued to note concerns with the length of time
to disposition, suggesting this challenge persists for reasons other than the impact of the pandemic on court operations.
161 Other jurisdictions have addressed case length of time through the Juvenile Detention Alternatives Initiative (JDAI).
Massachusetts should explore whether the states’ JDAI has capacity to lead this work here.
99

social workers and who, reportedly, do not universally petition the court for resources to work
with social workers for clients at this stage, the Board encourages them to petition for funds to
hire social workers to support their clients and court case-planning. The Board also encourages
CPCS to continue to provide training and support to bar advocates toward this end. Further, the
Juvenile Court should consider streamlining the petition process (e.g., making the process
administrative rather than an in-person court hearing) for court funds for social workers,
something that is not consistently happening across all courthouses.
Recommendation 10: Increase Data Availability to Support Continuous Quality
Improvement and Data-Informed Policymaking
In recent years, Massachusetts has made significant progress increasing the volume and
complexity of publicly reported data related to the state’s juvenile justice system.162 As a result,
the JJPAD Board is able to report a substantial amount of data across the entire system from the
beginning of the court process through dispositions. Of course, there is still room for
improvement, but this achievement is worth recognition.
As highlighted in the Limitations section of this report, the Board was unable to answer several
research questions with Massachusetts-based data due to data unavailability. Further, the Board
did not have data to inform key themes heard in stakeholder interviews (e.g., How many youth
violate pretrial conditions of release? What conditions are used more frequently?).
As a result, the Board has had to rely on estimated calculations and key stakeholder interviews
while researching this topic. The table below highlights key pretrial research questions and steps
various entities could take to ensure data to answer those questions is available in the future.163
It is the Board’s recommendation that any additional data should be reported annually. As
recommended in the JJPAD Board’s 2022 report on data availability, the state should make sure
there are adequate resources (i.e., additional funding, for staff and reporting infrastructure) to
support state entities in increasing their data reporting.164

163 Entities should also regularly review other states’ data reporting on these topics. At the time of this report other
states were not reporting statewide data yet, but the Board heard of California and Illinois working to improve their
statewide public data reporting on pretrial concepts like flight risk and GPS use, with public data anticipated in the
future.

Conclusion
There have been a significant number of reforms to the Massachusetts’ juvenile justice system
over the past two decades. These reforms have had various intended and unintended impacts
for the pretrial phase of the system specifically. The findings and recommendations in this
report aim to continue to build on the success of these reforms and address challenges that
remain.
The JJPAD Board will monitor implementation of these reforms and continue to research the
topics that emerged during this research that the Board was unable to address in its
recommendations for this project, including:
Use of cash bail: The JJPAD Board will continue to study state alternatives to detention for
vulnerable populations, especially for youth currently held on cash bail.
As documented above, youth detained pretrial as a result of cash bail being set are –
anecdotally—being held for reasons other than flight risk. While the CBI Subcommittee
discussed the possibility of eliminating cash bail, as a result of a growing body of research
documenting its ineffectiveness,165 the Board was not ready to make that recommendation until
the state can safely respond to the needs of the youth currently detained on bail. This includes,
but is not limited to, ensuring there are appropriate DCF placements available for youth.
The JJPAD Board is currently researching the topic of “dually involved youth” (youth involved in
both DYS and DCF) and will be making recommendations for state improvements on this project
in 2025. As part of that work, the group will further investigate why youth involved with DCF
are held on low amounts of cash bail, sometimes as low as $1 and determine what
alternatives to detention exist for this cohort and make recommendations for improvement.
Delinquency prevention and intervention programming: Since the Board’s inception, members
have highlighted a wide array of community-based delinquency prevention and intervention
programs that exist throughout the state. At the same time, members reported the service gaps
(and sometimes service deserts) that exist, and a complex, disparate system that makes it hard
to navigate eligibility, criteria, and effectiveness of these programs for youth in the juvenile
justice system. Furthermore, when quality services do exist, they may not have adequate
funding or resources to serve youth impacted by the state’s juvenile justice system. Board
members have also noted there may be gaps in community-based delinquency prevention and
intervention programs meeting the current level of need for the cohorts of youth that remain in
the state’s juvenile justice system. Members mentioned that individuals arraigned in Juvenile

103

Court today have complex needs and face challenges that cannot be addressed by the current
landscape of community-based programs.
This theme was highlighted again in the group’s initial research questions for the pretrial
project. Specifically, the Board asked, “What community-based interventions or supports need
to exist in order to divert more of this population from detention and/or the justice system
entirely?”
Further, as highlighted throughout this report, victim services are not always considered when
thinking about delinquency prevention/intervention services, despite research showing victims
of violences are more likely to go on to commit violent acts and therefore, services that support
victims are some of the best crime prevention strategies.
Therefore, in order to continue to make informed policy recommendations and decisions, the
Board will study the landscape of community-based delinquency-related prevention and
intervention programs in Massachusetts and make recommendations for funding, expansion,
and strategies to fill landscape gaps.
The state’s commitment to implementing these reforms and the Board’s continued study of
these important topics can ensure the Commonwealth’s juvenile justice system policies and
practices are research-informed, equitable, and impactful.

Table 11: Massachusetts Case Law and its Impact on Pretrial Processes
Case Law Year Summary/Impact on Pretrial
Processes
Commonwealth v. J. Jake 2000 A Juvenile Court judge had
authority under MGL Ch. 276,
Section 87 (see table above),
to impose pretrial probation
with conditions on a juvenile
with his consent for his
release pending trial, and
implicitly had inherent power
to revoke the juvenile's bail
for violation of the
conditions.
Commonwealth v. Brangan 2017 Dictates that a judge must
consider a defendant’s
financial resources in setting
bail and set it only at an
amount that will assure
appearance to court. It also
states that a judge may not
consider a defendant’s
alleged dangerousness in
setting the amount of bail.
Commonwealth v. Norman 2020 Dictates that conditions of
release should only be set to
assure a defendant’s
appearance to court or the
safety of a victim or the
community. The decision also
states that the use of GPS
106

location data can only be
used for the purpose of
enforcing conditions of
release and not general law
enforcement purposes.
Commonwealth v. Preston 2020 Concluded that G. L. c. 276,
Section 58B, does not govern
the revocation of pretrial
probation of a juvenile, and
that to revoke a juvenile's
pretrial probation based on a
new criminal offense, a judge
must find probable cause that
the juvenile committed the
offense.
Commonwealth v. Quigley 2021 Probation conditions that
Q. order compliance with an
executive branch agency (e.g.,
“Comply
with DYS”, “Comply with
DCF”) violate separation of
powers, and therefore,
cannot be used.
There is recent case law that informs the use of GPS as a condition of pretrial release.
Table 12: Massachusetts Case Law and its Impact on GPS Use
Case Law Year Summary
Commonwealth v. 2019 A Superior Court judge found that “GPS
Feliz monitoring's deterrent potential appears linked
primarily to its possible post hoc investigative
use.” However, the Commonwealth did not prove
that the defendant would be likely to violate the
terms of his probation without the deterrent of
GPS. Therefore, the court ruled that the
“government interests do not outweigh the
privacy infringement occasioned by GPS
monitoring.” The judge modified the probation
conditions to not include GPS.
Commonwealth v. 2019 A Superior Court judge denied the defendant's
Johnson pretrial motion to suppress historical GPS
location data recorded from the GPS monitoring
device that had been attached to the defendant
as a condition of his probation. The Judge also
107

found that based on the defendant's criminal
convictions and past probation violations, the
defendant's particular circumstances rendered
GPS monitoring as a condition of his probation
reasonable under the Fourth Amendment to the
United States Constitution.
Commonwealth v. 2020 Dictates that conditions of release should only be
Norman set to assure a defendant’s appearance to court
or the safety of a victim or the community. The
decision also states that the use of GPS location
data can only be used for the purpose of
enforcing conditions of release and not general
law enforcement purposes.
Commonwealth v. 2022 A judge must consider a number of factors when
Roderick deciding whether to order GPS monitoring,
including the Commonwealth's interest in
protecting the public and rehabilitating the
probationer, and the intrusion on the
probationer's privacy.
