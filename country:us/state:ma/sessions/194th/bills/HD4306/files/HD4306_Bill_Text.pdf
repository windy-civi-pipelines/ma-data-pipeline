In the One Hundred and Ninety-Fourth General Court
(2025-2026)
_______________
An Act to reform, dissolve and recreate the housing authorities and end housing choice and
benefit racial discrimination.
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives in General Court assembled, and by the authority
of the same, as follows:
1 End excessive and unnecessary homeliness: Reform and ensure that housing Authority
2 Agencies prioritized and expedited housing or rehousing for the displaced families, elderlyâ€™s and
3 handicap-people with Disabilities, the Federal protective class members.
4 Housing is Human Rights and no one especially the elderlies, chronic disabled people
5 and families with children should be left unhoused, displaced or homeless for many years while
6 the Housing Authority agencies are squandering the state and federal allocated rehousing money
7 by paying their selves huge salaries while people of Massachusetts are suffering from
8 unnecessary homelessness crisis. Housing Authority agencies are fully funded enough by the
9 state and federal from the allocated housing budget money to immediately rehousing displaced
10 people but rather they choose to abuse their powers and to suffer the most vulnerable in our
11 communities. They prefer for people to continue staying homeless unfairly while they enrich
12 each other with the money meant to use to immediately rehouse people. Housing Authority
13 agencies have turn the unfortunate homelessness of people as a beneficial business for them were
1 of 2

14 as long as people are homeless, it is good business for them because their agencies will continues
15 receiving taxpayers' money meant to immediately rehouse people to stop the human suffering of
16 homelessness and use it to enrich their pockets. We need accountability, transparency and
17 reform. We cannot allow the abuse anymore.
