In the One Hundred and Ninety-Fourth General Court
(2025-2026)
_______________
An Act to legislatives to recall and impeach the following Massachusetts State Judges.
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives in General Court assembled, and by the authority
of the same, as follows:
1 Peoples Petition to the legislatives to recall and impeach the following Massachusetts
2 State Judges for violation of our Judicial Rights, Constitutional Civil Rights and Human Rights
3 NOTE: This is just partial list of names, but we will be adding more names as we
4 received it from individuals. If you have names to add please send it to us.
5 We must have judicial accountability in Massachusetts.
6 Our Constitutional Republic is founded upon the idea that government is of the people,
7 by the people and for the people, not above the people. No one serving in elected or appointed
8 office should be above this standard, including those in our judicial branch.
9 Judicial performance evaluations should not be confidential, and only reviewed by a
10 small group of unelected judges. These performance evaluations must be public and available to
11 the Governor's Council, the elected body responsible for vetting and appointing judges, and to
12 elected members of the legislature serving on the Senate and House judiciary committees.

13 This increased transparency on the conduct of life-time appointed judges will provide
14 greater insight into our judicial system.
15 The Governor's Council should be able to conduct open, transparent, and public hearings
16 reviewing judicial performances.
17 No one should be above the law.
18 The Judges listed below have segregated our court houses, practice unethical corruption,
19 obstruction of justice, bias, prejudice, racism, discrimination, hate crime, inhumane tortures,
20 abuse, and cruelty and tainted our judicial system. They are not judges but rather gangsters in
21 black uniform. They have violated our Judicial and Constitutional rights.
22 Recall and impeach the following Judges:
23 1. Judge Gabrielle R. Wolohojian
24 2. Judge Andrew M. D'Angelo
25 3. Judge John Englander
26 4. Judge Joseph M. Ditkoff
