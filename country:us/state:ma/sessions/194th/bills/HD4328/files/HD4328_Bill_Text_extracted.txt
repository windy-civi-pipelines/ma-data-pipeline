In the One Hundred and Ninety-Fourth General Court
(2025-2026)
_______________
An Act empowering students and schools to thrive.
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives in General Court assembled, and by the authority
of the same, as follows:
1 SECTION 1. Said chapter 69 is hereby amended by striking out sections 1J and 1K, as
2 so appearing, and inserting in place thereof the following section:
3 Section 1J. (a) The commissioner of elementary and secondary education shall identify
4 schools for comprehensive support and improvement using a formula developed by the
5 department that complies with the criteria and processes in federal education law; provided that,
6 under this formula, student growth shall be given at least as much weight as student
7 achievement, and provided further that no more than five per cent of all schools statewide shall
8 be designated as comprehensive support and improvement schools at one time.
9 (b) Within 30 days of a school being designated as in need of comprehensive support and
10 improvement, the superintendent of the district shall convene a local stakeholder group of not
11 more than 11 individuals to develop a support and improvement plan for the school. The district
12 should strive to have the group membership represent the racial-ethnic and language diversity of
1 of 9
13 the school. The group shall include: (1) the superintendent, or a designee; (2) a representative
14 from the school committee selected by a majority of school committee members; (3) the
15 president of the local teachers union, or a designee; (4) an administrator from the school, who
16 may be the principal, chosen by the superintendent; (5) two educators (who could be teachers or
17 education support professionals) from the school, chosen by the school’s educators; (6) a parent
18 from the school, chosen by the local parent organization, provided that if the school or district
19 does not have a parent organization or if the organization does not select a parent, the
20 superintendent shall select a volunteer parent of a student from the school; (7) for high schools, a
21 student selected by the students at the school, and for other schools, an individual selected by the
22 superintendent who brings the appropriate grade-level perspective to the group (e.g., a
23 representative from the early childhood or pre-kindergarten sector for an elementary school); (8)
24 an educator or representative from the social services sector with expertise in students’ mental
25 health and social-emotional development, selected jointly by the group; (9) a member
26 representing a community organization, selected jointly by the group; and 10) an individual who
27 has specialized expertise in one or more of the evidence-based programs listed in subsection (c),
28 selected jointly by the group.
29 (c) The local stakeholder group shall develop a support and improvement plan for the
30 school, consistent with federal and state law, a final draft of which shall be submitted to the
31 school committee within 45 days of its first meeting. Consistent with guidelines developed by
32 the department, the group shall: (i) research, identify and analyze the root causes of the school’s
33 challenges; (ii) examine the adequacy of resources and equity in the distribution of those
34 resources, including an assessment of the physical condition of the school building; and (iii)
35 identify and catalog the school’s strengths and assets. The final draft plan submitted to the school
2 of 9
36 committee shall include a guiding vision of learning for the school; goals and objectives; and a
37 description of the evidence-based programs, supports and interventions that the district shall
38 employ to address the root causes of the school’s challenges and capitalize on assets consistent
39 with the guiding vision. Such evidence-based programs, supports and interventions may include:
40 (1) reduced class sizes and student caseloads; (2) small-group instruction and/or one-on-one
41 tutoring; (3) increased opportunity for common planning time for teachers; (4) implementation of
42 a “Community Schools” or “Hub School” model or other strategies for expanding social and
43 wraparound services to support students’ social-emotional and physical health; (5) additional
44 hiring, increased compensation, and/or strategic deployment of school personnel (e.g, coteaching
45 to facilitate inclusion) to support student learning and to retain highly qualified staff; (6)
46 increased or improved professional development, which may include mentoring and induction
47 programs for new teachers, as well as training in trauma-informed and anti-racist best practices
48 that are designed to limit school exclusion and maximize student engagement; (7) the use of
49 effective curriculum materials that are culturally responsive and aligned with the statewide
50 curriculum frameworks; (8) expanded early education and pre-kindergarten programming within
51 the district in consultation or in partnership with community-based organizations; (9)
52 diversifying the educator and administrator workforce; (10) developing additional pathways to
53 strengthen college and career readiness; and (11) any other program determined to be evidence
54 based by the group that addresses root causes of challenges identified in its analysis.
55 (d) The local stakeholder group shall make every effort to reach consensus on the final
56 draft plan and shall submit it to the school committee for review and approval. If consensus
57 cannot be reached, a majority of the group shall submit its final draft plan to the school
58 committee for review and approval. Dissenting members of the group may submit an alternative
3 of 9
59 final draft plan to the school committee for consideration, clearly indicating the areas of dissent.
60 Upon receipt of the final draft plan or plans, the school committee shall hold at least one public
61 hearing, giving at least 30 days’ public notice. The school committee may make modifications to
62 the final draft plan as necessary, consistent with federal and state law, and shall vote on the final
63 draft plan within 30 days of the hearing. The final plan shall be shared publicly and filed with the
64 commissioner. After confirming that the requirements of subsections (b) through (d) were
65 complied with, the commissioner shall approve the final plan.
66 (e) The department shall prioritize comprehensive support and improvement schools for
67 additional funding above and beyond chapter 70 allocations to support the evidence-based
68 programs identified in the final approved plan. Before the local stakeholder group commences its
69 work, the department shall provide the group with an estimate of future Chapter 70 aid for the
70 district and available funds in excess of Chapter 70 aid for the school that shall support the final
71 approved plan.
72 (f) The support and improvement plan shall be in effect for not more than four years, and
73 shall be reviewed annually by the superintendent pursuant to guidelines developed by the
74 department. Such progress reviews shall be shared publicly and filed with the commissioner,
75 who may comment on the reviews.
76 (g) The department shall establish exit criteria for schools in need of comprehensive
77 support and improvement using a formula that complies with federal education law. Upon
78 expiration of the final approved plan, the commissioner shall review the school’s progress and
79 determine, based solely on the exit criteria established by the department, whether: (1) the school
80 is exited from comprehensive support and improvement status; or (2) the status and plan shall
4 of 9
81 continue for up to four additional years. If the commissioner determines that the status and plan
82 shall continue, the local stakeholder group shall be reconvened to revise the final approved plan,
83 consistent with subsections (b) through (d) and subject to approval by the commissioner. If not
84 approved, the commissioner shall return the plan to the group with a directive to add specific
85 evidence-based programs, supports and interventions listed in (1) through (10) of subsection (c).
86 Within 30 days, the group shall submit the plan to the school committee for review and approval.
87 Within 30 days of receipt of the plan from the group, the school committee shall submit the final
88 plan to the commissioner.
89 (h) Upon the expiration of any continued or revised plan, the process in subsection (g)
90 shall be replicated.
91 (i) The school committee of any district with schools which have been deemed
92 underperforming or chronically unperforming shall develop a transition plan for transition to the
93 current section 1J of this act which shall be implemented with transition to the current section
94 within 1 year of the effective date of this act. The transition plan shall be implemented and any
95 school receivership shall end within 1 year of the effective date of this Act. The department shall
96 provide the school committee with the necessary funding and technical assistance to develop and
97 implement the transition plan.
98 (j) The board shall adopt regulations to implement this section, including provisions that
99 allow features of a support and improvement plan to continue for up to two years after a school is
100 exited from comprehensive support and improvement status. The department shall also make
101 every effort to continue additional funding during any transitional period.
5 of 9
102 SECTION 2. The school committee of any district in receivership shall develop a
103 transition plan for ending the receivership and hiring a superintendent. The transition plan shall
104 be implemented and the receivership shall end within 1 year of the effective date of this Act. The
105 department shall provide the school committee with the necessary funding and technical
106 assistance to develop and implement the transition plan.
107 SECTION 3. (a) There shall be a special commission to study and make
108 recommendations for a more authentic and accurate system for assessing students, schools and
109 school districts. The commission shall examine: (i) the requirements of the Every Student
110 Succeeds Act of 2015, codified at 20 U.S.C. § 6301 et. seq., and potential waivers; (ii)
111 alternative assessment and accountability systems in place or being considered nationwide; and

115 Regarding the assessment of students, the special commission shall consider assessments
116 other than conventional methods, including, but not limited to: work samples, projects and

119 biases, and recognize the strengths of all students.
120 Regarding the assessment of schools and districts, the special commission shall consider
121 the inclusion of a broader range of measures, beyond standardized test scores, that align with
122 public values and are less tied to student demography. The commission shall also research best
123 practices for facilitating stakeholder-driven improvement processes in schools identified under
6 of 9
124 federal law as needing comprehensive support, such as the creation of community schools. The
125 commission shall recommend strategies for assessing students, schools and districts that comply
126 with current federal law. The commission also may make recommendations for changes in or
127 waivers from federal law that would facilitate the implementation of effective assessment
128 strategies.
129 (b) The commission shall consist of: 1 member who shall be appointed by the president
130 of the senate, who shall serve as co-chair; 1 member who shall be appointed by the speaker of

1 SECTION 1. Said chapter 69 is hereby amended by striking out sections 1J and 1K, as
2 so appearing, and inserting in place thereof the following section:
3 Section 1J. (a) The commissioner of elementary and secondary education shall identify
4 schools for comprehensive support and improvement using a formula developed by the
5 department that complies with the criteria and processes in federal education law; provided that,
6 under this formula, student growth shall be given at least as much weight as student

9 (b) Within 30 days of a school being designated as in need of comprehensive support and

29 (c) The local stakeholder group shall develop a support and improvement plan for the
30 school, consistent with federal and state law, a final draft of which shall be submitted to the
31 school committee within 45 days of its first meeting. Consistent with guidelines developed by
32 the department, the group shall: (i) research, identify and analyze the root causes of the school’s
33 challenges; (ii) examine the adequacy of resources and equity in the distribution of those

54 based by the group that addresses root causes of challenges identified in its analysis.
