Independent Auditor’s Report
To the Advisory Board of the Greater Attleboro-Taunton Regional Transit Authority
Taunton, Massachusetts
We have audited the accompanying financial statements of the business-type activities of the Greater Attleboro-
Taunton Regional Transit Authority (“the Authority”) as of and for the year ended June 30, 2024, and have issued our
report thereon dated December 31, 2024, which contained an unmodified opinion on those financial statements. We
conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America and the
standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards, issued by the Comptroller
General of the United States.
Our audit was conducted for the purpose of forming an opinion on the basic financial statements of the Authority
taken as a whole. The supplementary information included in the accompanying Schedule of the Attleboro Commuter
Rail Station and Parking Lots’ Statement of Income and Calculation of MBTA Share of Income for the period ended
June 30, 2024 is presented for the purposes of additional analysis and is not a required part of the basic financial
statements. The statement is the responsibility of management and was derived from and relates to the underlying
accounting and other records used to prepare the financial statements. The information has been subjected to the
auditing procedures applied in the audit of the financial statements and certain additional procedures, including
comparing and reconciling such information directly to the underlying accounting and other records used to prepare
the financial statements themselves, and other additional procedures in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States of America. In our opinion, the information is fairly stated in all material respects, in
relation to the financial statements taken as a whole.
This report is intended solely for the information and use of the Advisory Board, management of the Authority and
the MBTA and is not intended to be and should not be used by anyone other than these specified parties.
