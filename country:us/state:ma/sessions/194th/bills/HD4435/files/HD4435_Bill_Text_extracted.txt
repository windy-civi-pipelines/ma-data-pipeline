Annual Report to the Legislature
Excellence, Impact, Stewardship:
How UMass is powering the Commonwealth’s economy and future
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
This year’s edition of the University of Massachusetts’ “Annual Report to the Legislature”
documents how FY2024 has been another solid year for UMass of delivering academic
excellence and powerful economic benefits throughout the Commonwealth, along with diligent
fiscal stewardship throughout the University system and ever-growing financial support for our
more than 73,000 students. Against ever-present fiscal headwinds and the growing demographic
challenges all colleges and universities face, UMass is proud to share the enormous success story
documented in the report that follows.
A few items we would particularly like to call out:
 In the past year, all four of our undergraduate campuses, in Amherst, Boston, Dartmouth,
and Lowell, launched programs assuring free tuition to qualifying students from families
with adjusted gross income of $75,000 or less. The MASSGrant Plus program expansion
approved by the Legislature in FY2024 and signed into law by the Healey-Driscoll
administration was a key driver of UMass’s ability to offer this tremendous benefit to
students with the greatest financial need. Along with the expansion of what we call
“University-generated financial aid” (scholarships, tuition reductions, and work-study
and on-campus job options funded by University revenues) to a record-high $409 million
annually, which UMass continues to grow faster than increases in tuition and fees, we are
leading the nation in championing affordable, high-quality higher education for all our
students.
 UMass witnessed countless examples of academic excellence in 2024, from students,
faculty, and researchers alike. We take particular pride in UMass Chan Medical School
researcher Victor R. Ambros, PhD, being honored with the 2024 Nobel Prize in
Physiology or Medicine. Dr. Ambros was recognized for his co-discovery of microRNA,
the very short, single-stranded RNA molecules that are now understood to play a critical
role in post-transcriptional gene regulation. This is the second time a UMass Chan
researcher has been part of a Nobel-winning team, following Dr. Craig C. Mello’s honors
in 2006. Dr. Ambros and his colleagues are showing how UMass Chan is truly at the
epicenter of a revolution in biomedical research.
 The University of Massachusetts continues to earn national and global recognition for its
academic excellence, impactful research, and contributions to economic development. In the 2025
Times Higher Education (T.H.E.) World University Rankings, UMass surged 39 spots to #84
i
worldwide, ranking #33 among all U.S. institutions and #16 among public universities. UMass
also retained its position as the #1 public university in New England. Additionally, UMass
Amherst achieved its highest-ever rankings, placing #26 among public universities and #58
among all national universities.
 UMass continues to be recognized as a national leader in the quality and rigor of our
financial and operational management. In reaffirming our strong bond rating, S&P Global
Ratings praised the University’s “sound management and governance oversight, with
comprehensive long-term strategic plans.” Moody’s lauded our “excellent strategic
positioning that incorporates disciplined fiscal oversight” and our “excellent and growing
research enterprise.”
 A key engine for our financial success is UMass’s Enterprise Risk Management (ERM)
program, which continues to win national acclaim. The ERM platform continuously
monitors more than 30 areas of financial and reputational risk to the University, with the
impact of declining enrollment, information security, and facilities and deferred
maintenance at the top of the current list. The program informs and guides all of our
financial accountability activities and risk-mitigation strategies, providing transparency
and shared understanding of risk across the system at both leadership and operational
levels. In 2024, the UMass ERM program was awarded the Public Risk Management
Association (PRIMA) Outstanding Achievement in Enterprise Risk Management Award
and, for a third year, was selected as the ERM “Best of Conference” at the University
Risk Management & Insurance Association national conference.
 In the last year, UMass took a small–but significant and successful–step towards offering
an applicant-friendly, system-wide admissions sharing process. Through close
coordination among the Amherst, Dartmouth, and Lowell campuses, Amherst shared with
the two other campuses a list of promising applicants who nonetheless were not wholly
qualified for admission to the flagship campus. Applying their own criteria, such as
omitting applicants for already-oversubscribed programs, UMass Dartmouth and UMass
Lowell made admissions offers to several hundred of the UMass Amherst applicants. This
led to a total of 23 students enrolling at UMass Dartmouth and 16 at UMass Lowell—all
students who likely never would have joined the UMass system. While these total
numbers are, at this stage, modest, we consider this last year’s admissions pilot a
critically important “proof of concept” of the large opportunity to provide UMass system
admissions offers to students not accepted by UMass Amherst. We are excited to continue
refining and expanding this program in order to ensure that the UMass system as a whole
succeeds in retaining more and more of the students who may fall short of meeting the
high admissions standards of the system flagship.
These and the many other success stories documented in this report underscore how valuable and
important it is for the Commonwealth to invest in UMass and how much UMass achieves and
produces for the Commonwealth. Expanding the Commonwealth’s Supporting Urgent
Community College Equity through Student Services (SUCCESS) program to cover UMass
students as well as those attending state and community colleges will ensure thousands of
Massachusetts young people get the wraparound services that can help them maximize their
success at UMass and go on to be our future business, community, and civic leaders. UMass will
ii
also be able to put to excellent use all available funding from the Commonwealth to our RISE
Capital Program (Resources for Infrastructure, Sustainability & Equity) to address our nearly $5
billion in systemwide renovation and upgrade needs for our physical plant and tremendous
opportunities to decarbonize and reduce the climate impacts of aging and energy-intensive
buildings.
As we look ahead, we recognize that there are challenging times ahead for all of higher
education. As with all of state government, costs continue to rise, and revenue sources remain
strained and stretched.
What this report shows, along with the achievements and successes of our 73,000 students and
28,000 faculty and staff every day, is that UMass has the people, systems, and financial acumen
to take on and address these challenges while delivering world-class academic experiences for
students and extraordinary economic returns from the Commonwealth’s continued investment in
the University.

and access.
 To highlight the University’s significant investment;

UMass is committed to access and affordability
$409 million: Annual financial aid On a per student basis University-
generated by UMass tuition generated aid has grown almost 3X
pricing/free aid strategy, up 82% as fast as net tuition and fee
over the past decade revenue since 2020
79% of University-generated aid $19,713 average annual net price at
goes to in state students, well UMass is just 2/3rds of the average
above their 71% share of total Massachusetts private institution price
enrollment
Depending on campus, 24% to UMass strategy has succeeded in
50% of in state undergraduates, holding average student debt at
or ~14k students, receive Pell graduation relatively flat for a decade

FAFSA Simplification Implementation Delays
 In 2020, the FAFSA (Free Application for Federal Student Aid) Simplification Act was adopted by the
federal government to streamline the common form utilized to determine financial need for
students and families and created a new measure of determining a student’s ability to pay for
college
 The rollout of the new, simplified forms has experienced delays and glitches; students unable to
complete the form creates delays in the financial aid awarding process
 The federal Department of Education is withholding FAFSA records from schools until technological
developments are completed – delaying the awarding of financial aid for students
 Additional delays related to adjustments to financial need calculations means that campuses may
not be receiving student information until late March
 UMass financial aid offices will process financial aid packages to students as soon as practicable
given the ongoing challenges of this implementation, but these delays will have an impact to the
traditional admissions timeline for new freshmen/transfer students
• Boston, Dartmouth and Lowell have extended the enrollment deposit deadline to June 1st
58
Understanding the components of financial aid
University-generated aid is primarily awarded to students as grants, scholarships, and credits.
Free Financial Aid
 Waivers/Credits – targeted and need-based discounts that directly reduce a student’s bill
 Grants/Scholarships – financial aid to students which does not have to be repaid
 UMass-generated aid ($409M) includes institutional financial need-based programs and merit
aid such as Chancellor’s Scholarships awarded based on strong academic achievement and
personal achievement
 Federal aid ($95M) such as Federal Pell Grants awarded based on financial need
 State aid ($79M) such as MASSGrant Plus awarded based on financial need
Student
Employment and
Work Study
 On- or off-campus jobs to earn money to pay for school
59
SPARC – Financial Aid

• Data available by college and
academic department detailing
financial aid by funding sources and
type of aid
(scholarships/grants/waivers/loans/

Salaries and Fringe
127
Salaries and Payroll Defined
 Salaries/Payroll expenses are shown by both fiscal year and calendar year.
• Generally, salary and fringe expense is shown by fiscal year
• The breakdown of base pay, performance incentive pay, and other types of pay are shown by
calendar year
• When shown by Fiscal Year, the title will be blue. When shown by Calendar Year, the title will
be green.
 Why show both?
• Showing certain payroll expenses by calendar year allows for easy comparison using publicly
available tools such as CTHRU.
• Additionally, Calendar Year is the typical way in which employees and the public think about
payroll – as tax documents like W2’s are calculated January – December.
 Staff type is presented based upon federally-designated categories reported across campuses and
other universities and is consistent with other reports generated by the University.
128
Overview of State-Mandated Fringe Benefit Rate
The fringe rate assessed to UMass is based on total payroll cost and does not reflect actual
costs incurred by UMass.
 Nearly all UMass employees are State employees and are afforded both state
health insurance and retirement benefits.
 The cost of these benefits are assessed to the University using a methodology
and fringe rate set by the Commonwealth - the FY24 rate (45.31%) has increased
by almost 64% since FY2014.
 The entire state appropriation (line item 7100-0200 = $753M) is used to fund
payroll at UMass. The related fringe expense for these employees is picked up
by the State.
 However, the state only covers 43% the University's total payroll costs (49% with
its share of fringe) leaving UMass to cover the rest from its own resources –
primarily tuition and fees.

Fiscal Year 2024 vs. Calendar Year 2024
Showing both fiscal year and calendar year views of payroll data presents the most
complete and accurate display of UMass payroll.
Why the difference?
Fiscal Year 2024 Salaries:
 The six-month difference between fiscal year end
$1.9 billion
and calendar year end creates variation
 Calendar year payroll excludes certain categories to
conform with CTHRU – the Commonwealth’s
Calendar Year 2024 Salaries:

$1.7 billion
• As an example, all student payroll is excluded
from CTHRU for student privacy

Calendar Year 2024 Payroll by Type of Pay

performance incentive pay.

Total Compensation Including Performance Incentive Pay
Performance payments are thoroughly vetted using industry and corporate best practices
and total only one quarter of one percent of total compensation.
 UMass works with national consulting firms (Sibson, Korn Ferry, and Pearl Meyer) that
specialize in higher education and medical centers to review executive compensation
and how it impacts goal of attracting and retaining executive leadership.
 Specific and measureable results are required for any incentive to be earned; putting
compensation at risk if goals are not met.
 In 2024, 63% of the performance incentive payments were earned at the UMass Chan
Medical School consistent with the total compensation reward program.

Deferred Maintenance - Annual Investment
Establishing Definitions and Setting Targets Based on Industry Best Practice
Keep Up:
 Defined as the annual investment needed to ensure buildings perform properly and reach their useful lives.
 Includes small operating projects (<$20k) and preventive/proactive maintenance funded from a recurring funding
source.
Catch Up:
 Defined as major capital projects funded by one-time funds such as reserves, bond proceeds, and State resources
(also typically bond funds).
 Large backlog that requires funding over a specified time period.
Annual Investment Targets:
 Keep Up - defined as the annual minimum investment required to prevent the deferred maintenance backlog
from growing. Gordian calculates the target by discounting the total cost necessary to replace each building
component at the completion of its useful life.
 Catch Up – defined as the annual investment needed to eliminate the backlog over a specified time period. This
target is still to be determined.

State Investment Required to Meet Goals
Campuses engaged in energy and sustainability master planning efforts and coordinating
with State
 Funding: will require state investment to decarbonize campus energy infrastructure at
the pace required to meet DOER’s updated goals
• For example, electrifying campus heating and cooling systems to meet emission goals requires
investments in new utility infrastructure on all 5 campuses – estimated cost $1 billion+
 Infrastructure: concerns on the ability of the ISO New England Grid to keep pace with
demand while ensuring the reliability and resiliency for business continuity
 Deferred Maintenance Needs: significant backlog impacts energy efficiency; requires a
partnership for funding to address building envelope and energy efficiency projects to
reduce energy demand and address long-standing capital needs

Overview
 The initiative to grow online is driven by the Board of Trustees’ vision and imperative
 A partnership for robust online programming ensures the University can achieve its
mission by filling the skills gap, expanding access to education and recovering students
already lost to out-of-state, online providers
 Experts agree that the only way to succeed online is be a national player operating in
multiple states
 After an exhaustive process UMass identified Brandman University as an ideal partner
and filed a change of control with the Department of Education to establish UMass

Commonwealth’s Workforce Education Gap
The Commonwealth must educate more of its population at the post-secondary level to remain a
competitive destination for business and provide equal opportunities for all residents.
SKILLS GAP NEED FOR EDUCATION OPTIONS STUDENT DEMAND
Employers are increasingly Greater numbers of workers An estimated one million adult learners

219
Strong Competition in Online Education
 Increased competition from online providers. SNHU’s online programs now enroll over 100k – 2x-3x
the number of Massachusetts residents served by the University – and SNHU is the provider of
choice for adult learners in the state
 UMass has a unique opportunity in a growing market that complements, and even protects, the
existing institutions of public higher education here in Massachusetts
 UMass is also competing against peers with established programs for working adults –University of
Maryland, Purdue University, Penn State and Arizona State
 UMass will face accelerating declines in enrollment, which may result in painful contraction
 Massachusetts employers will face an increasingly serious challenge in finding the talent to keep
their companies prosperous
220
Benefits to the Commonwealth
 Increase access for working adults and underserved populations
 Establish the Commonwealth as a leader in online teaching and learning
 Establish additional pathways to more affordable four-year degrees via the MassTransfer
program
 Increase the Commonwealth’s capacity for workforce upskilling and retraining with in-
demand skills and rapid response to employer workforce shortages with degrees plus a
variety of micro-credentials
 Defend against out-of-state providers recruiting students away from in-state colleges and
universities already under duress from demographic shifts
 Ensure the sustainability of UMass, the Commonwealth’s largest postsecondary educator,
third-largest research enterprise and third-largest employer
221
Activity to Date
Background:
 Transfer of control effective September 2021 (FY22)
 Separate 501(c)3 in California with a separate independent Board
 For the first time in FY22, included in the University’s Annual Financial Report
 Pro forma approved by the Board (April 2020) anticipated shortfalls in the 3-4 year ramp up period
FY24 Update:
 Enrollment: positive growth year over year with a focus on new student growth
 Operations: staff and faculty headcounts are being managed consistent with enrollment projections;
other savings anticipated including capital
Forecast:
 Embrace remote learning and work, expand access to meet student needs and capacity, expand
workforce relevant credentials (degrees as well as alternative credentials) through employer
partnerships, establish national and international reach

• Fund Increased Utility Cost (rate inflation, new buildings, offset by energy savings projects)
• Fund Increased Debt Service/Depreciation and Deferred Maintenance
 Continual process improvement yields annual campus-wide 1-2% base budget pullbacks
which seed strategic initiative pools
 For the Common Good. Develop a plan to sufficiently resource strategic plan initiatives

Amherst: Investing in Keep Up
 Depreciation is a non-cash expense
which spreads the cost of a capital
asset over its useful life
 Depreciation is included as an
operating expense in the operating
budget
 Principal payments are a cash
expense which are not included in
the operating budget
 The annual difference between
depreciation and principal provides
budgeted resources to invest in the
preventative maintenance of assets

spreads the cost of a capital asset over its
useful life
 Depreciation is included as an operating
expense in the operating budget
 Principal payments are a cash expense
which are not included in the operating
budget

NERB Financial Updates
 The New Education and Research Building (NERB) opened June 7, 2024 and is occupied by the Horae Gene
Therapy Center; the Departments of Neurology and Neurobiology, including the Wellstone Center; the Program
of Molecular Medicine; and a section of the Department of Psychiatry.
 The NERB is also home to UMass Chan researcher Victor Ambros, PhD, who shared the 2024 Nobel Prize in
Physiology or Medicine for his co-discovery of microRNA.
 The timing of faculty recruiting has been updated to reflect current hiring. While the building was not opened
until June 24, these faculty were housed elsewhere on campus.
 Fiscal 2025 will be the first full year of occupancy for the NERB.
 Operations and maintenance expense ramps up over the 5-year period; however, costs may be affected going
forward depending on utility rates and CPI.
 Projections have been updated to reflect the additional revenue from the higher projected tuition and fee rate
increases assumed in the 5-Year plan (FY26 4.75%, FY27 4.5%, FY28 4.25%, FY29 and FY30 4.0%)

 Depreciation is a non-cash expense which
spreads the cost of a capital asset over its
useful life
 Depreciation is included as an operating
expense in the operating budget
 Principal payments are a cash expense
which are not included in the operating
budget
 The annual difference between
depreciation and principal provides
budgeted resources to invest in the
preventative maintenance of assets

2 UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT 2024
Letter from the President
I am pleased to present the annual financial report of the University of Massachusetts. This
report details the university’s financial position and major activities over the past year and
emphasizes the work that we have done to ensure active fiscal management and accountability
across the five-campus system.
This is a pivotal period in higher education, as public and private colleges and universities
across the country are facing significant demographic challenges, largely due to a declining
high school graduate population, which is especially pronounced in the Northeast. In spite of
this, I am pleased to report that the University of Massachusetts has continued to maintain
strong enrollment, and the university is positioned to come through stronger because of our
collective work over the past years.
The university’s scope of activities is broad and impactful. UMass educates more than 73,000
students and produces nearly 19,000 graduates each year, with 660,000 alumni in total,
including 360,000 in Massachusetts. The UMass community provides 700,000 community
service hours a year and serves as a critical talent pipeline in service of the state’s long-term
competitiveness. With a $4.3 billion budget and $8.3 billion in annual economic impact,
UMass is an enormous contributor to the state’s economy, supporting many external jobs and
construction activities that generate a ripple effect in every corner of the Commonwealth.
Our research funding, which now stands at a record-high $826 million, is focused on key
Massachusetts industries like the life sciences, data science, climate science, advanced
manufacturing, robotics, and more.
The national reputation of our UMass campuses in Amherst, Boston, Dartmouth, and Lowell
continues to rise, including in annual rankings from reputable sources like U.S. News & World
Report. UMass Chan Medical School was recently named the best medical school in the
Northeast for primary care and ranks among the top 15 in the country.
Our work continues to be focused on providing affordability, accessibility, and a world-
class education for all our students. To accomplish these goals, the university has employed
innovative strategies ranging from improved data analytics to procurement reforms resulting
in reduced costs to UMass.
These efforts are only possible because of the overall effectiveness of our operations and our
financial strength, which have distinguished UMass as a well-managed university.
The university’s endowment has reached an all-time-high of $1.5 billion, thanks to improved
fundraising efforts on our campuses, significant philanthropic gifts, and exceptional
stewardship and investment management. We continue to receive external recognition for the
strength of our management, with strong bond ratings from Moody’s, Fitch and S&P Global.
Our Enterprise Risk Management program also received a national award from the Public Risk
Management Association.
A strong, stable and thriving UMass is critical to the success of our state, our economy, and
our quality of life, and I am proud of what our administration, faculty and staff have worked on
this past fiscal year to help advance these goals. As the largest contributor of college graduates
entering the state’s workforce, UMass is building the future of the Commonwealth — and
together we must remain steadfast in our mission of making Massachusetts better, stronger,
and more competitive through our mission of education, research and service.
Sincerely,
Martin T. Meehan
President

Section 162:
1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Reporting Entity
The University of Massachusetts (University or UMass), a federal land grant institution, is governed by Massachusetts General
Laws Chapter 75. Its Board of Trustees (Board or Trustees) consists of nineteen voting members and three non-voting members.
The voting members consist of two full-time students, the Secretary of Education of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts
(Commonwealth) and sixteen members appointed by the governor. The non-voting members consist of student representatives
who may only participate in open meetings of the full Board of Trustees.
The University is a business-type activity of the Commonwealth. The financial balances and activities included in these financial
statements are, therefore, also included in the Commonwealth’s annual comprehensive financial report.
The financial statements of the University include the campuses of Amherst, Boston, Dartmouth, Lowell, Chan Medical School
(UMass Chan), and the President’s Office of the University, University of Massachusetts Global (UMG), Worcester City Campus
Corporation (WCCC), University of Massachusetts Lowell Applied Research Corporation (UMLARC), the University of Massachusetts
Amherst Foundation (UMass Amherst Foundation), University of Massachusetts Medical School Foundation (UMMSF) as well as
the University of Massachusetts Building Authority (Building Authority).
The Building Authority is a public instrumentality of the Commonwealth created by Chapter 773 of the Acts of 1960 (referred to
as the Enabling Act), whose purpose is to provide dormitories, dining commons, and other buildings and structures for use by
the University. The UMLARC is a legally separate 501(c)(3) non-profit corporation which promotes efficient and effective applied
research and development by entering into grants, contracts, and other contractual mechanisms for services. UMG is a California
based not-for-profit institution of higher learning and a legally separate 501(c)(3) organization. WCCC is a tax-exempt 501(c)
(3) organization founded to support research and real property activities for the University. The UMass Amherst Foundation
supports private fundraising on behalf of the faculty and students of the Amherst campus. The UMMSF supports fundraising
and philanthropic activities of the UMass Chan. These component units are blended in the financial statements of the University
because of the significance and exclusivity of their financial relationships with the University. Refer to Note 18 for condensed
financial information for these blended component units.
The University also includes the financial information of the University’s discretely presented component units, the University of
Massachusetts Foundation, Inc. (UMF) and the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth Foundation, Inc. (UMDF). In these financial
statements, UMF and UMDF are collectively known as the Foundations. These are tax-exempt organizations founded to foster and
promote the growth, progress and general welfare of the University.
28 UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT 2024
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Basis of Presentation
The accompanying financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles
(GAAP) as prescribed by the Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB) using the economic resources measurement
focus and the accrual basis of accounting. The Foundations’ financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting
and reporting requirements prescribed by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB). As such, certain revenue recognition
criteria and presentation features are different from GASB revenue recognition criteria and presentation features. No modifications
have been made to the Foundations’ financial information in the University’s financial reporting entity for these differences.
The University’s activities are considered to be a single business-type activity and accordingly, are reported in a single column in
the financial statements. Business-type activities are those that are financed in whole or in part by funds received from external
parties for goods or services.
On the Statements of Revenues, Expenses and Changes in Net Position, the University’s operating activities consist of tuition and
fees, grants and contracts, sales and services, auxiliary enterprise and other operating revenues. Other operating revenues include
sales and services provided by UMass Chan under its ForHealth Consulting program (ForHealth). ForHealth provides consulting
and services in health care financing, administration and policy to federal, state and local agencies and not-for-profit health and
policy organizations. Also included in other operating revenues are payments received by UMass Chan for educational services it
provides to its clinical affiliate, UMass Memorial Medical Center (UMass Memorial).
Operating expenses include, among other items, payroll, fringe benefits, utilities, supplies and services, depreciation, and
amortization. Nonoperating revenues or expenses are those in which the University receives or gives value without directly giving
or receiving equal value, such as State and Federal appropriations, Federal Pell grants, private gifts, investment income and
interest expense.
Revenues for exchange transactions are recognized when earned and expenses are recognized when incurred. Restricted grant
revenue is recognized only when all eligibility requirements have been met. The University applies restricted net assets first when
an expense or outlay is incurred for purposes for which both restricted and unrestricted net assets are available.
The University receives unconditional promises to give through private donations or pledges from corporations, foundations,
alumni and other supporters of the University. Revenue is recognized when a pledge is received and all eligibility requirements,
including time and purpose requirements, are met. Endowment pledges are not recorded until paid because the inherent time
restriction has not been met until the funds are able to be invested in perpetuity.
Net Position
Net position is classified into the following categories:
• Net investment in capital assets: Capital assets, at historical cost or fair market value on the date of gift, net of accumulated
depreciation and outstanding principal balances of debt attributable to the acquisition, construction or improvement of
those assets.
• Restricted nonexpendable: Resources subject to externally imposed stipulations that they be maintained permanently by
the University.
• Restricted expendable: Resources whose use by the University is subject to externally imposed stipulations. Such assets
include restricted grants and contracts, the accumulated net gains/losses on true endowment funds, as well as restricted
funds loaned to students, restricted gifts and endowment income, and other similar restricted funds.
• Unrestricted: The net position that is not subject to externally imposed restrictions governing their use. The University’s
unrestricted net position may be designated for specific purposes by management or the Board of Trustees. Substantially all
of the University’s unrestricted net position is designated to support academic and research initiatives or programs, auxiliary
enterprises, quasi-endowments, or commitments to capital construction projects. Note 16 describes these designations
in more detail.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents consist primarily of demand deposit accounts, savings accounts and money market accounts with an
original maturity date of three months or less.
UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT 2024 29
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Massachusetts Municipal Depository Trust
The University is authorized to invest in the Massachusetts Municipal Depository Trust (“MMDT”), a pooled money market-like
fund, established under Massachusetts General Laws, Chapter 29, Section 38A. MMDT is an external investment pool that meets
the criteria to report its holdings at amortized cost. As such, the University reports its position in MMDT at amortized cost which
approximates the net asset value of $1.00 (one dollar) per share. MMDT has a maturity of less than one year and is not rated.
Accounts Receivable, Net
Accounts receivable consist of receivables for tuition and fees, grants and contracts, student loans, pledges and ForHealth related
activities. The University establishes an allowance for accounts receivable based on management’s expectation regarding the
collection of the receivables and the University’s historical experience for collections.
Investments
Investments are reported at fair value. Short-term investments consist of deposits with original maturities of less than one year
and are available for current use. Securities received as gifts are recorded at estimated fair value at the date of the gift. Investment
return includes dividends, interest income, unrealized gains and losses, and realized gains and losses, which are determined on a
specific identification basis.
30 UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT 2024
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Endowment
UMF maintains and administers the University’s endowment assets and other long-term investments. UMF utilizes the pooled
investment concept, whereby all invested funds are included in one investment pool unless otherwise required by the donor.
Pooled investment funds receive an annual distribution based on the endowment fund’s average market value for the preceding
twelve quarters on a one-year lag. Only quarters with funds on deposit are included in the average. In addition, a prudence rule
is utilized, limiting spending from a particular endowment fund to be no lower than 93% of its carrying value. The spending rate
approved for the years ended June 30, 2024 and 2023 was 4%.
Capital Assets
Capital assets (excluding intangible right-to-use lease and subscription assets) are stated at cost on the date of acquisition or, in
the case of gifts, fair value upon date of donation. Construction in progress is stated at cost, which includes direct construction
costs and other expenditures related to construction. All construction costs related to projects which are not yet completed
are presented as construction in progress until such time as the projects are completed and placed in operation. Repairs and
maintenance costs are expensed as incurred, whereas major improvements that extend the estimated useful lives of the assets
are capitalized as additions to capital assets. The University does not capitalize works of art, historical treasures, or library books.
The University capitalizes equipment with useful lives greater than one year and acquisition costs greater than or equal to $5,000.
Capital construction occurs when estimated costs reach $25,000. Projects under $25,000 are considered to be maintenance and
repairs and they are expensed as incurred. The University computes depreciation using the straight-line method over the asset’s
useful life and applies a half-year convention in the year the asset is acquired or placed in service. Land is not depreciated.
Table 1 presents the range of useful lives for the University’s depreciable assets:
TABLE 1 – Depreciable Assets
Depreciable asset category Useful life
Land improvements 20 years
Buildings 12–65 years
Infrastructure 50 years
Building improvements 3–20 years
Equipment, furniture and IT infrastructure 3–15 years
Software 5 years
Newly Implemented Accounting Standards
In April 2022, GASB issued GASB Statement No. 99, Omnibus 2022. This standard establishes or amends accounting and financial
requirements for specific issues including, but not limited to, financial guarantees, derivative guarantees, public private partnerships

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Leasing
The University determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception. The University has leases under which it is obligated as a lessee
and leases for which it is a lessor. The University is a lessee for various noncancellable real estate leases. In addition, the University
is a lessor of various leases of buildings, office space and ground leases.
Short-term Leases — For leases arrangements with a maximum possible term of 12 months or less at commencement, the
University recognizes expense based on the provisions of the lease contract.
Lease Arrangements Other Than Short-Term — For all other leases, (i.e. those that are not short- term), the University
recognizes a lease liability, and an intangible right-to-use lease asset.
For leases, where the University is a lessor, the University recognizes a lease receivable and a deferred inflow of resources.
Measurement of Lease Amounts —
• Lessee: At lease commencement, the University initially measures the lease liability at the present value of payments expected
to be made during the lease term. Subsequently, the lease liability is reduced by the principal portion of lease payments made.
The lease asset is initially measured as the initial amount of the lease liability, less lease payments made at or before the
lease commencement date, plus any initial direct costs ancillary to placing the underlying asset into service, less any lease
incentives received at or before the lease commencement date. Subsequently, the lease asset is amortized into depreciation
and amortization expense on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lease term or the useful life of the underlying asset.
If the University is reasonably certain of exercising a purchase option contained in a lease, the lease asset will be amortized
over the useful life of the underlying asset.
• Lessor: At lease commencement, the University initially measures the lease receivable at the present value of payments
expected to be received during the lease term. Subsequently, the lease receivable is reduced by the principal portion of lease
payments made. The deferred inflows of resources are initially measured as the initial amount of the lease receivable plus any
payments received at or before the commencement of the lease term that relate to future periods. Subsequently, the deferred
inflows of resources are amortized into lease revenue on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lease term or the useful
life of the underlying lease receivable.
Key Estimates and Judgments — Key estimates and judgments include how the University determines (1) the discount rate used
to calculate the present value of the expected lease payments, (2) lease term, and (3) lease payments.
When available, the University will use the interest rate explicitly or implicitly stated in the lease contract. If the rate is not provided
within the contract, the University will use its incremental borrowing rate (IBR), based on the University’s applicable bond rates.
The University’s IBR for leases is based on the rate of interest it would need to pay if it issued general obligation bonds to borrow
an amount equal to the lease payments, under similar terms, as of the lease commencement or amendment dates.
The lease includes the noncancellable period of the lease plus any additional periods covered by either a University or lessor
unilateral option to (1) extend for which it is reasonably certain to be exercised, or (2) terminate for which it is reasonably certain
not to be exercised. Periods in which both the University and the lessor/vendor have an option to terminate (or if both parties have
to agree to extend) are excluded from the lease term.
Payments are evaluated by the University to determine if they should be included in the measurement of the lease liabilities,
including those payments that require a determination of whether they are reasonably certain of being made, such as purchase
options, payments for termination penalties, and other payments.
Remeasurement of Lease Amounts — The University monitors changes in circumstances that may require remeasurement of
a lease. When certain changes occur that are expected to significantly affect the amount of the lease liability or lease receivable,
the liability or receivable is remeasured, and a corresponding adjustment is made to the lease asset (for lessee arrangements) or
deferred inflows of resources (for lessor arrangements).
Presentation in Statements of Net Position — Lease assets are reported with capital assets and lease liabilities are reported
within current and non-current liabilities in the statement of net position. Lease receivables are reported with current and non-
current assets and deferred inflows of resources in the Statements of Net Position.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Subscription-Based Liabilities
The University determines if an arrangement is a subscription-based information technology arrangement (SBITA) at inception
and recognizes a corresponding liability. Right-to-use SBITA assets largely consist of system-wide IT arrangements and upon
identification of a SBITA, the University recognizes a subscription-based liability and an intangible right-to-use subscription asset.
Measurement of Subscription-Based Liabilities — At SBITA commencement, the University initially measures the subscription-
based liability at the present value of payments expected to be made during the SBITA term. Subsequently, the subscription-based
liability is reduced by the principal portion of payments made. The subscription asset is initially measured as the initial amount of
the liability, less payments made at or before the SBITA commencement date, plus any initial direct costs ancillary to placing the
underlying asset into service, less any lease incentives received at or before the lease commencement date. Subsequently, the
SBITA asset is amortized into depreciation and amortization expense on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lease term or
the useful life of the underlying asset.
Key Estimates and Judgments — Key estimates and judgments include how the University determines (1) the discount rate
used to calculate the present value of the expected subscription payments, (2) subscription term, and (3) subscription payments.
When available, the University will use the interest rate explicitly or implicitly stated in the SBITA contract. If the rate is not provided
within the contract, the University will use its incremental borrowing rate (IBR), based on the University’s applicable bond rates.
The University’s IBR for SBITA agreements is based on the rate of interest it would need to pay if it issued general obligation bonds
to borrow an amount equal to the SBITA payments, under similar terms, as of the SBITA commencement or amendment dates.
Presentation in Statements of Net Position — SBITA assets are reported with capital assets and subscription based liabilities
are reported within current and non-current liabilities in the Statements of Net Position.

Deferred Outflows and Inflows of Resources
The University accounts for certain transactions that result in the consumption or acquisition of resources in one period that are
applicable to future periods as deferred outflows and deferred inflows, respectively, to distinguish them from assets and liabilities.
Deferred outflows of resources increase net position, similar to assets and deferred inflows of resources decrease net position,
similar to liabilities.
The components of deferred outflows and inflows of resources as of June 30, 2024 and 2023 ($ in thousands) are presented in

Compensated Absences
Employees earn the right to be compensated during absences for annual vacation leave and sick leave. Upon retirement,
termination, or death, certain employees are compensated for unused sick and vacation leave, subject to certain limitations, at
their current rate of pay. Within the Statements of Net Position, a liability is recorded for vacation and sick leave benefits earned
as of the fiscal year-end. The recorded liability is classified as current and noncurrent on the Statements of Net Position based on
the amount estimated to be paid to eligible employees in one year and beyond one year, respectively.
Unearned Revenue and Advances
Unearned revenue consists of amounts billed or received in advance of the University providing goods or services. Unearned
revenue is subsequently earned as qualifying expenses are incurred.
Advances include funds advanced to the University by the U.S. government under the Federal Perkins Loan Program (the Program).
Under federal law, the authority for colleges and universities to make new loans under the Program ended on September 30, 2017,
and final distributions were permitted through June 30, 2018. The University’s Statements of Net Position include both the notes
receivable from students and the related refundable liability to the Federal government.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Tuition and Fees, Net of Scholarship Allowances
Student tuition and fees, housing, dining, and other similar auxiliary revenues are reported net of any related scholarships and
fellowships applied to student accounts.
Grants and Contracts
The University receives grants and contracts for scholarships as well as research and other activities including medical service
reimbursements from federal and state government agencies. The University records revenue at the point all eligibility requirements
(e.g. allowable costs are incurred) are met.
The University records the recovery of indirect costs applicable to research programs and other activities which provide for the
full or partial reimbursement of such costs, as revenue. Recovery of indirect costs for the years ended June 30, 2024 and 2023 was
$180.9 million and $170.8 million, respectively, and is a component of grants and contracts revenue on the Statements of Revenues,
Expenses, and Changes in Net Position.
Auxiliary Enterprises, Net of Discount
An auxiliary enterprise is an activity that exists to furnish a service to students, faculty or staff acting in a personal capacity, and
that charges a fee for the use of goods and services. Any amount of excess undesignated aid (aid remaining after applicable tuition
and fee charges have been covered) would be applied first to auxiliary charges as a discount, then recorded as an expense.
Fringe Benefits for Current Employees and Postemployment Obligations
The University participates in the Commonwealth’s fringe benefit programs, including active employee and postemployment
health insurance, unemployment compensation, pension, and workers’ compensation benefits. Health insurance and pension
costs for active employees and retirees are paid through a fringe benefit rate charged to the University by the Commonwealth.
Workers’ compensation costs are assessed separately based on actual University experience.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial
statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from
these estimates. The most significant areas that require management estimates relate to valuation of certain investments and
derivative instruments, useful lives and related depreciation of capital assets, and accruals for pension and other postemployment
related benefits.
During FY2024, the University switched from a method that estimated and allocated scholarship allowances to a method that
directly determines discounts by student, by term. The new methodology applies discounts against auxiliary which was not done
historically. This change was applied prospectively for the year ending June 30, 2024 and had no impact on the University’s change
in net position.
Income Tax Status
The University is exempt from Federal and state income tax under the doctrine of intergovernmental tax immunity. The University
qualifies as a public charity eligible to receive charitable contributions under Section 170(b)(1)(A)(v) of the Internal Revenue Code,
as amended (the Code).
The University and its component units are required to assess uncertain tax positions and have determined that there were no
such positions that are material to the financial statements as of June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

Reclassifications
Certain reclassifications were made in the prior year to conform to current year presentation.

Section 163:
2. Cash Held by State Treasurer
Accounts payable, accrued salaries and outlays for capital projects funded by state-appropriated funds totaled $45.3 million and
$42.1 million at June 30, 2024 and June 30, 2023. The University has recorded a comparable amount of cash held by the State
Treasurer for the benefit of the University, which will be subsequently utilized to pay for allowable expenditures. The cash is held
in the State Treasurer’s pooled cash account. The Commonwealth requires all bank deposits in excess of insurance coverage by
the FDIC to be collateralized with a perfected pledge of eligible collateral. Eligible collateral must be pledged in an amount equal
to 102% of the amount of the deposits that exceed FDIC insurance. Sufficient collateral to cover total Commonwealth deposits in
excess of the FDIC insured amount must be pledged and held in safekeeping by a custodian that is approved by and under the
control of the Commonwealth Treasurer and Receiver - General.

Section 164:
3. Deposits with Bond Trustees
Deposits with bond trustees primarily consist of unspent bond proceeds, amounts held for the future payment of debt service on
such borrowings, and designated funds from the University’s pool loan program.
At June 30, 2024 and 2023, deposits with bond trustees are presented in Table 4 ($ in thousands):

Total deposits with bond trustees $ 446,844 $ 358,287
At June 30, 2024 and 2023, amounts restricted by bond trust agreements for capital projects and other purposes were $425.1
million and $339.3 million, respectively.
Custodial Credit Risk — The custodial credit risk for deposits is the risk that, in the event of the failure of a depository financial
institution, a government will not be able to recover deposits or will not be able to recover collateral securities that are in
the possession of an outside party. The custodial credit risk for investments is the risk that, in the event of the failure of the
counterparty to a transaction, a government will not be able to recover the value of investment or collateral securities that are in
the possession of an outside party. As of June 30, 2024 and 2023, the bank balances of uninsured deposits totaled $12.5 million
and $7.0 million, respectively.
Interest Rate Risk — Interest rate risk is the extent that changes in interest rates relevant to debt investments will adversely
affect the fair value of those investments. These investments include certain short-term cash equivalents, various long-term items,
and restricted assets by maturity in years. The University minimizes the risk of the fair value of securities falling due to changes
in market interest rates by ensuring securities have effective maturities of less than a year. MMDT and permitted money market
accounts have effective maturities of less than one year, thereby limiting the interest rate risk.
Credit Risk — Credit risk is the risk that an issuer of an investment will not fulfill its obligation to the holder of the investment.
The risk is measured by the assignment of a rating by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization. MMDT and permitted
money market accounts are not rated.

Pooled Investments — Fund I represents the endowment funds and University operating cash held at UMF. The endowment
funds include both donor-restricted endowments and quasi-endowments. The investment horizon for this portfolio is 5 to 10 years.
Short-Term Pool represents a portion of the operating cash balances of the University that have been transferred to UMF for
investment purposes only. This portfolio has a high degree of liquidity. The asset allocation is 25% U.S. equities and 75% short-
term corporate bonds. The University treasurer has the authority to request the return of funds at any time to meet the operating
needs of the University.
In addition to Foundation Agency funds, the Foundations’ assets also include investments not reported within the University’s

Custodial Credit Risk — Investment securities are exposed to custodial credit risk if they are uninsured or not registered in the
name of the University and are held by either the counterparty or the counterparty’s trust department or agent but not in the
University’s name.
The carrying amounts of cash balances with uninsured or uncollateralized deposits were $6.1 million and $5.3 million, at June 30,
2024 and 2023, respectively.
The University held non-money market investments with a fair market value of $1.7 billion and $1.5 billion at June 30, 2024 and
2023, respectively. In the event of negligence due to the University’s custodian and/or investment manager(s), it is expected that
the investment balances would be fully recovered. However, these amounts are subject to both interest rate risk and credit risk.
Concentration of Credit Risk — As of June 30, 2024 and 2023, there is no concentration of investments from one issuer equal
to or greater than 5% of the portfolio. Investments issued or guaranteed by the U.S. government, as well as investments in mutual
funds and other pooled investments are excluded from consideration when evaluating concentration risk.
Credit Risk — The University’s Investment Policy and Guidelines Statement allows each portfolio manager full discretion within
the parameters of the investment guidelines specific to that manager. Nationally recognized statistical rating organizations, such
as Standards & Poor’s (S&P) assign credit ratings to security issues and issuers that indicate a measure of potential credit risk
to investors.

40 UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT 2024
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Fair Value Measurement — Fair value represents the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability
in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The University categorizes these assets and
liabilities measured at fair value using a three-tiered hierarchy based on the valuation methodologies employed. The hierarchy is
defined as follows:
Level 1 — Inputs to the valuation methodology are unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets
that are available at the measurement date.
Level 2 — Inputs to the valuation methodology include:
- Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets;
- Quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets;
- Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability;
- Inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means.
Level 3 — Inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement. Unobservable
inputs reflect the University’s own assumptions about the inputs market participants would use in pricing the asset or
liability (including assumption about risk). Unobservable inputs are developed based on the best information available in the
circumstances and may include the University’s own data.
When available, quoted prices are used to determine fair value. When quoted prices in active markets are available, investments
are classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. The University’s Level 1 investments primarily consist of investments in U.S.
Treasury obligations, equity securities, and mutual funds. When quoted prices in active markets are not available, fair values are
based on evaluated prices received from the University’s investment custodian in conjunction with a third-party service provider
and are reported within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. The inputs for Level 2 include, but are not limited to, pricing models
such as benchmarking yields, reported trades, broker-dealer quotes, issuer spreads and benchmarking securities, among others.
The University’s Level 2 investments primarily consist of investments in U.S. government and agency obligations, asset-backed
securities, and corporate debt securities that did not trade on the University’s fiscal year end date.
UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT 2024 41
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
As a practical expedient to estimate the fair value of the University’s interests, certain investments in commingled funds and
limited partnerships are reported at the net asset value (NAV) determined by the fund managers. Because these investments are
not readily marketable, their estimated fair values may differ from the values that would have been assigned had a ready market
for such investments existed, and such differences could be material. As of June 30, 2024 and 2023, the University had no plans or
intentions to sell such investments at amounts different from NAV.

8. Business Acquisition
Effective September 1, 2021, the University acquired Brandman University in exchange for $139.3 million and the assumption of
all Brandman’s existing liabilities totaling $59.2 million. The acquisition included all of the assets of Brandman University totaling
$150.7 million.
The transaction resulted in deferred outflows of resources of $47.8 million as of the acquisition date. The deferred outflows of
resources are being amortized over a 10-year period. As of June 30, 2024 and 2023 there were $35.9 and $40.7 million, respectively
of deferred outflows of resources remaining associated with the acquisition.

Section 170:
9. Public‒Private Partnerships and Leases
The University has entered into three Public-Private Partnerships (PPP), one of which meets the definition of a service concession
arrangement (SCA). The remaining two PPPs do not meet the definition of an SCA.
PPPs Meeting the Definition of an SCA
On July 7, 2022, the University entered into an SCA with Mass Ave Housing Partners LLC (Project Company), to carry out the design,
construction, financing, operation, management, and maintenance of a portion of the Student Housing Project on the Amherst
campus consisting of approximately 600 beds of undergraduate apartment-style housing and approximately 200 beds of graduate
student apartment-style housing and related infrastructure, including parking. The Project Company will manage, maintain, and
operate the Student Housing Facilities and be entitled to all user fees associated with the project as defined, for a term of 65-years.
At the end of the arrangement, operation of the Student Housing Project will be transferred to the University. The accumulated
cost of construction of the Student Housing Project was $245.8 million. In accordance with GASB Statement No. 94, Public-Private
and Public-Public Partnerships and Availability Payment Arrangements, the University recorded an asset and corresponding deferred
inflow for the cost of the Student Housing Project when the related asset was placed into service in January 2024.
In accordance with SCA agreements, the University received from the Project Company a lump-sum payment of $20.0 million,
which is included in other noncurrent liabilities in the accompanying financial statements. The payment gets amortized over the
term of the agreement.
PPPs Not Meeting the Definition of an SCA
On November 8, 2016, the University entered into an agreement with Provident Commonwealth Educational Resources, Inc. (PCER),
a Massachusetts not-for-profit corporation to construct and operate for 40 years a 1,082-bed student housing facility at its Boston
campus (Boston Project). The Boston Project reverts to the University in 2056.
The Boston Project was financed with $130.1 million of revenue bonds issued on October 26, 2016 (Series 2016 Bonds) by
the Massachusetts Development Finance Agency (MassDevelopment) pursuant to a Loan and Trust Agreement between
MassDevelopment and PCER. Neither the Authority, University nor Boston campus have pledged revenues to secure the payment
of the Series 2016 bonds or have any obligation with respect to payment of the Series 2016 bonds.
On November 14, 2018, the University entered into an agreement with Provident Commonwealth Educational Resources II, Inc.
(PCER II), a Massachusetts not-for-profit corporation to construct and operate for 45 years a 1,210-bed student housing facility at
its Dartmouth campus (Dartmouth Project). The Dartmouth Project reverts to the University in 2064.
The Dartmouth Project was financed with $132.2 million of revenue bonds issued on November 14, 2018 (Series 2018 Bonds)
by the Massachusetts Development Finance Agency (MassDevelopment) pursuant to a Loan and Trust Agreement between
MassDevelopment and PCER II. Neither the Authority, University nor Dartmouth campus have pledged revenues to secure the
payment of the Series 2018 bonds or have any obligation with respect to payment of the Series 2018 bonds.
Management evaluated the applicability of relevant GASB guidance against the underlying Boston and Dartmouth Project
agreements and indentures and has concluded that the associated debt should not be recognized on the financial statements of
the University.
In accordance with GASB Statement No. 94, PPP’s that do not meet the definition of an SCA are recorded based upon the operators’
(PCER and PCER II) estimated carrying value of the underlying PPP assets as of the expected date of transfer in ownership to
UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT 2024 47
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
the University. As of June 30, 2024 and 2023, the estimated carrying value of the assets upon ownership transfer for the Boston
Project (2056) and the Dartmouth Project (2064) were deemed immaterial and therefore no amounts have been recorded in the
accompanying financial statements.
Ground Leases
Pursuant to the Boston and Dartmouth Project PPP agreements, the University entered into the following ground leases. For
the Boston Project, commencing January 1, 2019, and continuing for a term of 40 years, the annual rental amount payable to the
University is $1.0 million. For the Dartmouth Project, commencing January 1, 2021, and continuing for a term of 45 years, the rental
amount payable to the University is $0.6 million, increasing by 3% every five years.
As of June 30, 2024 and 2023 the University has current receivables past due of $4.5 million and $3.9 million, respectively, related
to the Boston and Dartmouth ground leases.
Direct Financing Lease
On October 27, 2009, the University entered into an agreement to lease its facility located on Morrissey Boulevard in Dorchester,
Massachusetts (the Facility) to the Edward M. Kennedy Institute for the United States Senate (EMKI), a charitable corporation
registered in the District of Columbia. The lease agreement provides for an initial term of ninety-nine years commencing in October
2009, and thereafter, at the option of EMKI, may be extended for two additional ninety-nine-year periods.
EMKI has an option to purchase the Facility for one dollar at any time after the earlier of: (i) payment of no less than 51% or
(ii) defeasement of the original amount of the associated revenue bonds. The University has right of first refusal in the event EMKI
decides to sell or otherwise dispose of the ownership of the Facility.
The project was financed with $74.4 million of revenue bonds. Rent is equal to the debt service on the outstanding bonds and
payable semiannually through fiscal year 2043.
48 UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT 2024
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
At June 30, 2024 and 2023, the University recorded gross lease receivable of approximately $88.9 million and $91.5 million,
respectively, related to the EMKI lease. As of June 30, 2024 and 2023, the University recorded unearned interest income of
approximately $21.5 million and $23.7 million, respectively, related to the EMKI lease. The University presents the unearned
interest income associated with the EMKI lease as other current liabilities of approximately $2.2 million and $2.2 million and other
noncurrent liabilities of approximately $19.3 million and $21.5 million as of June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
For both years ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, the University recognized $2.2 million of interest income related to its EMKI direct
financing lease.
Lessee Leases and Subscriptions
The University is a lessee for various noncancellable real estate leases.
The University has executed long-term leases with the Commonwealth, acting by and through the Trustees, covering the land on
which facilities owned by the Building Authority are located on the University’s campuses. These leases call for nominal annual
payments to the Commonwealth. Certain of these leases renew automatically for subsequent five- or ten-year periods unless the
Building Authority notifies the University that it does not wish to renew. Other leases require the Building Authority to notify the
University of its desire to renew. As of June 30, 2024, all leases with the Commonwealth were in good standing and any leases
requiring action by the Building Authority during the year to facilitate their renewals were properly renewed.
As provided in the Enabling Act, each of the above-referenced leases also terminates when the Building Authority no longer has
any bonds outstanding, at which time all Building Authority property becomes the property of the Commonwealth.
In addition, the University has entered into SBITA’s for various information technology agreements and are identified as
subscriptions within tables 18 and 19.
Tables 18 and 19 present a summary of right of use asset activity during the years ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

Section 174:
13. Benefit Plans
Defined Benefit Plan
The Massachusetts State Employees’ Retirement System (MSERS) is a public employee retirement system (PERS) that administers a
cost-sharing multi-employer defined benefit plan covering substantially all employees of the Commonwealth including University
employees.
MSERS provides retirement, disability, survivor and death benefits to members and their beneficiaries. Massachusetts General
Laws (MGL) establishes uniform benefit and contribution requirements for all contributory PERS. These requirements provide for
superannuation retirement allowance benefits up to a maximum of 80% of a member’s highest three-year to five-year average
annual rate of regular compensation depending on the date of hire. Benefit payments are based upon a member’s age, length of
creditable service, and group creditable service, and group classification. The authority for amending these provisions rests with
the Legislature.
56 UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT 2024
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The MSERS’ funding policies were established by Chapter 32 of MGL. The Legislature has the authority to amend these policies.
The annuity portion of the MSERS retirement allowance is funded by employees, who contribute a percentage of their regular
compensation. Costs of administering the plan are funded out of plan assets.
Member contributions for MSERS vary depending on the most recent date of membership, as shown in Table 30:
TABLE 30 – Membership Contributions
Hire date % of Compensation
Prior to 1975 5% of regular compensation
1975–1983 7% of regular compensation
1984–6/30/1996 8% of regular compensation
7/1/1996–present 9% of regular compensation except for State Police which is 12% of regular compensation
1979–present An additional 2% of regular compensation in excess of $30,000
In addition, members within this group who join the system on or after April 2, 2012 will have their withholding rate reduced to 6%
after achieving 30 years of creditable service.
The University makes contributions on behalf of the employees through a fringe benefit charge assessed by the Commonwealth.
The fringe benefit charge amounted to $220.7 million and $185.1 million for the years ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
Annual covered payroll was 77.7% and 76.6% of annual total payroll for the University for the years ended June 30, 2024 and
2023, respectively.
Pension Liabilities, Pension Expense, and Deferred Outflows of Resources
and Deferred Inflows of Resources Related to Pensions
The net pension liability as of June 30, 2024 was determined based on a measurement date of June 30, 2023 from an actuarial
valuation as of January 1, 2023 rolled forward to June 30, 2023. The net pension liability measured as of June 30, 2023 was
determined based on a measurement date of June 30, 2022 from an actuarial valuation as of January 1, 2022 rolled forward to
June 30, 2022. There are no significant changes known which would impact the total pension liability between the measurement
date and the reporting date, other than typical plan experience.
At June 30, 2024 and 2023, the University reported a liability of $384.4 million and $444.8 million, respectively, for its proportionate
share of MSERS’s net pension liability, respectively. The University’s proportion of the net pension liability was based on a
projection of the University’s long-term share of contributions to the pension plan relative to the total projected contributions of
all participating entities, as actuarially determined. The University’s proportion of the pension plan at measurement dates of June
30, 2023 and 2022 was 2.6% and 3.2%, respectively.
For the fiscal years ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, the University recognized net pension expense of $21.4 million and $28.1 million,
respectively.
The University reported its proportionate share of MSERS’s deferred outflows of resources and deferred inflows of resources

Investment Allocation
Investment assets of MSERS are with the Commonwealth’s Pension Reserves Investment Trust (PRIT) Fund. The long-term expected
rate of return on pension plan investments was determined using a building-block method in which best-estimate ranges of
expected future rates of return are developed for each major asset class. These ranges are combined to produce the long-term
expected rate of return by weighting the expected future rates of return by the target asset allocation percentage.
Best estimates of geometric rates of return for each major asset class included in the PRIT Fund’s target asset allocation as of June
30, 2023 and 2022 are summarized in Tables 35 and 36:

Discount Rate
The discount rate used to measure the total pension liability was 7.00% for both June 30, 2023 and 2022. The projection of cash
flows used to determine the discount rate assumed that plan member contributions will be made at the current contribution rates
and the Commonwealth’s contributions will be made at rates equal to the difference between actuarially determined contribution
rates and the member rates. Based on those assumptions, the net position was projected to be available to make all projected
future benefit payments of current plan members. Therefore, the long-term expected rate of return on pension plan investments
was applied to all periods of projected benefit payments to determine the total pension liability.

Defined Contribution Plan
Non-vested faculty and certain other employees of the University can opt out of MSERS and participate in a defined contribution
plan, the Optional Retirement Plan (ORP), administered by the Commonwealth’s Department of Higher Education. As of June
30, 2024 and 2023, there were 2,316 and 2,255 participants in the ORP, respectively. Employees contribute at the same rate as
members in MSERS and the Commonwealth matches 5.0% of employee contributions, minus certain expenses such as cost of
insurances and administrative expenses for a net matching contribution of 4.3%. The Commonwealth contributed $10.9 million
and $9.6 million in FY2024 and FY2023, respectively. University employees contributed $25.8 million and $23.1 million in 2024 and
2023, respectively.
The MSERS and ORP retirement contributions of employees who become members of MSERS or ORP after January 1, 2011 are
subject to a state compensation limit. Effective January 1, 2011, the University established a defined contribution plan, the University
of Massachusetts 401(a) Retirement Gap Plan (Gap Plan). Employees with MSERS or ORP membership dates after January 1, 2011
are eligible to participate in the Gap Plan. Eligible employees begin participation in the Gap Plan when their regular compensation
exceeds the state compensation limit in effect for the plan year, at which point their contributions to MSERS or ORP are required to
stop for the remainder of the plan year. Employee contributions to the Gap Plan are mandatory and at the same rate as MSERS and
ORP. The University contributes 5% of employee compensation exceeding 64% of the Compensation Limit up to the Compensation

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Limit. The Compensation limits for FY2024 and FY2023 were $345,000 and $330,000, respectively. As of June 30, 2024 and 2023,
the plan assets of the Gap Plan were $14.4 million and $10.2 million, respectively.
In addition, UMG offers a defined contribution retirement plan. Employees working at least 20 hours a week are eligible to
participate in the plan after 90 days of employment. UMG contributes 3% of each employee’s eligible annual salary, as defined
by the plan. Eligible employees may contribute up to 6% of their eligible salary and UMG matches their contributions. UMG’s total
contribution to the plan was $2.5 million and $3.1 million for FY2024 and FY2023, respectively.
Other component units may opt to offer defined contribution retirement plans. These are not material in relation to the University
as a whole and detailed plan information are therefore not presented.

Section 177:
14. Other Postemployment Benefits
The Commonwealth administers the State Retirees’ Benefit Trust (SRBT), a single employer defined Postemployment Benefits
Other Than Pensions (OPEB) Plan (the Plan). Benefits are managed by the Group Insurance Commission (GIC) and investments are
managed by the Commonwealth’s Pension Reserves Investment Management Board (PRIM).
Benefits Provided
Under Chapter 32A of the MGL the Commonwealth is required to provide certain health care and life insurance benefits for retired
employees of the Commonwealth. Substantially all of the Commonwealth’s employees may become eligible for these benefits if
they reach retirement age while working for the Commonwealth. Eligible retirees are required to contribute a specified percentage
of the health care/benefit costs, which are comparable to contributions required from employees.
Employer and employee contribution rates are set in MGL. The Commonwealth recognizes its share of the costs on an actuarial
basis. As of June 30, 2024 and 2023, the retirees’ share of premium costs is between 10%–20%, depending on the date of hire.
OPEB Liabilities, OPEB Expense, and Deferred Outflows of Resources and
Deferred Inflows of Resources Related to OPEB
The total OPEB liability as of June 30, 2024 was determined based on a measurement date of June 30, 2023 from an actuarial
valuation as of January 1, 2023 rolled forward to June 30, 2023. The total OPEB liability as of June 30, 2023 was determined based
on a measurement date of June 30, 2022 from an actuarial valuation as of January 1, 2022 rolled forward to June 30, 2022. There
are no significant changes known which would impact the total OPEB liability between the measurement date and the reporting
date, other than typical plan experience.
As of June 30, 2024 and 2023, the University reported a liability of $408.9 million and $559.8 million, respectively, for its
proportionate share of the OPEB liability. The University’s proportion of the OPEB liability was based on a projection of the
University’s long-term share of contributions to the OPEB plan relative to the total projected contributions of all participating
entities, actuarially determined. The University’s proportion of the OPEB plan at measurement dates of June 30, 2023 and 2022
was 2.88% and 4.19%, respectively.
UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT 2024 61

Discount Rate
The discount rates used to measure the total OPEB liability as of June 30, 2024 and 2023 were 4.34% and 4.30%, respectively. These
rates were based on a blend of the Bond Buyer Index rates of 3.65% and 3.54%, respectively, as of the measurement dates June 30,
2023 and 2022 and the long term rate of return on Plan investments of 7.00%. The plan’s fiduciary net position was not projected
to be available to make all projected future benefit payments for current plan members. Based on the stated assumptions and the
projection of cash flows, the Plan’s Fiduciary Net Position and future contributions were not sufficient to finance the future benefit
payments of the current plan members. Therefore, the long-term expected rate of return on SRBT investments was applied to
projected benefit payments through year 2042 and the municipal bond rate was applied to all remaining future years to determine
the total OPEB liability.

Section 180:
17. Commitments and Contingencies
In June 2019, the University entered into an agreement to lease property located at 200 Mount Vernon Street in Dorchester,
Massachusetts to an unrelated party (the Developer). The Developer plans to develop a mixed-use opportunity at the site. Under
the terms of the agreement, the Developer, subject to certain contingencies, may enter into a 99-year ground lease for an initial
fixed rent upfront payment of up to $235.0 million, with a minimum payment of $192.5 million. It is an ongoing transaction to be
negotiated on terms acceptable to the University while the parties agree to a closing date. At June 30, 2024, the University held
$26.4 million as a fully nonrefundable deposit. Subsequent to the year end, an additional $0.3 million was released to the University
as a nonrefundable deposit. The University has the ability to terminate the agreement subject to the terms of the agreement.
The University has outstanding purchase commitments with contractors for the construction of certain facilities as of June 30, 2024
and 2023 of $179.4 million and $193.1 million, respectively.
As of June 30, 2024 and 2023, the Authority had a working capital deficiency of $77.4 million and $125.9 million, respectively. As
stated in the various contracts between the Authority and the University, the University is required to provide necessary funding
to the Authority to meet its obligations through June 30, 2025 and beyond.
From time to time, the University is involved in routine litigation that arises in the ordinary course of business. There are no
significant legal proceedings to which the University is a party for which management believes the ultimate outcome would have
a material adverse effect on the University’s financial position.

72 UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT 2024
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The UMass Amherst Foundation, UMass Medical School Foundation and the UMLARC are not material in relation to the other
blended component units, nor the University as a whole, and therefore not presented in the above condensed information.

Section 182:
19. Discretely Presented Component Units
As described in Note 1, UMF and UMDF are discretely presented component units. These Foundations are presented in the
aggregate in the accompanying financial statements. Following is supplemental information on UMF’s non-agency investments,
which is not included in its entirety elsewhere in these financial statements.
This note excludes agency funds held with the Foundation that are not the University’s in the amount of $20.5 million and $18.8
million as of June 30, 2024 and 2023. UMF’s investment portfolio represents substantially all of the aggregate discretely presented
component units. This note does not include investment information for UMDF given the immaterial nature of UMDF’s balances
and activities.
Investments
UMF’s disclosure regarding investments in debt and equity securities, owned by the University, is captured in Note 4. Additional
disclosure related to UMF’s non-agency investments is noted on page 74.
UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT 2024 73
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Custodial Credit Risk
UMF maintains depository, payroll, disbursement, receipt, and imprest accounts. In addition to bank account deposits, UMF held
money market instruments which are classified as investments. Interest bearing and money market accounts carry Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation (FDIC) insurance up to $250,000 per account. None of the accounts are collateralized above the FDIC
insured amounts.
Concentration of Credit Risk — As of June 30, 2024 and 2023, there is no concentration of investments from one issuer equal
or greater than 5% of the portfolio. Investments issued or guaranteed by the U.S. government, as well as investments in mutual
funds and other pooled investments are excluded from consideration when evaluating concentration risk.
Credit Risk — UMF’s investment policy allows each portfolio manager full discretion within the parameters of the investment
guidelines specific to that manager. Nationally recognized statistical rating organizations, such as Standards & Poor’s (S&P) assign
credit ratings to security issues and issuers that indicate a measure of potential credit risk to investors.

Interest Rate Risk — UMF’s Investment Policy and Guidelines Statement establishes targets for the preferred duration of the
fixed income component of the investment portfolio by asset class by limiting investments through targeted allocations to different
asset classes.

Section 183:
20. Related Party Transactions
Members of the University’s Board of Trustees and Officers may, from time to time, be associated, either directly or indirectly, with
companies doing business with the University. The University requires an annual disclosure of significant financial interests in,
family relationships, significant management function, or substantial business with entities doing business with the University by
members of the University’s Board of Trustees and Officers. When such relationships exist, measures are taken to assess potential
conflicts of interest to protect the best interests of the University and ensure compliance with relevant conflict of interest laws and
policy. The University’s conflict of interest policy also requires, among other things, that no member of the Board of Trustees or
Officer may participate in any decision in which they (or an immediate family member) has a material financial interest.

Section 184:
21. Subsequent Events
Subsequent to the year ended June 30, 2024, and through December 18, 2024, the University rolled $52.8 million of tax-exempt
and $5.25 million of taxable commercial paper with interest rates ranging from 3.31% to 5.15% with a maturity date of December
4, 2024, to fund construction projects at the Boston and Lowell campuses.
For purposes of determining the effects of subsequent events on these financial statements, management has evaluated events
subsequent to June 30, 2024 and through December 18, 2024, the date on which the financial statements were issued.

2 23 April 2024 University of Massachusetts, MA: Update to credit analysis
MOODY'S INVESTORS SERVICE U.S. PUBLIC FINANCE
Profile
University of Massachusetts is a large public university system serving the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. The system includes five
campuses: Amherst (flagship), Boston, Dartmouth, Lowell, and Worcester (medical school); and UMass Global. Included in UMass'
operations is forHealth Consulting, a public, nonprofit healthcare consulting organization. Fiscal 2023 operating revenue was $4.1
billion and fall 2023 enrollment was 64,855 full-time equivalent (FTE) students.
Detailed credit considerations
Market position
The University of Massachusetts' student demand will remain sound due to its role as an essential provider of public higher education
across multiple campuses, including the state's flagship public university, with sizable scale and scope of operations. The system's
strategic and data-driven enrollment focus supported the fall 2023 year-over-year increase in headcount at all but the Lowell campus.
Enrollment challenges will remain given employment alternatives and high school age demographic declines.
The university's initiative for increasing its online capacity and presence to reach a non-traditional student base was established
with its September 2021 partnership with Brandman University, a California-based nonprofit online provider that was a component
of Chapman University. Enrollment and financial performance of UMass Global, a blended unit of the university, is lagging original
forecasts due to slower than anticipated regulatory approvals. FTE enrollment for fiscal 2023 was just under 15,000 students.
University of Massachusetts maintains a sizable and growing research profile, which enhances its reputation and revenue diversity.
Research activity, totaling $586 million in fiscal 2023 or nearly 15% of expenses, is concentrated at the Amherst and Worcester
campuses in biomedical, applied materials and sustainability areas.
Operating performance
UMass' active and disciplined fiscal oversight and expense management, guided by its financial accountability framework, will continue
to underpin steady positive operating performance. Historically strong and consistent state operating appropriations, comprising
25% of fiscal 2023 revenue, in addition to solid capital support, contribute to the university’s excellent credit quality and also link the
university closely to the state's credit quality. State support for a portion of increased salary costs associated with collective bargaining
units is favorable to the university's credit profile. Across the $4.1 billion enterprise, the fiscal 2023 EBIDA margin was a sound 15% and
provided 2.3x debt service coverage.

Wealth and liquidity
UMass' overall wealth levels and liquidity will remain sound, benefitting active financial management of investments, ongoing
philanthropic efforts at the individual campuses, and modest annual surpluses. Total cash and investments of $3.2 billion for fiscal 2023
was up a strong 57% in the fiscal 2019-23 period, driven largely by strong returns in fiscal 2021. Wealth covers operating expenses by

Section 198:
0.8x, below the Aa2-median of 1.1x. While gift activity is supportive to asset growth and investments, the fiscal 2021-23 average gift
revenue of $61 million is less than the Aa2-median of $137 million.
Similarly, monthly liquidity will remain modest relative to rated peers. Monthly liquidity of $1.3 billion translated to 136 monthly days
cash on hand for 2023, relative to the Aa2-median of 208 days. Favorably, UMass' has limited calls on liquidity with a fixed rated debt
portfolio. Further, a $150 million revolving line of credit provides additional liquidity access.

Leverage and coverage
The university's leverage is elevated relative to peers, but will remain manageable due to consistency of operating performance and
prudent capital planning, acknowledging its excellent financial policy. Fiscal 2023 total cash and investments covered total adjusted
debt by 0.6x, relative to the Aa2-median of 0.7x. All of UMass' $3 billion of direct debt at fiscal end 2023 is fixed rate and amortizing.
Other debtlike liabilities totaling $1.7 billion include the Moody's adjusted net pension liability and alternative financing arrangements
representing three developer-owned student housing projects. Total adjusted debt was $5.2 billion for fiscal 2023, rising to $5.3 billion
including UMass' planned new money Series 2024-1 financing.
UMass will continue to have capital needs over its multi-campus system. Funding sources for the multi-year $2.1 billion budget include
reserves, gifts, state capital support, alternative financing arrangements, and debt. The debt portion of the capital plan of about $789
million is being issued over multiple years, with a tranche issued in fiscal 2022, the current planned Series 2024-1 bonds, and a roughly
$142 million issue anticipated in fiscal 2026. For interim financing needs, UMass has two commercial paper programs with a combined
$200 million authorization, split between the Series 2013A and 2013B notes. Both programs are supported by SBPAs with TD Bank.
The university has agreements with third party developers to operate student housing projects, which due to the nature of the projects
on campus land, serving university constituents and eventually returning to the university, Moody's includes as alternative financing
arrangements. Outstanding debt associated with these projects at the UMass-Boston and UMass-Dartmouth campuses, totaling
$255.4 million, are included in UMass' adjusted debt. A third project at UMass-Amherst is a service concession agreement, fully
developer-financed, opened in fall 2023.

ESG considerations
University of Massachusetts' ESG credit impact score is CIS-3
Exhibit 6
ESG credit impact score
Source: Moody's Ratings
University of Massachusetts’ (CIS-3) indicates that ESG considerations have a limited impact on the current rating with potential for
greater negative impact over time. UMass’ large scale and scope of operations, state support and active financial management help
mitigate ESG risk exposure.
Exhibit 7
ESG issuer profile scores
Source: Moody's Ratings
Environmental
Environmental risks are (E-2). UMass’ multiple locations in Massachusetts provide for varying, but manageable levels of environmental
risks. The Boston and Dartmouth campuses are exposed to sea level rise, though infrastructure upgrades have provided material risk
mitigation. Regarding carbon transition, all five UMass campuses have or are completing decarbonization plans. UMass aims to align
with other state agencies to meet net zero greenhouse gas emission goals by 2050.
Social
UMass’ (S-3) reflects favorable customer relations with the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, evidenced by solid operating and capital
state support, while its large sponsored research enterprise signals strong focus on grantors including the federal agencies. However,
weak demographic trends for in-state students, UMass’ core market, and tuition affordability sensitivities underpin elevated social risks.
Diversity among the five UMass campuses, with a solid draw for the flagship university, somewhat limits impact. Collective bargaining
unit exposure introduces human capital risks, though these are partially mitigated by state oversight of collective bargaining and
benefits, along with state reimbursement for a significant portion of any cost increases.
Governance
UMass’ (G-2) balances slightly elevated risks around board and organization structure with more favorable financial strategy and
risk management. Active financial management acknowledges the university’s strong internal controls, development of specific
reserve requirements and expense efficiencies. The ability to maintain stability in core revenue streams speaks to management
credibility. Board structure risks are introduced by the selection process, with the majority of the 19 voting members appointed by
5 23 April 2024 University of Massachusetts, MA: Update to credit analysis

the Massachusetts governor. This structure adds exposure to potential political considerations which could create misalignment to
institutional priorities. Recent reliance on student housing public-private partnerships and the September 2021 partnership with a
California-based online provider, Brandman University, introduces some organizational structure risks.

Annual Report to the Legislature
Excellence, Impact, Stewardship:
How UMass is powering the Commonwealth’s economy and future
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
This year’s edition of the University of Massachusetts’ “Annual Report to the Legislature”
documents how FY2024 has been another solid year for UMass of delivering academic
excellence and powerful economic benefits throughout the Commonwealth, along with diligent
fiscal stewardship throughout the University system and ever-growing financial support for our
more than 73,000 students. Against ever-present fiscal headwinds and the growing demographic
challenges all colleges and universities face, UMass is proud to share the enormous success story
documented in the report that follows.
A few items we would particularly like to call out:
 In the past year, all four of our undergraduate campuses, in Amherst, Boston, Dartmouth,
and Lowell, launched programs assuring free tuition to qualifying students from families
with adjusted gross income of $75,000 or less. The MASSGrant Plus program expansion
approved by the Legislature in FY2024 and signed into law by the Healey-Driscoll
administration was a key driver of UMass’s ability to offer this tremendous benefit to
students with the greatest financial need. Along with the expansion of what we call
“University-generated financial aid” (scholarships, tuition reductions, and work-study
and on-campus job options funded by University revenues) to a record-high $409 million
annually, which UMass continues to grow faster than increases in tuition and fees, we are
leading the nation in championing affordable, high-quality higher education for all our
students.
 UMass witnessed countless examples of academic excellence in 2024, from students,
faculty, and researchers alike. We take particular pride in UMass Chan Medical School
researcher Victor R. Ambros, PhD, being honored with the 2024 Nobel Prize in
Physiology or Medicine. Dr. Ambros was recognized for his co-discovery of microRNA,
the very short, single-stranded RNA molecules that are now understood to play a critical
role in post-transcriptional gene regulation. This is the second time a UMass Chan
researcher has been part of a Nobel-winning team, following Dr. Craig C. Mello’s honors
in 2006. Dr. Ambros and his colleagues are showing how UMass Chan is truly at the
epicenter of a revolution in biomedical research.
 The University of Massachusetts continues to earn national and global recognition for its
academic excellence, impactful research, and contributions to economic development. In the 2025
Times Higher Education (T.H.E.) World University Rankings, UMass surged 39 spots to #84
i

worldwide, ranking #33 among all U.S. institutions and #16 among public universities. UMass
also retained its position as the #1 public university in New England. Additionally, UMass
Amherst achieved its highest-ever rankings, placing #26 among public universities and #58
among all national universities.
 UMass continues to be recognized as a national leader in the quality and rigor of our
financial and operational management. In reaffirming our strong bond rating, S&P Global
Ratings praised the University’s “sound management and governance oversight, with
comprehensive long-term strategic plans.” Moody’s lauded our “excellent strategic
positioning that incorporates disciplined fiscal oversight” and our “excellent and growing
research enterprise.”
 A key engine for our financial success is UMass’s Enterprise Risk Management (ERM)
program, which continues to win national acclaim. The ERM platform continuously
monitors more than 30 areas of financial and reputational risk to the University, with the
impact of declining enrollment, information security, and facilities and deferred
maintenance at the top of the current list. The program informs and guides all of our
financial accountability activities and risk-mitigation strategies, providing transparency
and shared understanding of risk across the system at both leadership and operational
levels. In 2024, the UMass ERM program was awarded the Public Risk Management
Association (PRIMA) Outstanding Achievement in Enterprise Risk Management Award
and, for a third year, was selected as the ERM “Best of Conference” at the University
Risk Management & Insurance Association national conference.
 In the last year, UMass took a small–but significant and successful–step towards offering
an applicant-friendly, system-wide admissions sharing process. Through close
coordination among the Amherst, Dartmouth, and Lowell campuses, Amherst shared with
the two other campuses a list of promising applicants who nonetheless were not wholly
qualified for admission to the flagship campus. Applying their own criteria, such as
omitting applicants for already-oversubscribed programs, UMass Dartmouth and UMass
Lowell made admissions offers to several hundred of the UMass Amherst applicants. This
led to a total of 23 students enrolling at UMass Dartmouth and 16 at UMass Lowell—all
students who likely never would have joined the UMass system. While these total
numbers are, at this stage, modest, we consider this last year’s admissions pilot a
critically important “proof of concept” of the large opportunity to provide UMass system
admissions offers to students not accepted by UMass Amherst. We are excited to continue
refining and expanding this program in order to ensure that the UMass system as a whole
succeeds in retaining more and more of the students who may fall short of meeting the
high admissions standards of the system flagship.
These and the many other success stories documented in this report underscore how valuable and
important it is for the Commonwealth to invest in UMass and how much UMass achieves and
produces for the Commonwealth. Expanding the Commonwealth’s Supporting Urgent
Community College Equity through Student Services (SUCCESS) program to cover UMass
students as well as those attending state and community colleges will ensure thousands of
Massachusetts young people get the wraparound services that can help them maximize their
success at UMass and go on to be our future business, community, and civic leaders. UMass will
ii

also be able to put to excellent use all available funding from the Commonwealth to our RISE
Capital Program (Resources for Infrastructure, Sustainability & Equity) to address our nearly $5
billion in systemwide renovation and upgrade needs for our physical plant and tremendous
opportunities to decarbonize and reduce the climate impacts of aging and energy-intensive
buildings.
As we look ahead, we recognize that there are challenging times ahead for all of higher
education. As with all of state government, costs continue to rise, and revenue sources remain
strained and stretched.
What this report shows, along with the achievements and successes of our 73,000 students and
28,000 faculty and staff every day, is that UMass has the people, systems, and financial acumen
to take on and address these challenges while delivering world-class academic experiences for
students and extraordinary economic returns from the Commonwealth’s continued investment in
the University.

#4. Financial Aid

Financial Aid
What is it? Why do we do it?
Details key definitions on financial aid, trend data on  To quantify the amount of financial aid provided to
UMass investment in financial aid compared to other our students from University-generated sources

and access.
 To highlight the University’s significant investment;
When do we do it? particularly to in state undergraduate students

UMass is committed to access and affordability
$409 million: Annual financial aid On a per student basis University-
generated by UMass tuition generated aid has grown almost 3X
pricing/free aid strategy, up 82% as fast as net tuition and fee
over the past decade revenue since 2020
79% of University-generated aid $19,713 average annual net price at
goes to in state students, well UMass is just 2/3rds of the average
above their 71% share of total Massachusetts private institution price
enrollment
Depending on campus, 24% to UMass strategy has succeeded in
50% of in state undergraduates, holding average student debt at
or ~14k students, receive Pell graduation relatively flat for a decade

FAFSA Simplification Implementation Delays
 In 2020, the FAFSA (Free Application for Federal Student Aid) Simplification Act was adopted by the
federal government to streamline the common form utilized to determine financial need for
students and families and created a new measure of determining a student’s ability to pay for
college
 The rollout of the new, simplified forms has experienced delays and glitches; students unable to
complete the form creates delays in the financial aid awarding process
 The federal Department of Education is withholding FAFSA records from schools until technological
developments are completed – delaying the awarding of financial aid for students
 Additional delays related to adjustments to financial need calculations means that campuses may
not be receiving student information until late March
 UMass financial aid offices will process financial aid packages to students as soon as practicable
given the ongoing challenges of this implementation, but these delays will have an impact to the
traditional admissions timeline for new freshmen/transfer students
• Boston, Dartmouth and Lowell have extended the enrollment deposit deadline to June 1st
58

Understanding the components of financial aid
University-generated aid is primarily awarded to students as grants, scholarships, and credits.
Free Financial Aid
 Waivers/Credits – targeted and need-based discounts that directly reduce a student’s bill
 Grants/Scholarships – financial aid to students which does not have to be repaid
 UMass-generated aid ($409M) includes institutional financial need-based programs and merit
aid such as Chancellor’s Scholarships awarded based on strong academic achievement and
personal achievement
 Federal aid ($95M) such as Federal Pell Grants awarded based on financial need
 State aid ($79M) such as MASSGrant Plus awarded based on financial need
Student
Employment and
Work Study
 On- or off-campus jobs to earn money to pay for school
59

SPARC – Financial Aid
SPARC enhancements included adding financial aid data for real-time analysis by campus users
• Data available by college and
academic department detailing
financial aid by funding sources and
type of aid
(scholarships/grants/waivers/loans/
“self-pay”*) providing insight at a
more granular level
• View of data by funding sources
broken out by types: need vs. non
need aid
• Demonstrates the impact University-
funded financial aid has on students
and differences between academic
departments/student types
* Self-pay is the amount students/families are paying out of

pocket after all aid is provided from all sources

past decade; 3.5% growth over FY23
• 79% of UMass aid goes to in state students, well above their 71% share of total enrollment
 UMass Net Price Below MA Private Institutions and align with New England Public Peers
• $19,713 average annual net price (FY22) at UMass is just 2/3rds of the average Massachusetts
private institution price
 Student debt remains flat in recent years but a real decline in inflation-adjusted dollars
• The average amount of debt at graduation for FY24 is $31,173
 UMass faces limits on growing University-generated aid
• Must pursue many strategies to grow the pie, including through increased Commonwealth support
- because investing in UMass students invests in Massachusetts’ future

Key Take Aways of the FY26 – FY30 Forecast
Enrollment Strategies: Affordability:
 Address changing demographics of new undergrads  Tuition: modest increases; forecasted tuition increases
needs Board approval
 Financial aid commitment improving accessibility
 Financial Aid: continued investments by both University
 Leverage student pathways for future enrollment: early
and State
college, Community College transfer
 Sensitivity Analysis: stress testing enrollment
 Campus specific targeted strategies: area high schools,
assumptions and impact on revenue, operating margin
specific states, international partnerships, etc.
Transparency: Alignment with State:
 Revenue and Expenses: grow on average 4% annually  State Appropriation: additional 1% aligns with typical

Salaries and Fringe
127

Salaries and Payroll Defined
 Salaries/Payroll expenses are shown by both fiscal year and calendar year.
• Generally, salary and fringe expense is shown by fiscal year
• The breakdown of base pay, performance incentive pay, and other types of pay are shown by
calendar year
• When shown by Fiscal Year, the title will be blue. When shown by Calendar Year, the title will
be green.
 Why show both?
• Showing certain payroll expenses by calendar year allows for easy comparison using publicly
available tools such as CTHRU.
• Additionally, Calendar Year is the typical way in which employees and the public think about
payroll – as tax documents like W2’s are calculated January – December.
 Staff type is presented based upon federally-designated categories reported across campuses and
other universities and is consistent with other reports generated by the University.
128

Overview of State-Mandated Fringe Benefit Rate
The fringe rate assessed to UMass is based on total payroll cost and does not reflect actual
costs incurred by UMass.
 Nearly all UMass employees are State employees and are afforded both state
health insurance and retirement benefits.
 The cost of these benefits are assessed to the University using a methodology
and fringe rate set by the Commonwealth - the FY24 rate (45.31%) has increased
by almost 64% since FY2014.
 The entire state appropriation (line item 7100-0200 = $753M) is used to fund
payroll at UMass. The related fringe expense for these employees is picked up
by the State.
 However, the state only covers 43% the University's total payroll costs (49% with
its share of fringe) leaving UMass to cover the rest from its own resources –
primarily tuition and fees.
129

Salaries and Fringe by Fiscal Year
The entire state appropriation is used to fund payroll which only covers 43% of the
University's total payroll costs (49% when you factor fringe).

Fiscal Year 2024 vs. Calendar Year 2024
Showing both fiscal year and calendar year views of payroll data presents the most
complete and accurate display of UMass payroll.
Why the difference?
Fiscal Year 2024 Salaries:
 The six-month difference between fiscal year end
$1.9 billion
and calendar year end creates variation
 Calendar year payroll excludes certain categories to
conform with CTHRU – the Commonwealth’s
Calendar Year 2024 Salaries:

$1.7 billion
• As an example, all student payroll is excluded
from CTHRU for student privacy

performance incentive pay.

Total Compensation Including Performance Incentive Pay
Performance payments are thoroughly vetted using industry and corporate best practices
and total only one quarter of one percent of total compensation.
 UMass works with national consulting firms (Sibson, Korn Ferry, and Pearl Meyer) that
specialize in higher education and medical centers to review executive compensation
and how it impacts goal of attracting and retaining executive leadership.
 Specific and measureable results are required for any incentive to be earned; putting
compensation at risk if goals are not met.
 In 2024, 63% of the performance incentive payments were earned at the UMass Chan
Medical School consistent with the total compensation reward program.

Deferred Maintenance - Annual Investment
Establishing Definitions and Setting Targets Based on Industry Best Practice
Keep Up:
 Defined as the annual investment needed to ensure buildings perform properly and reach their useful lives.
 Includes small operating projects (<$20k) and preventive/proactive maintenance funded from a recurring funding
source.
Catch Up:
 Defined as major capital projects funded by one-time funds such as reserves, bond proceeds, and State resources
(also typically bond funds).
 Large backlog that requires funding over a specified time period.
Annual Investment Targets:
 Keep Up - defined as the annual minimum investment required to prevent the deferred maintenance backlog
from growing. Gordian calculates the target by discounting the total cost necessary to replace each building
component at the completion of its useful life.
 Catch Up – defined as the annual investment needed to eliminate the backlog over a specified time period. This
target is still to be determined.

State Investment Required to Meet Goals
Campuses engaged in energy and sustainability master planning efforts and coordinating
with State
 Funding: will require state investment to decarbonize campus energy infrastructure at
the pace required to meet DOER’s updated goals
• For example, electrifying campus heating and cooling systems to meet emission goals requires
investments in new utility infrastructure on all 5 campuses – estimated cost $1 billion+
 Infrastructure: concerns on the ability of the ISO New England Grid to keep pace with
demand while ensuring the reliability and resiliency for business continuity
 Deferred Maintenance Needs: significant backlog impacts energy efficiency; requires a
partnership for funding to address building envelope and energy efficiency projects to
reduce energy demand and address long-standing capital needs

Commonwealth’s Workforce Education Gap
The Commonwealth must educate more of its population at the post-secondary level to remain a
competitive destination for business and provide equal opportunities for all residents.
SKILLS GAP NEED FOR EDUCATION OPTIONS STUDENT DEMAND
Employers are increasingly Greater numbers of workers An estimated one million adult learners

219

Strong Competition in Online Education
 Increased competition from online providers. SNHU’s online programs now enroll over 100k – 2x-3x
the number of Massachusetts residents served by the University – and SNHU is the provider of
choice for adult learners in the state
 UMass has a unique opportunity in a growing market that complements, and even protects, the
existing institutions of public higher education here in Massachusetts
 UMass is also competing against peers with established programs for working adults –University of
Maryland, Purdue University, Penn State and Arizona State
 UMass will face accelerating declines in enrollment, which may result in painful contraction
 Massachusetts employers will face an increasingly serious challenge in finding the talent to keep
their companies prosperous
220

Benefits to the Commonwealth
 Increase access for working adults and underserved populations
 Establish the Commonwealth as a leader in online teaching and learning
 Establish additional pathways to more affordable four-year degrees via the MassTransfer
program
 Increase the Commonwealth’s capacity for workforce upskilling and retraining with in-
demand skills and rapid response to employer workforce shortages with degrees plus a
variety of micro-credentials
 Defend against out-of-state providers recruiting students away from in-state colleges and
universities already under duress from demographic shifts
 Ensure the sustainability of UMass, the Commonwealth’s largest postsecondary educator,
third-largest research enterprise and third-largest employer
221

Activity to Date
Background:
 Transfer of control effective September 2021 (FY22)
 Separate 501(c)3 in California with a separate independent Board

Amherst: Strategies for FY26 and FY27
 Maintain current enrollment levels. Invest in academic programs, student support services and
capital to attract and retain 5,250 incoming students each fall. Maintain/Improve 83.4% 6-year
graduation rates. Strive to continue increases in diversity of incoming class
 Continued focus on out-of-state recruiting to offset demographic declines in Northeast
 Invest remaining existing Base Budget in academic and administrative priorities (budget from
past State Appropriation Increases) including academic advising and other student support,
marketing, research support and health and safety initiatives
 Utilize NEW FUNDING (state appropriation and tuition increase revenues) to:
• Invest in Financial Aid to Yield Diverse and Academically-Strong Students
• Fund Increased Utility Cost (rate inflation, new buildings, offset by energy savings projects)
• Fund Increased Debt Service/Depreciation and Deferred Maintenance
 Continual process improvement yields annual campus-wide 1-2% base budget pullbacks
which seed strategic initiative pools
 For the Common Good. Develop a plan to sufficiently resource strategic plan initiatives

Amherst: Investing in Keep Up
 Depreciation is a non-cash expense
which spreads the cost of a capital
asset over its useful life
 Depreciation is included as an
operating expense in the operating
budget
 Principal payments are a cash
expense which are not included in
the operating budget
 The annual difference between
depreciation and principal provides
budgeted resources to invest in the
preventative maintenance of assets

Boston: Investing in Keep Up
 Depreciation is a non-cash expense
which spreads the cost of a capital asset
over its useful life
 Depreciation is included as an operating
expense in the operating budget
 Principal payments are a cash expense
which are not included in the operating
budget
 The annual difference between
depreciation and principal provides
budgeted resources to invest in the
preventative maintenance of assets
(available for keep up)

spreads the cost of a capital asset over its
useful life
 Depreciation is included as an operating
expense in the operating budget
 Principal payments are a cash expense
which are not included in the operating
budget
 The annual difference between
depreciation and principal provides
budgeted resources to invest in the
preventative maintenance of assets

NERB Financial Updates
 The New Education and Research Building (NERB) opened June 7, 2024 and is occupied by the Horae Gene
Therapy Center; the Departments of Neurology and Neurobiology, including the Wellstone Center; the Program
of Molecular Medicine; and a section of the Department of Psychiatry.
 The NERB is also home to UMass Chan researcher Victor Ambros, PhD, who shared the 2024 Nobel Prize in
Physiology or Medicine for his co-discovery of microRNA.
 The timing of faculty recruiting has been updated to reflect current hiring. While the building was not opened
until June 24, these faculty were housed elsewhere on campus.
 Fiscal 2025 will be the first full year of occupancy for the NERB.
 Operations and maintenance expense ramps up over the 5-year period; however, costs may be affected going
forward depending on utility rates and CPI.
 Projections have been updated to reflect the additional revenue from the higher projected tuition and fee rate
increases assumed in the 5-Year plan (FY26 4.75%, FY27 4.5%, FY28 4.25%, FY29 and FY30 4.0%)

2 UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT 2024

Letter from the President
I am pleased to present the annual financial report of the University of Massachusetts. This
report details the university’s financial position and major activities over the past year and
emphasizes the work that we have done to ensure active fiscal management and accountability
across the five-campus system.
This is a pivotal period in higher education, as public and private colleges and universities
across the country are facing significant demographic challenges, largely due to a declining
high school graduate population, which is especially pronounced in the Northeast. In spite of
this, I am pleased to report that the University of Massachusetts has continued to maintain
strong enrollment, and the university is positioned to come through stronger because of our
collective work over the past years.
The university’s scope of activities is broad and impactful. UMass educates more than 73,000
students and produces nearly 19,000 graduates each year, with 660,000 alumni in total,
including 360,000 in Massachusetts. The UMass community provides 700,000 community
service hours a year and serves as a critical talent pipeline in service of the state’s long-term
competitiveness. With a $4.3 billion budget and $8.3 billion in annual economic impact,
UMass is an enormous contributor to the state’s economy, supporting many external jobs and
construction activities that generate a ripple effect in every corner of the Commonwealth.
Our research funding, which now stands at a record-high $826 million, is focused on key
Massachusetts industries like the life sciences, data science, climate science, advanced
manufacturing, robotics, and more.
The national reputation of our UMass campuses in Amherst, Boston, Dartmouth, and Lowell
continues to rise, including in annual rankings from reputable sources like U.S. News & World
Report. UMass Chan Medical School was recently named the best medical school in the
Northeast for primary care and ranks among the top 15 in the country.
Our work continues to be focused on providing affordability, accessibility, and a world-
class education for all our students. To accomplish these goals, the university has employed
innovative strategies ranging from improved data analytics to procurement reforms resulting
in reduced costs to UMass.
These efforts are only possible because of the overall effectiveness of our operations and our
financial strength, which have distinguished UMass as a well-managed university.
The university’s endowment has reached an all-time-high of $1.5 billion, thanks to improved
fundraising efforts on our campuses, significant philanthropic gifts, and exceptional
stewardship and investment management. We continue to receive external recognition for the
strength of our management, with strong bond ratings from Moody’s, Fitch and S&P Global.
Our Enterprise Risk Management program also received a national award from the Public Risk
Management Association.
A strong, stable and thriving UMass is critical to the success of our state, our economy, and
our quality of life, and I am proud of what our administration, faculty and staff have worked on
this past fiscal year to help advance these goals. As the largest contributor of college graduates
entering the state’s workforce, UMass is building the future of the Commonwealth — and
together we must remain steadfast in our mission of making Massachusetts better, stronger,
and more competitive through our mission of education, research and service.
Sincerely,
Martin T. Meehan
President

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Basis of Presentation
The accompanying financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles
(GAAP) as prescribed by the Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB) using the economic resources measurement
focus and the accrual basis of accounting. The Foundations’ financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting
and reporting requirements prescribed by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB). As such, certain revenue recognition
criteria and presentation features are different from GASB revenue recognition criteria and presentation features. No modifications
have been made to the Foundations’ financial information in the University’s financial reporting entity for these differences.
The University’s activities are considered to be a single business-type activity and accordingly, are reported in a single column in
the financial statements. Business-type activities are those that are financed in whole or in part by funds received from external
parties for goods or services.
On the Statements of Revenues, Expenses and Changes in Net Position, the University’s operating activities consist of tuition and
fees, grants and contracts, sales and services, auxiliary enterprise and other operating revenues. Other operating revenues include
sales and services provided by UMass Chan under its ForHealth Consulting program (ForHealth). ForHealth provides consulting
and services in health care financing, administration and policy to federal, state and local agencies and not-for-profit health and
policy organizations. Also included in other operating revenues are payments received by UMass Chan for educational services it
provides to its clinical affiliate, UMass Memorial Medical Center (UMass Memorial).
Operating expenses include, among other items, payroll, fringe benefits, utilities, supplies and services, depreciation, and
amortization. Nonoperating revenues or expenses are those in which the University receives or gives value without directly giving
or receiving equal value, such as State and Federal appropriations, Federal Pell grants, private gifts, investment income and
interest expense.
Revenues for exchange transactions are recognized when earned and expenses are recognized when incurred. Restricted grant
revenue is recognized only when all eligibility requirements have been met. The University applies restricted net assets first when
an expense or outlay is incurred for purposes for which both restricted and unrestricted net assets are available.
The University receives unconditional promises to give through private donations or pledges from corporations, foundations,
alumni and other supporters of the University. Revenue is recognized when a pledge is received and all eligibility requirements,
including time and purpose requirements, are met. Endowment pledges are not recorded until paid because the inherent time
restriction has not been met until the funds are able to be invested in perpetuity.
Net Position
Net position is classified into the following categories:
• Net investment in capital assets: Capital assets, at historical cost or fair market value on the date of gift, net of accumulated
depreciation and outstanding principal balances of debt attributable to the acquisition, construction or improvement of
those assets.
• Restricted nonexpendable: Resources subject to externally imposed stipulations that they be maintained permanently by
the University.
• Restricted expendable: Resources whose use by the University is subject to externally imposed stipulations. Such assets
include restricted grants and contracts, the accumulated net gains/losses on true endowment funds, as well as restricted
funds loaned to students, restricted gifts and endowment income, and other similar restricted funds.
• Unrestricted: The net position that is not subject to externally imposed restrictions governing their use. The University’s
unrestricted net position may be designated for specific purposes by management or the Board of Trustees. Substantially all
of the University’s unrestricted net position is designated to support academic and research initiatives or programs, auxiliary
enterprises, quasi-endowments, or commitments to capital construction projects. Note 16 describes these designations
in more detail.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents consist primarily of demand deposit accounts, savings accounts and money market accounts with an
original maturity date of three months or less.
UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT 2024 29

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Massachusetts Municipal Depository Trust
The University is authorized to invest in the Massachusetts Municipal Depository Trust (“MMDT”), a pooled money market-like
fund, established under Massachusetts General Laws, Chapter 29, Section 38A. MMDT is an external investment pool that meets
the criteria to report its holdings at amortized cost. As such, the University reports its position in MMDT at amortized cost which
approximates the net asset value of $1.00 (one dollar) per share. MMDT has a maturity of less than one year and is not rated.
Accounts Receivable, Net
Accounts receivable consist of receivables for tuition and fees, grants and contracts, student loans, pledges and ForHealth related
activities. The University establishes an allowance for accounts receivable based on management’s expectation regarding the
collection of the receivables and the University’s historical experience for collections.
Investments
Investments are reported at fair value. Short-term investments consist of deposits with original maturities of less than one year
and are available for current use. Securities received as gifts are recorded at estimated fair value at the date of the gift. Investment
return includes dividends, interest income, unrealized gains and losses, and realized gains and losses, which are determined on a
specific identification basis.
30 UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT 2024

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Endowment
UMF maintains and administers the University’s endowment assets and other long-term investments. UMF utilizes the pooled
investment concept, whereby all invested funds are included in one investment pool unless otherwise required by the donor.
Pooled investment funds receive an annual distribution based on the endowment fund’s average market value for the preceding
twelve quarters on a one-year lag. Only quarters with funds on deposit are included in the average. In addition, a prudence rule
is utilized, limiting spending from a particular endowment fund to be no lower than 93% of its carrying value. The spending rate
approved for the years ended June 30, 2024 and 2023 was 4%.
Capital Assets
Capital assets (excluding intangible right-to-use lease and subscription assets) are stated at cost on the date of acquisition or, in
the case of gifts, fair value upon date of donation. Construction in progress is stated at cost, which includes direct construction
costs and other expenditures related to construction. All construction costs related to projects which are not yet completed
are presented as construction in progress until such time as the projects are completed and placed in operation. Repairs and
maintenance costs are expensed as incurred, whereas major improvements that extend the estimated useful lives of the assets
are capitalized as additions to capital assets. The University does not capitalize works of art, historical treasures, or library books.
The University capitalizes equipment with useful lives greater than one year and acquisition costs greater than or equal to $5,000.
Capital construction occurs when estimated costs reach $25,000. Projects under $25,000 are considered to be maintenance and
repairs and they are expensed as incurred. The University computes depreciation using the straight-line method over the asset’s
useful life and applies a half-year convention in the year the asset is acquired or placed in service. Land is not depreciated.
Table 1 presents the range of useful lives for the University’s depreciable assets:
TABLE 1 – Depreciable Assets
Depreciable asset category Useful life
Land improvements 20 years
Buildings 12–65 years
Infrastructure 50 years
Building improvements 3–20 years
Equipment, furniture and IT infrastructure 3–15 years
Software 5 years
Newly Implemented Accounting Standards
In April 2022, GASB issued GASB Statement No. 99, Omnibus 2022. This standard establishes or amends accounting and financial
requirements for specific issues including, but not limited to, financial guarantees, derivative guarantees, public private partnerships
(PPPs) and subscription based information technology arrangements (SBITAs). The University adopted GASB statement No. 99,
effective July 1, 2022. Adoption of the standard had no effect on the University’s financial statements.
In June 2022, GASB issued GASB Statement No. 100, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections – an amendment of GASB Statement
No. 62. This standard enhances the accounting and financial reporting requirements for accounting changes and error corrections
to provide more understandable, reliable, relevant, consistent, and comparable information for making decisions or assessing
accountability. The University adopted GASB statement No. 100, effective July 1, 2023. Adoption of the standard had no effect on
the University’s financial statements.
UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT 2024 31

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Leasing
The University determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception. The University has leases under which it is obligated as a lessee
and leases for which it is a lessor. The University is a lessee for various noncancellable real estate leases. In addition, the University
is a lessor of various leases of buildings, office space and ground leases.
Short-term Leases — For leases arrangements with a maximum possible term of 12 months or less at commencement, the
University recognizes expense based on the provisions of the lease contract.
Lease Arrangements Other Than Short-Term — For all other leases, (i.e. those that are not short- term), the University
recognizes a lease liability, and an intangible right-to-use lease asset.
For leases, where the University is a lessor, the University recognizes a lease receivable and a deferred inflow of resources.
Measurement of Lease Amounts —
• Lessee: At lease commencement, the University initially measures the lease liability at the present value of payments expected
to be made during the lease term. Subsequently, the lease liability is reduced by the principal portion of lease payments made.
The lease asset is initially measured as the initial amount of the lease liability, less lease payments made at or before the
lease commencement date, plus any initial direct costs ancillary to placing the underlying asset into service, less any lease
incentives received at or before the lease commencement date. Subsequently, the lease asset is amortized into depreciation
and amortization expense on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lease term or the useful life of the underlying asset.
If the University is reasonably certain of exercising a purchase option contained in a lease, the lease asset will be amortized
over the useful life of the underlying asset.
• Lessor: At lease commencement, the University initially measures the lease receivable at the present value of payments
expected to be received during the lease term. Subsequently, the lease receivable is reduced by the principal portion of lease
payments made. The deferred inflows of resources are initially measured as the initial amount of the lease receivable plus any
payments received at or before the commencement of the lease term that relate to future periods. Subsequently, the deferred
inflows of resources are amortized into lease revenue on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lease term or the useful
life of the underlying lease receivable.
Key Estimates and Judgments — Key estimates and judgments include how the University determines (1) the discount rate used
to calculate the present value of the expected lease payments, (2) lease term, and (3) lease payments.
When available, the University will use the interest rate explicitly or implicitly stated in the lease contract. If the rate is not provided
within the contract, the University will use its incremental borrowing rate (IBR), based on the University’s applicable bond rates.
The University’s IBR for leases is based on the rate of interest it would need to pay if it issued general obligation bonds to borrow
an amount equal to the lease payments, under similar terms, as of the lease commencement or amendment dates.
The lease includes the noncancellable period of the lease plus any additional periods covered by either a University or lessor
unilateral option to (1) extend for which it is reasonably certain to be exercised, or (2) terminate for which it is reasonably certain
not to be exercised. Periods in which both the University and the lessor/vendor have an option to terminate (or if both parties have
to agree to extend) are excluded from the lease term.
Payments are evaluated by the University to determine if they should be included in the measurement of the lease liabilities,
including those payments that require a determination of whether they are reasonably certain of being made, such as purchase
options, payments for termination penalties, and other payments.
Remeasurement of Lease Amounts — The University monitors changes in circumstances that may require remeasurement of
a lease. When certain changes occur that are expected to significantly affect the amount of the lease liability or lease receivable,
the liability or receivable is remeasured, and a corresponding adjustment is made to the lease asset (for lessee arrangements) or
deferred inflows of resources (for lessor arrangements).
Presentation in Statements of Net Position — Lease assets are reported with capital assets and lease liabilities are reported
within current and non-current liabilities in the statement of net position. Lease receivables are reported with current and non-
current assets and deferred inflows of resources in the Statements of Net Position.
32 UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT 2024

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Subscription-Based Liabilities
The University determines if an arrangement is a subscription-based information technology arrangement (SBITA) at inception
and recognizes a corresponding liability. Right-to-use SBITA assets largely consist of system-wide IT arrangements and upon
identification of a SBITA, the University recognizes a subscription-based liability and an intangible right-to-use subscription asset.
Measurement of Subscription-Based Liabilities — At SBITA commencement, the University initially measures the subscription-
based liability at the present value of payments expected to be made during the SBITA term. Subsequently, the subscription-based
liability is reduced by the principal portion of payments made. The subscription asset is initially measured as the initial amount of
the liability, less payments made at or before the SBITA commencement date, plus any initial direct costs ancillary to placing the
underlying asset into service, less any lease incentives received at or before the lease commencement date. Subsequently, the
SBITA asset is amortized into depreciation and amortization expense on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lease term or
the useful life of the underlying asset.
Key Estimates and Judgments — Key estimates and judgments include how the University determines (1) the discount rate
used to calculate the present value of the expected subscription payments, (2) subscription term, and (3) subscription payments.
When available, the University will use the interest rate explicitly or implicitly stated in the SBITA contract. If the rate is not provided
within the contract, the University will use its incremental borrowing rate (IBR), based on the University’s applicable bond rates.
The University’s IBR for SBITA agreements is based on the rate of interest it would need to pay if it issued general obligation bonds
to borrow an amount equal to the SBITA payments, under similar terms, as of the SBITA commencement or amendment dates.
Presentation in Statements of Net Position — SBITA assets are reported with capital assets and subscription based liabilities
are reported within current and non-current liabilities in the Statements of Net Position.

Deferred Outflows and Inflows of Resources
The University accounts for certain transactions that result in the consumption or acquisition of resources in one period that are
applicable to future periods as deferred outflows and deferred inflows, respectively, to distinguish them from assets and liabilities.
Deferred outflows of resources increase net position, similar to assets and deferred inflows of resources decrease net position,
similar to liabilities.
The components of deferred outflows and inflows of resources as of June 30, 2024 and 2023 ($ in thousands) are presented in

Total deferred inflows of resources $ 1,155,256 $ 939,241
Compensated Absences
Employees earn the right to be compensated during absences for annual vacation leave and sick leave. Upon retirement,
termination, or death, certain employees are compensated for unused sick and vacation leave, subject to certain limitations, at
their current rate of pay. Within the Statements of Net Position, a liability is recorded for vacation and sick leave benefits earned
as of the fiscal year-end. The recorded liability is classified as current and noncurrent on the Statements of Net Position based on
the amount estimated to be paid to eligible employees in one year and beyond one year, respectively.
Unearned Revenue and Advances
Unearned revenue consists of amounts billed or received in advance of the University providing goods or services. Unearned
revenue is subsequently earned as qualifying expenses are incurred.
Advances include funds advanced to the University by the U.S. government under the Federal Perkins Loan Program (the Program).
Under federal law, the authority for colleges and universities to make new loans under the Program ended on September 30, 2017,
and final distributions were permitted through June 30, 2018. The University’s Statements of Net Position include both the notes
receivable from students and the related refundable liability to the Federal government.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Tuition and Fees, Net of Scholarship Allowances
Student tuition and fees, housing, dining, and other similar auxiliary revenues are reported net of any related scholarships and
fellowships applied to student accounts.
Grants and Contracts
The University receives grants and contracts for scholarships as well as research and other activities including medical service
reimbursements from federal and state government agencies. The University records revenue at the point all eligibility requirements
(e.g. allowable costs are incurred) are met.
The University records the recovery of indirect costs applicable to research programs and other activities which provide for the
full or partial reimbursement of such costs, as revenue. Recovery of indirect costs for the years ended June 30, 2024 and 2023 was
$180.9 million and $170.8 million, respectively, and is a component of grants and contracts revenue on the Statements of Revenues,
Expenses, and Changes in Net Position.
Auxiliary Enterprises, Net of Discount
An auxiliary enterprise is an activity that exists to furnish a service to students, faculty or staff acting in a personal capacity, and
that charges a fee for the use of goods and services. Any amount of excess undesignated aid (aid remaining after applicable tuition
and fee charges have been covered) would be applied first to auxiliary charges as a discount, then recorded as an expense.
Fringe Benefits for Current Employees and Postemployment Obligations
The University participates in the Commonwealth’s fringe benefit programs, including active employee and postemployment
health insurance, unemployment compensation, pension, and workers’ compensation benefits. Health insurance and pension
costs for active employees and retirees are paid through a fringe benefit rate charged to the University by the Commonwealth.
Workers’ compensation costs are assessed separately based on actual University experience.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial
statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from
these estimates. The most significant areas that require management estimates relate to valuation of certain investments and
derivative instruments, useful lives and related depreciation of capital assets, and accruals for pension and other postemployment
related benefits.
During FY2024, the University switched from a method that estimated and allocated scholarship allowances to a method that
directly determines discounts by student, by term. The new methodology applies discounts against auxiliary which was not done
historically. This change was applied prospectively for the year ending June 30, 2024 and had no impact on the University’s change
in net position.
Income Tax Status
The University is exempt from Federal and state income tax under the doctrine of intergovernmental tax immunity. The University
qualifies as a public charity eligible to receive charitable contributions under Section 170(b)(1)(A)(v) of the Internal Revenue Code,
as amended (the Code).
The University and its component units are required to assess uncertain tax positions and have determined that there were no
such positions that are material to the financial statements as of June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

2. Cash Held by State Treasurer
Accounts payable, accrued salaries and outlays for capital projects funded by state-appropriated funds totaled $45.3 million and
$42.1 million at June 30, 2024 and June 30, 2023. The University has recorded a comparable amount of cash held by the State
Treasurer for the benefit of the University, which will be subsequently utilized to pay for allowable expenditures. The cash is held
in the State Treasurer’s pooled cash account. The Commonwealth requires all bank deposits in excess of insurance coverage by
the FDIC to be collateralized with a perfected pledge of eligible collateral. Eligible collateral must be pledged in an amount equal
to 102% of the amount of the deposits that exceed FDIC insurance. Sufficient collateral to cover total Commonwealth deposits in
excess of the FDIC insured amount must be pledged and held in safekeeping by a custodian that is approved by and under the
control of the Commonwealth Treasurer and Receiver - General.
3. Deposits with Bond Trustees
Deposits with bond trustees primarily consist of unspent bond proceeds, amounts held for the future payment of debt service on
such borrowings, and designated funds from the University’s pool loan program.
At June 30, 2024 and 2023, deposits with bond trustees are presented in Table 4 ($ in thousands):

At June 30, 2024 and 2023, amounts restricted by bond trust agreements for capital projects and other purposes were $425.1
million and $339.3 million, respectively.
Custodial Credit Risk — The custodial credit risk for deposits is the risk that, in the event of the failure of a depository financial
institution, a government will not be able to recover deposits or will not be able to recover collateral securities that are in
the possession of an outside party. The custodial credit risk for investments is the risk that, in the event of the failure of the
counterparty to a transaction, a government will not be able to recover the value of investment or collateral securities that are in
the possession of an outside party. As of June 30, 2024 and 2023, the bank balances of uninsured deposits totaled $12.5 million
and $7.0 million, respectively.
Interest Rate Risk — Interest rate risk is the extent that changes in interest rates relevant to debt investments will adversely
affect the fair value of those investments. These investments include certain short-term cash equivalents, various long-term items,
and restricted assets by maturity in years. The University minimizes the risk of the fair value of securities falling due to changes
in market interest rates by ensuring securities have effective maturities of less than a year. MMDT and permitted money market
accounts have effective maturities of less than one year, thereby limiting the interest rate risk.
Credit Risk — Credit risk is the risk that an issuer of an investment will not fulfill its obligation to the holder of the investment.
The risk is measured by the assignment of a rating by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization. MMDT and permitted
money market accounts are not rated.

Pooled Investments — Fund I represents the endowment funds and University operating cash held at UMF. The endowment
funds include both donor-restricted endowments and quasi-endowments. The investment horizon for this portfolio is 5 to 10 years.
Short-Term Pool represents a portion of the operating cash balances of the University that have been transferred to UMF for
investment purposes only. This portfolio has a high degree of liquidity. The asset allocation is 25% U.S. equities and 75% short-
term corporate bonds. The University treasurer has the authority to request the return of funds at any time to meet the operating
needs of the University.
In addition to Foundation Agency funds, the Foundations’ assets also include investments not reported within the University’s

Custodial Credit Risk — Investment securities are exposed to custodial credit risk if they are uninsured or not registered in the
name of the University and are held by either the counterparty or the counterparty’s trust department or agent but not in the
University’s name.
The carrying amounts of cash balances with uninsured or uncollateralized deposits were $6.1 million and $5.3 million, at June 30,
2024 and 2023, respectively.
The University held non-money market investments with a fair market value of $1.7 billion and $1.5 billion at June 30, 2024 and
2023, respectively. In the event of negligence due to the University’s custodian and/or investment manager(s), it is expected that
the investment balances would be fully recovered. However, these amounts are subject to both interest rate risk and credit risk.
Concentration of Credit Risk — As of June 30, 2024 and 2023, there is no concentration of investments from one issuer equal
to or greater than 5% of the portfolio. Investments issued or guaranteed by the U.S. government, as well as investments in mutual
funds and other pooled investments are excluded from consideration when evaluating concentration risk.
Credit Risk — The University’s Investment Policy and Guidelines Statement allows each portfolio manager full discretion within
the parameters of the investment guidelines specific to that manager. Nationally recognized statistical rating organizations, such
as Standards & Poor’s (S&P) assign credit ratings to security issues and issuers that indicate a measure of potential credit risk
to investors.

40 UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT 2024

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Fair Value Measurement — Fair value represents the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability
in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The University categorizes these assets and
liabilities measured at fair value using a three-tiered hierarchy based on the valuation methodologies employed. The hierarchy is
defined as follows:
Level 1 — Inputs to the valuation methodology are unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets
that are available at the measurement date.
Level 2 — Inputs to the valuation methodology include:
- Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets;
- Quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets;
- Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability;
- Inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means.
Level 3 — Inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement. Unobservable
inputs reflect the University’s own assumptions about the inputs market participants would use in pricing the asset or
liability (including assumption about risk). Unobservable inputs are developed based on the best information available in the
circumstances and may include the University’s own data.
When available, quoted prices are used to determine fair value. When quoted prices in active markets are available, investments
are classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. The University’s Level 1 investments primarily consist of investments in U.S.
Treasury obligations, equity securities, and mutual funds. When quoted prices in active markets are not available, fair values are
based on evaluated prices received from the University’s investment custodian in conjunction with a third-party service provider
and are reported within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. The inputs for Level 2 include, but are not limited to, pricing models
such as benchmarking yields, reported trades, broker-dealer quotes, issuer spreads and benchmarking securities, among others.
The University’s Level 2 investments primarily consist of investments in U.S. government and agency obligations, asset-backed
securities, and corporate debt securities that did not trade on the University’s fiscal year end date.
UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT 2024 41

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
As a practical expedient to estimate the fair value of the University’s interests, certain investments in commingled funds and
limited partnerships are reported at the net asset value (NAV) determined by the fund managers. Because these investments are
not readily marketable, their estimated fair values may differ from the values that would have been assigned had a ready market
for such investments existed, and such differences could be material. As of June 30, 2024 and 2023, the University had no plans or
intentions to sell such investments at amounts different from NAV.

6. UMass Memorial Medical Center
In 1998, the University entered into an Amended and Restated Definitive Agreement (Definitive Agreement whereby the University
separated its clinical health care operations from its ongoing academic operations. As part of the Definitive Agreement, the
University entered into a 99-year Academic Affiliation and Support Agreement (Affiliation Agreement), expiring on June 30, 2097,
with UMass Memorial (successor to the clinical operations) whereby UMass Memorial is required to make annual inflation adjusted
payments to the University provided the University continues to operate a medical school. For the years ending June 30, 2024 and
2023, the inflation adjusted income recognized totaled approximately $22.9 million and $21.6 million and was recorded as other
operating revenue in the accompanying financial statements.
Other provisions of the Definitive agreement include terms for reimbursement of shared services, cross-funded employees, and
other agreed upon activities. For the years ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, the reimbursements received for services provided to
UMass Memorial and which offset the University’s operating expenses were $181.4 million and $156.3 million, respectively. Included
in these amounts are payroll paid by the University on behalf of UMass Memorial in an agency capacity, recorded as an offset to
operating expenses, in the amount of $108.0 million and $111.0 million for the years ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
As of June 30, 2024 and 2023, the University has recorded a receivable, from UMass Memorial, in the amount of $20.4 million

8. Business Acquisition
Effective September 1, 2021, the University acquired Brandman University in exchange for $139.3 million and the assumption of
all Brandman’s existing liabilities totaling $59.2 million. The acquisition included all of the assets of Brandman University totaling
$150.7 million.
The transaction resulted in deferred outflows of resources of $47.8 million as of the acquisition date. The deferred outflows of
resources are being amortized over a 10-year period. As of June 30, 2024 and 2023 there were $35.9 and $40.7 million, respectively
of deferred outflows of resources remaining associated with the acquisition.
9. Public‒Private Partnerships and Leases
The University has entered into three Public-Private Partnerships (PPP), one of which meets the definition of a service concession
arrangement (SCA). The remaining two PPPs do not meet the definition of an SCA.
PPPs Meeting the Definition of an SCA
On July 7, 2022, the University entered into an SCA with Mass Ave Housing Partners LLC (Project Company), to carry out the design,
construction, financing, operation, management, and maintenance of a portion of the Student Housing Project on the Amherst
campus consisting of approximately 600 beds of undergraduate apartment-style housing and approximately 200 beds of graduate
student apartment-style housing and related infrastructure, including parking. The Project Company will manage, maintain, and
operate the Student Housing Facilities and be entitled to all user fees associated with the project as defined, for a term of 65-years.
At the end of the arrangement, operation of the Student Housing Project will be transferred to the University. The accumulated
cost of construction of the Student Housing Project was $245.8 million. In accordance with GASB Statement No. 94, Public-Private
and Public-Public Partnerships and Availability Payment Arrangements, the University recorded an asset and corresponding deferred
inflow for the cost of the Student Housing Project when the related asset was placed into service in January 2024.
In accordance with SCA agreements, the University received from the Project Company a lump-sum payment of $20.0 million,
which is included in other noncurrent liabilities in the accompanying financial statements. The payment gets amortized over the
term of the agreement.
PPPs Not Meeting the Definition of an SCA
On November 8, 2016, the University entered into an agreement with Provident Commonwealth Educational Resources, Inc. (PCER),
a Massachusetts not-for-profit corporation to construct and operate for 40 years a 1,082-bed student housing facility at its Boston
campus (Boston Project). The Boston Project reverts to the University in 2056.
The Boston Project was financed with $130.1 million of revenue bonds issued on October 26, 2016 (Series 2016 Bonds) by
the Massachusetts Development Finance Agency (MassDevelopment) pursuant to a Loan and Trust Agreement between
MassDevelopment and PCER. Neither the Authority, University nor Boston campus have pledged revenues to secure the payment
of the Series 2016 bonds or have any obligation with respect to payment of the Series 2016 bonds.
On November 14, 2018, the University entered into an agreement with Provident Commonwealth Educational Resources II, Inc.
(PCER II), a Massachusetts not-for-profit corporation to construct and operate for 45 years a 1,210-bed student housing facility at
its Dartmouth campus (Dartmouth Project). The Dartmouth Project reverts to the University in 2064.
The Dartmouth Project was financed with $132.2 million of revenue bonds issued on November 14, 2018 (Series 2018 Bonds)
by the Massachusetts Development Finance Agency (MassDevelopment) pursuant to a Loan and Trust Agreement between
MassDevelopment and PCER II. Neither the Authority, University nor Dartmouth campus have pledged revenues to secure the
payment of the Series 2018 bonds or have any obligation with respect to payment of the Series 2018 bonds.
Management evaluated the applicability of relevant GASB guidance against the underlying Boston and Dartmouth Project
agreements and indentures and has concluded that the associated debt should not be recognized on the financial statements of
the University.
In accordance with GASB Statement No. 94, PPP’s that do not meet the definition of an SCA are recorded based upon the operators’
(PCER and PCER II) estimated carrying value of the underlying PPP assets as of the expected date of transfer in ownership to
UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT 2024 47

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
the University. As of June 30, 2024 and 2023, the estimated carrying value of the assets upon ownership transfer for the Boston
Project (2056) and the Dartmouth Project (2064) were deemed immaterial and therefore no amounts have been recorded in the
accompanying financial statements.
Ground Leases
Pursuant to the Boston and Dartmouth Project PPP agreements, the University entered into the following ground leases. For
the Boston Project, commencing January 1, 2019, and continuing for a term of 40 years, the annual rental amount payable to the
University is $1.0 million. For the Dartmouth Project, commencing January 1, 2021, and continuing for a term of 45 years, the rental
amount payable to the University is $0.6 million, increasing by 3% every five years.
As of June 30, 2024 and 2023 the University has current receivables past due of $4.5 million and $3.9 million, respectively, related
to the Boston and Dartmouth ground leases.
Direct Financing Lease
On October 27, 2009, the University entered into an agreement to lease its facility located on Morrissey Boulevard in Dorchester,
Massachusetts (the Facility) to the Edward M. Kennedy Institute for the United States Senate (EMKI), a charitable corporation
registered in the District of Columbia. The lease agreement provides for an initial term of ninety-nine years commencing in October
2009, and thereafter, at the option of EMKI, may be extended for two additional ninety-nine-year periods.
EMKI has an option to purchase the Facility for one dollar at any time after the earlier of: (i) payment of no less than 51% or

Lessee Leases and Subscriptions
The University is a lessee for various noncancellable real estate leases.
The University has executed long-term leases with the Commonwealth, acting by and through the Trustees, covering the land on
which facilities owned by the Building Authority are located on the University’s campuses. These leases call for nominal annual
payments to the Commonwealth. Certain of these leases renew automatically for subsequent five- or ten-year periods unless the
Building Authority notifies the University that it does not wish to renew. Other leases require the Building Authority to notify the
University of its desire to renew. As of June 30, 2024, all leases with the Commonwealth were in good standing and any leases
requiring action by the Building Authority during the year to facilitate their renewals were properly renewed.
As provided in the Enabling Act, each of the above-referenced leases also terminates when the Building Authority no longer has
any bonds outstanding, at which time all Building Authority property becomes the property of the Commonwealth.
In addition, the University has entered into SBITA’s for various information technology agreements and are identified as
subscriptions within tables 18 and 19.
Tables 18 and 19 present a summary of right of use asset activity during the years ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

12. Fringe Benefits
During the years ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, the Commonwealth paid $544.1 million and $467.7 million, respectively, for the
University’s portion of fringe benefit costs which includes pension expense, health insurance for active employees and retirees,
and terminal leave. Of this amount, the University reimbursed the Commonwealth $157.8 million and $145.8 million during the
years ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The remaining portion is included in revenue as state appropriations.
13. Benefit Plans
Defined Benefit Plan
The Massachusetts State Employees’ Retirement System (MSERS) is a public employee retirement system (PERS) that administers a
cost-sharing multi-employer defined benefit plan covering substantially all employees of the Commonwealth including University
employees.
MSERS provides retirement, disability, survivor and death benefits to members and their beneficiaries. Massachusetts General
Laws (MGL) establishes uniform benefit and contribution requirements for all contributory PERS. These requirements provide for
superannuation retirement allowance benefits up to a maximum of 80% of a member’s highest three-year to five-year average
annual rate of regular compensation depending on the date of hire. Benefit payments are based upon a member’s age, length of
creditable service, and group creditable service, and group classification. The authority for amending these provisions rests with
the Legislature.
56 UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT 2024

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The MSERS’ funding policies were established by Chapter 32 of MGL. The Legislature has the authority to amend these policies.
The annuity portion of the MSERS retirement allowance is funded by employees, who contribute a percentage of their regular
compensation. Costs of administering the plan are funded out of plan assets.
Member contributions for MSERS vary depending on the most recent date of membership, as shown in Table 30:
TABLE 30 – Membership Contributions
Hire date % of Compensation
Prior to 1975 5% of regular compensation
1975–1983 7% of regular compensation
1984–6/30/1996 8% of regular compensation
7/1/1996–present 9% of regular compensation except for State Police which is 12% of regular compensation
1979–present An additional 2% of regular compensation in excess of $30,000
In addition, members within this group who join the system on or after April 2, 2012 will have their withholding rate reduced to 6%
after achieving 30 years of creditable service.
The University makes contributions on behalf of the employees through a fringe benefit charge assessed by the Commonwealth.
The fringe benefit charge amounted to $220.7 million and $185.1 million for the years ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
Annual covered payroll was 77.7% and 76.6% of annual total payroll for the University for the years ended June 30, 2024 and
2023, respectively.
Pension Liabilities, Pension Expense, and Deferred Outflows of Resources
and Deferred Inflows of Resources Related to Pensions
The net pension liability as of June 30, 2024 was determined based on a measurement date of June 30, 2023 from an actuarial
valuation as of January 1, 2023 rolled forward to June 30, 2023. The net pension liability measured as of June 30, 2023 was
determined based on a measurement date of June 30, 2022 from an actuarial valuation as of January 1, 2022 rolled forward to
June 30, 2022. There are no significant changes known which would impact the total pension liability between the measurement
date and the reporting date, other than typical plan experience.
At June 30, 2024 and 2023, the University reported a liability of $384.4 million and $444.8 million, respectively, for its proportionate
share of MSERS’s net pension liability, respectively. The University’s proportion of the net pension liability was based on a
projection of the University’s long-term share of contributions to the pension plan relative to the total projected contributions of
all participating entities, as actuarially determined. The University’s proportion of the pension plan at measurement dates of June
30, 2023 and 2022 was 2.6% and 3.2%, respectively.
For the fiscal years ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, the University recognized net pension expense of $21.4 million and $28.1 million,
respectively.
The University reported its proportionate share of MSERS’s deferred outflows of resources and deferred inflows of resources

Investment Allocation
Investment assets of MSERS are with the Commonwealth’s Pension Reserves Investment Trust (PRIT) Fund. The long-term expected
rate of return on pension plan investments was determined using a building-block method in which best-estimate ranges of
expected future rates of return are developed for each major asset class. These ranges are combined to produce the long-term
expected rate of return by weighting the expected future rates of return by the target asset allocation percentage.
Best estimates of geometric rates of return for each major asset class included in the PRIT Fund’s target asset allocation as of June
30, 2023 and 2022 are summarized in Tables 35 and 36:

Discount Rate
The discount rate used to measure the total pension liability was 7.00% for both June 30, 2023 and 2022. The projection of cash
flows used to determine the discount rate assumed that plan member contributions will be made at the current contribution rates
and the Commonwealth’s contributions will be made at rates equal to the difference between actuarially determined contribution
rates and the member rates. Based on those assumptions, the net position was projected to be available to make all projected
future benefit payments of current plan members. Therefore, the long-term expected rate of return on pension plan investments
was applied to all periods of projected benefit payments to determine the total pension liability.

Defined Contribution Plan
Non-vested faculty and certain other employees of the University can opt out of MSERS and participate in a defined contribution
plan, the Optional Retirement Plan (ORP), administered by the Commonwealth’s Department of Higher Education. As of June
30, 2024 and 2023, there were 2,316 and 2,255 participants in the ORP, respectively. Employees contribute at the same rate as
members in MSERS and the Commonwealth matches 5.0% of employee contributions, minus certain expenses such as cost of
insurances and administrative expenses for a net matching contribution of 4.3%. The Commonwealth contributed $10.9 million
and $9.6 million in FY2024 and FY2023, respectively. University employees contributed $25.8 million and $23.1 million in 2024 and
2023, respectively.
The MSERS and ORP retirement contributions of employees who become members of MSERS or ORP after January 1, 2011 are
subject to a state compensation limit. Effective January 1, 2011, the University established a defined contribution plan, the University
of Massachusetts 401(a) Retirement Gap Plan (Gap Plan). Employees with MSERS or ORP membership dates after January 1, 2011
are eligible to participate in the Gap Plan. Eligible employees begin participation in the Gap Plan when their regular compensation
exceeds the state compensation limit in effect for the plan year, at which point their contributions to MSERS or ORP are required to
stop for the remainder of the plan year. Employee contributions to the Gap Plan are mandatory and at the same rate as MSERS and
ORP. The University contributes 5% of employee compensation exceeding 64% of the Compensation Limit up to the Compensation

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Limit. The Compensation limits for FY2024 and FY2023 were $345,000 and $330,000, respectively. As of June 30, 2024 and 2023,
the plan assets of the Gap Plan were $14.4 million and $10.2 million, respectively.
In addition, UMG offers a defined contribution retirement plan. Employees working at least 20 hours a week are eligible to
participate in the plan after 90 days of employment. UMG contributes 3% of each employee’s eligible annual salary, as defined
by the plan. Eligible employees may contribute up to 6% of their eligible salary and UMG matches their contributions. UMG’s total
contribution to the plan was $2.5 million and $3.1 million for FY2024 and FY2023, respectively.
Other component units may opt to offer defined contribution retirement plans. These are not material in relation to the University
as a whole and detailed plan information are therefore not presented.
14. Other Postemployment Benefits
The Commonwealth administers the State Retirees’ Benefit Trust (SRBT), a single employer defined Postemployment Benefits
Other Than Pensions (OPEB) Plan (the Plan). Benefits are managed by the Group Insurance Commission (GIC) and investments are
managed by the Commonwealth’s Pension Reserves Investment Management Board (PRIM).
Benefits Provided
Under Chapter 32A of the MGL the Commonwealth is required to provide certain health care and life insurance benefits for retired
employees of the Commonwealth. Substantially all of the Commonwealth’s employees may become eligible for these benefits if
they reach retirement age while working for the Commonwealth. Eligible retirees are required to contribute a specified percentage
of the health care/benefit costs, which are comparable to contributions required from employees.
Employer and employee contribution rates are set in MGL. The Commonwealth recognizes its share of the costs on an actuarial
basis. As of June 30, 2024 and 2023, the retirees’ share of premium costs is between 10%–20%, depending on the date of hire.
OPEB Liabilities, OPEB Expense, and Deferred Outflows of Resources and
Deferred Inflows of Resources Related to OPEB
The total OPEB liability as of June 30, 2024 was determined based on a measurement date of June 30, 2023 from an actuarial
valuation as of January 1, 2023 rolled forward to June 30, 2023. The total OPEB liability as of June 30, 2023 was determined based
on a measurement date of June 30, 2022 from an actuarial valuation as of January 1, 2022 rolled forward to June 30, 2022. There
are no significant changes known which would impact the total OPEB liability between the measurement date and the reporting
date, other than typical plan experience.
As of June 30, 2024 and 2023, the University reported a liability of $408.9 million and $559.8 million, respectively, for its
proportionate share of the OPEB liability. The University’s proportion of the OPEB liability was based on a projection of the
University’s long-term share of contributions to the OPEB plan relative to the total projected contributions of all participating
entities, actuarially determined. The University’s proportion of the OPEB plan at measurement dates of June 30, 2023 and 2022
was 2.88% and 4.19%, respectively.

Discount Rate
The discount rates used to measure the total OPEB liability as of June 30, 2024 and 2023 were 4.34% and 4.30%, respectively. These
rates were based on a blend of the Bond Buyer Index rates of 3.65% and 3.54%, respectively, as of the measurement dates June 30,
2023 and 2022 and the long term rate of return on Plan investments of 7.00%. The plan’s fiduciary net position was not projected
to be available to make all projected future benefit payments for current plan members. Based on the stated assumptions and the
projection of cash flows, the Plan’s Fiduciary Net Position and future contributions were not sufficient to finance the future benefit
payments of the current plan members. Therefore, the long-term expected rate of return on SRBT investments was applied to
projected benefit payments through year 2042 and the municipal bond rate was applied to all remaining future years to determine
the total OPEB liability.

17. Commitments and Contingencies
In June 2019, the University entered into an agreement to lease property located at 200 Mount Vernon Street in Dorchester,
Massachusetts to an unrelated party (the Developer). The Developer plans to develop a mixed-use opportunity at the site. Under
the terms of the agreement, the Developer, subject to certain contingencies, may enter into a 99-year ground lease for an initial
fixed rent upfront payment of up to $235.0 million, with a minimum payment of $192.5 million. It is an ongoing transaction to be
negotiated on terms acceptable to the University while the parties agree to a closing date. At June 30, 2024, the University held
$26.4 million as a fully nonrefundable deposit. Subsequent to the year end, an additional $0.3 million was released to the University
as a nonrefundable deposit. The University has the ability to terminate the agreement subject to the terms of the agreement.
The University has outstanding purchase commitments with contractors for the construction of certain facilities as of June 30, 2024
and 2023 of $179.4 million and $193.1 million, respectively.
As of June 30, 2024 and 2023, the Authority had a working capital deficiency of $77.4 million and $125.9 million, respectively. As
stated in the various contracts between the Authority and the University, the University is required to provide necessary funding
to the Authority to meet its obligations through June 30, 2025 and beyond.
From time to time, the University is involved in routine litigation that arises in the ordinary course of business. There are no
significant legal proceedings to which the University is a party for which management believes the ultimate outcome would have
a material adverse effect on the University’s financial position.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The UMass Amherst Foundation, UMass Medical School Foundation and the UMLARC are not material in relation to the other
blended component units, nor the University as a whole, and therefore not presented in the above condensed information.
19. Discretely Presented Component Units
As described in Note 1, UMF and UMDF are discretely presented component units. These Foundations are presented in the
aggregate in the accompanying financial statements. Following is supplemental information on UMF’s non-agency investments,
which is not included in its entirety elsewhere in these financial statements.
This note excludes agency funds held with the Foundation that are not the University’s in the amount of $20.5 million and $18.8
million as of June 30, 2024 and 2023. UMF’s investment portfolio represents substantially all of the aggregate discretely presented
component units. This note does not include investment information for UMDF given the immaterial nature of UMDF’s balances
and activities.
Investments
UMF’s disclosure regarding investments in debt and equity securities, owned by the University, is captured in Note 4. Additional
disclosure related to UMF’s non-agency investments is noted on page 74.
UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT 2024 73

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Custodial Credit Risk
UMF maintains depository, payroll, disbursement, receipt, and imprest accounts. In addition to bank account deposits, UMF held
money market instruments which are classified as investments. Interest bearing and money market accounts carry Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation (FDIC) insurance up to $250,000 per account. None of the accounts are collateralized above the FDIC
insured amounts.
Concentration of Credit Risk — As of June 30, 2024 and 2023, there is no concentration of investments from one issuer equal
or greater than 5% of the portfolio. Investments issued or guaranteed by the U.S. government, as well as investments in mutual
funds and other pooled investments are excluded from consideration when evaluating concentration risk.
Credit Risk — UMF’s investment policy allows each portfolio manager full discretion within the parameters of the investment
guidelines specific to that manager. Nationally recognized statistical rating organizations, such as Standards & Poor’s (S&P) assign
credit ratings to security issues and issuers that indicate a measure of potential credit risk to investors.

fixed income component of the investment portfolio by asset class by limiting investments through targeted allocations to different
asset classes.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
20. Related Party Transactions
Members of the University’s Board of Trustees and Officers may, from time to time, be associated, either directly or indirectly, with
companies doing business with the University. The University requires an annual disclosure of significant financial interests in,
family relationships, significant management function, or substantial business with entities doing business with the University by
members of the University’s Board of Trustees and Officers. When such relationships exist, measures are taken to assess potential
conflicts of interest to protect the best interests of the University and ensure compliance with relevant conflict of interest laws and
policy. The University’s conflict of interest policy also requires, among other things, that no member of the Board of Trustees or
Officer may participate in any decision in which they (or an immediate family member) has a material financial interest.
21. Subsequent Events
Subsequent to the year ended June 30, 2024, and through December 18, 2024, the University rolled $52.8 million of tax-exempt
and $5.25 million of taxable commercial paper with interest rates ranging from 3.31% to 5.15% with a maturity date of December
4, 2024, to fund construction projects at the Boston and Lowell campuses.
For purposes of determining the effects of subsequent events on these financial statements, management has evaluated events
subsequent to June 30, 2024 and through December 18, 2024, the date on which the financial statements were issued.

2 23 April 2024 University of Massachusetts, MA: Update to credit analysis

MOODY'S INVESTORS SERVICE U.S. PUBLIC FINANCE
Profile
University of Massachusetts is a large public university system serving the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. The system includes five
campuses: Amherst (flagship), Boston, Dartmouth, Lowell, and Worcester (medical school); and UMass Global. Included in UMass'
operations is forHealth Consulting, a public, nonprofit healthcare consulting organization. Fiscal 2023 operating revenue was $4.1
billion and fall 2023 enrollment was 64,855 full-time equivalent (FTE) students.
Detailed credit considerations
Market position
The University of Massachusetts' student demand will remain sound due to its role as an essential provider of public higher education
across multiple campuses, including the state's flagship public university, with sizable scale and scope of operations. The system's
strategic and data-driven enrollment focus supported the fall 2023 year-over-year increase in headcount at all but the Lowell campus.
Enrollment challenges will remain given employment alternatives and high school age demographic declines.
The university's initiative for increasing its online capacity and presence to reach a non-traditional student base was established
with its September 2021 partnership with Brandman University, a California-based nonprofit online provider that was a component
of Chapman University. Enrollment and financial performance of UMass Global, a blended unit of the university, is lagging original
forecasts due to slower than anticipated regulatory approvals. FTE enrollment for fiscal 2023 was just under 15,000 students.
University of Massachusetts maintains a sizable and growing research profile, which enhances its reputation and revenue diversity.
Research activity, totaling $586 million in fiscal 2023 or nearly 15% of expenses, is concentrated at the Amherst and Worcester
campuses in biomedical, applied materials and sustainability areas.
Operating performance
UMass' active and disciplined fiscal oversight and expense management, guided by its financial accountability framework, will continue
to underpin steady positive operating performance. Historically strong and consistent state operating appropriations, comprising
25% of fiscal 2023 revenue, in addition to solid capital support, contribute to the university’s excellent credit quality and also link the
university closely to the state's credit quality. State support for a portion of increased salary costs associated with collective bargaining
units is favorable to the university's credit profile. Across the $4.1 billion enterprise, the fiscal 2023 EBIDA margin was a sound 15% and
provided 2.3x debt service coverage.

Wealth and liquidity
UMass' overall wealth levels and liquidity will remain sound, benefitting active financial management of investments, ongoing
philanthropic efforts at the individual campuses, and modest annual surpluses. Total cash and investments of $3.2 billion for fiscal 2023
was up a strong 57% in the fiscal 2019-23 period, driven largely by strong returns in fiscal 2021. Wealth covers operating expenses by

0.8x, below the Aa2-median of 1.1x. While gift activity is supportive to asset growth and investments, the fiscal 2021-23 average gift
revenue of $61 million is less than the Aa2-median of $137 million.
Similarly, monthly liquidity will remain modest relative to rated peers. Monthly liquidity of $1.3 billion translated to 136 monthly days
cash on hand for 2023, relative to the Aa2-median of 208 days. Favorably, UMass' has limited calls on liquidity with a fixed rated debt
portfolio. Further, a $150 million revolving line of credit provides additional liquidity access.

Leverage and coverage
The university's leverage is elevated relative to peers, but will remain manageable due to consistency of operating performance and
prudent capital planning, acknowledging its excellent financial policy. Fiscal 2023 total cash and investments covered total adjusted
debt by 0.6x, relative to the Aa2-median of 0.7x. All of UMass' $3 billion of direct debt at fiscal end 2023 is fixed rate and amortizing.
Other debtlike liabilities totaling $1.7 billion include the Moody's adjusted net pension liability and alternative financing arrangements
representing three developer-owned student housing projects. Total adjusted debt was $5.2 billion for fiscal 2023, rising to $5.3 billion
including UMass' planned new money Series 2024-1 financing.
UMass will continue to have capital needs over its multi-campus system. Funding sources for the multi-year $2.1 billion budget include
reserves, gifts, state capital support, alternative financing arrangements, and debt. The debt portion of the capital plan of about $789
million is being issued over multiple years, with a tranche issued in fiscal 2022, the current planned Series 2024-1 bonds, and a roughly
$142 million issue anticipated in fiscal 2026. For interim financing needs, UMass has two commercial paper programs with a combined
$200 million authorization, split between the Series 2013A and 2013B notes. Both programs are supported by SBPAs with TD Bank.
The university has agreements with third party developers to operate student housing projects, which due to the nature of the projects
on campus land, serving university constituents and eventually returning to the university, Moody's includes as alternative financing
arrangements. Outstanding debt associated with these projects at the UMass-Boston and UMass-Dartmouth campuses, totaling
$255.4 million, are included in UMass' adjusted debt. A third project at UMass-Amherst is a service concession agreement, fully
developer-financed, opened in fall 2023.

ESG considerations
University of Massachusetts' ESG credit impact score is CIS-3
Exhibit 6
ESG credit impact score
Source: Moody's Ratings
University of Massachusetts’ (CIS-3) indicates that ESG considerations have a limited impact on the current rating with potential for
greater negative impact over time. UMass’ large scale and scope of operations, state support and active financial management help
mitigate ESG risk exposure.
Exhibit 7
ESG issuer profile scores
Source: Moody's Ratings
Environmental
Environmental risks are (E-2). UMass’ multiple locations in Massachusetts provide for varying, but manageable levels of environmental
risks. The Boston and Dartmouth campuses are exposed to sea level rise, though infrastructure upgrades have provided material risk
mitigation. Regarding carbon transition, all five UMass campuses have or are completing decarbonization plans. UMass aims to align
with other state agencies to meet net zero greenhouse gas emission goals by 2050.
Social
UMass’ (S-3) reflects favorable customer relations with the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, evidenced by solid operating and capital
state support, while its large sponsored research enterprise signals strong focus on grantors including the federal agencies. However,
weak demographic trends for in-state students, UMass’ core market, and tuition affordability sensitivities underpin elevated social risks.
Diversity among the five UMass campuses, with a solid draw for the flagship university, somewhat limits impact. Collective bargaining
unit exposure introduces human capital risks, though these are partially mitigated by state oversight of collective bargaining and
benefits, along with state reimbursement for a significant portion of any cost increases.
Governance
UMass’ (G-2) balances slightly elevated risks around board and organization structure with more favorable financial strategy and
risk management. Active financial management acknowledges the university’s strong internal controls, development of specific
reserve requirements and expense efficiencies. The ability to maintain stability in core revenue streams speaks to management
credibility. Board structure risks are introduced by the selection process, with the majority of the 19 voting members appointed by

the Massachusetts governor. This structure adds exposure to potential political considerations which could create misalignment to
institutional priorities. Recent reliance on student housing public-private partnerships and the September 2021 partnership with a
California-based online provider, Brandman University, introduces some organizational structure risks.
