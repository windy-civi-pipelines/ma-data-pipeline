Section 1:
The Commonwealth of Massachusetts
Central Voter Registry
Report to the House and Senate Committees on Ways and Means
By:
Office of Secretary of the Commonwealth
January 28, 2025
One Ashburton Place, 17th Floor, Boston, Massachusetts 02108
This report is being submitted as required by Item 0521-0001 of the budget,
which requires “the secretary of the commonwealth shall submit a report to the house
and senate committees on ways and means detailing voter registration activity and a
breakdown, by region, of active voters in the commonwealth.”
The Voter Registration Information System (VRIS) was originally developed in
response to the National Voter Registration Act of 1995 (also known as 'Motor Voter')
and implementing state legislation (General Laws chapter 51, section 47C) and
regulations (950 CMR § 58.00 et seq). It has since been modified to accommodate the
requirements of the federal Help America Vote Act of 2002 (HAVA) and other
requirements set forth in state laws subsequently enacted.
VRIS is the statewide database of registered voters and residents on which all
cities and towns in Massachusetts are required to maintain certain voting and election
related information. VRIS also is used for maintenance of local census information,
which is collected by municipal election officials in accordance with section 4 of chapter
51 of the General Laws. VRIS also includes election administration functionality and
election result reporting. VRIS supports over 1,000 users in each of the 351 cities and
towns of the Commonwealth through operation of a Help Desk.
This Office provides training for local election officials virtually and through
presentations made at conferences of the Massachusetts City and Town Clerks’
Associations on using the system to comply with state and federal laws, including
processing vote by mail applications and conducting voter list maintenance.
The data included in this report covers the period from the 2022 election through
the 2024 election.1 This data is also reported to the Election Assistance Commission as
required by HAVA and contained in the Election Administration and Voting Survey. A
breakdown by city and town is available upon request.
1 The exact dates for the reporting period are from October 29, 2022 to October 26, 2024, which are the deadlines for
voter registration before the applicable elections.
