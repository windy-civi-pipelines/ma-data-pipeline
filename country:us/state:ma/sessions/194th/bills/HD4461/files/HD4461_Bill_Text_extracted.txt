Section 1:
340B/High-Cost Drugs Impact Report
Summary
hospital's access to the discounted purchase of prescription drugs to the full extent
permitted under section 340B of the federal Public Health Service Act, as codified under
42 U.S.C. § 256b, the Secretary of Health and Human Services is required to submit a
report to the Joint Committee on Health Care Financing and the Senate and House
Committees on Ways and Means detailing:
(A) the proposed restriction or limitation;
(B) the anticipated aggregate savings to the Commonwealth;
(C) the estimated fiscal impact of the restriction or limitation on each affected
hospital; and
(D) the manner in which the Secretary plans to mitigate the fiscal impact, which
may include measures to maintain savings already achieved by providers under
said 42 U.S.C. § 256b.
The MassHealth program intends to limit payment for twenty drugs for MassHealth
members if purchased through the 340B Drug Pricing Program to allow the
Commonwealth to benefit from value-based contracts entered into by MassHealth.
These twenty drugs consist of eleven drugs that are already excluded from coverage if
purchased through the 340B Drug Pricing Program, and the nine new drugs excluded
from coverage if purchased through the 340B Drug Pricing Program described below.
MassHealth will continue to pay for these twenty drugs for MassHealth members when
purchased outside of the 340B Drug Pricing Program, and this policy will therefore not
impact MassHealth member access to these drugs, or the ability of hospitals to receive
payment for these drugs when purchased through the 340B program and provided to
non-MassHealth patients. This report details the proposed limitation and its anticipated
fiscal impact and mitigation.
(A) Proposed Restriction or Limitation
New 340 Drugs Excluded from MassHealth Coverage
MassHealth has designated the following nine drugs as non-payable when purchased
through the 340B drug pricing program and provided to MassHealth members:
• Amtagvi (lifileucel)
• Beqvez (fidanacogene elaparvovec)
• Casgevy (exagamglogene autotemcel)
• Elevidys (delandistrogene moxeparvovec-rokl)
• Lenmeldy (atidarsagene autotemcel)
1
• Lyfgenia (lovotibeglogene autotemcel)
• Omisirge (omidubicel-onlv)
• Roctavian (valoctocogene roxaparvovec-rvox)
• Tecelra (afamitresgene autoleucel)
In accordance with 130 CMR 406.404(D): Participation in the 340B Drug Pricing
Program for Outpatient Pharmacy Services, these drugs are high-cost drugs with a
gross cost of $100,000 or more per utilizer per year.
This policy has no impact on MassHealth’s coverage of medically necessary drugs for
MassHealth members. This policy affects only the method by which specific high-cost
drugs may be purchased when provided to MassHealth members, and does not impact
the use of 340B drugs for other patients.
MassHealth will implement this limitation no sooner than August 18, 2025.
(B) Anticipated Aggregate Savings to the Commonwealth
MassHealth has value-based payment (VBP) contracts tied to certain of these drugs and
may enter into VBP contracts covering other such drugs where payment for the drug is
tied to patient outcomes. VBP contracts allow drug manufacturers to stand behind their
products and take financial responsibility for clinical outcomes. These VBP contracts
protect the Commonwealth in the event the drugs to not perform as desired and
therefore potential savings are dependent on actual clinical outcomes. MassHealth is
unable to estimate such savings at this time, which will vary depending on the number
of value-based contracts entered into and the clinical outcomes for patients.
(C) Estimated Fiscal Impact of the Restrictions or Limitations on each
Affected Hospital
Each of the nine added drugs are already listed or will be listed on the MassHealth Acute
Hospital Carve-Out Drugs List, and providers are reimbursed at their actual acquisition
cost of the drug, regardless of method of purchase. This payment methodology will not
change. Hospitals will pay more to purchase the drug outside of the 340B Drug Pricing
Program but will be reimbursed at a corresponding higher amount. As such, any fiscal
impact of this policy is limited to temporary cash-flow impact. There are, however,
potential savings for the Commonwealth under the VBP contracts.
It is important to note that drug manufacturers are typically unwilling to pay rebates on
drugs purchased through the 340B Drug Pricing Program, and states cannot collect the
standard federal rebate on drugs purchased through the 340B program. Many
manufacturers are also unwilling to pay state-only rebates, including value-based
rebates, on a drug that does not have a standard federal rebate. Requiring these drugs to
be purchased outside of the 340B program for MassHealth members allows the
Commonwealth to benefit from the protections available through a value-based
contract.
2
(D) How the Secretary Plans to Mitigate the Fiscal Impact, which may
Include Measures to Maintain Savings Already Achieved by Providers
under 42 U.S.C. § 256b.
The Secretary of Health and Human Services does not anticipate there will be a fiscal
impact, so there will be no need to mitigate. MassHealth will provide notice to affected
providers for input by provider bulletin and may adjust this policy if it is determined
that there is a fiscal impact.
