Chair, House Committee on Ways and Means

Dear Chairman Michlewitz,
to prepare a report on the operations of a Regional Evaluation and Stabilization Unit (ESU) located inside the Hampden
County Correctional Center (HCCC), and the Western Massachusetts Regional Women’s Correctional Center
(WMRWCC) Evaluation and Stabilization Units (ESU). These units are designed to serve mentally unstable inmates of
the counties of Berkshire, Franklin, Hampden, Hampshire, and Worcester.
The ESU’s in Hampden and Middlesex counties are regional facilities for all Sheriff's Departments to utilize. The
ESU is a short term program (up to 14 days), designed to stabilize justice involved individuals in psychiatric crisis due to
mental health or environmental stressors, in need of medication stabilization, increased support, or close observation to
assist in managing the offender at the correctional facility and to decrease the commitments to the state psychiatric
hospital. Hampden County and Middlesex County mental health services currently utilize standard definitions from the
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders and common criteria for ESU admission and discharge. Mental
health service providers from Hampden, Middlesex, and the other counties continue to meet quarterly to collaborate on
mental health services provided at the county correctional facilities.
The correctional system continues to see an increase in severity and chronicity of mental health issues in
individuals detained or sentenced in the correctional institutions. Many offenders enter the correctional system
destabilized due to chronic mental health symptoms, off psychotropic medication, detoxing, or situational issues. Most
mental health emergencies are generated in the early part of an offender’s incarceration, but some are due to ongoing
chronic mental health issues that are difficult to stabilize. The Mental Health Services at HCCC and WMRWCC manage
and treat individuals with chronic mental health issues with a coordinated effort between correctional and mental health
staff. The mental health clinician assesses an offender’s mental status and level of risk, and determines what crisis
intervention or treatment/care is needed. The goal of the mental health service is to stabilize the offender to function in
population, decrease psychiatric commitments, to participate in treatment/programing, maintain stabilization prior to their
return to the community, and ultimately to increase public safety.
Continued increase in the use of the ESU is significant for a low number of 18A psychiatric commitments to state
hospitals from the HCCC. HCCC had 6 commitments and WMRWCC had 7 commitments in fiscal year 2024. The ESU
continues to have a significant impact on the state by alleviating the caseload of incarcerated offenders at the psychiatric
state facilities; producing cost savings (see statistical report for details of cost savings.)
Mental health service providers in the other county correctional facilities (Berkshire, Franklin, Hampshire, and
Worcester) can directly refer male offenders to the HCCC ESU by calling the HCCC Mental Health Director or Clinical
Supervisor to arrange for the transfer. When an ESU out-of-county offender is stabilized, the Mental Health Director or
Clinical Supervisor connects with the mental health service provider at the referring facility to make recommendations
and review the mental health plan, and the offender is returned to the original county and mainstreamed back into general
population.
In addressing the deficiencies of mental health services (Section (E) of Chapter 38 8910-1010) for incarcerated
women, the in-patient Evaluation Stabilization Program/Unit, located within a secure treatment housing unit at the
WMRWCC, serves those who are either at imminent risk of harm to self or others, in psychiatric crisis, or are at-risk of
clinical decompensation. The goals of the ESU program are inmate safety, stabilization, and re-integration to general
population, all contributing to avoiding inmate 18A hospitalizations. The scope of ESU services includes daily
observation, evaluation/risk assessment, and staff consultation. In house respites were incorporated in each of the general
population living units, to assist and support the women within those units who are in need of increased support due to
mental health or situational/ adjustment issues.
HCCC and WMRWCC mental health services provide ongoing mental health treatment for offenders in the ESU
or in general population. These mental health services and treatments include referral and assessment for ESU admission,
respite, diagnostic evaluation, risk assessment, medication clinic and referrals, symptom and medication
monitoring/management, ongoing support, follow up support/treatment post discharge from the ESU, and collaboration
with community providers to assist with transitioning back into the community. Identification, referral, treatment, and
ongoing monitoring play critical roles in preventing suicide as well as decreasing the commitments to the state psychiatric
hospital. Mental health services provided at the HCCC and WMRWCC have decreased the risk of injury to correctional
staff and offenders and help to maintain and achieve state standards for mental health care for offenders and enhance
public safety.
