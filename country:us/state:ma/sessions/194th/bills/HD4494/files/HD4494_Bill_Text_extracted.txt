Enhanced Outpatient Treatment
with Eliot Community Human Services, focuses on providing assertive community outreach, engagement
and support to the most under-served behavioral health population in the greater Metro North area. The
Eliot EOT team is multidisciplinary and includes a Clinical Coordinator (LMHC), a Nurse Practitioner
(PMNHP), Case Managers (BA) a certified Recovery Coach and a Peer Specialist. EOT referrals are not
insurance based which frees the team from potential fee-based restrictions, utilization demands and
limitation on referrals to the program. In turn, this allows team members to focus on consistent engagement
based on an individual’s personalized needs, and their motivation and readiness for change. This low
threshold approach to enrollment allows police departments, community mental health collaboratives
(HUBs) and traditional providers struggling to support and engage clients to refer to EOT. In fact, of the
23 new admissions to EOT this past year, 31.3% were referred by police departments or HUBs and 50%
were referred directly by community providers. In 2023 the average length a client was active in EOT by
discharge was approximately 1.09 years.
Of the individuals served, 60% experienced a dual diagnosis of trauma related and substance abuse
disorders, resulting in compounding needs including:
➢ Homelessness and unstable housing;
➢ Mental health acuity resulting in reliance on Emergency Services and Emergency Departments;
➢ Current or past involvement with the criminal justice system;
➢ Disengagement and lack of health providers and health care;
➢ Poor social determinants of health; and
➢ Loss of community and natural supports.
Page 1
This target population demonstrates a great need for services; yet traditional behavioral health treatment
that would reduce stress, experience of symptoms and reliance on emergency-based services are not
effective at promoting engagement. This population often needs immediate access to treatment services and
community supports due to struggles navigating the behavioral health and larger health system. Even with
the implementation of Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs) and Behavioral Health Community
Partners (BH CPs), and Community Behavioral Health Centers (CBHC) we have seen that this population
struggle to engage with care coordination teams. This not only includes difficulty maintaining appointments
with their Primary Care Physicians (PCPs) and assigned ACO, BH CP and OneCare care coordinators, but
difficulty engaging with these entities to even start services. The EOT team has focused on creating
partnerships with care coordination entities as a means to increase EOT individuals access to care.
The team outreaches and engages clients in the community, at their homes, or wherever they are to ensure
services are provided. Engagement is the core strategy to deliver services and includes:
➢ In person outreach with consistent in-person follow up;
➢ Transportation;
➢ Assistance with accessing stable food and housing resources;
➢ Immediate and in time addiction services including recovery coaching and Medication Assistance
Treatment; and
➢ Support and advocacy within the criminal justice system.
The EOT team’s engagement strategies and approach to each individual has resulted in improving the
services and supports available to each individual serviced. Compared to admission, EOT clients have seen
up to a 90% increase in accessing benefits, including Food Stamps, SSDI, SSI, EAEDC, and Rep Payee
services.

The following includes information about service outcomes that were derived from an outcome tracking
measure that Eliot developed. EOT staff administer the outcomes measure directly with clients at 6-month
intervals. The responses are based on a scale from 1 to 5, with 1 being in crisis and 5 as thriving. (Tool is
attached for review).
At admission, most clients identified being in
crisis level and that acute or chronic symptoms
were affecting housing, employment, social
interactions, etc. Upon discharge, clients
identified as being safe and that their medical
symptoms were rarely affecting housing,
employment, and social interactions.
At admission, most clients identified being in
crisis level, meaning that they were a danger
to themselves or others, experienced recurring
suicidal ideation, and were experiencing
severe difficulties in their day-to-day life due
to their mental health. Upon discharge, clients
identified as building greater coping capacity.
At admission, most clients identified being
closer to crisis level, meaning they were
unemployed. Upon discharge, they were
employed full-time with adequate pay and
benefits.

At admission, most clients identified being
closer to crisis level, meaning they did not
have community involvement due to being
in “survival mode.” Upon discharge, clients
identified as having adequate social skills
and motivation to engage with their
community.
At admission, most clients identified being
in crisis level, meaning that they were
unable to complete any basic life skills
without assistance. Upon discharge, clients
identified as being able to complete
between 2 and 3 skills without assistance.
At admission many EOT clients identify
having legal status, which is often due to
untreated SMI, homelessness, poverty and
lack of natural supports. At discharge
clients reported an improvement in their
legal status due to accessing supportive
resources through the EOT program.

EOT client hospitalizations have shown a significant decrease compared to utilization at admission:
Over the past six years, EOT has seen an increase in the number of entities referring individuals for service
and the number of individuals we have served on an annual basis. Additionally, since 2018, EOT has been
able to partner with BH CP, ACOs, and OneCare providers to leverage and coordinate services. Even
though Eliot’s CCBHC program ended in October of 2023, the coordination with our new CBHC programs
in Lynn and Danvers have created another new avenue for cyclical collaboration of referrals from them to
EOT; as well stepping down EOT clients to a lower level of care in a team-based treatment environment,
when appropriate.
In 2023, a total of 36 persons were served, of which 23 clients were newly enrolled in 2023, which is an
increase compared to recent years and there have been several remarkable outcomes from the team’s hard
work. For example, EOT worked extensively with a client who was referred by Eliot’s CCBHC program
due to her complex needs and lack of engagement due to homelessness and executive functioning
difficulties. The client had long-term homelessness when she was referred to EOT, complex PTSD, was a
domestic violence survivor; and had major medical concerns which had resulted in emergency room
admissions without follow up care. She had significant loss in her hierarchy of needs, was malnourished,
pregnant, and living out of a tent with her dog and pet rat. It took the EOT team time to collaborate with
internal and external resources to develop a workable treatment plan. After a lot of work with community
partners and other Eliot departments, the EOT team was able to engage with the client, connect her to
medical care and get her safely housed.
EOT has been able to maintain a high percentage of face-to-face contact with individuals served. During
2023, over 80% of EOT’s services were provided face-to-face. As clients begin to stabilize and needs are
met, they often decrease contact from daily to multiple times weekly, weekly, and down to biweekly as
aftercare services are determined. In 2023, 85% of clients who were discharged, were discharged
successfully. Successful discharges were most typically stepped down to outpatient services or were
discharged to more long-term outreach services once stabilized, which including BHCP, OneCare, DMH,
Mystic Valley Elder Services and CBHC.
