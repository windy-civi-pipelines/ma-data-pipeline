Legislative filing to be made in the LAWS system
The Office of the Comptroller hereby files the Commonwealth’s Statutory Basis Financial Report
(SBFR) for Fiscal Year 2024, the 12-month period ended June 30, 2024.
The SBFR provides independent and unbiased accounting of Commonwealth revenues and
expenditures for Fiscal Year 2024. The SBFR was prepared by the professional staff of the Office
of the Comptroller and reviewed by the Commonwealth’s independent audit firm,
CliftonLarsonAllen LLP (CLA), in accordance with professional standards established by the
American Institute of Certified Public Accountants.
M.G.L c. 7A, § 12, requires the Comptroller to file the SBFR with the Governor, the Secretary of
Administration and Finance, the House and Senate Committees on Ways and Means, the Clerks of
the House and Senate, and any other parties specified in general or special law by October 31 of
each year. The final supplementary budget for Fiscal Year 2024 (“the closeout supp”) was signed
on December 4, 2024, making it impossible to meet the statutory requirement. As I described in
my letter of November 1, 2024, there is a pattern of serious delay in the closeout of the fiscal year
and the delivery of the SBFR.
Although the timing of the report is a serious concern, the content of the SBFR shows that the
financial condition of the Commonwealth is very sound. While the rate of growth in revenues
must be expected to fluctuate, the general upward trend in revenue continued in Fiscal Year 2024.
- Page 1 of 2 -
In seeking to address both ongoing and emerging spending priorities, elected officials in the
Administration and the Legislature have exercised prudence in matching needs and resources. The
successful management of fiscal challenges, the continuing growth of the Stabilization Fund, the
ongoing attention to debt and pension obligations – all are positive signs of the careful and
thoughtful work by the Legislature and the Administration on behalf of the people of the
Commonwealth.
I can also attest to the hard work of the professionals in my office and across state government,
who strive to ensure that the annual budget and all aspects of state finance law are faithfully
executed, and that our financial processes occur efficiently, under effective controls, and guarded
against fraud. That group includes financial staff in the largest and smallest departments, across
the executive branch and independents. It includes as well, the Executive Office for
Administration & Finance, the Office of the Treasurer and Receiver-General, and the Office of the
State Auditor, each of which plays a critical role at the center of state finance. I thank them all for
their partnership in Fiscal Year 2024.
I thank the staff of the Office of the Comptroller. I take this opportunity to note the recognition
our Statewide General Accounting Team, under the leadership of Assistant Comptroller & Chief
Accounting Officer Kristin Lacroix, received this past year from the national Government
Financial Officers Association. For their work in producing the SBFR, I thank Assistant
Comptroller & Chief Financial Reporting Officer Pauline Lieu and every member of her team, as
well as Senior Advisor Howard Merkowitz. I am fortunate to work with such knowledgeable and
dedicated public servants.
Sincerely,
William McNamara

Report Summary
As of June 30, 2024, the Commonwealth had a budgeted fund balance of approximately $15.004 billion and
completed FY24 with a “consolidated net surplus” $426 million, which, per statute, was transferred to the Student
Opportunity Act Investment Fund (See below for the statutory definition of consolidated net surplus and a balanced
budget). During the fiscal year, the balance of the Commonwealth Stabilization (or rainy day) Fund increased by
$488 million, to $8.524 billion, primarily the result of interest earned on the Fund’s balances, as well as transfers to
the Fund of capital gains taxes, gaming tax revenue, and abandoned property. No funds were drawn from the
Stabilization Fund in FY24. (The Budgeted Funds – Operations table on page 11 displays the FY24 summary of
budgeted funds compared to FY23. Details of the FY24 Stabilization Fund activity are provided on pages 13-16 and
page 178.) The total budgeted fund balance of $15.004 billion reflects a reduction in budgeted fund balances
(revenues and other financing sources less than expenditures and other financing uses) of approximately $334
million from the FY24 beginning balance of $15.338 billion. This follows an FY23 operating loss of $2.862 billion.
Approximately $3.172 billion is reserved for continuing appropriations and debt service in FY24 in all budgeted
funds. In addition to the $8.524 billion reserved in the Stabilization Fund, $1.477 billion is held in the Transitional
Escrow Fund, which was created at the end of FY21 to hold that year’s budget surplus as well as the surplus in
FY22 and FY23 ending balances. The remaining undesignated balance of $2.709 billion is made up of other
budgeted fund balances not included in the consolidated net surplus calculation.
During FY24, budgeted fund tax revenues increased by $4.435 billion, or 13.2%, from FY23, with the entire
increase was due to the net impact of several tax laws, including a one-time reduction in FY23 tax collections
triggered by FY22 tax revenue growth and implementation of new tax laws in FY24 that on net increased F24 tax
collections, most notably the full fiscal year impact of a 4% surtax on personal incomes above $1 million. (Without
those changes, FY24 budgeted fund tax revenues would have been virtually unchanged from FY23 — (see page 6
for a detailed explanation of these impacts.) Before transfers between budgeted funds (which do not affect total
budgeted fund balances), total budgeted fund revenues and other financing sources increased by $4.320 billion, or

Section 2:
7.5%. Budgeted fund expenditures and other financing uses, including transfers to non-budgeted funds (but before
transfers between the budgeted funds) increased by $1.793 billion, or 3.0%, with the largest changes being new
spending on Transportation and Education projects from revenue generated by the “Fair Share” 4% personal income
tax surtax, increases in local aid spending, growth in post-employment benefits, and spending for family shelters,
partially offset by a reduction in MassHealth (Medicaid) expenditures. A detailed analysis of revenue and spending
changes, as well as the economic factors that affected the budget, is included in the sections that follow.
Overview of the Financial Statements
This report focuses primarily on the Commonwealth’s budgeted funds. For the budgeted funds, the activity (inflows
and outflows) and balances (assets and liabilities) of each fund are presented separately. For all other non-budgeted
funds included in this report, the activity – inflows and outflows – is presented in tabular form, but per statute, the
full balance sheets for each fund are not shown.
The financial operations of these funds are maintained in the Massachusetts Management Accounting and Reporting
System (MMARS), the statewide accounting system, which is operated by the Commonwealth and contains detailed
information summarized in this report.
The SBFR satisfies the requirements of state finance law and to present the results of FY24 activity in the
Commonwealth’s funds. The report contains computations required by state finance law, including the certification
of the state’s consolidated net surplus and the balances in the Stabilization Fund.
3
Basis of Accounting and Definition of the Consolidated Net Surplus
The statutory (or budgetary) basis of accounting, as defined in Massachusetts law, is used to budget and control the
Commonwealth’s fiscal operations. The statutory basis of accounting does not conform with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) as defined for governments by the Governmental
Accounting Standards Board (GASB). In addition, per statute, the Commonwealth-managed fiduciary funds (the
largest of which funds Unemployment Insurance benefits) are not included in this presentation. The Comptroller’s
Office will report the Commonwealth’s financial position on a GAAP basis in the State’s Annual Comprehensive
Financial Report (ACFR). That report provides a more consistent basis for comparison with other jurisdictions, as
the accounting rules for the ACFR are the same for all governments, whereas the statutory basis of accounting may
differ across states. There are significant differences between what is contained in the SBFR and what will be
presented in the GAAP-based ACFR, the major ones being that the ACFR reflects capital assets and depreciation
expense, all types of long-term obligations – including debt, pensions, and other post-employment benefits (or
OPEB, which are mainly retirees’ health insurance benefits) – and in the ACFR the financial statements are
presented in an all-encompassing, net position and net expense format. In addition, the statutory basis of accounting
is mainly cash-based, with a two month accounts payable period for expenses and accounts receivable for revenues
received from other government entities (“modified cash basis”).
The Commonwealth’s statutory basis of accounting, as set out in Chapter 29 of the Massachusetts General Laws
(MGL), defines the “consolidated net surplus” or CNS as the ending “undesignated”, or unreserved, balances in the
budgeted funds, that is, those funds subject to the state’s annual appropriation process, though by statute several
budgeted funds (including the Transitional Escrow Fund and those funded by the 4% surtax) are excluded from the
consolidated net surplus calculation. State finance law defines a “balanced budget” as a consolidated net surplus of
$0 or greater. The largest of the budgeted funds in FY24 were the General Fund, the Federal Covid-19 Response
Fund, and the Commonwealth Transportation Fund, which in FY24 together accounted for approximately 86.9% ,

Section 3:
3.6%, and 3.5%, respectively, of total budgeted fund expenditures and other financing uses. The remaining
approximately 6.0% of budgeted fund activity comprises 24 other funds, 20 of which by statute are excluded from
the consolidated net surplus calculation.
In accordance with Section 12 of Chapter 7A of the MGL, the Office of the Comptroller is required to transmit the
SBFR by October 31st. However, due to the fact that the final FY24 supplemental budget bill was not enacted and
signed into law until December 4, 2024, this SBFR is being transmitted on February 14, 2025 in order to provide
sufficient time to accurately incorporate that bill’s provisions into this report and have it reviewed by the
Commonwealth’s independent auditor.
The SBFR for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024 is reviewed, not audited, by the state’s independent auditor,
CliftonLarsonAllen (“CLA”), and represents the closing of the Commonwealth’s books for the fiscal year.
The Economic Context
The funding available to the Commonwealth to finance its programs is determined largely by the performance of the
state’s economy, particularly growth in employment, wages and investment income, which drive the personal
income tax, the state’s largest revenue source, and the sales tax, which depends on the amount of income
Massachusetts residents have available to spend. In FY24, the Commonwealth’s economy continued to recover
from the economic impact of the global Coronavirus or COVID-19 pandemic, though growth moderated as the
economy reached full employment. Between June 2023 and June 2024, employment increased by approximately
26,100 jobs, or 0.7%, compared to increased employment of 1.6% for the United States as a whole. As of June 2024
the Massachusetts unemployment rate was lower than for the U.S. as a whole: 3.2%, compared to 4.1% nationally.
As the Massachusetts economy reached full employment, wages and salaries, which largely determine personal
income tax collections, grew more slowly than the national average, by 5.0% from FY23, compared to 6.1% median
growth rate of all other states.

The Budgeted Funds
The FY24 budget enacted by the Legislature (the General Appropriation Act, or GAA) included an FY24 tax
revenue estimate of $41.410 billion prior to tax initiatives (and excluding $50 million in tax settlements greater than
$10 million each), equal to the FY24 consensus estimate of $40.410 billion plus $1.0 billion in personal income tax
revenue estimated to be generated by a 4% surtax on incomes above $1 billion that was in effect for all of FY24.
The GAA tax revenue estimate was reduced by a net of $530 million, to $40.880 billion, as a result of enacted and
proposed tax law changes included in the budget that were forecasted to reduce FY24 tax revenues by $580 million,
partially offset by $50 million in assumed tax-related settlements and judgments exceeding $10 million. $38.086
billion of that revenue was to be deposited in the budgeted funds and available for use, with $2.794 billion to be
deposited into non-budgeted funds, including transfers of sales tax revenue of $1.464 billion dedicated to the
Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority and $1.304 billion dedicated to the Massachusetts School Building
Authority, $583 million of capital gains tax revenues transferred to the Stabilization Fund, State Pension Fund, and
State Retiree Benefits Trust Fund, and $27 million in Unemployment Insurance surcharges allocated to the non-
budgeted Workforce Training Fund.
Based on tax revenue performance through December 2023, in January 2024, the Secretary of Administration and
Finance reduced the FY24 state tax revenue estimate by $997 million to a total of $39.884 billion, including the
projected revenue impact of tax law changes and $50 million in judgment and settlement revenue.
The GAA also assumed budgeted fund non-tax revenue of $24.153 billion, including $13.735 billion in federal
reimbursements, $6.128 billion in departmental revenue, and $4.290 billion in consolidated transfers, or transfers
from non-budgeted to budgeted funds. Total budgeted fund tax and non-tax revenues assumed in the GAA
(excluding the non-budgeted fund portions allocated to the MBTA, MSBA, and Unemployment Insurance
surcharge) was $62.239 billion.
The FY24 General Appropriation Act (GAA) authorized approximately $66.814 billion in spending, including
approximately $4.105 billion in required pension contributions and $1.323 billion in other transfers.
Approximately $1.809 billion in supplemental appropriations were authorized during FY24, $580 million of which
were enacted by June 30, 2024. Subsequent to year end, a supplemental budget was enacted totaling approximately
$1.230 billion in new appropriations. Of the FY24 appropriations included in the GAA and supplemental budgets,
$3.154 billion was authorized to be continued into FY25.
The year’s significant supplemental appropriations (some of which were carried forward and reappropriated to be
expended in FY25):
• $565 million for MassHealth (Medicaid) services;
• $312 million to fund collective bargaining contracts
• $251 million for family shelters and associated services
• $228 million for MassHealth's Home and Community-Based Services program
• $176 million to fund a transfer from the Medical Assistance Trust Fund to hospitals that treat large numbers
of Medicaid-eligible patients
FY24 budgeted revenues and other financing sources (before transfers between the budgeted funds, which are
included in both spending and revenue and thus have no effect on total budgeted fund balances) totaled $61.735
billion, an increase of $4.320 billion, or 7.5%, from FY23. Most of this increase from FY23 was due to full year
implementation of the 4% surtax, a one-time reduction in FY23 revenues resulting from refunds issued pursuant to a
law that required FY22 excess revenues to be returned to taxpayers in FY23, partially offset by other tax cuts that
reduced revenue. These changes are discussed below.
5
FY24 tax revenues ended the year at $40.813 billion (including $16 million in tax settlements exceeding $10 million
each), of which $38.138 billion was deposited in the budgeted funds after accounting for the transfer of sales tax
revenue of $1.404 billion to the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority and $1.244 billion to the
Massachusetts School Building Authority, and $26 million in unemployment tax surcharges to the Workforce
Training Fund. Tax revenue deposited in the budgeted funds increased by $4.435 billion, or 13.2%, from FY23,
$944 million above the final FY24 estimate, with above-forecast revenue due entirely to the implementation of a 4%
surtax on incomes above $1 million (see following paragraph).
The $4.435 billion increase in budgeted fund tax revenues between FY23 and FY24 was primarily the result of two
tax law impacts, one of which resulted in one-time tax revenue reductions in FY23 and the other that resulted in
increased tax collections in FY24, the combination of which caused an increase of $4.662 billion in tax revenue in
FY24 compared to FY23. One-time FY23 personal income tax refunds of $2.879 billion were issued pursuant to
Chapter 62F of the Massachusetts General Laws, which required that tax revenues in excess of a statutory limit in
FY22 be refunded to taxpayers in FY23 to FY24 (thus reducing tax revenues in FY23 relative to FY24). Another tax
law change resulted in increased FY24 tax revenues: the “Fair Share” 4% surcharge on incomes over $1 million that
was implemented for a full fiscal year 2024 and raised $2.460 billion in FY24, $2.218 billion more than the surtax
raised in FY23. Partially offsetting these impacts was the implementation of certain tax reforms, which reduced
FY24 income tax revenues by $431 million. Absent these three changes, “baseline” tax revenues decreased by $228
million, or 0.6% in FY24 compared to FY23, with growth in income tax withholding offset by a decline in capital
gains taxes, corporate and business tax, sales tax, deeds excise tax, and estate tax.
Total personal income tax collections totaled $24.112 billion, an increase of $5.117 billion, or 26.9%; adjusted for
the FY23 one-time reduction in taxes resulting from the Chapter 62F refunds, the 4% surtax and the impact of tax
reforms in FY24, the increase was $455 million, or 2.1%, with growth in withholding partially offset by a decline in
non-witheld income tax. Personal income tax withholding totaled $17.967 billion, an increase of $1.320 billion or

Section 4:
7.9%, and an increase of $1.007 billion, or 6.1%, when adjusted for the impact of the 4% surtax. Non-withheld
personal income tax (primarily quarterly estimated tax payments and final payments with tax returns, reduced by
refunds), totaled $6.145 billion, up by $3.797 billion, or 161.7%, but declined by $552 million, or 11.0%, when
adjusted for the impact of tax law changes, primarily due to a decline in capital gains taxes, which totaled $2.009
billion, down $271 million, or 11.9%, from FY23. Corporate and business taxes (comprising corporate excise,
financial institutions, insurance company, and public utilities taxes) totaled $4.833 billion, a decrease of
$275 million, or 5.4%, and revenue from sales and use taxes (including regular sales, meals, and motor vehicle sales
tax, but excluding cannabis sales tax and the revenues allocated to the MBTA and MSBA) totaled $6.626 billion,
down $21 million, or 0.3%, as a $69 million increase in meals tax collections was offset by an $89 million decline in
regular sales tax. Other notable tax revenue sources included motor fuels taxes, which totaled $713 million, up $11
million, or 1.6% from FY23, deeds excise tax revenues, which totaled $337 million, down $33 million, or 9.9%, as
home sales continued to decline, cannabis sales and excise taxes, which totaled $239 million, up $16 million, or

Section 5:
7.0%, as the legal cannabis market continued to expand, and estate and inheritance taxes,which totaled $574 million,
a decline of $400 million, or 41.0%, as this volatile revenue source dropped from an unusually high FY23 level.

Fiscal Year 2024 Budgeted Fund Revenues and Other Financing Sources
Before Transfers Between Budgeted Funds (Total of $61.735 billion)
Federal Reimbursements: 23.7%
Income Tax: 39.0%
Transfers: 4.2%
Departmental: 10.4%
Other Tax: 4.2%
Sales & Use Tax: 10.7%
Corporate Tax & Business Tax: 7.8%
Budgeted fund federal reimbursements totaled $14.603 billion, a decrease of $622 million, or 4.1%, with the decline
resulting primarily from lower federal reimbursements for reduced Medicaid expenditures (see explanation of
Medicaid expenditure changes on the following page). Medicaid federal reimbursements totaled $13.210 billion, a
decrease of $989 million, or 7.0%.
Budgeted fund departmental revenue totaled $6.429 billion, an increase of $347 million, or 5.7%, from FY23. Most
of the departmental revenue growth was due to increases in interest earnings, which grew by $282 million, from
$698 million in FY23 to $980 million in FY24, as result of higher short-term interest rates applied to the
Commonwealth’s large cash balances, particularly in the Stabilization Fund. Other significant sources of
departmental revenue were reimbursements for services, which totaled $2.702 billion, down $67 million,or 2.4%
from FY23, with the the most significant sources being rebates received from drug manufacturers for the state’s
Medicaid program, which totaled $1.523 billion, down $105 million, or 6.5% from FY23 and reimbursements
received from cities and towns for health insurance provided by the Group Insurance Commission,which totaled
$655 million in FY24, virtually identical to FY23). Fees received by the state totaled $1.272 billion, up $35
million, or 2.8%,, with virtually the entire increase due to motor vehicle fees and licenses, which totaled $626
million, up $38 million, or 6.5%. Among other significant sources of departmental revenue were drug rebates for
the state’s employee Group Insurance program, which totaled $165 million, up $158 million from FY23 (see detail
of GIC spending below for an explanation of this increase).
Interfund transfers from non-budgeted funds to the budgeted funds totaled $2.564 billion, an increase of $161
million, or 6.7%, from FY23. Gaming revenues transferred to the budgeted funds totaled $345 million, up $53
million, or 18.3% from FY23. Lottery Fund transfers to the General Fund totaled $1.125 billion, a decrease of $40
million, or 3.4% (see Lottery and Gaming section on page 12). Fringe benefit and indirect cost recovery from non-
budgeted funds totaled $682 million, up $117 million, or 20.6% from FY23, due to increases in the fringe benefit
rate and higher spending from federal grant accounts that are charged that rate.
The Commonwealth continues to receive revenues, as it will in perpetuity, from the Master Settlement Agreement
(MSA) between the states and the tobacco industry to recover health care costs for tobacco-related illnesses. In
FY24, the Commonwealth received $186 million in tobacco settlement funds, a decrease of $71 million compared to
FY23. Statute requires that a portion of tobacco settlement proceeds be transferred to the State Retiree Benefits
Trust Fund (SRBTF) to fund the Commonwealth’s liability for retiree health care, with the percentage of proceeds
7
transferred increasing by 10% each year until 100% of such proceeds is deposited in the SRBTF in FY24 and after.
For FY24, the statutorily required transfer was 100% of tobacco settlement revenues; however, the FY24 General
Appropriation Act changed the transfer percentage to 10% in FY24, resulting in a the transfer of $19 million.

FY24 budgeted expenditures and other financing uses, including transfers to non-budgeted funds (but before
transfers between the budgeted funds) totaled $62.069 billion, an increase of $1.793 billion, or 3.0%, from FY23,
with the increase primarily attributable to growth in local aid, pensions, higher education, transfers to hospitals that
treat large numbers of Medicaid-eligible patients, and spending of revenue generated by the 4% personal income tax
surtax.
Spending on programs and services totaled $53.405 billion, an increase of $1.454 billion, or 2.8%, from FY23.
Medicaid expenditures totaled $20.070 billion, a decrease of $1.630 billion, or 7.5%, from FY23, as the pandemic-
era suspension of eligibility redeterminations expired and Medicaid beneficiaries were removed from the program
because they no longer met eligibility requirements. Spending on other Executive Office of Human Services
programs totaled $9.414 billion, an increase of $184 million, or 2.0% from FY23, including spending for
emergency assistance family shelters and services program, which increased by $369 million. Spending for direct
local aid (both education aid and unrestricted aid), at $7.949 billion, was up $654 million, or 9.0%, from FY23,
higher education spending totaled $1.764 billion, an increase of $154 million, or 9.6%, from FY23. Spending on
state employee health insurance benefits paid through the Group Insurance Commission (including benefits for
retiree health insurance) increased by $291 million, or 11.9%, from $2.445 billion to $2.736 billion. However, these
expenditures were offset by $164 million in drug rebates that normally would have been used to reduce spending but
in FY24 was recorded as revenue. Adjusted for this revenue, Group Health Insurance spending increased by $127
million, or 5.2%, in line with previous spending increases due to medical inflation.
As noted above, approximately $2.460 billion was generated in FY24 by the “Fair Share” 4% personal income
surtax. In FY24, approximately $903 million of those revenues was expended on various budgeted fund
transportation and education programs, the largest of which were:
8
• $181 million for MBTA capital investments
• $100 million for roads and bridges supplemental aid
• $68 million for regional transit funding and grants
• $50 million for highway and bridge preservation projects
• $100 million for Massachusetts School Building Authority capital projects
• $82 million for education financial aid expansion
• $69 million for school meals programs
• $50 million for public school clean energy infrastructure projects
• $49 million for higher education capital funding
• $45 million for scholarships at state universities and community colleges
• $25 million for early education and care programs targeted to lower income families
Transfers to the state and teachers’ pension funds totaled $4.104 billion in accordance with the Commonwealth’s
actuarially-determined pension funding schedule, an increase of $360 million, or 9.6%, from FY23, and an
additional pension contribution of $30 million from capital gains tax taxes, as required by a statute that mandates
such transfers from a portion of capital gains tax collections above an annual threshold. As a result, FY24
contributions to the pension fund totaled $4.133 billion an increase of $348 million, or 9.2% from FY23, a smaller
increase than in FY23 because capital gains tax transfers and supplemental pension appropriations were lower in
FY24 than in FY23. (In FY23, there was also a $200 million additional appropriation for a transfer to the state and
teachers’ pension funds that was not repeated in FY24.). Budgeted fund debt service totaled $2.425 billion, up $5
million, or 0.2%, from FY23.
In FY21, the Commonwealth received $5.286 billion in federal American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) funds, of which
$4.892 billion was transferred to the newly established Federal COVID-19 Response Fund (a budgeted fund, subject
to appropriation) and carried forward for allocation in FY22 and then again in FY23 and FY24. In FY24, the
Commonwealth spent $2.386 billion from the Fund, leaving it with a zero balance.
Interfund transfers from budgeted to non-budgeted funds totaled $1.520 billion, an increase of $281 million or

Section 7:
22.6%, from FY23. with the largest increase being a transfer of $505 million from the General Fund to the Medical
Assistance Trust Fund (MATF) for payments to hospitals that treat large populations of lower income patients, an
increase of $420 million from FY23. Transfers to and payments from the MATF vary significantly from year-to-
year depending on the timing of federal reimbursements. The MATF increase was partially offset by net reductions
in other transfers.
In conducting the budget process, the Commonwealth excludes from its forecast those “interfund” transactions
within the budgeted funds that are included in this report; these transactions by their nature have no impact on the
combined fund balance of the budgeted funds. The Budgeted Funds - Operations table on the following page
isolates this “interfund” activity from the budgeted sources and subtracts this revenue and spending to align forecasts
prepared during the budget process and in bond disclosure documents to actual amounts in this report. In FY24,
transfers among the budgeted funds totaled $4.727 billion, a decrease of $828 million, or 14.9%, from FY23. This
net decrease was the result of several large changes in transfers between the budgeted funds compared to FY23,
including an FY23 non-recurring transfer of $2.879 billion from the Transitional Escrow Fund to the General Fund
to fund the FY23 Chapter 62F refunds mentioned earlier, a $721 million decline in transfers from the General Fund
9
to the Stabilization Fund, as FY24 above-threshold capital gains tax revenue was retained in the General Fund
instead of being transferred to the Stabilization Fund, and non-recurring FY23 transfers of $490 million to seed the
High-Quality Early Education & Care Affordability Fund and $193 million for the Behavioral Health Trust Fund.
These declines in transfers was partially offset by increased transfers from the General Fund due to revenue
generated by the 4% surtax, the largest of which were a $2.199 billion transfer in surtax revenue from the General
Fund to the Education and Transportation Fund, an increase of $1.957 billion from FY23, and transfers totaling
$1.349 billion of that surtax revenue out of the Education and Transportation Fund to the Education and
Transportation Reserve Fund, the Education and Transportation Innovation and Capital Fund, and the Early
Education and Care Operational Grant Fund as required by statute to fund various education and transportation
programs. It should be noted that the 4% surtax estimate was revised upward in December 2024 to $2.460 billion,
but per statute the FY24 transfer to the Education and Transportation Fund was based on the July 2024 estimate of
$2.199 billion, with the difference between the July and December estimates being transferred to the Education and
Transportation Fund in FY25.
A detailed list of these FY24 interfund transfers is included in Note 3 of the financial statements and Schedule C of
the Supplemental Information section of this report.

The graph of Budgeted Funds - Fund Balance above shows the combined fund balance in the budgeted funds for the
past five years.
As of June 30, 2024, the ending budgeted fund balance was comprised of the $1.952 billion fund balance in the
General Fund, $1.477 billion in the Transitional Escrow Fund, and $8.524 billion in the Stabilization Fund. The
remaining $2.709 billion was undesignated in various budgeted education, health care, and environmental and other
funds that are not included in the consolidated net surplus calculation, with the largest undesignated balances being
$1.342 billion in education and transportation funds holding revenues generated by a 4% surtax on incomes over $1
million and $926 million in the Student Opportunity Act Investment Fund. $3.172 billion of the total budgeted fund
balance, exclusive of the Stabilization Fund, is reserved for appropriations and debt service in FY25.
Lottery and Gaming
The Commonwealth generates revenue from the State Lottery, as well as taxes on revenue at two casinos, a slot
machine parlor, and sports betting. Gross Lottery revenues (including revenues from the Arts Lottery) were
virtually unchanged from FY23, growing from $6.264 billion in FY23 to $6.274 billion in FY24, an increase of $10
million, or 0.2%. Lottery profits, after deducting administrative expenses, debt service, and fringe benefit costs
borne by and reimbursed by the Lottery to the General Fund, but prior to distributions to reimburse the
Massachusetts Cultural Council and compulsive gambling appropriations as mandated in the FY24 budget, totaled
$1.151 billion, a decrease of $37 million, or 3.1%, from FY23. Of that $1.151 billion in profits, and as mandated in
the FY24 General Appropriation Act, approximately $1.124 billion was transferred to the General Fund to fund so-
called Unrestricted General Government Aid (formerly Lottery Local Aid), $26 million funded the Massachusetts
Cultural Council appropriation, and $1 million reimbursed a compulsive gambling program appropriation.
12
FY24 gaming-related revenue for both the budgeted and non-budgeted funds totaled approximately $512 million, an
increase of $76 million, or 17.4%, from FY23, with most of the growth resulting from the full year implementation
of taxes on sports betting, which generated $136 million, up $70 million, or 108.1%, from FY23. Approximately
$345 million of gaming-related revenue was deposited in the budgeted funds (including $26 million transferred to
the Commonwealth Stabilization Fund), an increase of $53 million, or 18.3%, from FY23. Budgeted fund revenue
from the Plainridge slot machine parlor, equal to 40% of gross profits (or “gross gaming revenues”) from slot
machines, totaled approximately $65 million, an increase of approximately $4 million, or 6.9% from FY23, tax
revenue from the Everett and Springfield casinos, equal to 25% of gross gaming revenues, totaled $187 million,
virtually identical to FY23 revenues, and budgeted fund sports betting related revenue totaled $94 million, an
increase of $51 million., or 117.9%, from FY23. The remaining $166 million of the $512 million in total gaming-
related revenue was deposited in non-budgeted funds.
Statute requires that all tax revenues from the Plainridge slots parlor and a portion of the tax revenues from the
Springfield and Everett casinos and sports wagering be allocated to fund unrestricted local aid. The FY24 General
Appropriation Act allocated $139 million in gaming-related revenues to local aid, and taxes on gaming and sports
betting revenues deposited in the Gaming Local Aid Fund exceeded that amount by approximately $12 million, with
the excess being included in the FY24 consolidated net surplus calculation.
The Stabilization Fund
The Stabilization (or rainy day) Fund provides a reserve to be used in the event of an economic downturn or other
fiscal emergency. The balance of the Stabilization Fund increased by $488 million, to $8.524 billion, between the
close of FY23 and FY24, with the main source of growth being interest earnings on the Fund’s balance, with
additional transfers of capital gains tax revenues to the Fund, gaming tax revenues, abandoned property revenues,
and a small amount of income tax withholding from the transfer of Lottery prizes.
As mentioned earlier, Massachusetts state finance law includes a requirement to transfer personal income tax
revenue attributable to capital gains above an annual threshold to the Stabilization Fund, State Pension Liability
Fund, and State Retiree Benefits Trust Fund (which funds retiree health and other insurance benefits). The FY24
capital gains tax threshold, as determined by the Department of Revenue, was $1.479 billion. In August 2023, the
Department of Revenue (DOR) certified that FY24 tax collections attributable to capital gains totaled $2.070 billion.
Per legislation enacted as part of the FY24 supplemental budgets, of the above-threshold amount of $591 million,
85%, or $501 million, was retained in the General Fund, and 5%, or $29.5 million, was transferred to each of the
Stabilization Fund, the Commonwealth Pension Fund, and the State Retiree Benefits Trust Fund. (In December
2024, per state finance law, based on more complete tax return information, DOR certified FY24 capital gains tax
revenue of $2.280 billion, but per statute, capital gains tax transfers are not adjusted for any differences between the
August and final certifications.) During the fiscal year, the Stabilization Fund also recorded net investment income
of $425 million on the Fund’s large balance, which is invested in short-term interest-bearing securities. The Fund
also had transferred to it $26 million from casino gaming tax revenue, $7 million of abandoned property revenue,
and $214 thousand of withholding tax revenue from the transfer of Lottery prizes. The Commonwealth made no
withdrawals from the Stabilization in FY24. (Details of transfers to and investment earnings of the Stabilization
Fund are shown in the table on page 178).
The following three charts show the end of fiscal year Stabilization Fund balances since the inception of the fund in
FY87, the amounts of capital gains taxes deposited to the Stabilization Fund, and the Stabilization Fund balance as a
percentage of General Funds own-source expenditures over the past five fiscal years, compared to the projected
median of all states.

The chart on the next page shows the amount of capital gains tax revenue transferred to the Stabilization Fund since
the law implementing this requirement was enacted, effective in FY13. Over the twelve years that the requirement
has been in effect, more than $5.840 billion in deposits to the Stabilization Fund have been made from capital gains
tax revenue, accounting for approximately 69% of the $8.524 billion of the Fund’s balance. Including the
approximately $624 million of cumulative interest earned on those capital gains deposits through FY24, capital
gains transfers accounted for about 76% of the Fund’s balance as of June 30, 2024.

Rainy day fund balances are typically measured both in terms of the absolute size of those funds and the funds’
balances as a percentage of General Fund “own source” expenditures (with own source expenditures excluding the
portion of expenditures — mostly Medicaid — funded by federal government reimbursements), with the latter
calculation taking into account the relative size of each state government’s budget. According to The National
Association of State Budget Officers’ (NASBO) Fall 2024 Fiscal Survey of the States, at the close of FY23 (the
most recent year for which final rainy day fund balances were available for all states), the Commonwealth
Stabilization Fund’s balance of $8.036 billion was the 3rd largest in the nation in absolute terms, and Massachusetts
also had the 3rd largest Stabilization Fund balance at the end of FY24. As a percentage of total General Fund own
source expenditures, the Commonwealth’s FY23 Stabilization Fund balance of 19.3% was well above the national
median of 12.7%. For FY24, the Commonwealth’s Stabilization Fund balance as a percentage of General Fund own
source expenditures was 19.6%, well above the preliminary FY24 national median of 13.5% as reported in the
NASBO Spring survey.
With the $488 million added to the Stabilization Fund balance in FY24, the Fund’s balance has once again risen to
its highest level since its creation in FY87.
Full-Time Equivalent Employment
The chart on the following page shows the Commonwealth’s full-time equivalent employment, including the
Massachusetts Department of Transportation (MassDOT) for all state funding sources (budgeted, non-budgeted,
capital, federal, and trust) over the past five fiscal years. As of June 30, 2024, the number of Commonwealth
employees (both budgeted and non-budgeted funded) increased by a net of 3,332 full-time equivalent employees
(FTEs) from June 30, 2023, to a total of 90,758. The largest increases were in the executive agencies controlled by
the Governor, where FTEs increased by 2,260, to 45,910, particularly in Executive Office of Health and Human
Services, where employment increased by 1,180 FTEs, the Executive Office of Transportation and Construction,
where FTEs increased by 267, and the Executive Office of Environmental Affairs, where FTEs increased by 238.
Other increases occurred in non Executive agencies, including the Judiciary, where FTEs increased by 245, and the
University of Massachusetts, which saw an increase of 316 FTEs.

The Non-Budgeted Funds
The Non-Budgeted Funds represent operations in which the government has imposed its sovereign authority but has
excluded these operations from the annual budget process. During FY24, the Commonwealth maintained 156 active
non-budgeted funds (many of which are healthcare related), while another 44 were inactive.
The largest non-budgeted funds in terms of operating revenues include the State Lottery and Gaming Fund, the
Federal Grants Fund, the MBTA State and Local Contribution Trust Fund (which accounts for sales tax revenue
dedicated to and transferred to the MBTA), the School Modernization Trust Fund (which accounts for sales tax
revenue dedicated to and transferred to Massachusetts School Building Authority), the Commonwealth Care Trust
Fund, the Medical Assistance Trust Fund, the Health Safety Net Trust Fund, the MassHealth Delivery System
Reform Trust Fund, the Convention and Exhibition Center Fund, the Massachusetts Transportation Trust Fund, and
the Special Contribution Unemployment Compensation Trust, which was established in FY22 to fund debt service
incurred to repay federal loans received during the COVID-19 pandemic. Other funds that show large inflows
include the Grant Anticipation Notes Trust Fund, which is funded by federal highway spending reimbursements.
The table below, Non-Budgeted Special Revenue Funds - Operations, summarizes the FY24 non-budgeted funds. A
Statement of Revenues, Expenditures and Changes in Fund Balance is presented in a table within this report for each
of the individual non-budgeted funds in the financial section of this report. The table includes the State Lottery
Funds, where Lottery revenues and expenditures occur prior to Lottery profits being transferred to the General Fund
to reimburse it for local aid and other appropriations. The non-budgeted special revenue funds had a $61 million
operating deficit in FY24.

In FY24, eleven non-budgeted special revenue funds had operating deficits of $10 million or more, which were
mainly the result of spending of previously received revenues. These were the the Federal Grants Fund with a
deficit of $99 million which was the result of spending down previously received federal pandemic aid and to
spending that occurs in advance of being reimbursed by the federal government, the MassHealth Delivery System
Reform Trust, with a deficit of $39 million, the Substance Use Disorder Federal Reinvestment Trust, with a deficit
of $65 million, the Health Information Technology Trust, with a deficit of $13 million, the Housing Preservation and
Stabilization Trust, with a deficit of $41 million, the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) Auction Trust,
with a deficit of $72 million, the Hospital Investment and Performance Trust, with a deficit of $169 million, and the
Electric Vehicle Adoption Inventive Trust, with a deficit of $34 million, the Grant Anticipation Note Trust, with a
deficit of $40 million, the COVID-19 Essential Employee Premium Pay, with a deficit of $15 million, the
Communication Access Trust, with a deficit of $20 million.
As noted in previous years, the Government Land Bank Fund has a continuing structural fund deficit. The FY24
deficit balance of approximately $35 million remains an unbudgeted drain on the Commonwealth’s cash pool.
More consolidation and elimination is needed for the non-budgeted special revenue funds generally.
The Capital Projects Funds
The purpose of the capital project funds is to account for the construction or acquisition of capital assets. The
Governor may propose capital outlay budgets which, upon enactment by the Legislature and approval by the
Governor, become capital outlay acts. Capital outlay acts financed through the sale of debt require a two-thirds vote
of the Legislature. Numerous acts may be combined for reporting in an individual capital projects fund, but each act
is accounted for separately within the fund. These accounts record authorizations for expenditures in itemized
capital appropriation accounts and equivalent authorizations to issue bonds or notes.
The structure of these funds is such that each capital outlay authorization is in balance, creating authorization for
inflows (which may be from sales of bonds, federal reimbursements or other revenues) and expenditures.
Imbalances due to timing differences develop when the expenditure precedes the inflow of funds from the sale of
bonds or federal reimbursements. Due to restrictions imposed by federal tax arbitrage rules, tax exempt bonds are
not routinely sold in anticipation of expenditures.
The Administration oversees a coordinated fiscal strategy for the management of the capital projects funds. This
strategy includes a five-year capital budget linked to debt management and capital management. The focus of this
strategy is to manage capital spending within outstanding debt levels and debt service obligations the Administration
considers appropriate for the Commonwealth. An important part of the strategy is to control capital spending within
an administrative “cap.”
To fund the FY24 capital budget and expenditures from FY23 that had not been bonded as of the June 30, 2023, the
Commonwealth borrowed by issuing general obligation debt with a principal value of $4.057 billion and proceeds of
$4.402 billion (since the bonds were issued at a premium) and $500 million of special obligation bonds with
proceeds of $525 million. The Commonwealth also issued $2.011 billion in debt with proceeds of $2.308 billion to
refund already existing obligations, taking advantage of the relatively low interest rates that persisted into the first
half of FY24. In addition, the Commonwealth received $779 million in federal reimbursements (most of it for
19
transportation projects), including $715 million classified in the financial statements as a transfer in since it is
initially deposited in a non-capital projects fund.
In FY24, the Commonwealth spent $3.941 billion on capital projects (plus $42 million in fringe benefit costs), with
approximately $2.143 billion, or 54%, of that amount spent on transportation-related projects. Additional significant
spending included $508 million on non-transportation state infrastructure, $316 million on housing, $320 million on
environmental projects, $281 million on education, and $191 million on information technology.
During FY24, significant capital spending projects included:
• $544 million for state-owned facilities including public higher education campuses, trial courts, and state
health care facilities;
• $506 million for safety and capacity improvements and reconstruction for the Commonwealth’s highways,
bridges, and tunnels;
• $325 million for affordable housing development and public housing;
• $228 million in Chapter 90 reimbursements and additional new MassDOT grant programs to municipalities
for local road, bridge, and sidewalk projects;
• $142 million in spending for the Department of Conservation and Recreation, including improvements to
roadways, parks, and for environmental spending;
• $81 million for the MassWorks economic development initiative, which provides infrastructure grants to
municipalities;
• $74 million of investments in major information technology system upgrades for the Departments of Labor
and Workforce Development, Health and Human Services, Education, and Public Safety and Security, and
for the trial court system and MassHealth;
• $55 million to directly address climate change, including funds for repairing and rebuilding coastal
infrastructure and inland dams, helping state agencies and municipalities plan for and protect against the
impact of a changing climate, and wetlands protection;
• $47 million in support for freight rail enhancement projects, including investment in improving reliability
of tracks, road crossings, vehicles, facilities, and bridges;
• $42 million for the maintenance, modernization, and replacement of regional transit vehicles and facilities;
• $41 million in spending for the Executive Office of Public Safety and Security, including vehicles and
equipment for the State Police, Department of Correction, Department of Fire Services, Parole Board, State
Crime Lab, and Chief Medical Examiner, and municipal grants for body-worn cameras and bullet-proof
vests;
• $36 million for durable equipment and vehicles employed in highway repair, maintenance, and
improvements;
• $35 million for the Life Sciences Capital program, providing grants to promote job growth, business
expansion, discovery, and innovation in the industry and the Commonwealth economy;
• $33 million to improve the quality of clean and drinking water;
• $29 million to support innovation and research & development partnerships that bring together the
Commonwealth’s research institutions and companies to promote cluster development and job creation;
• $25 million for planning and construction grants from the Board of Library Commissioners to public
library systems;
20
• $24 million for the Food Security Infrastructure program, which provides grants to enhance food security
for the people of the Commonwealth and to increase access and production of local food;
• $23 million for aeronautics and aviation assets, including investments in airport buildings, runways, and
taxiways to improve safety and capacity;
• $22 million in environmental municipal grants for parklands, ecological diversity, and water protection;
• $22 million to fund planning, design, right-of-way, utility, and construction costs for the replacement of the
Sagamore and Bourne Bridges to Cape Cod;
• $21 million in grants to assess, remediate, and redevelop “brownfield” contaminated properties, often in
Gateway Cities and other challenging markets;
• $18 million for capital investments in the advanced manufacturing sector and for state matching funds for
federal competitive grants to develop advanced manufacturing technologies;
• $17 million to support the economic redevelopment of underutilized or vacant properties into active
commercial, housing, or green civic space;
• $15 million in assistance to the Massachusetts Educational Financing Authority for student loan support;
• $15 million to make improvements to bicycle and pedestrian transportation routes, addressing safety,
accessibility, connectivity, maintenance, and options for students traveling to schools;
• $14 million for the Workforce Skills capital grants to educational institutions;
• $13 million for cybersecurity and vulnerability remediation for the Commonwealth’s IT systems, including
those of public higher education institutions;
• $12 million in grants to public and non-profit entities to stimulate economic development and create jobs in
the maritime sector, and to protect coastal assets;
• $11 million in grants for planning, acquisition, rehabilitation, and construction of cultural facilities
administered through the Massachusetts Cultural Council and MassDevelopment; and
• $10 million for capital improvements to the Commonwealth’s six military installations, supporting their
economic impact on local communities.
The following graph Capital Projects Funds - Fund Balance/(Deficit) shows the combined fund balance in the capital
projects funds for the past five years. Typically, the combined fiscal year ending balance in the capital projects
funds is negative, as capital spending occurs prior to bonds being issued by the Commonwealth. At the end of
FY24, the capital projects funds had a $1.595 billion deficit balance (including $986 million in accounts payable), as
the Commonwealth had not yet reimbursed itself for capital spending that it typically funds in arrears through
subsequent bond issues.

maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of combined financial
statements-statutory basis that are free from material misstatement whether due to fraud or error.
Accountant’s Responsibility
Our responsibility is to conduct the review engagement in accordance with Statements on Standards
for Accounting and Review Services promulgated by the Accounting and Review Services Committee
of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. Those standards require us to perform
procedures to obtain limited assurance as a basis for reporting whether we are aware of any material
modifications that should be made to the combined financial statements-statutory basis for them to
be in accordance with the Statutory Basis of Accounting. We believe that the results of our procedures
provide a reasonable basis for our conclusion.
We are required to be independent of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and to meet our other
ethical responsibilities, in accordance with the relevant ethical requirements related to our review.
Accountant’s Conclusion
Based on our review, we are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to the
accompanying combined financial statements-statutory basis in order for them to be in accordance
with the statutory basis of accounting as described in Notes 1 and 2.

Commonwealth of Massachusetts 39 Statutory Basis Financial Report
Notes to Combined Financial Statements - Statutory Basis Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2024

Section 24:
1. FINANCIAL STATEMENT PRESENTATION
A. INTRODUCTION
The accompanying combined financial statements (Statutory Basis Financial Report or SBFR) of the
Commonwealth of Massachusetts (the Commonwealth) are presented in accordance with the requirements of

Section 25:
Section 12 of Chapter 7A as amended by Section 4 of Chapter 88 of the Acts of 1997 of the Massachusetts General
Laws, as amended most recently by Chapter 26, Section 4 of the Acts of 2009. The Office of the Comptroller also
publishes the Commonwealth’s Annual Comprehensive Financial Report (ACFR), which is prepared in accordance
with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) in the United States of America for governments.
The SBFR includes the budgeted, non-budgeted special revenue, and capital projects funds of the Commonwealth,
as recorded by the Office of the Comptroller in compliance with Massachusetts General Laws (MGL) and in
accordance with the Commonwealth’s budgetary principles.
The SBFR’s financial statements are not intended to include independent authorities, non-appropriated funds of
higher education, or other organizations included in the Commonwealth’s reporting entity as it would be defined
under GAAP.
B. GOVERNMENTAL FUND TYPES
The fund types are organized as follows:
Governmental fund types account for the general governmental activities of the Commonwealth.
Budgeted Funds - are the primary operating funds of the Commonwealth. They account for all budgeted
governmental transactions, i.e., those subject to the annual appropriation process. Budgeted funds include the
General, the Commonwealth Transportation, the Stabilization Funds, the Federal COVID-19 Response Fund, and
the Transitional Escrow Fund which are identified by the Comptroller as the operating funds of the Commonwealth.
In addition, there are 22 other budgeted funds, the Intragovernmental Services Fund, the Inland Fisheries and Game
Fund, the Marine Recreational Fisheries Development Fund, the Underground Storage Tank Petroleum Product
Cleanup Fund, the Public Safety Training Fund, the Local Capital Projects Fund, the Gaming Local Aid Fund, the
Education Fund, the Local Aid Stabilization Fund, the Gaming Economic Development Fund, the Marijuana
Regulation Fund, the Behavioral Health Outreach Access and Support Trust Fund, the Student Opportunity Act
Investment Fund, the Broadband Innovation Fund, the High-Quality Early Education and Care Affordability Fund,
the Youth Development and Achievement Fund, the Behavioral Health Trust Fund, Castle Island, Marine Park Trust
Fund, the Education and Transportation Fund, the Education and Transportation Reserve Fund, the Education and
Transportation Innovation and Capital Fund, and the Early Education and Care Operational Grant Fund.
Non-Budgeted Special Revenue Funds - are established by law to account for revenue sources that have been
segregated from the budgeted funds to support specific governmental activities such as federal grants, the operations
of the state lottery and funds related to the Massachusetts Gaming Commission.
Capital Projects Funds - account for financial resources used to acquire or construct major capital assets and to
finance local capital projects. These resources are derived almost entirely from proceeds of bonds and other
obligations, which are generally received after related expenditures have been incurred, operating transfers
authorized by the Legislature, and from federal reimbursements. Deficit balances in the capital projects funds
represent amounts to be financed, primarily through future bond sales.
Commonwealth of Massachusetts 40 Statutory Basis Financial Report
Notes to Combined Financial Statements - Statutory Basis Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2024

Section 26:
2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
A. STATUTORY BASIS OF ACCOUNTING
The SBFR is prepared from the Commonwealth’s books and records and other official reports that are maintained on
the basis of accounting used in the preparation of the Commonwealth’s legally adopted annual budget (statutory
basis). The statutory basis emphasizes accountability and budgetary control of appropriations. The SBFR is not
intended to present the Commonwealth’s financial condition and results of operations in conformity with GAAP.
Under the statutory basis of accounting, revenues generally are recognized when cash deposits are received by the
Treasury. However, revenues receivable for federal grants and reimbursements generally are recognized when
related expenditures are incurred, provided that the related revenues are received by the Commonwealth by August
31, the end of the statutory accounts receivable period. Amounts due from political subdivisions of the
Commonwealth are recognized when considered measurable and available. These are largely payments from
municipalities reimbursing for pension costs paid by the Commonwealth on their behalf, authorized under Section
3(8)c of Chapter 32 of the MGL, provided that the revenues are received by August 31.
Under the statutory basis of accounting, expenditures are generally recorded when the related cash disbursement
occurs. At year-end, payroll is accrued and payables are recognized, to the extent of approved encumbrances, for
goods or services received by June 30, and payment made by August 31. Costs incurred under the federally-
sponsored Medicaid program, amounts required to settle claims and judgments against the Commonwealth, and
certain other liabilities are not recognized until they are encumbered or otherwise processed for payment. In some
cases the liabilities will have been incurred prior to June 30, but recorded when paid in the following fiscal year, not
as statutory payables.
The accounting policies followed in preparing the accompanying statutory basis financial report are described in the
remainder of this section.
B. CASH, SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS AND INVESTMENTS
The Commonwealth follows the practice of pooling cash and cash equivalents, except for balances in the
Commonwealth Stabilization Fund, which are sequestered. Cash equivalents consist of short-term investments with
an original maturity of three months or less and are stated at cost. Interest earned on pooled cash is allocated to the
General Fund and, when so directed by law, to certain other governmental funds.
The Office of the Treasurer and Receiver-General (Treasury) manages the Commonwealth’s short-term external
mixed investment pool, the Massachusetts Municipal Depository Trust (MMDT). MMDT is comprised of two
portfolios, a Cash Portfolio and a Short Term Bond Fund. The Cash Portfolio is a money-market-like investment
pool; its investments are carried at amortized cost, which approximates fair value. The Short Term Bond Fund
investments are carried at fair value.
Investors in MMDT are not allowed to overdraw their shares. For a complete copy of MMDT’s separately issued
financial statements, please contact the Office of the State Treasurer’s Cash Management Department, at (617)
367-9333. The statements can also be downloaded from the Cash Management section of the Office of the State
Treasurer’s website at www.mass.gov/treasury. MGL Chapter 29, Section 38 enumerates the Commonwealth’s
investment policy for non-pension assets.
C. DEDICATED REVENUE AND PLEDGES
The Commonwealth has a number of bond programs in which bonds are secured by a pledge of dedicated revenues
provided to bondholders, pursuant to trust agreements, as well as pledges of revenue for general operations. Like
the Commonwealth, certain state authorities have also issued special obligation bonds secured by specific
Commonwealth revenues. These other authorities’ debts are not included in the SBFR, but are included in the
ACFR.
Commonwealth of Massachusetts 41 Statutory Basis Financial Report
Notes to Combined Financial Statements - Statutory Basis Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2024
All federal highway reimbursements are dedicated to funding the principal portion only of federal grant anticipation
notes (GANs) issued in fiscal years 2015, 2017, 2018 and 2020 with no new bonds issued in FY24. As of June 30,
2024, total principal remaining to be paid was approximately $256 million. Remaining maturities are from FY26
through FY27. Debt service paid during FY24 was approximately $158 million.
The Commonwealth issued approximately $500 million in new money special obligation bonds under the Rail
Enhancement Program (REP) in FY24. These bonds mature from FY25 to FY53 and are secured by a lien on the full
24 cents per gallon gasoline tax, the full 24 cents per gallon of special fuels taxes (comprised primarily of taxes on
diesel fuel), and the full 19.1% of the average price per gallon tax on liquefied natural gas and all Registry of Motor
Vehicle fees deposited into the Commonwealth Transportation Fund (CTF). As of June 30, 2024, approximately
$1.480 billion and $2.393 billion in principal was outstanding on the ABP and REP bonds, respectively, and
approximately $784 million and $2.395 billion of interest (net of the federal subsidy) was expected to be paid
through maturity related to the ABP and REP bonds, respectively.
The ABP projected interest costs are net of federal subsidies under the Build America Bond (BABs) program.
BABs is a temporary program under which the Commonwealth and other state and local governments issued taxable
bonds in calendar 2009 and 2010 in return for a subsidy from the federal government equal to 35% to 45%
(depending on whether the proceeds are used for projects in economically distressed areas) of the interest costs on
the bonds.
A portion of the Commonwealth’s receipts from the sales tax (other than the tax on meals) is dedicated through non-
budgeted special revenue funds to the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) and the Massachusetts
School Building Authority (MSBA). The amount dedicated to the MBTA is the amount raised by a 1.0% sales tax
(not including meals), subject to an inflation-adjusted floor. A comparable amount, though without the floor, is
dedicated to the MSBA beginning in fiscal 2010, with lesser amounts having been dedicated to the MSBA from
fiscal 2005 through fiscal 2009.
Legislation approved by the Governor on October 31, 2014 increased the amount statutorily required to be credited
to the MBTA by $160 million annually, starting in fiscal 2015. The $160 million increase in the dedicated sales tax
revenue amount and the amount included in the inflation-adjusted floor were intended to replace the $160 million
annual state appropriation the MBTA received from fiscal 2010 through fiscal 2014. In FY24, total dedicated sales
tax revenue that was directed to the MBTA was approximately $1.404 billion. Dedicated revenues to the MBTA
increase by the lesser of the annual increase in the Boston consumer price index or prior calendar year annual sales
taxes, with a floor of 0% and a ceiling of 3.0%.
The MSBA also receives a pledge starting in FY11 of a 1.0% sales tax (not including meals) but with no annual
floor or ceiling. In FY24, approximately $1.244 billion of the dedicated sales tax revenue stream was directed to the
MSBA.
The Commonwealth has also pledged sales tax revenue and rooms tax surcharges from areas contiguous to
convention centers and the Worcester DCU Arena and Convention Center to support such centers’ operations. As of
June 30, 2024, taxes within the Convention Center districts support approximately $397 million of outstanding
principal and approximately $130 million of interest on debts related to these Convention Centers. Taxes collected
in FY24 were approximately $225 million, while debt service on the bonds was approximately $52 million.
The Transportation Modernization Act of 2009, as amended, eliminated the pledges of sales tax revenue to
MassDOT through the Commonwealth Transportation Fund (CTF). Beginning in FY14, motor vehicle sales tax
collections were shifted from the General Fund to the CTF while also eliminating the 0.385% pledge of regular and
meals sales tax. During FY24, approximately $590 million in motor vehicle sales tax revenue was transferred to
MassDOT. From the CTF, $187 million was dedicated to funding the operations of the MBTA while an additional
$94 million was dedicated to funding the operations of the regional transit authorities. These amounts are
transferred through the CTF.
Commonwealth of Massachusetts 42 Statutory Basis Financial Report
Notes to Combined Financial Statements - Statutory Basis Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2024
D. INTERFUND/INTRAFUND TRANSACTIONS
Transactions of a buyer/seller nature between departments within a fund are not eliminated.
Transfers in and out net to approximately $25 million due to higher education non-appropriated fund activity, which
is not included in the combined statements - statutory basis.
E. CURRENT EMPLOYEE BENEFITS
Employees are granted vacation and sick leave in varying amounts based on collective bargaining agreements and
state laws. Upon retirement, termination or death, certain employees are compensated for unused vacation and sick
leave (subject to certain limitations) at their current rate of pay (not accrued on a statutory basis).
F. FRINGE BENEFIT COST RECOVERY
The Commonwealth pays the fringe benefit costs of its employees and retirees through the General Fund. These
fringe benefits include the costs of employees’ health insurance, pensions, unemployment compensation, and other
costs necessary to support the state work force. As directed by Chapter 29, Sections 5D and 6B(f) of the MGL,
these costs are assessed to other funds based on their payroll costs, net of credits for direct payments.
Since these fringe benefit costs and pensions are not appropriated in the budget, the required assessment creates a
variance between budget and actual expenditures at year-end. The fringe benefit cost recoveries of approximately
$620 million in the General Fund results from cost assessments from the other budgeted funds, non-budgeted special
revenue funds, capital projects funds, non-appropriated activities of higher education, expendable trust, and
custodial funds.
G. LOTTERY REVENUE AND PRIZES
Ticket revenues are recognized when sold and prizes awarded by the Massachusetts State Lottery Commission are
recognized as drawings are held. Games expenditures are accrued at year-end only for open jackpots for Mega
Millions, Powerball and Megabucks.
H. RECEIVABLES
Reimbursements due to the Commonwealth for its expenditures on federally funded reimbursement and grant
programs are reported as “Due from federal government”. Other receivables include reimbursement of fringe
benefit assessments from authorities and the institutions of higher education along with other departmental
receivables.
I. DUE FROM CITIES AND TOWNS
“Due from Cities and Towns” represents reimbursements due to the Commonwealth for its expenditures on certain
programs for the benefit of cities and towns.
J. RISK MANAGEMENT
The Commonwealth is self-insured for state employees’ workers’ compensation, casualty, theft, tort claims and
other losses. Such liabilities are not recognized in the governmental funds on the statutory basis until encumbered
and/or processed for payment. For employees’ workers’ compensation, the Commonwealth assumes the full risk of
claims filed under a program managed by the Human Resources Division.
For personal injury or property damages, Chapter 258 of the MGL limits the risk assumed by the Commonwealth to
$100,000 per occurrence, in most circumstances.
Commonwealth of Massachusetts 43 Statutory Basis Financial Report
Notes to Combined Financial Statements - Statutory Basis Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2024
The Group Insurance Commission administers contributory health care and other insurance programs for the
Commonwealth’s employees and retirees.
K. ENCUMBRANCES
Encumbrance accounting is utilized in the Governmental Funds as a significant aspect of budgetary control. The full
amounts of purchase orders, contracts and other commitments of appropriated resources are encumbered and
recorded as deductions from appropriations prior to actual expenditure, ensuring that such commitments do not
exceed appropriations. Encumbrances outstanding at year-end for goods or services received on or before June 30,
but paid after, are reported as expenditures and statutory basis liabilities as a component of accounts payable.
L. FUND BALANCES
Fund balance has been reserved as follows:
“Reserved for continuing appropriations” - are unexpended amounts in appropriations, which the Legislature has
specifically authorized to be carried into the next fiscal year.
“Reserved for Commonwealth Stabilization” - are amounts set aside in the Commonwealth Stabilization Fund in
accordance with Section 5C of Chapter 29 of the MGL.
“Reserved for debt service” - are amounts held by fiscal agents or the Commonwealth to fund future debt service
obligations.
The remainder of fund balance is unreserved and undesignated and consists of cumulative surplus or deficits of the
fund not otherwise designated.
M. TOTAL COLUMN - MEMORANDUM ONLY
Total and subtotal columns on the combined financial statements - statutory basis are captioned “Memorandum
Only” to indicate that they are presented only to facilitate financial analysis. Data in these columns do not present
consolidated financial position, results of operations, or changes in financial position. Interfund eliminations have
not been made in the aggregation of these data.
The financial statements include certain prior year summarized comparative information in total but not by fund.
Such information does not include sufficient detail to constitute a full comparative presentation. Accordingly, such
information should be read in conjunction with the Commonwealth’s financial statements in this SBFR for the year
ended June 30, 2023, from which the summarized information was derived.
N. ESTIMATES
The preparation of the SBFR requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures at the date of the financial report. Estimates also affect the reported
amounts of revenues and expenditures during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Section 27:
3. BUDGETARY CONTROL
State finance law requires that a balanced budget be approved by the Governor and the Legislature. The Governor
presents an annual budget to the Legislature, which includes estimates of revenues and other financing sources and
recommended expenditures and other financing uses. The Legislature, which has full authority to amend the budget,
adopts an expenditure budget by appropriating monies at the individual appropriation account level in an annual
appropriations act.
Commonwealth of Massachusetts 44 Statutory Basis Financial Report
Notes to Combined Financial Statements - Statutory Basis Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2024
Before signing the appropriations act, the Governor may veto or reduce any specific item, subject to legislative
override. Further changes to the budget established in the annual appropriations act may be made via supplemental
appropriation acts or other legislative acts. These must also be signed by the Governor and are subject to the line
item veto.
In addition, MGL authorizes the Secretary of Administration and Finance, with the approval of the Governor, upon
determination that available revenues will be insufficient to meet authorized expenditures, to withhold allotments of
appropriated funds, which effectively reduce the affected accounts’ expenditure budgets.
The majority of the Commonwealth’s appropriations are non-continuing accounts which lapse at the end of each
fiscal year. Others are continuing accounts for which the Legislature has authorized that an unspent balance from
the prior year be carried forward and made available for spending in the current fiscal year. In addition, the
Legislature may direct that certain revenues be retained and made available for spending within an appropriation.
Fringe benefits, pension costs, and certain other costs that are mandated by state finance law are not itemized in the
appropriation process and are not separately budgeted.
Because revenue budgets are not updated subsequent to the original appropriation act, the comparison of the initial
revenue budget to the subsequent, and often modified, expenditure budget can be misleading. Also, these financial
statements portray fund accounting with gross inflows and outflows, thus creating a difference from separately
published budget documents, which eliminate some interfund activity. In conducting the budget process, the
Commonwealth excludes those interfund transactions that by their nature have no impact on the combined fund
balance of the budgeted funds.
Generally, expenditures may not exceed the level of spending authorized for an appropriation account. However,
the Commonwealth is required to pay certain Medicaid expenses regardless of appropriations, due to superseding
federal law.
The FY04 General Appropriation Act (Chapter 26, Section 167 of the Acts of 2003) amended Section 9C of Chapter
29, directing the Governor to notify the Legislature in writing as to the reasons for and the effect of any reductions in
spending. This proposal must be delivered to the Legislature 15 days before any reductions take effect.
Alternatively, funds from the Stabilization Fund may be used to cure the deficiency, subject to appropriation.

Commonwealth of Massachusetts 46 Statutory Basis Financial Report
Notes to Combined Financial Statements - Statutory Basis Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2024
The Office of the Comptroller has the responsibility to ensure that budgetary control is maintained on an individual
appropriation account basis. Budgetary control is exercised through the state accounting system, the Massachusetts
Management Accounting and Reporting System (MMARS). Encumbrances and expenditures are not allowed to
exceed the appropriation account’s spending authorization.

Section 28:
4. MASSACHUSETTS DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION (MassDOT)
MassDOT is a legally separate entity from the Commonwealth. MassDOT operations are reported separately in the
non-budgeted special revenue funds section of this report, which includes all of the Commonwealth’s highway and
turnpike-related operations as well as the activity of the Registry of Motor Vehicles. MassDOT capital spending and
revenue activity are reported in the capital funds section of this report, in the General Capital Projects Fund, Central
Artery Statewide Road and Bridge Infrastructure Fund, the Highway Capital Projects Fund, and the Federal
Highway Construction Program Fund.
MassDOT financial activity is included in this report in order to reflect all activity reported on the Commonwealth’s
MMARS accounting system. For the SBFR, MassDOT is treated as an agency or department of the
Commonwealth, as specified in Massachusetts General Laws. However, for GAAP reporting purposes, as reflected
in the Commonwealth’s ACFR, MassDOT is reported as a discretely presented component unit of the
Commonwealth.

Section 29:
5. INDIVIDUAL FUND DEFICITS
The following non-budgeted special revenue and capital projects funds are included in the combined totals and have
individual fund deficits at June 30, 2024, as follows (amounts in thousands) (excludes MassDOT):

6. MEDICAID COSTS
Approximately 37.6% of the Commonwealth’s budgeted funds spending for programs and services is devoted to
Medicaid. It is the largest and has been one of the fastest growing items in the Commonwealth’s budget. For the
fiscal year ended June 30, 2024, the budgeted funds include approximately $20.070 billion in expenditures for
Medicaid claims. The combined financial statements - statutory basis includes Medicaid claims processed but
unpaid at June 30, 2024 of approximately $75 million as accounts payable.

Commonwealth of Massachusetts 51 Statutory Basis Financial Report
Individual Budgeted Funds
Budgeted funds are those funds subject to appropriation in either the annual General Appropriation Act (GAA) or
other appropriations bills. Unless otherwise specified, budgeted funds are also subject to Section 5C of Chapter 29
of the Massachusetts General Laws (MGL) which defines the “consolidated net surplus” calculation (and determines
whether the annual budget is in balance) as well as year-end transfers to eliminate deficits in budgeted funds and
transfers of surplus balances to the Commonwealth Stabilization Fund. The following contains a list of budgeted
funds grouped by categories.
BUDGETED FUNDS
The General Fund - The General Fund is the Commonwealth’s primary Governmental Fund. All governmental
activities not specifically directed to another fund are accounted for in the General Fund. As a result, most budgeted

education and independent commissions are paid from the General Fund. It similarly receives a significant portion
of sales, individual income and corporate taxes and the full amount of most other governmental taxes.
Commonwealth Transportation Fund - to account for revenues from motor fuels taxes and all fees and fines
received by the Registry of Motor Vehicles relating to the use and operation of motor vehicles and trailers.
Spending is for debt service on general and special obligation debt, as well as for amounts, subject to appropriation,
to fund the programs and services of the Massachusetts Department of Transportation.
The Commonwealth Stabilization Fund - to account for amounts calculated in accordance with state finance law
and to maintain a reserve to enhance the Commonwealth’s fiscal stability. Tax revenues from certain lottery
winners selling their stream of future winnings in exchange for current payments are recorded in this fund. In
addition, transfers are required for fiscal year capital gains tax revenues exceeding $1 billion (adjusted annually for
economic growth), judgments and settlements of more than $10 million that exceed the previous 5 years average of
judgments and settlements, and a portion of the gaming tax revenues. Any excess undesignated fund balance as
calculated by Section 5C of Chapter 29 of the MGL, are also transferred to this fund.

governmental funds of the Commonwealth. It differs from the schedule of tax collections prepared by the
Comptroller, Commissioner of Revenue and State Auditor for calculations in accordance with Chapter 62F of the
General Laws, as amended. The differences are due to 2/5ths of Beano revenue and the health care coverage penalty
in the Commonwealth Care Fund, both of which are recognized on the statutory basis of accounting but are not
accounted for on the schedule of tax collections prepared by the Department of Revenue.

Legislative filing to be made in the LAWS system
The Office of the Comptroller hereby files the Commonwealth’s Statutory Basis Financial Report
(SBFR) for Fiscal Year 2024, the 12-month period ended June 30, 2024.
The SBFR provides independent and unbiased accounting of Commonwealth revenues and
expenditures for Fiscal Year 2024. The SBFR was prepared by the professional staff of the Office
of the Comptroller and reviewed by the Commonwealth’s independent audit firm,
CliftonLarsonAllen LLP (CLA), in accordance with professional standards established by the
American Institute of Certified Public Accountants.
M.G.L c. 7A, § 12, requires the Comptroller to file the SBFR with the Governor, the Secretary of
Administration and Finance, the House and Senate Committees on Ways and Means, the Clerks of
the House and Senate, and any other parties specified in general or special law by October 31 of
each year. The final supplementary budget for Fiscal Year 2024 (“the closeout supp”) was signed
on December 4, 2024, making it impossible to meet the statutory requirement. As I described in
my letter of November 1, 2024, there is a pattern of serious delay in the closeout of the fiscal year
and the delivery of the SBFR.
Although the timing of the report is a serious concern, the content of the SBFR shows that the
financial condition of the Commonwealth is very sound. While the rate of growth in revenues
must be expected to fluctuate, the general upward trend in revenue continued in Fiscal Year 2024.
- Page 1 of 2 -

In seeking to address both ongoing and emerging spending priorities, elected officials in the
Administration and the Legislature have exercised prudence in matching needs and resources. The
successful management of fiscal challenges, the continuing growth of the Stabilization Fund, the
ongoing attention to debt and pension obligations – all are positive signs of the careful and
thoughtful work by the Legislature and the Administration on behalf of the people of the
Commonwealth.
I can also attest to the hard work of the professionals in my office and across state government,
who strive to ensure that the annual budget and all aspects of state finance law are faithfully
executed, and that our financial processes occur efficiently, under effective controls, and guarded
against fraud. That group includes financial staff in the largest and smallest departments, across
the executive branch and independents. It includes as well, the Executive Office for
Administration & Finance, the Office of the Treasurer and Receiver-General, and the Office of the
State Auditor, each of which plays a critical role at the center of state finance. I thank them all for
their partnership in Fiscal Year 2024.
I thank the staff of the Office of the Comptroller. I take this opportunity to note the recognition
our Statewide General Accounting Team, under the leadership of Assistant Comptroller & Chief
Accounting Officer Kristin Lacroix, received this past year from the national Government
Financial Officers Association. For their work in producing the SBFR, I thank Assistant
Comptroller & Chief Financial Reporting Officer Pauline Lieu and every member of her team, as
well as Senior Advisor Howard Merkowitz. I am fortunate to work with such knowledgeable and
dedicated public servants.
Sincerely,
William McNamara
Comptroller

Report Summary
As of June 30, 2024, the Commonwealth had a budgeted fund balance of approximately $15.004 billion and
completed FY24 with a “consolidated net surplus” $426 million, which, per statute, was transferred to the Student
Opportunity Act Investment Fund (See below for the statutory definition of consolidated net surplus and a balanced
budget). During the fiscal year, the balance of the Commonwealth Stabilization (or rainy day) Fund increased by
$488 million, to $8.524 billion, primarily the result of interest earned on the Fund’s balances, as well as transfers to
the Fund of capital gains taxes, gaming tax revenue, and abandoned property. No funds were drawn from the
Stabilization Fund in FY24. (The Budgeted Funds – Operations table on page 11 displays the FY24 summary of
budgeted funds compared to FY23. Details of the FY24 Stabilization Fund activity are provided on pages 13-16 and
page 178.) The total budgeted fund balance of $15.004 billion reflects a reduction in budgeted fund balances
(revenues and other financing sources less than expenditures and other financing uses) of approximately $334
million from the FY24 beginning balance of $15.338 billion. This follows an FY23 operating loss of $2.862 billion.
Approximately $3.172 billion is reserved for continuing appropriations and debt service in FY24 in all budgeted
funds. In addition to the $8.524 billion reserved in the Stabilization Fund, $1.477 billion is held in the Transitional
Escrow Fund, which was created at the end of FY21 to hold that year’s budget surplus as well as the surplus in
FY22 and FY23 ending balances. The remaining undesignated balance of $2.709 billion is made up of other
budgeted fund balances not included in the consolidated net surplus calculation.
During FY24, budgeted fund tax revenues increased by $4.435 billion, or 13.2%, from FY23, with the entire
increase was due to the net impact of several tax laws, including a one-time reduction in FY23 tax collections
triggered by FY22 tax revenue growth and implementation of new tax laws in FY24 that on net increased F24 tax
collections, most notably the full fiscal year impact of a 4% surtax on personal incomes above $1 million. (Without
those changes, FY24 budgeted fund tax revenues would have been virtually unchanged from FY23 — (see page 6
for a detailed explanation of these impacts.) Before transfers between budgeted funds (which do not affect total
budgeted fund balances), total budgeted fund revenues and other financing sources increased by $4.320 billion, or
7.5%. Budgeted fund expenditures and other financing uses, including transfers to non-budgeted funds (but before
transfers between the budgeted funds) increased by $1.793 billion, or 3.0%, with the largest changes being new
spending on Transportation and Education projects from revenue generated by the “Fair Share” 4% personal income
tax surtax, increases in local aid spending, growth in post-employment benefits, and spending for family shelters,
partially offset by a reduction in MassHealth (Medicaid) expenditures. A detailed analysis of revenue and spending
changes, as well as the economic factors that affected the budget, is included in the sections that follow.
Overview of the Financial Statements
This report focuses primarily on the Commonwealth’s budgeted funds. For the budgeted funds, the activity (inflows
and outflows) and balances (assets and liabilities) of each fund are presented separately. For all other non-budgeted
funds included in this report, the activity – inflows and outflows – is presented in tabular form, but per statute, the
full balance sheets for each fund are not shown.
The financial operations of these funds are maintained in the Massachusetts Management Accounting and Reporting
System (MMARS), the statewide accounting system, which is operated by the Commonwealth and contains detailed
information summarized in this report.
The SBFR satisfies the requirements of state finance law and to present the results of FY24 activity in the
Commonwealth’s funds. The report contains computations required by state finance law, including the certification
of the state’s consolidated net surplus and the balances in the Stabilization Fund.

Basis of Accounting and Definition of the Consolidated Net Surplus
The statutory (or budgetary) basis of accounting, as defined in Massachusetts law, is used to budget and control the
Commonwealth’s fiscal operations. The statutory basis of accounting does not conform with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) as defined for governments by the Governmental
Accounting Standards Board (GASB). In addition, per statute, the Commonwealth-managed fiduciary funds (the
largest of which funds Unemployment Insurance benefits) are not included in this presentation. The Comptroller’s
Office will report the Commonwealth’s financial position on a GAAP basis in the State’s Annual Comprehensive
Financial Report (ACFR). That report provides a more consistent basis for comparison with other jurisdictions, as
the accounting rules for the ACFR are the same for all governments, whereas the statutory basis of accounting may
differ across states. There are significant differences between what is contained in the SBFR and what will be
presented in the GAAP-based ACFR, the major ones being that the ACFR reflects capital assets and depreciation
expense, all types of long-term obligations – including debt, pensions, and other post-employment benefits (or
OPEB, which are mainly retirees’ health insurance benefits) – and in the ACFR the financial statements are
presented in an all-encompassing, net position and net expense format. In addition, the statutory basis of accounting
is mainly cash-based, with a two month accounts payable period for expenses and accounts receivable for revenues
received from other government entities (“modified cash basis”).
The Commonwealth’s statutory basis of accounting, as set out in Chapter 29 of the Massachusetts General Laws
(MGL), defines the “consolidated net surplus” or CNS as the ending “undesignated”, or unreserved, balances in the
budgeted funds, that is, those funds subject to the state’s annual appropriation process, though by statute several
budgeted funds (including the Transitional Escrow Fund and those funded by the 4% surtax) are excluded from the
consolidated net surplus calculation. State finance law defines a “balanced budget” as a consolidated net surplus of
$0 or greater. The largest of the budgeted funds in FY24 were the General Fund, the Federal Covid-19 Response
Fund, and the Commonwealth Transportation Fund, which in FY24 together accounted for approximately 86.9% ,
3.6%, and 3.5%, respectively, of total budgeted fund expenditures and other financing uses. The remaining
approximately 6.0% of budgeted fund activity comprises 24 other funds, 20 of which by statute are excluded from
the consolidated net surplus calculation.
In accordance with Section 12 of Chapter 7A of the MGL, the Office of the Comptroller is required to transmit the
SBFR by October 31st. However, due to the fact that the final FY24 supplemental budget bill was not enacted and
signed into law until December 4, 2024, this SBFR is being transmitted on February 14, 2025 in order to provide
sufficient time to accurately incorporate that bill’s provisions into this report and have it reviewed by the
Commonwealth’s independent auditor.
The SBFR for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024 is reviewed, not audited, by the state’s independent auditor,
CliftonLarsonAllen (“CLA”), and represents the closing of the Commonwealth’s books for the fiscal year.
The Economic Context
The funding available to the Commonwealth to finance its programs is determined largely by the performance of the
state’s economy, particularly growth in employment, wages and investment income, which drive the personal
income tax, the state’s largest revenue source, and the sales tax, which depends on the amount of income
Massachusetts residents have available to spend. In FY24, the Commonwealth’s economy continued to recover
from the economic impact of the global Coronavirus or COVID-19 pandemic, though growth moderated as the
economy reached full employment. Between June 2023 and June 2024, employment increased by approximately
26,100 jobs, or 0.7%, compared to increased employment of 1.6% for the United States as a whole. As of June 2024
the Massachusetts unemployment rate was lower than for the U.S. as a whole: 3.2%, compared to 4.1% nationally.
As the Massachusetts economy reached full employment, wages and salaries, which largely determine personal
income tax collections, grew more slowly than the national average, by 5.0% from FY23, compared to 6.1% median
growth rate of all other states.

The Budgeted Funds
The FY24 budget enacted by the Legislature (the General Appropriation Act, or GAA) included an FY24 tax
revenue estimate of $41.410 billion prior to tax initiatives (and excluding $50 million in tax settlements greater than
$10 million each), equal to the FY24 consensus estimate of $40.410 billion plus $1.0 billion in personal income tax
revenue estimated to be generated by a 4% surtax on incomes above $1 billion that was in effect for all of FY24.
The GAA tax revenue estimate was reduced by a net of $530 million, to $40.880 billion, as a result of enacted and
proposed tax law changes included in the budget that were forecasted to reduce FY24 tax revenues by $580 million,
partially offset by $50 million in assumed tax-related settlements and judgments exceeding $10 million. $38.086
billion of that revenue was to be deposited in the budgeted funds and available for use, with $2.794 billion to be
deposited into non-budgeted funds, including transfers of sales tax revenue of $1.464 billion dedicated to the
Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority and $1.304 billion dedicated to the Massachusetts School Building
Authority, $583 million of capital gains tax revenues transferred to the Stabilization Fund, State Pension Fund, and
State Retiree Benefits Trust Fund, and $27 million in Unemployment Insurance surcharges allocated to the non-
budgeted Workforce Training Fund.
Based on tax revenue performance through December 2023, in January 2024, the Secretary of Administration and
Finance reduced the FY24 state tax revenue estimate by $997 million to a total of $39.884 billion, including the
projected revenue impact of tax law changes and $50 million in judgment and settlement revenue.
The GAA also assumed budgeted fund non-tax revenue of $24.153 billion, including $13.735 billion in federal
reimbursements, $6.128 billion in departmental revenue, and $4.290 billion in consolidated transfers, or transfers
from non-budgeted to budgeted funds. Total budgeted fund tax and non-tax revenues assumed in the GAA
(excluding the non-budgeted fund portions allocated to the MBTA, MSBA, and Unemployment Insurance
surcharge) was $62.239 billion.
The FY24 General Appropriation Act (GAA) authorized approximately $66.814 billion in spending, including
approximately $4.105 billion in required pension contributions and $1.323 billion in other transfers.
Approximately $1.809 billion in supplemental appropriations were authorized during FY24, $580 million of which
were enacted by June 30, 2024. Subsequent to year end, a supplemental budget was enacted totaling approximately
$1.230 billion in new appropriations. Of the FY24 appropriations included in the GAA and supplemental budgets,
$3.154 billion was authorized to be continued into FY25.
The year’s significant supplemental appropriations (some of which were carried forward and reappropriated to be
expended in FY25):
• $565 million for MassHealth (Medicaid) services;
• $312 million to fund collective bargaining contracts
• $251 million for family shelters and associated services
• $228 million for MassHealth's Home and Community-Based Services program
• $176 million to fund a transfer from the Medical Assistance Trust Fund to hospitals that treat large numbers
of Medicaid-eligible patients
FY24 budgeted revenues and other financing sources (before transfers between the budgeted funds, which are
included in both spending and revenue and thus have no effect on total budgeted fund balances) totaled $61.735
billion, an increase of $4.320 billion, or 7.5%, from FY23. Most of this increase from FY23 was due to full year
implementation of the 4% surtax, a one-time reduction in FY23 revenues resulting from refunds issued pursuant to a
law that required FY22 excess revenues to be returned to taxpayers in FY23, partially offset by other tax cuts that
reduced revenue. These changes are discussed below.
5

FY24 tax revenues ended the year at $40.813 billion (including $16 million in tax settlements exceeding $10 million
each), of which $38.138 billion was deposited in the budgeted funds after accounting for the transfer of sales tax
revenue of $1.404 billion to the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority and $1.244 billion to the
Massachusetts School Building Authority, and $26 million in unemployment tax surcharges to the Workforce
Training Fund. Tax revenue deposited in the budgeted funds increased by $4.435 billion, or 13.2%, from FY23,
$944 million above the final FY24 estimate, with above-forecast revenue due entirely to the implementation of a 4%
surtax on incomes above $1 million (see following paragraph).
The $4.435 billion increase in budgeted fund tax revenues between FY23 and FY24 was primarily the result of two
tax law impacts, one of which resulted in one-time tax revenue reductions in FY23 and the other that resulted in
increased tax collections in FY24, the combination of which caused an increase of $4.662 billion in tax revenue in
FY24 compared to FY23. One-time FY23 personal income tax refunds of $2.879 billion were issued pursuant to
Chapter 62F of the Massachusetts General Laws, which required that tax revenues in excess of a statutory limit in
FY22 be refunded to taxpayers in FY23 to FY24 (thus reducing tax revenues in FY23 relative to FY24). Another tax
law change resulted in increased FY24 tax revenues: the “Fair Share” 4% surcharge on incomes over $1 million that
was implemented for a full fiscal year 2024 and raised $2.460 billion in FY24, $2.218 billion more than the surtax
raised in FY23. Partially offsetting these impacts was the implementation of certain tax reforms, which reduced
FY24 income tax revenues by $431 million. Absent these three changes, “baseline” tax revenues decreased by $228
million, or 0.6% in FY24 compared to FY23, with growth in income tax withholding offset by a decline in capital
gains taxes, corporate and business tax, sales tax, deeds excise tax, and estate tax.
Total personal income tax collections totaled $24.112 billion, an increase of $5.117 billion, or 26.9%; adjusted for
the FY23 one-time reduction in taxes resulting from the Chapter 62F refunds, the 4% surtax and the impact of tax
reforms in FY24, the increase was $455 million, or 2.1%, with growth in withholding partially offset by a decline in
non-witheld income tax. Personal income tax withholding totaled $17.967 billion, an increase of $1.320 billion or
7.9%, and an increase of $1.007 billion, or 6.1%, when adjusted for the impact of the 4% surtax. Non-withheld
personal income tax (primarily quarterly estimated tax payments and final payments with tax returns, reduced by
refunds), totaled $6.145 billion, up by $3.797 billion, or 161.7%, but declined by $552 million, or 11.0%, when
adjusted for the impact of tax law changes, primarily due to a decline in capital gains taxes, which totaled $2.009
billion, down $271 million, or 11.9%, from FY23. Corporate and business taxes (comprising corporate excise,
financial institutions, insurance company, and public utilities taxes) totaled $4.833 billion, a decrease of
$275 million, or 5.4%, and revenue from sales and use taxes (including regular sales, meals, and motor vehicle sales
tax, but excluding cannabis sales tax and the revenues allocated to the MBTA and MSBA) totaled $6.626 billion,
down $21 million, or 0.3%, as a $69 million increase in meals tax collections was offset by an $89 million decline in
regular sales tax. Other notable tax revenue sources included motor fuels taxes, which totaled $713 million, up $11
million, or 1.6% from FY23, deeds excise tax revenues, which totaled $337 million, down $33 million, or 9.9%, as
home sales continued to decline, cannabis sales and excise taxes, which totaled $239 million, up $16 million, or
7.0%, as the legal cannabis market continued to expand, and estate and inheritance taxes,which totaled $574 million,
a decline of $400 million, or 41.0%, as this volatile revenue source dropped from an unusually high FY23 level.

Fiscal Year 2024 Budgeted Fund Revenues and Other Financing Sources
Before Transfers Between Budgeted Funds (Total of $61.735 billion)
Federal Reimbursements: 23.7%
Income Tax: 39.0%
Transfers: 4.2%
Departmental: 10.4%
Other Tax: 4.2%
Sales & Use Tax: 10.7%
Corporate Tax & Business Tax: 7.8%
Budgeted fund federal reimbursements totaled $14.603 billion, a decrease of $622 million, or 4.1%, with the decline
resulting primarily from lower federal reimbursements for reduced Medicaid expenditures (see explanation of
Medicaid expenditure changes on the following page). Medicaid federal reimbursements totaled $13.210 billion, a
decrease of $989 million, or 7.0%.
Budgeted fund departmental revenue totaled $6.429 billion, an increase of $347 million, or 5.7%, from FY23. Most
of the departmental revenue growth was due to increases in interest earnings, which grew by $282 million, from
$698 million in FY23 to $980 million in FY24, as result of higher short-term interest rates applied to the
Commonwealth’s large cash balances, particularly in the Stabilization Fund. Other significant sources of
departmental revenue were reimbursements for services, which totaled $2.702 billion, down $67 million,or 2.4%
from FY23, with the the most significant sources being rebates received from drug manufacturers for the state’s
Medicaid program, which totaled $1.523 billion, down $105 million, or 6.5% from FY23 and reimbursements
received from cities and towns for health insurance provided by the Group Insurance Commission,which totaled
$655 million in FY24, virtually identical to FY23). Fees received by the state totaled $1.272 billion, up $35
million, or 2.8%,, with virtually the entire increase due to motor vehicle fees and licenses, which totaled $626
million, up $38 million, or 6.5%. Among other significant sources of departmental revenue were drug rebates for
the state’s employee Group Insurance program, which totaled $165 million, up $158 million from FY23 (see detail
of GIC spending below for an explanation of this increase).
Interfund transfers from non-budgeted funds to the budgeted funds totaled $2.564 billion, an increase of $161
million, or 6.7%, from FY23. Gaming revenues transferred to the budgeted funds totaled $345 million, up $53
million, or 18.3% from FY23. Lottery Fund transfers to the General Fund totaled $1.125 billion, a decrease of $40
million, or 3.4% (see Lottery and Gaming section on page 12). Fringe benefit and indirect cost recovery from non-
budgeted funds totaled $682 million, up $117 million, or 20.6% from FY23, due to increases in the fringe benefit
rate and higher spending from federal grant accounts that are charged that rate.
The Commonwealth continues to receive revenues, as it will in perpetuity, from the Master Settlement Agreement
(MSA) between the states and the tobacco industry to recover health care costs for tobacco-related illnesses. In
FY24, the Commonwealth received $186 million in tobacco settlement funds, a decrease of $71 million compared to
FY23. Statute requires that a portion of tobacco settlement proceeds be transferred to the State Retiree Benefits
Trust Fund (SRBTF) to fund the Commonwealth’s liability for retiree health care, with the percentage of proceeds
7

transferred increasing by 10% each year until 100% of such proceeds is deposited in the SRBTF in FY24 and after.
For FY24, the statutorily required transfer was 100% of tobacco settlement revenues; however, the FY24 General
Appropriation Act changed the transfer percentage to 10% in FY24, resulting in a the transfer of $19 million.
Fiscal Year 2024 Budgeted Expenditures and Other Financing Uses

FY24 budgeted expenditures and other financing uses, including transfers to non-budgeted funds (but before
transfers between the budgeted funds) totaled $62.069 billion, an increase of $1.793 billion, or 3.0%, from FY23,
with the increase primarily attributable to growth in local aid, pensions, higher education, transfers to hospitals that
treat large numbers of Medicaid-eligible patients, and spending of revenue generated by the 4% personal income tax
surtax.
Spending on programs and services totaled $53.405 billion, an increase of $1.454 billion, or 2.8%, from FY23.
Medicaid expenditures totaled $20.070 billion, a decrease of $1.630 billion, or 7.5%, from FY23, as the pandemic-
era suspension of eligibility redeterminations expired and Medicaid beneficiaries were removed from the program
because they no longer met eligibility requirements. Spending on other Executive Office of Human Services
programs totaled $9.414 billion, an increase of $184 million, or 2.0% from FY23, including spending for
emergency assistance family shelters and services program, which increased by $369 million. Spending for direct
local aid (both education aid and unrestricted aid), at $7.949 billion, was up $654 million, or 9.0%, from FY23,
higher education spending totaled $1.764 billion, an increase of $154 million, or 9.6%, from FY23. Spending on
state employee health insurance benefits paid through the Group Insurance Commission (including benefits for
retiree health insurance) increased by $291 million, or 11.9%, from $2.445 billion to $2.736 billion. However, these
expenditures were offset by $164 million in drug rebates that normally would have been used to reduce spending but
in FY24 was recorded as revenue. Adjusted for this revenue, Group Health Insurance spending increased by $127
million, or 5.2%, in line with previous spending increases due to medical inflation.
As noted above, approximately $2.460 billion was generated in FY24 by the “Fair Share” 4% personal income
surtax. In FY24, approximately $903 million of those revenues was expended on various budgeted fund
transportation and education programs, the largest of which were:
8

• $181 million for MBTA capital investments
• $100 million for roads and bridges supplemental aid
• $68 million for regional transit funding and grants
• $50 million for highway and bridge preservation projects
• $100 million for Massachusetts School Building Authority capital projects
• $82 million for education financial aid expansion
• $69 million for school meals programs
• $50 million for public school clean energy infrastructure projects
• $49 million for higher education capital funding
• $45 million for scholarships at state universities and community colleges
• $25 million for early education and care programs targeted to lower income families
Transfers to the state and teachers’ pension funds totaled $4.104 billion in accordance with the Commonwealth’s
actuarially-determined pension funding schedule, an increase of $360 million, or 9.6%, from FY23, and an
additional pension contribution of $30 million from capital gains tax taxes, as required by a statute that mandates
such transfers from a portion of capital gains tax collections above an annual threshold. As a result, FY24
contributions to the pension fund totaled $4.133 billion an increase of $348 million, or 9.2% from FY23, a smaller
increase than in FY23 because capital gains tax transfers and supplemental pension appropriations were lower in
FY24 than in FY23. (In FY23, there was also a $200 million additional appropriation for a transfer to the state and
teachers’ pension funds that was not repeated in FY24.). Budgeted fund debt service totaled $2.425 billion, up $5
million, or 0.2%, from FY23.
In FY21, the Commonwealth received $5.286 billion in federal American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) funds, of which
$4.892 billion was transferred to the newly established Federal COVID-19 Response Fund (a budgeted fund, subject
to appropriation) and carried forward for allocation in FY22 and then again in FY23 and FY24. In FY24, the
Commonwealth spent $2.386 billion from the Fund, leaving it with a zero balance.
Interfund transfers from budgeted to non-budgeted funds totaled $1.520 billion, an increase of $281 million or
22.6%, from FY23. with the largest increase being a transfer of $505 million from the General Fund to the Medical
Assistance Trust Fund (MATF) for payments to hospitals that treat large populations of lower income patients, an
increase of $420 million from FY23. Transfers to and payments from the MATF vary significantly from year-to-
year depending on the timing of federal reimbursements. The MATF increase was partially offset by net reductions
in other transfers.
In conducting the budget process, the Commonwealth excludes from its forecast those “interfund” transactions
within the budgeted funds that are included in this report; these transactions by their nature have no impact on the
combined fund balance of the budgeted funds. The Budgeted Funds - Operations table on the following page
isolates this “interfund” activity from the budgeted sources and subtracts this revenue and spending to align forecasts
prepared during the budget process and in bond disclosure documents to actual amounts in this report. In FY24,
transfers among the budgeted funds totaled $4.727 billion, a decrease of $828 million, or 14.9%, from FY23. This
net decrease was the result of several large changes in transfers between the budgeted funds compared to FY23,
including an FY23 non-recurring transfer of $2.879 billion from the Transitional Escrow Fund to the General Fund
to fund the FY23 Chapter 62F refunds mentioned earlier, a $721 million decline in transfers from the General Fund
9

to the Stabilization Fund, as FY24 above-threshold capital gains tax revenue was retained in the General Fund
instead of being transferred to the Stabilization Fund, and non-recurring FY23 transfers of $490 million to seed the
High-Quality Early Education & Care Affordability Fund and $193 million for the Behavioral Health Trust Fund.
These declines in transfers was partially offset by increased transfers from the General Fund due to revenue
generated by the 4% surtax, the largest of which were a $2.199 billion transfer in surtax revenue from the General
Fund to the Education and Transportation Fund, an increase of $1.957 billion from FY23, and transfers totaling
$1.349 billion of that surtax revenue out of the Education and Transportation Fund to the Education and
Transportation Reserve Fund, the Education and Transportation Innovation and Capital Fund, and the Early
Education and Care Operational Grant Fund as required by statute to fund various education and transportation
programs. It should be noted that the 4% surtax estimate was revised upward in December 2024 to $2.460 billion,
but per statute the FY24 transfer to the Education and Transportation Fund was based on the July 2024 estimate of
$2.199 billion, with the difference between the July and December estimates being transferred to the Education and
Transportation Fund in FY25.
A detailed list of these FY24 interfund transfers is included in Note 3 of the financial statements and Schedule C of
the Supplemental Information section of this report.
The table on the following page summaries the beginning balances, revenues and expenditures, and ending balances

The graph of Budgeted Funds - Fund Balance above shows the combined fund balance in the budgeted funds for the
past five years.
As of June 30, 2024, the ending budgeted fund balance was comprised of the $1.952 billion fund balance in the
General Fund, $1.477 billion in the Transitional Escrow Fund, and $8.524 billion in the Stabilization Fund. The
remaining $2.709 billion was undesignated in various budgeted education, health care, and environmental and other
funds that are not included in the consolidated net surplus calculation, with the largest undesignated balances being
$1.342 billion in education and transportation funds holding revenues generated by a 4% surtax on incomes over $1
million and $926 million in the Student Opportunity Act Investment Fund. $3.172 billion of the total budgeted fund
balance, exclusive of the Stabilization Fund, is reserved for appropriations and debt service in FY25.
Lottery and Gaming
The Commonwealth generates revenue from the State Lottery, as well as taxes on revenue at two casinos, a slot
machine parlor, and sports betting. Gross Lottery revenues (including revenues from the Arts Lottery) were
virtually unchanged from FY23, growing from $6.264 billion in FY23 to $6.274 billion in FY24, an increase of $10
million, or 0.2%. Lottery profits, after deducting administrative expenses, debt service, and fringe benefit costs
borne by and reimbursed by the Lottery to the General Fund, but prior to distributions to reimburse the
Massachusetts Cultural Council and compulsive gambling appropriations as mandated in the FY24 budget, totaled
$1.151 billion, a decrease of $37 million, or 3.1%, from FY23. Of that $1.151 billion in profits, and as mandated in
the FY24 General Appropriation Act, approximately $1.124 billion was transferred to the General Fund to fund so-
called Unrestricted General Government Aid (formerly Lottery Local Aid), $26 million funded the Massachusetts
Cultural Council appropriation, and $1 million reimbursed a compulsive gambling program appropriation.
12

FY24 gaming-related revenue for both the budgeted and non-budgeted funds totaled approximately $512 million, an
increase of $76 million, or 17.4%, from FY23, with most of the growth resulting from the full year implementation
of taxes on sports betting, which generated $136 million, up $70 million, or 108.1%, from FY23. Approximately
$345 million of gaming-related revenue was deposited in the budgeted funds (including $26 million transferred to
the Commonwealth Stabilization Fund), an increase of $53 million, or 18.3%, from FY23. Budgeted fund revenue
from the Plainridge slot machine parlor, equal to 40% of gross profits (or “gross gaming revenues”) from slot
machines, totaled approximately $65 million, an increase of approximately $4 million, or 6.9% from FY23, tax
revenue from the Everett and Springfield casinos, equal to 25% of gross gaming revenues, totaled $187 million,
virtually identical to FY23 revenues, and budgeted fund sports betting related revenue totaled $94 million, an
increase of $51 million., or 117.9%, from FY23. The remaining $166 million of the $512 million in total gaming-
related revenue was deposited in non-budgeted funds.
Statute requires that all tax revenues from the Plainridge slots parlor and a portion of the tax revenues from the
Springfield and Everett casinos and sports wagering be allocated to fund unrestricted local aid. The FY24 General
Appropriation Act allocated $139 million in gaming-related revenues to local aid, and taxes on gaming and sports
betting revenues deposited in the Gaming Local Aid Fund exceeded that amount by approximately $12 million, with
the excess being included in the FY24 consolidated net surplus calculation.
The Stabilization Fund
The Stabilization (or rainy day) Fund provides a reserve to be used in the event of an economic downturn or other
fiscal emergency. The balance of the Stabilization Fund increased by $488 million, to $8.524 billion, between the
close of FY23 and FY24, with the main source of growth being interest earnings on the Fund’s balance, with
additional transfers of capital gains tax revenues to the Fund, gaming tax revenues, abandoned property revenues,
and a small amount of income tax withholding from the transfer of Lottery prizes.
As mentioned earlier, Massachusetts state finance law includes a requirement to transfer personal income tax
revenue attributable to capital gains above an annual threshold to the Stabilization Fund, State Pension Liability
Fund, and State Retiree Benefits Trust Fund (which funds retiree health and other insurance benefits). The FY24
capital gains tax threshold, as determined by the Department of Revenue, was $1.479 billion. In August 2023, the
Department of Revenue (DOR) certified that FY24 tax collections attributable to capital gains totaled $2.070 billion.
Per legislation enacted as part of the FY24 supplemental budgets, of the above-threshold amount of $591 million,
85%, or $501 million, was retained in the General Fund, and 5%, or $29.5 million, was transferred to each of the
Stabilization Fund, the Commonwealth Pension Fund, and the State Retiree Benefits Trust Fund. (In December
2024, per state finance law, based on more complete tax return information, DOR certified FY24 capital gains tax
revenue of $2.280 billion, but per statute, capital gains tax transfers are not adjusted for any differences between the
August and final certifications.) During the fiscal year, the Stabilization Fund also recorded net investment income
of $425 million on the Fund’s large balance, which is invested in short-term interest-bearing securities. The Fund
also had transferred to it $26 million from casino gaming tax revenue, $7 million of abandoned property revenue,
and $214 thousand of withholding tax revenue from the transfer of Lottery prizes. The Commonwealth made no
withdrawals from the Stabilization in FY24. (Details of transfers to and investment earnings of the Stabilization
Fund are shown in the table on page 178).
The following three charts show the end of fiscal year Stabilization Fund balances since the inception of the fund in
FY87, the amounts of capital gains taxes deposited to the Stabilization Fund, and the Stabilization Fund balance as a
percentage of General Funds own-source expenditures over the past five fiscal years, compared to the projected
median of all states.

The chart on the next page shows the amount of capital gains tax revenue transferred to the Stabilization Fund since
the law implementing this requirement was enacted, effective in FY13. Over the twelve years that the requirement
has been in effect, more than $5.840 billion in deposits to the Stabilization Fund have been made from capital gains
tax revenue, accounting for approximately 69% of the $8.524 billion of the Fund’s balance. Including the
approximately $624 million of cumulative interest earned on those capital gains deposits through FY24, capital
gains transfers accounted for about 76% of the Fund’s balance as of June 30, 2024.

Rainy day fund balances are typically measured both in terms of the absolute size of those funds and the funds’
balances as a percentage of General Fund “own source” expenditures (with own source expenditures excluding the
portion of expenditures — mostly Medicaid — funded by federal government reimbursements), with the latter
calculation taking into account the relative size of each state government’s budget. According to The National
Association of State Budget Officers’ (NASBO) Fall 2024 Fiscal Survey of the States, at the close of FY23 (the
most recent year for which final rainy day fund balances were available for all states), the Commonwealth
Stabilization Fund’s balance of $8.036 billion was the 3rd largest in the nation in absolute terms, and Massachusetts
also had the 3rd largest Stabilization Fund balance at the end of FY24. As a percentage of total General Fund own
source expenditures, the Commonwealth’s FY23 Stabilization Fund balance of 19.3% was well above the national
median of 12.7%. For FY24, the Commonwealth’s Stabilization Fund balance as a percentage of General Fund own
source expenditures was 19.6%, well above the preliminary FY24 national median of 13.5% as reported in the
NASBO Spring survey.
With the $488 million added to the Stabilization Fund balance in FY24, the Fund’s balance has once again risen to
its highest level since its creation in FY87.
Full-Time Equivalent Employment
The chart on the following page shows the Commonwealth’s full-time equivalent employment, including the
Massachusetts Department of Transportation (MassDOT) for all state funding sources (budgeted, non-budgeted,
capital, federal, and trust) over the past five fiscal years. As of June 30, 2024, the number of Commonwealth
employees (both budgeted and non-budgeted funded) increased by a net of 3,332 full-time equivalent employees
(FTEs) from June 30, 2023, to a total of 90,758. The largest increases were in the executive agencies controlled by
the Governor, where FTEs increased by 2,260, to 45,910, particularly in Executive Office of Health and Human
Services, where employment increased by 1,180 FTEs, the Executive Office of Transportation and Construction,
where FTEs increased by 267, and the Executive Office of Environmental Affairs, where FTEs increased by 238.
Other increases occurred in non Executive agencies, including the Judiciary, where FTEs increased by 245, and the
University of Massachusetts, which saw an increase of 316 FTEs.

The Non-Budgeted Funds
The Non-Budgeted Funds represent operations in which the government has imposed its sovereign authority but has
excluded these operations from the annual budget process. During FY24, the Commonwealth maintained 156 active
non-budgeted funds (many of which are healthcare related), while another 44 were inactive.
The largest non-budgeted funds in terms of operating revenues include the State Lottery and Gaming Fund, the
Federal Grants Fund, the MBTA State and Local Contribution Trust Fund (which accounts for sales tax revenue
dedicated to and transferred to the MBTA), the School Modernization Trust Fund (which accounts for sales tax
revenue dedicated to and transferred to Massachusetts School Building Authority), the Commonwealth Care Trust
Fund, the Medical Assistance Trust Fund, the Health Safety Net Trust Fund, the MassHealth Delivery System
Reform Trust Fund, the Convention and Exhibition Center Fund, the Massachusetts Transportation Trust Fund, and
the Special Contribution Unemployment Compensation Trust, which was established in FY22 to fund debt service
incurred to repay federal loans received during the COVID-19 pandemic. Other funds that show large inflows
include the Grant Anticipation Notes Trust Fund, which is funded by federal highway spending reimbursements.
The table below, Non-Budgeted Special Revenue Funds - Operations, summarizes the FY24 non-budgeted funds. A
Statement of Revenues, Expenditures and Changes in Fund Balance is presented in a table within this report for each

balances include:
• $1.346 billion – Massachusetts Transportation Trust Fund;
• $552 million – Convention and Exhibition Center Fund;
• $511 million – Commonwealth Care Trust Fund;

In FY24, eleven non-budgeted special revenue funds had operating deficits of $10 million or more, which were
mainly the result of spending of previously received revenues. These were the the Federal Grants Fund with a
deficit of $99 million which was the result of spending down previously received federal pandemic aid and to
spending that occurs in advance of being reimbursed by the federal government, the MassHealth Delivery System
Reform Trust, with a deficit of $39 million, the Substance Use Disorder Federal Reinvestment Trust, with a deficit
of $65 million, the Health Information Technology Trust, with a deficit of $13 million, the Housing Preservation and
Stabilization Trust, with a deficit of $41 million, the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) Auction Trust,
with a deficit of $72 million, the Hospital Investment and Performance Trust, with a deficit of $169 million, and the
Electric Vehicle Adoption Inventive Trust, with a deficit of $34 million, the Grant Anticipation Note Trust, with a
deficit of $40 million, the COVID-19 Essential Employee Premium Pay, with a deficit of $15 million, the
Communication Access Trust, with a deficit of $20 million.
As noted in previous years, the Government Land Bank Fund has a continuing structural fund deficit. The FY24
deficit balance of approximately $35 million remains an unbudgeted drain on the Commonwealth’s cash pool.
More consolidation and elimination is needed for the non-budgeted special revenue funds generally.
The Capital Projects Funds
The purpose of the capital project funds is to account for the construction or acquisition of capital assets. The
Governor may propose capital outlay budgets which, upon enactment by the Legislature and approval by the
Governor, become capital outlay acts. Capital outlay acts financed through the sale of debt require a two-thirds vote
of the Legislature. Numerous acts may be combined for reporting in an individual capital projects fund, but each act
is accounted for separately within the fund. These accounts record authorizations for expenditures in itemized
capital appropriation accounts and equivalent authorizations to issue bonds or notes.
The structure of these funds is such that each capital outlay authorization is in balance, creating authorization for
inflows (which may be from sales of bonds, federal reimbursements or other revenues) and expenditures.
Imbalances due to timing differences develop when the expenditure precedes the inflow of funds from the sale of
bonds or federal reimbursements. Due to restrictions imposed by federal tax arbitrage rules, tax exempt bonds are
not routinely sold in anticipation of expenditures.
The Administration oversees a coordinated fiscal strategy for the management of the capital projects funds. This
strategy includes a five-year capital budget linked to debt management and capital management. The focus of this
strategy is to manage capital spending within outstanding debt levels and debt service obligations the Administration
considers appropriate for the Commonwealth. An important part of the strategy is to control capital spending within
an administrative “cap.”
To fund the FY24 capital budget and expenditures from FY23 that had not been bonded as of the June 30, 2023, the
Commonwealth borrowed by issuing general obligation debt with a principal value of $4.057 billion and proceeds of
$4.402 billion (since the bonds were issued at a premium) and $500 million of special obligation bonds with
proceeds of $525 million. The Commonwealth also issued $2.011 billion in debt with proceeds of $2.308 billion to
refund already existing obligations, taking advantage of the relatively low interest rates that persisted into the first
half of FY24. In addition, the Commonwealth received $779 million in federal reimbursements (most of it for
19

transportation projects), including $715 million classified in the financial statements as a transfer in since it is
initially deposited in a non-capital projects fund.
In FY24, the Commonwealth spent $3.941 billion on capital projects (plus $42 million in fringe benefit costs), with
approximately $2.143 billion, or 54%, of that amount spent on transportation-related projects. Additional significant
spending included $508 million on non-transportation state infrastructure, $316 million on housing, $320 million on
environmental projects, $281 million on education, and $191 million on information technology.
During FY24, significant capital spending projects included:
• $544 million for state-owned facilities including public higher education campuses, trial courts, and state
health care facilities;
• $506 million for safety and capacity improvements and reconstruction for the Commonwealth’s highways,
bridges, and tunnels;
• $325 million for affordable housing development and public housing;
• $228 million in Chapter 90 reimbursements and additional new MassDOT grant programs to municipalities
for local road, bridge, and sidewalk projects;
• $142 million in spending for the Department of Conservation and Recreation, including improvements to
roadways, parks, and for environmental spending;
• $81 million for the MassWorks economic development initiative, which provides infrastructure grants to
municipalities;
• $74 million of investments in major information technology system upgrades for the Departments of Labor
and Workforce Development, Health and Human Services, Education, and Public Safety and Security, and
for the trial court system and MassHealth;
• $55 million to directly address climate change, including funds for repairing and rebuilding coastal
infrastructure and inland dams, helping state agencies and municipalities plan for and protect against the
impact of a changing climate, and wetlands protection;
• $47 million in support for freight rail enhancement projects, including investment in improving reliability
of tracks, road crossings, vehicles, facilities, and bridges;
• $42 million for the maintenance, modernization, and replacement of regional transit vehicles and facilities;
• $41 million in spending for the Executive Office of Public Safety and Security, including vehicles and
equipment for the State Police, Department of Correction, Department of Fire Services, Parole Board, State
Crime Lab, and Chief Medical Examiner, and municipal grants for body-worn cameras and bullet-proof
vests;
• $36 million for durable equipment and vehicles employed in highway repair, maintenance, and
improvements;
• $35 million for the Life Sciences Capital program, providing grants to promote job growth, business
expansion, discovery, and innovation in the industry and the Commonwealth economy;
• $33 million to improve the quality of clean and drinking water;
• $29 million to support innovation and research & development partnerships that bring together the
Commonwealth’s research institutions and companies to promote cluster development and job creation;
• $25 million for planning and construction grants from the Board of Library Commissioners to public
library systems;
20

• $24 million for the Food Security Infrastructure program, which provides grants to enhance food security
for the people of the Commonwealth and to increase access and production of local food;
• $23 million for aeronautics and aviation assets, including investments in airport buildings, runways, and
taxiways to improve safety and capacity;
• $22 million in environmental municipal grants for parklands, ecological diversity, and water protection;
• $22 million to fund planning, design, right-of-way, utility, and construction costs for the replacement of the
Sagamore and Bourne Bridges to Cape Cod;
• $21 million in grants to assess, remediate, and redevelop “brownfield” contaminated properties, often in
Gateway Cities and other challenging markets;
• $18 million for capital investments in the advanced manufacturing sector and for state matching funds for
federal competitive grants to develop advanced manufacturing technologies;
• $17 million to support the economic redevelopment of underutilized or vacant properties into active
commercial, housing, or green civic space;
• $15 million in assistance to the Massachusetts Educational Financing Authority for student loan support;
• $15 million to make improvements to bicycle and pedestrian transportation routes, addressing safety,
accessibility, connectivity, maintenance, and options for students traveling to schools;
• $14 million for the Workforce Skills capital grants to educational institutions;
• $13 million for cybersecurity and vulnerability remediation for the Commonwealth’s IT systems, including
those of public higher education institutions;
• $12 million in grants to public and non-profit entities to stimulate economic development and create jobs in
the maritime sector, and to protect coastal assets;
• $11 million in grants for planning, acquisition, rehabilitation, and construction of cultural facilities
administered through the Massachusetts Cultural Council and MassDevelopment; and
• $10 million for capital improvements to the Commonwealth’s six military installations, supporting their
economic impact on local communities.
The following graph Capital Projects Funds - Fund Balance/(Deficit) shows the combined fund balance in the capital
projects funds for the past five years. Typically, the combined fiscal year ending balance in the capital projects
funds is negative, as capital spending occurs prior to bonds being issued by the Commonwealth. At the end of
FY24, the capital projects funds had a $1.595 billion deficit balance (including $986 million in accounts payable), as
the Commonwealth had not yet reimbursed itself for capital spending that it typically funds in arrears through
subsequent bond issues.

Governmental fund types account for the general governmental activities of the Commonwealth.
Budgeted Funds - are the primary operating funds of the Commonwealth. They account for all budgeted
governmental transactions, i.e., those subject to the annual appropriation process. Budgeted funds include the
General, the Commonwealth Transportation, the Stabilization Funds, the Federal COVID-19 Response Fund, and
the Transitional Escrow Fund which are identified by the Comptroller as the operating funds of the Commonwealth.
In addition, there are 22 other budgeted funds, the Intragovernmental Services Fund, the Inland Fisheries and Game
Fund, the Marine Recreational Fisheries Development Fund, the Underground Storage Tank Petroleum Product
Cleanup Fund, the Public Safety Training Fund, the Local Capital Projects Fund, the Gaming Local Aid Fund, the
Education Fund, the Local Aid Stabilization Fund, the Gaming Economic Development Fund, the Marijuana
Regulation Fund, the Behavioral Health Outreach Access and Support Trust Fund, the Student Opportunity Act
Investment Fund, the Broadband Innovation Fund, the High-Quality Early Education and Care Affordability Fund,
the Youth Development and Achievement Fund, the Behavioral Health Trust Fund, Castle Island, Marine Park Trust
Fund, the Education and Transportation Fund, the Education and Transportation Reserve Fund, the Education and
Transportation Innovation and Capital Fund, and the Early Education and Care Operational Grant Fund.
Non-Budgeted Special Revenue Funds - are established by law to account for revenue sources that have been
segregated from the budgeted funds to support specific governmental activities such as federal grants, the operations
of the state lottery and funds related to the Massachusetts Gaming Commission.
Capital Projects Funds - account for financial resources used to acquire or construct major capital assets and to
finance local capital projects. These resources are derived almost entirely from proceeds of bonds and other
obligations, which are generally received after related expenditures have been incurred, operating transfers
authorized by the Legislature, and from federal reimbursements. Deficit balances in the capital projects funds
represent amounts to be financed, primarily through future bond sales.
Commonwealth of Massachusetts 40 Statutory Basis Financial Report

Notes to Combined Financial Statements - Statutory Basis Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2024
2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
A. STATUTORY BASIS OF ACCOUNTING
The SBFR is prepared from the Commonwealth’s books and records and other official reports that are maintained on
the basis of accounting used in the preparation of the Commonwealth’s legally adopted annual budget (statutory
basis). The statutory basis emphasizes accountability and budgetary control of appropriations. The SBFR is not
intended to present the Commonwealth’s financial condition and results of operations in conformity with GAAP.
Under the statutory basis of accounting, revenues generally are recognized when cash deposits are received by the
Treasury. However, revenues receivable for federal grants and reimbursements generally are recognized when
related expenditures are incurred, provided that the related revenues are received by the Commonwealth by August
31, the end of the statutory accounts receivable period. Amounts due from political subdivisions of the
Commonwealth are recognized when considered measurable and available. These are largely payments from
municipalities reimbursing for pension costs paid by the Commonwealth on their behalf, authorized under Section
3(8)c of Chapter 32 of the MGL, provided that the revenues are received by August 31.
Under the statutory basis of accounting, expenditures are generally recorded when the related cash disbursement
occurs. At year-end, payroll is accrued and payables are recognized, to the extent of approved encumbrances, for
goods or services received by June 30, and payment made by August 31. Costs incurred under the federally-
sponsored Medicaid program, amounts required to settle claims and judgments against the Commonwealth, and
certain other liabilities are not recognized until they are encumbered or otherwise processed for payment. In some
cases the liabilities will have been incurred prior to June 30, but recorded when paid in the following fiscal year, not
as statutory payables.
The accounting policies followed in preparing the accompanying statutory basis financial report are described in the
remainder of this section.
B. CASH, SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS AND INVESTMENTS
The Commonwealth follows the practice of pooling cash and cash equivalents, except for balances in the
Commonwealth Stabilization Fund, which are sequestered. Cash equivalents consist of short-term investments with
an original maturity of three months or less and are stated at cost. Interest earned on pooled cash is allocated to the
General Fund and, when so directed by law, to certain other governmental funds.
The Office of the Treasurer and Receiver-General (Treasury) manages the Commonwealth’s short-term external
mixed investment pool, the Massachusetts Municipal Depository Trust (MMDT). MMDT is comprised of two
portfolios, a Cash Portfolio and a Short Term Bond Fund. The Cash Portfolio is a money-market-like investment
pool; its investments are carried at amortized cost, which approximates fair value. The Short Term Bond Fund
investments are carried at fair value.
Investors in MMDT are not allowed to overdraw their shares. For a complete copy of MMDT’s separately issued
financial statements, please contact the Office of the State Treasurer’s Cash Management Department, at (617)
367-9333. The statements can also be downloaded from the Cash Management section of the Office of the State
Treasurer’s website at www.mass.gov/treasury. MGL Chapter 29, Section 38 enumerates the Commonwealth’s
investment policy for non-pension assets.
C. DEDICATED REVENUE AND PLEDGES
The Commonwealth has a number of bond programs in which bonds are secured by a pledge of dedicated revenues
provided to bondholders, pursuant to trust agreements, as well as pledges of revenue for general operations. Like
the Commonwealth, certain state authorities have also issued special obligation bonds secured by specific
Commonwealth revenues. These other authorities’ debts are not included in the SBFR, but are included in the
ACFR.
Commonwealth of Massachusetts 41 Statutory Basis Financial Report

Notes to Combined Financial Statements - Statutory Basis Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2024
All federal highway reimbursements are dedicated to funding the principal portion only of federal grant anticipation
notes (GANs) issued in fiscal years 2015, 2017, 2018 and 2020 with no new bonds issued in FY24. As of June 30,
2024, total principal remaining to be paid was approximately $256 million. Remaining maturities are from FY26
through FY27. Debt service paid during FY24 was approximately $158 million.
The Commonwealth issued approximately $500 million in new money special obligation bonds under the Rail
Enhancement Program (REP) in FY24. These bonds mature from FY25 to FY53 and are secured by a lien on the full
24 cents per gallon gasoline tax, the full 24 cents per gallon of special fuels taxes (comprised primarily of taxes on
diesel fuel), and the full 19.1% of the average price per gallon tax on liquefied natural gas and all Registry of Motor
Vehicle fees deposited into the Commonwealth Transportation Fund (CTF). As of June 30, 2024, approximately
$1.480 billion and $2.393 billion in principal was outstanding on the ABP and REP bonds, respectively, and
approximately $784 million and $2.395 billion of interest (net of the federal subsidy) was expected to be paid
through maturity related to the ABP and REP bonds, respectively.
The ABP projected interest costs are net of federal subsidies under the Build America Bond (BABs) program.
BABs is a temporary program under which the Commonwealth and other state and local governments issued taxable
bonds in calendar 2009 and 2010 in return for a subsidy from the federal government equal to 35% to 45%
(depending on whether the proceeds are used for projects in economically distressed areas) of the interest costs on
the bonds.
A portion of the Commonwealth’s receipts from the sales tax (other than the tax on meals) is dedicated through non-
budgeted special revenue funds to the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) and the Massachusetts
School Building Authority (MSBA). The amount dedicated to the MBTA is the amount raised by a 1.0% sales tax
(not including meals), subject to an inflation-adjusted floor. A comparable amount, though without the floor, is
dedicated to the MSBA beginning in fiscal 2010, with lesser amounts having been dedicated to the MSBA from
fiscal 2005 through fiscal 2009.
Legislation approved by the Governor on October 31, 2014 increased the amount statutorily required to be credited
to the MBTA by $160 million annually, starting in fiscal 2015. The $160 million increase in the dedicated sales tax
revenue amount and the amount included in the inflation-adjusted floor were intended to replace the $160 million
annual state appropriation the MBTA received from fiscal 2010 through fiscal 2014. In FY24, total dedicated sales
tax revenue that was directed to the MBTA was approximately $1.404 billion. Dedicated revenues to the MBTA
increase by the lesser of the annual increase in the Boston consumer price index or prior calendar year annual sales
taxes, with a floor of 0% and a ceiling of 3.0%.
The MSBA also receives a pledge starting in FY11 of a 1.0% sales tax (not including meals) but with no annual
floor or ceiling. In FY24, approximately $1.244 billion of the dedicated sales tax revenue stream was directed to the
MSBA.
The Commonwealth has also pledged sales tax revenue and rooms tax surcharges from areas contiguous to
convention centers and the Worcester DCU Arena and Convention Center to support such centers’ operations. As of
June 30, 2024, taxes within the Convention Center districts support approximately $397 million of outstanding
principal and approximately $130 million of interest on debts related to these Convention Centers. Taxes collected
in FY24 were approximately $225 million, while debt service on the bonds was approximately $52 million.
The Transportation Modernization Act of 2009, as amended, eliminated the pledges of sales tax revenue to
MassDOT through the Commonwealth Transportation Fund (CTF). Beginning in FY14, motor vehicle sales tax
collections were shifted from the General Fund to the CTF while also eliminating the 0.385% pledge of regular and
meals sales tax. During FY24, approximately $590 million in motor vehicle sales tax revenue was transferred to
MassDOT. From the CTF, $187 million was dedicated to funding the operations of the MBTA while an additional
$94 million was dedicated to funding the operations of the regional transit authorities. These amounts are
transferred through the CTF.
Commonwealth of Massachusetts 42 Statutory Basis Financial Report

Notes to Combined Financial Statements - Statutory Basis Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2024
D. INTERFUND/INTRAFUND TRANSACTIONS
Transactions of a buyer/seller nature between departments within a fund are not eliminated.
Transfers in and out net to approximately $25 million due to higher education non-appropriated fund activity, which
is not included in the combined statements - statutory basis.
E. CURRENT EMPLOYEE BENEFITS
Employees are granted vacation and sick leave in varying amounts based on collective bargaining agreements and
state laws. Upon retirement, termination or death, certain employees are compensated for unused vacation and sick
leave (subject to certain limitations) at their current rate of pay (not accrued on a statutory basis).
F. FRINGE BENEFIT COST RECOVERY
The Commonwealth pays the fringe benefit costs of its employees and retirees through the General Fund. These
fringe benefits include the costs of employees’ health insurance, pensions, unemployment compensation, and other
costs necessary to support the state work force. As directed by Chapter 29, Sections 5D and 6B(f) of the MGL,
these costs are assessed to other funds based on their payroll costs, net of credits for direct payments.
Since these fringe benefit costs and pensions are not appropriated in the budget, the required assessment creates a
variance between budget and actual expenditures at year-end. The fringe benefit cost recoveries of approximately
$620 million in the General Fund results from cost assessments from the other budgeted funds, non-budgeted special
revenue funds, capital projects funds, non-appropriated activities of higher education, expendable trust, and
custodial funds.
G. LOTTERY REVENUE AND PRIZES
Ticket revenues are recognized when sold and prizes awarded by the Massachusetts State Lottery Commission are
recognized as drawings are held. Games expenditures are accrued at year-end only for open jackpots for Mega
Millions, Powerball and Megabucks.
H. RECEIVABLES
Reimbursements due to the Commonwealth for its expenditures on federally funded reimbursement and grant
programs are reported as “Due from federal government”. Other receivables include reimbursement of fringe
benefit assessments from authorities and the institutions of higher education along with other departmental
receivables.
I. DUE FROM CITIES AND TOWNS
“Due from Cities and Towns” represents reimbursements due to the Commonwealth for its expenditures on certain
programs for the benefit of cities and towns.
J. RISK MANAGEMENT
The Commonwealth is self-insured for state employees’ workers’ compensation, casualty, theft, tort claims and
other losses. Such liabilities are not recognized in the governmental funds on the statutory basis until encumbered
and/or processed for payment. For employees’ workers’ compensation, the Commonwealth assumes the full risk of
claims filed under a program managed by the Human Resources Division.
For personal injury or property damages, Chapter 258 of the MGL limits the risk assumed by the Commonwealth to
$100,000 per occurrence, in most circumstances.
Commonwealth of Massachusetts 43 Statutory Basis Financial Report

Notes to Combined Financial Statements - Statutory Basis Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2024
The Group Insurance Commission administers contributory health care and other insurance programs for the
Commonwealth’s employees and retirees.
K. ENCUMBRANCES
Encumbrance accounting is utilized in the Governmental Funds as a significant aspect of budgetary control. The full
amounts of purchase orders, contracts and other commitments of appropriated resources are encumbered and
recorded as deductions from appropriations prior to actual expenditure, ensuring that such commitments do not
exceed appropriations. Encumbrances outstanding at year-end for goods or services received on or before June 30,
but paid after, are reported as expenditures and statutory basis liabilities as a component of accounts payable.
L. FUND BALANCES
Fund balance has been reserved as follows:
“Reserved for continuing appropriations” - are unexpended amounts in appropriations, which the Legislature has
specifically authorized to be carried into the next fiscal year.
“Reserved for Commonwealth Stabilization” - are amounts set aside in the Commonwealth Stabilization Fund in
accordance with Section 5C of Chapter 29 of the MGL.
“Reserved for debt service” - are amounts held by fiscal agents or the Commonwealth to fund future debt service
obligations.
The remainder of fund balance is unreserved and undesignated and consists of cumulative surplus or deficits of the
fund not otherwise designated.
M. TOTAL COLUMN - MEMORANDUM ONLY
Total and subtotal columns on the combined financial statements - statutory basis are captioned “Memorandum
Only” to indicate that they are presented only to facilitate financial analysis. Data in these columns do not present
consolidated financial position, results of operations, or changes in financial position. Interfund eliminations have
not been made in the aggregation of these data.
The financial statements include certain prior year summarized comparative information in total but not by fund.
Such information does not include sufficient detail to constitute a full comparative presentation. Accordingly, such
information should be read in conjunction with the Commonwealth’s financial statements in this SBFR for the year
ended June 30, 2023, from which the summarized information was derived.
N. ESTIMATES
The preparation of the SBFR requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures at the date of the financial report. Estimates also affect the reported
amounts of revenues and expenditures during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
3. BUDGETARY CONTROL
State finance law requires that a balanced budget be approved by the Governor and the Legislature. The Governor
presents an annual budget to the Legislature, which includes estimates of revenues and other financing sources and
recommended expenditures and other financing uses. The Legislature, which has full authority to amend the budget,
adopts an expenditure budget by appropriating monies at the individual appropriation account level in an annual
appropriations act.
Commonwealth of Massachusetts 44 Statutory Basis Financial Report

Notes to Combined Financial Statements - Statutory Basis Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2024
Before signing the appropriations act, the Governor may veto or reduce any specific item, subject to legislative
override. Further changes to the budget established in the annual appropriations act may be made via supplemental
appropriation acts or other legislative acts. These must also be signed by the Governor and are subject to the line
item veto.
In addition, MGL authorizes the Secretary of Administration and Finance, with the approval of the Governor, upon
determination that available revenues will be insufficient to meet authorized expenditures, to withhold allotments of
appropriated funds, which effectively reduce the affected accounts’ expenditure budgets.
The majority of the Commonwealth’s appropriations are non-continuing accounts which lapse at the end of each
fiscal year. Others are continuing accounts for which the Legislature has authorized that an unspent balance from
the prior year be carried forward and made available for spending in the current fiscal year. In addition, the
Legislature may direct that certain revenues be retained and made available for spending within an appropriation.
Fringe benefits, pension costs, and certain other costs that are mandated by state finance law are not itemized in the
appropriation process and are not separately budgeted.
Because revenue budgets are not updated subsequent to the original appropriation act, the comparison of the initial
revenue budget to the subsequent, and often modified, expenditure budget can be misleading. Also, these financial
statements portray fund accounting with gross inflows and outflows, thus creating a difference from separately
published budget documents, which eliminate some interfund activity. In conducting the budget process, the
Commonwealth excludes those interfund transactions that by their nature have no impact on the combined fund
balance of the budgeted funds.
Generally, expenditures may not exceed the level of spending authorized for an appropriation account. However,
the Commonwealth is required to pay certain Medicaid expenses regardless of appropriations, due to superseding
federal law.
The FY04 General Appropriation Act (Chapter 26, Section 167 of the Acts of 2003) amended Section 9C of Chapter
29, directing the Governor to notify the Legislature in writing as to the reasons for and the effect of any reductions in
spending. This proposal must be delivered to the Legislature 15 days before any reductions take effect.
Alternatively, funds from the Stabilization Fund may be used to cure the deficiency, subject to appropriation.

The Office of the Comptroller has the responsibility to ensure that budgetary control is maintained on an individual
appropriation account basis. Budgetary control is exercised through the state accounting system, the Massachusetts
Management Accounting and Reporting System (MMARS). Encumbrances and expenditures are not allowed to
exceed the appropriation account’s spending authorization.
4. MASSACHUSETTS DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION (MassDOT)
MassDOT is a legally separate entity from the Commonwealth. MassDOT operations are reported separately in the
non-budgeted special revenue funds section of this report, which includes all of the Commonwealth’s highway and
turnpike-related operations as well as the activity of the Registry of Motor Vehicles. MassDOT capital spending and
revenue activity are reported in the capital funds section of this report, in the General Capital Projects Fund, Central
Artery Statewide Road and Bridge Infrastructure Fund, the Highway Capital Projects Fund, and the Federal
Highway Construction Program Fund.
MassDOT financial activity is included in this report in order to reflect all activity reported on the Commonwealth’s
MMARS accounting system. For the SBFR, MassDOT is treated as an agency or department of the
Commonwealth, as specified in Massachusetts General Laws. However, for GAAP reporting purposes, as reflected
in the Commonwealth’s ACFR, MassDOT is reported as a discretely presented component unit of the
Commonwealth.
5. INDIVIDUAL FUND DEFICITS
The following non-budgeted special revenue and capital projects funds are included in the combined totals and have
individual fund deficits at June 30, 2024, as follows (amounts in thousands) (excludes MassDOT):

Total Capital Projects Funds................................................................ (1,681,318)
Total............................................................................................................ $ (1,913,850)
None of the funds detailed above were in deficit due to finance-related contractual provisions and all were allowed
to be in deficit by MGL.
6. MEDICAID COSTS
Approximately 37.6% of the Commonwealth’s budgeted funds spending for programs and services is devoted to
Medicaid. It is the largest and has been one of the fastest growing items in the Commonwealth’s budget. For the
fiscal year ended June 30, 2024, the budgeted funds include approximately $20.070 billion in expenditures for
Medicaid claims. The combined financial statements - statutory basis includes Medicaid claims processed but
unpaid at June 30, 2024 of approximately $75 million as accounts payable.

Commonwealth of Massachusetts 51 Statutory Basis Financial Report

Individual Budgeted Funds
Budgeted funds are those funds subject to appropriation in either the annual General Appropriation Act (GAA) or
other appropriations bills. Unless otherwise specified, budgeted funds are also subject to Section 5C of Chapter 29
of the Massachusetts General Laws (MGL) which defines the “consolidated net surplus” calculation (and determines
whether the annual budget is in balance) as well as year-end transfers to eliminate deficits in budgeted funds and
transfers of surplus balances to the Commonwealth Stabilization Fund. The following contains a list of budgeted
funds grouped by categories.
BUDGETED FUNDS
The General Fund - The General Fund is the Commonwealth’s primary Governmental Fund. All governmental
activities not specifically directed to another fund are accounted for in the General Fund. As a result, most budgeted
expenditures of the Executive secretariats, the Legislature, constitutional offices, Judiciary, institutions of higher
education and independent commissions are paid from the General Fund. It similarly receives a significant portion
of sales, individual income and corporate taxes and the full amount of most other governmental taxes.
Commonwealth Transportation Fund - to account for revenues from motor fuels taxes and all fees and fines
received by the Registry of Motor Vehicles relating to the use and operation of motor vehicles and trailers.
Spending is for debt service on general and special obligation debt, as well as for amounts, subject to appropriation,
to fund the programs and services of the Massachusetts Department of Transportation.
The Commonwealth Stabilization Fund - to account for amounts calculated in accordance with state finance law
and to maintain a reserve to enhance the Commonwealth’s fiscal stability. Tax revenues from certain lottery
winners selling their stream of future winnings in exchange for current payments are recorded in this fund. In
addition, transfers are required for fiscal year capital gains tax revenues exceeding $1 billion (adjusted annually for
economic growth), judgments and settlements of more than $10 million that exceed the previous 5 years average of
judgments and settlements, and a portion of the gaming tax revenues. Any excess undesignated fund balance as
calculated by Section 5C of Chapter 29 of the MGL, are also transferred to this fund.
ADMINISTRATIVE CONTROL FUND
This fund accounts for the revenues generated by certain administrative functions of government, for which the
Legislature has required a separate fund be established.
Intragovernmental Service Fund - to account for the charges of any state agency for services provided to another
state agency.
Transitional Escrow Fund - to account for an amount equal to the fiscal year 2022 consolidated net surplus per
section 259 of Ch. 268 of the Acts of 2022. This Fund shall not be subject to section 5C of Chapter 29 of the
General Laws. The fund shall expire on September 15, 2027, and transfer the remaining unexpended balance to the
Stabilization Fund established in section 2H of chapter 29 of the General Laws.
BUDGETED ENVIRONMENTAL FUNDS
Inland Fisheries and Game Fund - to account for revenues from license and permit fees for inland fishing, hunting,
trapping, and sporting licenses and revenue producing stamps or the sales of land, rights and properties, gifts,
interest, and federal grant reimbursements; used for developing, maintaining and operating the Division of Fisheries
and Wildlife. The fund is not subject to the requirements of Section 5C of Chapter 29 of the MGL.
Commonwealth of Massachusetts 52 Statutory Basis Financial Report

Marine Recreational Fisheries Development Fund - to account for salt water permit fees collected, funds, grants
and gifts received as authorized, including investment income; used for development and administration of
recreational saltwater fishing improvement programs. The fund is not subject to the requirements of Section 5C of
Chapter 29 of the MGL.
Underground Storage Tank Petroleum Product Cleanup Fund - to account for fees, appropriations, grants, gifts
or other contributions, and investment income. Annually, the fund is to receive the first $30 million in underground
petroleum storage fees. Expenditures are to provide reimbursements for cleanup and other expenses as a result of
damage caused by underground storage tanks and systems.
OTHER BUDGETED FUNDS
These funds account for a variety of miscellaneous taxes, fees, fines and other revenues, which are restricted to the
financing of specific Commonwealth programs.
Public Safety Training Fund - to account for certain surcharge revenues imposed by MGL. Expenditures are for
the instruction and recruitment of public safety personnel. The fund is not subject to the requirements of Section 5C
of Chapter 29 of the MGL.
Local Capital Projects Fund - to account for funds generated by the casino license fees and by the tax imposed on
revenues generated by casinos (but not the slots parlor).
Gaming Local Aid Fund - to account for gaming tax revenues imposed on casino revenues. The fund is used to
finance local aid distributions to cities and towns.
Education Fund - to account for a portion of the funds generated by the tax imposed on casino revenue (but not
slots parlor) revenue. 35% of the funds received shall be appropriated for higher education purposes. Any
expenditures for either higher education or K-12 education from this fund are required to supplement, not offset,
General Appropriation Act spending.
Local Aid Stabilization Fund - to account for funds generated by the tax imposed on casino revenues. Monies are
used to supplement local aid distributions to cities and towns. The fund is not subject to the requirements of Section
5C of Chapter 29 of the MGL.

governmental funds of the Commonwealth. It differs from the schedule of tax collections prepared by the
Comptroller, Commissioner of Revenue and State Auditor for calculations in accordance with Chapter 62F of the
General Laws, as amended. The differences are due to 2/5ths of Beano revenue and the health care coverage penalty
in the Commonwealth Care Fund, both of which are recognized on the statutory basis of accounting but are not
accounted for on the schedule of tax collections prepared by the Department of Revenue.
