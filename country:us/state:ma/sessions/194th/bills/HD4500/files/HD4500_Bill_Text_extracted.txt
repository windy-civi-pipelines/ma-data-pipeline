1.0 Background

Section 35:
1.1 Legislative Direction
An Act Driving Clean Energy and Offshore Wind (the Act) states that the
Massachusetts Department of Transportation (MassDOT), in consultation with
the Massachusetts Department of Energy Resources (DOER) and the
Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education (DESE),
shall develop a report analyzing aspects of a transition to zero-emission
school buses (ZESBs).1
The Act asks for analysis of:
(i) The number of fossil fuel-powered school buses in use in the
Commonwealth, delineated by school district.
(ii) The number of zero-emission school buses in use in the
Commonwealth, delineated by school district.
(iii) The annual cost of operating fossil fuel-powered school buses
including, but not limited to, the cost of purchasing or contracting to
use fossil fuel-powered buses and purchasing fossil fuels.
(iv) The annual cost of operating zero-emission school buses including,
but not limited to, the cost of purchasing or contracting to use zero-
emission buses and the cost of purchasing or contracting to use
charging stations and related charging infrastructure.
(v) The projected cost differential between the sale or contracted use of
fossil fuel-powered and zero-emission school buses.
(vi) The estimated cost to replace fossil fuel-powered school buses with
zero-emission school buses.
(vii) The estimated environmental benefits of replacing fossil fuel-
powered school buses with zero-emission school buses including, but
not limited to, carbon reductions and related health benefits.
(viii) the number of school districts that own their school bus fleets and
the number of school districts that rent, lease or contract for school
bus services.

MassDOT relied on vehicle registration data from the Registry of Motor Vehicles
(RMV) on the school bus fleet in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts as of
April 5, 2023, and all analysis in this report is representative of the fleet as of
this date. This data set defines school buses as vehicles with the RMV-
assigned “Use Type” of “school bus” or “apportioned school bus.” The
Massachusetts school bus fleet, as of April 5, 2023, is summarized in more
detail in Section 2.0.
MassDOT interviewed stakeholders in the school bus sector in Massachusetts
to inform this study. These interviews included a total of 11 school districts that
represented a range of sizes and geographic locations; 4 private school bus
contractors; 1 school bus dealership; 1 utility provider; 1 electric vehicle (EV)
charging equipment vendor; 2 statewide school administration and
transportation associations; and 6 state and federal agencies that currently
administer ZESB incentive programs. This report is informed by those
conversations.
The legislation defines a zero-emission school bus as “a school bus that
produces no engine exhaust carbon emissions.” For the purposes of this report,
ZESBs are synonymous with battery electric school buses, which are the most
widely adopted and accessible type of ZESB available in the market. ZESBs
share many similarities with diesel-powered school buses, however ZESBs
contain high-voltage electrical systems powered by a battery pack and do
not include internal combustion-related components that are found in their
conventional counterparts.

Section 43:
1.3 School Bus Vehicle Market in the United States
There are more than 480,000 school buses that transport over 25 million
children to and from school every day in the United States.2 Approximately 60
percent of low-income students in the U.S. take a school bus to school, and 45
2 “EPA Clean School Bus Program - Second Report to Congress Fiscal Year 2022,” United States Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA), February 2023, https://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyPDF.cgi?Dockey=P1016LN0.pdf.
5
percent of non-low-income students ride a school bus.3 Most of these students
travel on diesel-powered school buses, which make up over 90 percent of the
U.S. fleet.4 Other fuel types include gasoline, propane, compressed natural gas
(CNG), and a small, but growing segment of electric battery-powered school
buses.5
School buses are typically classified into four “types” based on their size and
construction. Type A and Type B school buses are smaller and typically carry
up to 30 passengers, while Type C and Type D school buses are larger and
generally carry between 50 to 90 passengers. The most common type of
school bus is Type C, making up approximately 70 percent of the U.S. school
bus market.6 For the purposes of this report, school buses are categorized into
one of these four types.
The leading Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) for conventional school
buses are Blue Bird, IC Bus, and Thomas Built Buses.7 All three of these OEMs
offer a full line of school bus types. As ZESBs have increased in popularity, more
OEMs have introduced this technology into their vehicle offerings, including the
three most prominent OEMs mentioned, and new manufacturers have entered
the market, such as Lion Electric and GreenPower.
School buses are often custom-built by OEMs to meet the needs of their
customers. Each state and school district has differing requirements for school
buses, resulting in thousands of specifications that OEMs need to meet. Given
the production process is not standardized but rather distinct based on the

school buses.8

Section 44:
1.4 Readiness of Zero-Emission School Bus Technology
Electric school buses are gaining market share in the United States. As of June
2023, just under 6,000 ZESBs have been awarded, ordered, delivered, or are
operating in 49 states, 5 territories, and 4 tribal nations. Over 1,200 of these
ZESBs are already, or imminently, transporting students to and from school.9
There are approximately 9 OEMs that manufacture 24 ZESB models, ranging
from Type A, C, and D. Type B ZESBs are not currently available on the market.10
Type A school buses have the largest selection of available models, and Type
C school buses represent the majority of orders and deliveries. Figure 1 shows
the manufacturers of the 24 available ZESB models and the number of ordered
and delivered ZESBs from each OEM as of December 2022.

WRI, June 2023, https://wri-dataportal-
prod.s3.amazonaws.com/manual/electric_school_bus_adoption_dataset_v6_2023-08Aug.zip. WRI defines each of
these ZESB statuses as follows: Awarded is when a fleet operator has been awarded funds to make a ZESB purchase;
Ordered indicates the fleet operator has submitted an award with a bus dealer to purchase a ZESB; Delivered
means the ZESB has arrived at the fleet operator’s depot; and operating means the ZESB is used regularly on school
bus routes to transport students.

Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM)
Manufacturing capacity for ZESB production in the U.S. is scaling up in response
to rising demand. For example, two ZESB OEMs, GreenPower Motor Company
and Lion Electric Company, recently built new manufacturing facilities in West
Virginia and Illinois, respectively. Additionally, Thomas Built Buses and Lightning
eMotors both expanded their existing facilities in part to meet increased ZESB
production needs.12
Lead times for ZESBs are highly variable depending on a range of
circumstances, including the school district’s needs, the OEM, and supply chain
conditions. California leads the United States in the number of delivered ZESBs,
and data from the state’s main incentive program for zero-emission vehicles
(ZEVs) indicates that the average total lead time for a ZESB is approximately
23 months.13 Based on stakeholder interviews in Massachusetts, ZESB lead
times experienced in the Commonwealth have varied from 3 months to 18
months.

Voucher Incentive Project (HVIP), which included lead times for a total of 545 ZESB deliveries in California from 2017-

The upfront capital costs of ZESBs in the United States are 3-4 times more
expensive than their diesel counterparts. The batteries that power ZESBs are
particularly expensive and are the main driver of the higher upfront cost.14 Cost
comparisons of ZESBs and their diesel counterparts can be found in Section

Section 46:
4.3.
Battery capacity differs between ZESB manufacturers and types. A sample of
the battery capacity and approximate range of some of the 24 available ZESB
models as of March 2023 are listed in Table 1 below. The battery capacities
and ranges provided in the table are provided by the OEMs and represent the
“nameplate” or claimed estimates, which are the maximum capacity the
battery can store and distance the bus can travel when it is fully charged and
operating under ideal conditions. The “usable” battery capacity, typically 80 –
90 percent of the nameplate capacity, is the amount of energy that can be
discharged from the battery while maintaining the state of health of the
battery. The actual vehicle range will vary depending on the specific demands
of each route, including distance, elevation changes, and weather conditions.

ZESB motors have approximately 20 parts compared to 2,000 in their diesel
engine counterparts. With fewer components, some ZESB operators have
reported these vehicles are generally easier to maintain, however their high
voltage systems require specialized training for maintenance technicians.16
Operating ZESBs requires the procurement and installation of appropriate
electrical and charging infrastructure at school bus garaging locations.
Upgrades or changes to the electricity system may be required both on-site
and within the utility distribution system serving the chosen depot location.
These upgrades may include the purchase and installation of electrical
infrastructure components, such as transformers, meters, switchgear, panels,
and chargers.
Each ZESB has a maximum threshold for power acceptance, and it is essential
that school bus operators purchase chargers that are compatible with their
ZESBs. There are generally three types of chargers that service ZEVs: AC Level 1
(L1), AC Level 2 (L2), and Direct Current (DC). Given the longer dwell times for
school buses, L2 chargers are generally the standard, while ZESBs with a more
rigorous duty cycle, longer route, and/or shorter dwell time might need a DC
fast charger (DCFC), which are more expensive because of their ability to
deliver high amounts of energy in a short amount of time.17
Charging stations for ZESBs can be “networked” or internet connected,
providing the station operators with real-time data and controls. Sometimes
referred to as “Smart” charging stations, networked charging stations provide
operators with a web-based dashboard application to see all charging
stations, status of stations, and control usage of the stations including
scheduling when a vehicle connected to the station will receive power.
Charging software can help optimize charging schedules, costs, demand, and
bus performance. These software packages are often available as part of the
overall annual subscription service fees that EV station network providers
charge EV charging station operators (i.e., the ZESB owners or school districts).
The software can communicate with electric utility grid operators to utilize
real-time pricing and demand data from the utility.

Section 47:
2.0 The School Bus Sector in Massachusetts

Section 48:
2.1 School Bus Fleet in Massachusetts
As previously stated, RMV vehicle registration data was utilized to describe the
Commonwealth’s school bus fleet. This data included characteristics such as
passenger capacity, fuel type, age, ownership, garaging location, and
odometer readings. The RMV data indicated that there were 9,446 school
buses registered in Massachusetts.
There are 398 public school districts in Massachusetts and approximately
400,000 students in Massachusetts are transported by school buses annually.18
The RMV school bus data available for this analysis did not indicate if all 9,446
of these school buses are used regularly to transport students in the
Commonwealth to school. This data does not allow MassDOT to identify which
school buses serve which districts nor does it outline school districts’
transportation service arrangements or agreements.
Understanding the school bus types in the fleet is important for determining
costs given the range of costs between types. The RMV data did not include
information regarding school bus types, so each school bus type is
categorized by their passenger capacity, as show in Table 2.19 Some of the
school buses in the fleet have passenger capacities that fall outside of the
typical capacity ranges for Type A, B, C, and D school buses. Consequently,
such vehicles are classified as “Other (fewer than 16 passengers)” and “Other
(30 to 59 passengers).”
18 “Massachusetts School and District Profiles,” Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education
(DESE), accessed August 21, 2023, https://profiles.doe.mass.edu/general/generalstate.aspx; “School Bus Safety Fact
Sheet,” Mass.gov, accessed August 21, 2023, https://www.mass.gov/info-details/school-bus-safety-fact-sheet.
19 Arora, Welch, and Silver “Electric School Buses Market Study.” This report utilized a classification system used by
CALSTART and School Bus Fleet Magazine, which details the passenger capacities of each school bus type.

Figure 2 summarizes the statewide breakdown of school bus types by
passenger capacity. Most school buses in Massachusetts are Types C and D,
with passenger capacities between 60 and 90. Just over 14 percent of school
buses fall outside of the standard types and are classified as “Other (fewer
than 16 passengers)” and “Other (30 to 59 passengers).”

fleet has a median age of five years. Most school buses in the fleet are either
1-5 years old or 6-10 years old, making up 43 percent and 34 percent,
respectively. New vehicles account for approximately 11 percent of the fleet.20
20 New vehicles are classified as Model Year (MY) 2023 and MY 2024.

Age (Years)
School buses in Massachusetts are fueled by five different fuel types: diesel,
gasoline, flexible fuel, propane, and electricity. 21 Approximately 76 percent of
school buses use diesel fuel, followed by gasoline, flexible fuel, propane, and
electric (Figure 4). There were 18 electric school buses registered in the
Commonwealth.
21 Flexible fuel refers to internal combustion vehicles that can operate on gasoline and any blend of gasoline and
ethanol up to 83 percent, such as E85 which is a gasoline-ethanol blend containing 51 percent to 83 percent
ethanol.

School districts in Massachusetts tailor their school transportation ownership
and operations arrangements to fit their specific needs and preferences.
School districts can either operate their entire fleet, contract out transportation
services to a private entity, or choose a combination of those two options.
Transportation service arrangements are discussed in more detail in Section

Section 49:
2.4.
Figure 5 illustrates the breakdown of school bus ownership statewide, with an
inset that indicates how many school buses are leased to private or municipal
entities. Private entities own more than 70 percent of school buses in the
Commonwealth, and of those that are leased, more than 70 percent are
leased to private entities. In the Commonwealth, approximately 72 school
districts own at least one school bus, while 31 own more than ten. These
numbers give us an understanding of the number of school districts that own
their school bus fleets, but do not mean they operate, or are served by, only
these buses; many of these same districts may partially lease school buses or
contract for school bus services.

school bus operates, this data does include the municipality where school
buses are garaged. Figure 6 illustrates the ownership status by garage
municipality.

Figure 6. School Bus Ownership by Garage Municipality
In summary, the school bus fleet in Massachusetts as of April 5, 2023 generally
consists of larger Type C and D buses, skews young with a median age of 5
years, primarily runs on diesel fuel, and is mostly owned by private entities.

Section 50:
2.2 Regulations and Laws Relevant to School Bus
Operations
Numerous regulations and laws in Massachusetts set forth guidelines for how
school transportation should operate. The following section provides a
summary of the key regulations and laws that govern school bus
transportation in the Commonwealth.
Massachusetts statutes establish the responsibility of the School Committee
to ensure transportation services are available for students to be transported
to and from home and school and other educational programs. The School
16
Committee for each district has oversight of and responsibility for the school
system and establishes criteria to determine if the district’s goals and policies
are being met.22
The procurement method for school transportation services in Massachusetts
is governed by Chapter 30B of the Uniform Procurement Act, which regulates
the procurement of supplies, services, and real property by school districts,
cities, towns, and other local jurisdictions in Massachusetts.23 Chapter 30B,
unless authorized by majority vote, also limits the initial contract term to three
years with a possibility for two one-year extensions to the initial three-year
contract, for a total potential contract duration of up to five years subject to
renegotiation and agreement between the districts and the providers.24
Massachusetts law also dictates school bus driver qualifications. Individuals
who wish to operate a school bus must obtain a Commercial Driver’s License
(CDL) with a Passenger (P) Endorsement or a School Bus (S) Endorsement.
Drivers also need a school bus driver certificate.25
Additionally, school buses registered in Massachusetts are subject to three
annual inspections conducted by the RMV during the fall, winter, and spring.
The first annual inspection occurs during the months of August and
September, the second during December and January, and the third during
April and May.26 These inspections result in a certification or rejection of a
school bus meeting state-sanctioned safety standards.

interviews, most school districts provide transportation services to students
living more than one mile from their assigned schools, while sometimes
providing services for shorter distances for elementary students.

the cost of their school transportation services through general tax receipts
and school bus service fees.28
Massachusetts’ primary state financial aid program for public elementary and
secondary schools is the Chapter 70 program.29 Chapter 70, however, cannot
be used to fund general student transportation in Massachusetts. The
exception is for regional school district transportation, which is typically
reimbursed by the state at 70 to 90 percent of the total costs.
Additional state and federal funding opportunities primarily target
transportation services with higher associated costs and for high-need
students. Specifically, the Special Education Circuit Breaker, McKinney-Vento
Homeless Assistance Act, and Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) offer
financial assistance for unique student transportation services.
The Special Education Circuit Breaker is a cost-sharing state program between
school districts and the state for expenses related to educating the students
who have the highest special education needs. Transportation services for
students who are placed in out-of-district programs and are on an
Individualized Education Program (IEP) are eligible for state reimbursements
up to 25 percent. However, the Circuit Breaker does not require state
reimbursement of transportation costs for in district special education
transportation.30
Under the federal McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act, school
transportation for students experiencing homelessness is a mandatory service
for the state to qualify for various categories of federal money. Consequently,
the state is obligated to provide full reimbursement to school districts that
transport these students.31

ESSA requires school districts to work with the Massachusetts Department of
Children and Families (DCF) to provide, arrange, and fund transportation for
students in foster care to the schools that students previously attended prior
to their placement in care. This service does not receive state aid; however,
these transportation services are eligible for federal aid via approval of a Title
IV-E state plan amendment.32

Section 52:
2.4 School Bus Contracting Arrangements
School districts in Massachusetts must arrange school transportation services
for their students, and there are various stakeholders who determine how a
school district will do so. The superintendent is responsible for the execution of
transportation policy and regulations, including establishing bus routes.33
Based on stakeholder interviews, school transportation services are often led
by a director of transportation, director of operations, director of finance, or the
school business administrator. These school district transportation leaders
collaborate with the School Committee and other stakeholders to determine
how to provide school transportation services.
School districts may choose to either own and operate their own fleets, lease
and operate their school buses, or contract out services to a private bus
company. Some school districts choose a mix of these options. For example,
some school districts contract both general education and special education
services, while other districts contract out general education transportation
and provide special education transportation internally.
DESE sent a survey to school districts in April of 2023 asking if they “provide
[their] own self-operated regular or special education transportation?” There
were 314 school districts that responded. For regular transportation services,
48 stated “yes” and 266 replied “no.” For special education transportation
services, 81 responded “yes” and 233 responded “no.” This survey indicates that
most school districts in Massachusetts contract out services to private
companies and that school districts are more likely to self-operate special

21
education services, which generally transport fewer students than general
education services.
School districts that want to contract out transportation services are required
to follow competitive bidding processes. They issue Requests for Proposals
(RFPs) or Invitations for Bids (IFBs) to potential transportation providers,
evaluating them based on predefined criteria such as cost, service quality, and
safety records. When all other criteria are met, the only remaining determinant
is the price. Subsequently, in accordance with Chapter 30B, Section 5, school
districts select the lowest responsible and responsive bidder that meets the
transportation needs of the students while offering the best value.34 Contracts
with private operators are typically bid on a per bus per day rate and are
signed for three years with the option for two one-year extensions or for five
years.

Section 53:
2.5 School Bus Fleet Operations
Conversations with both school districts and private bus companies highlight
the complex and context-specific nature of school bus operations, which
encompass tasks such as route planning, driver training, safety procedures,
regulatory compliance, and the provision of specialized services, including
transportation for students with disabilities and extracurricular activities.
Each school district designs their school bus fleet operations or directs the
private bus company’s operations to ensure their individual district’s
requirements are met. School districts generally provide school transportation
services for 180 days per year for general education transportation, special
education transportation, travel for sports and extracurricular activities, and
vocational school transportation. Some districts provide summer school
transportation, which falls outside of the standard 180 days of operation per
year.
Daily duty cycles of school buses depend on the school district’s needs and
typically encompass morning routes, mid-day layovers, afternoon routes,
athletic events, and occasional field trips or extracurricular trips. This study did
34 “General Law - Part I, Title III, Chapter 30B, Section 5,” Massachusetts Legislature, accessed September 7, 2023,
https://malegislature.gov/Laws/GeneralLaws/PartI/TitleIII/Chapter30B/Section5.
22
not have access to school bus telematics, but based on stakeholder
interviews, the average daily mileage per bus varies from 10 miles to 150 miles.
School bus routes typically remain consistent throughout the year and are
structured with the goal of minimizing the total time a student spends on the
bus. Stakeholder interviews revealed that school bus routes are often
categorized into tiers based on various factors such as distance from the
school, grade levels, and start times. Additionally, the daily transportation
service schedule may vary depending on the day of the week if the district has
inconsistent weekly start or end times.
The number of stops, along with the duration of stop layovers, differs among
school districts due to diverse factors, including geographical location, student
requirements, and start and end times. Some districts have bus routes with as
few as 5 stops and 5 to 10 minutes of layover time. Other districts, specifically
those in more rural communities, have longer routes with up to 25 stops per
route.
Deadheading is also a consideration for school bus operations due to its
impact on efficiency and cost effectiveness. This occurs when school buses
operate without passengers, usually to reach their starting points or assigned
terminals. Depending on the storage locations of the individual buses, the
deadheading varies amongst school districts. Efficient school transportation
services tend to design routes to limit deadheading.

Section 54:
2.6 School Bus Fleet Storage and Maintenance
School bus service providers in Massachusetts have varied operating
demands, but their fleet storage and maintenance practices are relatively
similar. All operators need to determine where and how to store their school
buses, whether they own or lease the storage depot, what equipment to keep
at the storage facility, and where and how to perform fleet maintenance.
Typically, school district transportation procurement contracts require that a
school bus be stored in the same municipality as the school it serves to
minimize transit times and ensure timely pick-up and drop-off of students.
However, some districts make exceptions if the storage location is still close
23
by. For school districts that own school buses, they tend to store their fleet on
school property or at facilities located within the district. Some districts and
private operators store their fleets across multiple facilities, while others utilize
one location.
School bus operators have the choice of owning or leasing the property where
they store their fleet. This decision is primarily determined by the operator’s
budget and availability of land and storage locations in the district. Interviews
suggested that most leasing agreements are 20 years long.
School bus fleets are typically stored in outdoor, central depots, with some
depots including limited indoor storage for buses.
Based on stakeholder interviews, the mobility of buses between depots is
relatively infrequent. Generally, each depot serves a specific geographic area
or school district, and the buses assigned to that depot primarily operate
within their designated region. However, in exceptional cases, such as
maintenance needs, high-volume passenger events, or emergencies, buses
may be temporarily moved between depots to meet demand.
The typical layout of school buses at a storage facility consists of designated
parking spaces for each bus. The buses are generally parked side by side in a
row format, and there are well-defined lanes for easy access and movement
of the vehicles.
At school bus fleet facilities, a range of equipment is stored and utilized. Apart
from the school buses themselves, these facilities house maintenance and
repair tools, diagnostic equipment, and spare parts to keep the buses in
optimal condition. Additionally, they may have fueling stations and bus-
washing facilities. If fueling stations are not located at the storage facility,
operators typically fuel their fleets off-site at a location close by.
Operators that perform their own maintenance often have a dedicated facility
for maintenance and employ full-time mechanics. Other operators perform
simple repairs in-house and transfer the vehicle to the dealership or the
24
service provider for major repairs or choose to contract out all maintenance
services.
Fleet replacement practices vary between public and privately owned fleets.
Generally, school district-owned buses are replaced at the end of a bus’s life
(between 10 to 15 years). However, specific replacement schedules may be
adjusted based on factors like the bus's mileage, condition, and funding
availability. For school districts that contract with private companies for school
bus services, contract terms often require school buses to be five years old or
younger, which incentivizes private fleets to replace their buses more regularly.

Section 55:
2.7 Status of Zero-Emission School Bus Implementation in the
Commonwealth
Out of the 9,446 school buses in the Commonwealth, at the time RMV data
was extracted for this analysis, 18 were ZESBs. The school bus operators
interviewed that currently utilize ZESBs stated that the financial assistance
through several government programs enabled them to purchase these
buses. Operators also expressed a key success factor for ZESB adoption was a
strong relationship with their utility provider. They also emphasized the
importance of training drivers, particularly on regenerative breaking, and
having specially trained ZESB maintenance operators close by.35 Broadly, ZESB
operators expressed their ambition to continue with a transition to this
technology, with quieter bus operation and the absence of diesel emissions
among the factors motivating this ongoing transition.
A number of school districts and private operators using ZESBs collaborate
with private companies who offer a turnkey ZESB service. These turnkey ZESB
service providers typically own the ZESB and associated equipment, thereby
reducing the up-front capital cost for their clients. These providers are usually
responsible for all maintenance tasks, assist with installing charging
infrastructure at the client’s storage facility, offer driver training, and aid their
clients in seeking financial assistance. The school district is typically

https://www.energy.gov/energysaver/how-regenerative-brakes-work.
25
responsible for hiring drivers. This arrangement typically entails a 10–15-year
contract.
Some of the school bus operators with ZESB experience have participated in
pilot Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) technology programs. V2G charging technology
allows ZESBs to interact with the power grid via a bi-directional charger that
facilitates a two-way energy flow. Using this technology, ZESBs can both draw
power from the grid to charge their batteries and send stored energy back to
the grid.36 Under a V2G program, the school bus operator is paid for the energy
the bus gives back to the grid. Feedback from participants indicated that in
theory, this approach could offer advantages to both the operator and the
power grid, but that the compensation provided to the ZESB operators was
modest, and the training and resources needed for V2G implementation are
significant.
Most of the fleet operators interviewed who have not yet adopted ZESBs
expressed their interest in buying them--however, the primary barrier to
adoption is the higher up-front cost of ZESBs and their associated charging
infrastructure compared to their diesel counterparts. Some districts interested
in buying ZESBs either applied for funding assistance but didn't receive it, don't
have the time or expertise to apply for grants or a plan for how to integrate
ZESBs into their fleets, or didn't know funding assistance was available.
Transitioning to ZESBs requires the establishment of charging infrastructure
and in many cases, upgrading electric systems to accommodate higher
energy demands. Interviews indicated these to be significant logistical and
financial challenges.
As mentioned earlier, there are approximately 24 ZESB models available on the
market. However, due to the specific needs of each school district, some
stakeholders expressed that there are not enough model options and lead
times are too long to meet their needs. School bus operators also expressed
uncertainty regarding available models meeting their daily mileage needs.
36 Darlene Steward, “Critical Elements of Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) Economics,” National Renewable Energy Laboratory
(NREL), September 2017, https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy17osti/69017.pdf.
26
This is particularly a concern for operators with daily bus mileage
requirements of 150 miles or more.
Many private operators in Massachusetts rely on resale values to fund their
next school bus purchase and ensure their fleet is young enough to meet
school district bid requirements. Given the ZESB market is new, there is little
information regarding market resale values, which poses a concern for private
operators. Similarly, the lifespan of a ZESB is unfamiliar, making fleet
replacement planning for school districts and private operators challenging.

Section 56:
3.0 Overview of Massachusetts Investor-Owned Utilities
ZESB adoption, specifically the deployment of charging infrastructure, requires
coordination with private and municipal utilities in Massachusetts.
There are currently four investor-owned electric distribution companies that
provide electricity services for a majority of towns and cities in Massachusetts:
 NSTAR Electric Company d/b/a Eversource Energy
 Massachusetts Electric Company d/b/a National Grid
 Nantucket Electric Company d/b/a National Grid
 Fitchburg Gas and Electric Light Company d/b/a Unitil
Massachusetts is also served by 41 municipal electric companies delivering
power to approximately 50 municipalities across the Commonwealth.37 This
structure creates a patchwork of different providers, each of which maintains
the electric distribution infrastructure (i.e., wires, poles, transformers, etc.) for
their specific service territory.
The economic analysis in Section 4.0 includes consideration of Demand
Charge Alternative programs for electric vehicle charging, which are only
relevant to investor-owned utilities. The focus of this section is on these

details/competitive-supply-glossary.
27
investor-owned utilities, and their EV charging programs are discussed in
more detail below.
Investor-owned electric utilities charge distribution fees to electric consumers.
The prices (“rates”) that these utilities charge their customers are highly
regulated and set by the Department of Public Utilities (DPU). These utilities
must supply electricity largely on demand and typically have limited ways to
store it. Consequently, electricity must be distributed immediately to end users,
prompting providers to structure pricing in a way that encourages consistent
and predictable customer demand.
The investor-owned utilities in Massachusetts assess “demand charges” on
commercial customers who demand high power levels over short periods of
time. These utilities have structured their rates so that once a commercial
customer exceeds a peak demand or load threshold, demand charges are
triggered, which are based on the monthly maximum or peak energy kilowatt
(kW) demand.38
The kW demand of energy use is the key difference between L2 and DC EV
charging from a customer pricing standpoint. For example, if a ZESB with a 180
kW battery returns to base with 15 percent charge left, that ZESB would need
153 kW to return to a state of full charge. The school bus operator could charge
that bus for 12 hours overnight at an average of 13 kW per hour using a 19.2 kW
L2 charger, or a school bus operator could charge that bus in a single hour
during the day using a 150 kW DCFC. Both scenarios could be subject to
demand charges--however, it is more likely that the daytime DCFC charging
scenario would experience higher demand charges due to its higher
maximum energy threshold of 150 kW compared to 19.2 kW.
National Grid, Eversource, and Unitil developed Demand Charge Alternative
Programs for EV charging, which were approved by DPU.39 These programs are
designed to reduce EV charging station operating costs by providing a tiered,

28
load factor-based discount on commercial customer demand charges.40 A
load factor (LF) is the ratio of the actual kilowatt hours (kWh) delivered during
a billing period to the peak load (or peak demand in kW) during the billing
period, if the demand was constant over the billing period. These programs
are currently available for 10 years starting in 2023. All new and existing utility
customers are eligible to enroll in their service area provider’s program,
provided their EV charging stations are separately metered and the customer
is on a qualifying, EV-specific rate schedule.
The Demand Charge Alternative Programs coupled with networked chargers
and demand management software can help school bus operators mitigate
electric utility demand charges.

Zero-emission School Buses

Section 58:
4.1 Fleet Replacement Scenarios
FLEET REPLACEMENT SCENARIO DEFINITIONS
To enable comparisons of ZESB costs and environmental benefits with their
conventional counterparts, three school bus fleet replacement scenarios
were defined, as outlined in Table 4 below, reflecting futures in which ZESB
fleet share follows three different adoption pathways. The fleet replacement
scenarios cover the period from 2023-2036. This fourteen-year analysis
period aligns with the approximate life expectancy of a school bus and
concludes in 2036, the year following the cessation of Advanced Clean
Trucks rule (ACT rule) sales percentage escalations, described below.
In all three fleet replacement scenarios, the total number of school buses
operating in Massachusetts remains constant at 9,446 vehicles over the
analysis horizon, to simplify the analysis. Similarly, the proportion of vehicles

scenario is included only to allow the calculation of the total cost
of ZESB adoption and associated emissions impacts.
Under this scenario, school bus manufacturers comply with the
ACT rule adopted by Massachusetts in 2021 and taking effect in
Model Year (MY) 2025 sales.41 The rule requires an increasing
fraction of all medium and heavy duty vehicle sales, in weight
classes 2B through 8, in Massachusetts beginning with MY 2025 be
zero-emission vehicles. These fractions vary by vehicle weight
ZEV
class.
Compliance
While the ACT rule applies to all MHDV sales and does not
specifically apply to school buses, this scenario assumes that ZESB
manufacturers comply with the ACT rule sales fraction schedule
by vehicle weight class set out in the regulation.
This scenario models an immediate shift to 100 percent ZESB
purchases. Beginning in 2024, all new school buses entering the
ZESB Swap
fleet are ZESBs.

FLEET REPLACEMENT SCENARIO ZESB FLEET SHARE
Figure 7 below illustrates the estimated ZESB fleet share for each analysis
year (2023-2036) of each fleet replacement scenario, as defined in Table 4.
These fleet share estimates take into account the age distribution of the
Massachusetts school bus fleet and a custom scrappage curve that defines
the probability of vehicles retiring from the fleet changes with age.
While used ZESBs may circulate in the fleet and individual fleets may buy and
sell individual vehicles over time, this analysis examines the statewide school
bus population.
32
Figure 7. Estimated ZESB Fleet Share by Fleet Replacement Scenario, 2023-
2036
Current ZESB Swap
Fuel Mix
ZESB fleet share is lowest for the Current Fuel Mix scenario; by design, the fleet
never gains more than 18 ZESBs (0.2 percent of the fleet).
The ZEV Compliance scenario results in a ZESB fleet share of 71 percent by

Section 59:
2036. The conversion rate for this scenario slows slightly in 2035, and then
begins to flatten as the Class 4-8 sales fraction ceases to increase in that
year.
The ZESB Swap scenario would achieve a nearly full ZESB fleet by 2036. The
fleet share reaches 92 percent electric in 2033 and 99.4 percent electric at
the end of the analysis timeframe in 2036. Though outside the stated
analysis horizon, the analysis predicts full electrification under the ZESB Swap
scenario by 2038.

Section 60:
4.2 Key Assumptions and Inputs Considerations
Estimating the economic and environmental impacts of the three fleet
replacement scenarios required assumptions about the fleet activity,
including average daily miles driven, charging requirements, and a range of
unit costs.
33

Section 61:
4.2.1 Fleet Activity and Mileage Assumptions
The average annual vehicle miles travelled (VMT) for each regulatory class
and age was estimated using the annual RMV mileage data from 2018-2022,
available for only 8,007 school buses. The results from the school buses with
mileage data were then scaled to reflect the full fleet of 9,446 school buses.
For the annual VMT calculation, the number of school bus operating days in
Massachusetts was estimated to be 156. The Massachusetts school year is
180 days and on average, each school bus is assumed to be used as a spare
vehicle approximately 13 percent of the time, or 24 days per year.43
The distribution of annual miles driven for school buses in Massachusetts is
presented in Figure 8, while Figure 9 shows the distribution of daily miles
driven.

As Figure 9 shows, only 3 percent of daily miles driven exceed 100 miles. The
daily mileage results were used to determine the charging strategy for each
school bus in the fleet, as described in Section 4.2.2 below.
All ZESBs of regulatory Class 4 and above were assumed to use diesel-
powered heaters during winter months only (between November and
March). Class 2-3 school buses are assumed to use batteries for heat, given
these smaller vehicles would require far less energy to heat.
The number of winter school bus operating days from November to March
was estimated to determine the days that diesel heaters would operate.
There are typically 109 weekdays from November to March and 17 weekday
holidays, which leads to a total of 92 winter school days, of which each
vehicle would actually operate 80 days (due to the 13 percent spare vehicle
assumption). Multiplying the average daily VMT by 80 yielded the winter
mileage, which was then distributed in the same manner as with average
annual VMT, by regulatory class and age. This winter operating day estimate
was used to calculate the emissions from diesel heaters, as described in

Section 62:
Section 4.4.

Section 63:
4.2.2 Charging Requirement Assumptions
CHARGING FEASIBILITY STRATEGIES
A charging feasibility analysis was performed using a model that incorporated
the battery capacity, number of days of operations, weather conditions,
average daily mileage, and average speed to determine fleet charging
strategies and energy requirements.
One of the following two charging strategies was assigned to each school bus
based on estimated energy consumption rates and various operational
conditions:

Section 64:
1. ZESBs charge solely on L2 (19.2kW) EV chargers overnight. L2 chargers
offer fleet owners the lowest cost EV hardware options, smallest space
requirements per bus, lowest cost for installation, and lowest ongoing
costs for operations and maintenance (O&M).

Section 65:
2. ZESBs complete daily operations with DCFC EV stations capable of
charging buses at 150kW per hour during a mid-point of daily operations
to ensure sufficient battery charge. DCFC EV charging stations need
additional space per bus and are significantly more expensive
compared to L2 EV chargers.
CHARGING FEASIBILITY ASSUMPTIONS
The charging assumptions detailed in Table 7 below were used to determine
the charging feasibility of the 9,446 school buses based on the two charging
strategies.

use)
Average School Bus Speed 25 mph44
Minimum State of Charge
15% (industry standard minimum SOC best practice)
(SOC)
Maximum State of Charge 85% (industry standard providing buffer against battery
(SOC) degradation)
Each bus is assumed to begin the day with a minimum 85 percent state of
charge (SOC) and its daily mileage is considered feasible if it ends the day
above a 15 percent battery SOC. This range considers that operating at a SOC
above 85 percent leads to battery degradation and that operating below 15
percent risks the vehicle running out of charge before it can return to the
garage.
When the average daily miles driven for a bus end with a SOC greater than 15
percent, that bus is considered feasible for electrification under an L2 (19.2kW)
overnight EV charging scenario to meet all daily service cycle energy needs.
For each bus that fell under 15 percent state of charge after the L2 overnight
only charging scenario, a midday DCFC (150kW) EV charging session option
was tested in the model to see if the bus could service the remaining route
miles. The school buses that could meet its energy needs with a DCFC session
during the daily service cycle were considered feasible for electrification.
CHARGING FEASIBILITY RESULTS
The results of this high-level charging analysis are illustrated in Figure 10. An
estimated 73 percent of the Massachusetts school bus fleet would be feasible

for overnight L2 (19.2kW) EV charging alone, while the remaining 27 percent
can complete their service routes with one mid-day DCFC EV charging session.
Less than one tenth of a percent of the fleet could not complete their daily
mileage under either charging strategy, with these school buses most likely
used for longer field trips or special routes.

These charging results were utilized to determine the use of L2 charging or DC
fast charging strategies in the fleet replacement scenario cost estimates in

Section 67:
Section 4.3.2.
For the fleet replacement scenario cost estimates and environmental impact
analysis below, it was assumed that all fossil fuel-powered school buses could
be replaced on a 1:1 basis with ZESBs of the same vehicle class. While less than
one percent of the school bus fleet was unsuitable for electrification, the state-
wide nature of this analysis and the fact that none of the replacement
scenarios reach 100 percent ZESB adoption by 2036 justified the use of a 1:1
replacement ratio.

Section 68:
4.2.3 ZESB and Diesel School Bus Cost Assumptions
School bus fleets, whether powered by fossil fuel for or zero-emission sources,
are subject to the following four categories of lifecycle costs: 1) capital
acquisition costs; 2) operations costs; 3) maintenance costs; and 4) end-of-
life costs. Each of the four main cost categories are detailed below in 2022
dollars with information on three schools bus types (A, C, & D) for ZESBs and
38
diesel-powered school buses.45 These cost assumptions are representative
and actual costs associated with ZESB adoption will vary based on a range of
factors, such as the vehicle makes and models chosen, vehicle specifications,
school district needs, site upgrades, and utility provider.
In the subsections that follow, red-colored numbers are used to illustrate ZESB
costs that exceed conventional diesel buses, while green-colored numbers are
used to illustrate ZESB costs that offer comparable savings.
The capital acquisition costs in Table 8 and Table 9 were utilized to estimate
the fleet replacement scenario costs in Section 4.3.2.
The “total” values for Type C school buses in Table 8 – Table 14 represent the
cost assumptions utilized in the total cost of ownership (TCO) analysis in

Section 69:

Investments and upgrades are often needed on the utility’s side of the
electrical meter, such as a separate meter, larger transformer, new electrical

ANNUAL SCHOOL BUS OPERATIONS COST ASSUMPTIONS
ZESBs potentially offer several operational cost savings advantages to diesel
vehicles based on reduced costs for energy, greater energy efficiencies, and
reduced need for additional fluids such as diesel exhaust fluid. Table 10 below
details the annual operations costs per school bus associated with L2 charging
or DC fast charging.

Table 10 above does not factor in demand charges. Table 11 illustrates
potential demand charge costs. To streamline the cost analysis, only demand
charges from investor-owned utilities with Demand Charge Alternative
Programs (National Grid, Eversource, and Unitil) were considered. These
programs consist of rate components such as a kW demand charge and a
kWh base distribution rate.
Demand charges are based on the peak rate of electricity consumption in kWs
at a facility each month over a specific time interval. The demand charges in
the existing programs range from $3.04 - $19.82/kW. The kW rates in Table 11
represent a weighted average based on how many school buses are garaged
in each utility service region. They are categorized by “low utilization” and “high
utilization,” where low utilization represents the weighted average $/kW in the
greater than 5 percent and less than or equal to 10 percent load factor
52 The annual operations costs in Table 10 would apply to all ZESBs, regardless of whether they utilize an L2 charger
or DCFC.
53 The annual average school bus mileage (7,069) from the RMV mileage data was utilized for these cost estimates.

category, and high utilization represents the weighted average $/kW in the

The kWh cost estimates were calculated using the same approach as the
demand charge kW costs.

ANNUAL SCHOOL BUS MAINTENANCE COST ASSUMPTIONS
ZESBs offer potential maintenance advantages versus their diesel
counterparts due to their simplified mechanical components, as shown in the
“Annual Maintenance Costs” row in Table 12 below.55
However, ZESBs are currently subject to several increased costs versus diesel
school buses, primarily stemming from increased costs to insure the vehicles

DC EV fast chargers are subject to increased ongoing maintenance costs
compared to L2 EV chargers. These increased costs stem primarily from the
fact that DCFC equipment, by providing significantly higher power (150kW vs.

Section 71:
19.2kW) outputs over short time periods, have hardware that is routinely
subject to higher temperatures, or thermal loads, during operations. These
high operating temperatures require cooling systems within the DCFC
equipment, and these cooling systems need routine maintenance. Table 13
details the ongoing costs related to annual DCFC equipment maintenance.

56 Insurance costs can vary significantly due to factors like deductible structure, market characteristics (character
of local juries, repair costs, perceived danger), coverage, caps on payouts, and other considerations.
43
For fleet owners that keep their vehicles for their full lifetime, additional mid-
life battery overhaul costs may be incurred. Electric vehicle batteries, like all
batteries, are subject to degradation over years of successive charging and
discharging cycles. Battery degradation means a diminished capacity for
batteries to store energy over their lifetime. Most ZESB manufacturers, like
conventional vehicle manufacturers, offer battery warranties for five to eight
years, often guaranteeing a range minimum, and offering a full battery
replacement if range decreases past warrantied thresholds.
Table 14 details the potential mid-life ZESB battery overhaul costs as well as
end-of-life battery salvage values (based on composite average battery sizes
for each bus type).
For the TCO estimate in Section 4.3.1, mid-life overhaul costs for ZESBs were
assumed at 8 years. Diesel school buses did not have associated mid-life
costs because diesel engines are typically replaced at 250,000 miles or more,
which is beyond the estimated lifetime mileage of the Commonwealth’s fleet.57

VEHICLE END-OF-LIFE AND RESALE VALUE
Compared to the extensive market data that exists for diesel school buses,
assessing the end-of-life and resale values of ZESBs is challenging due to
scarcity of data. Most ZESBs deployed have been operating for five years or
less and therefore have not yet reached the end-of-life stage.58 Consequently,

no end-of-life or resale values were used in the TCO or fleet replacement
scenario cost analysis.

Section 72:
4.3 Estimated Costs of Ownership and Fleet Replacement
Scenarios

Section 73:
4.3.1 Lifetime Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) Estimates
Table 15 illustrates a TCO assessment for Type C ZESBs and diesel school
buses. The TCO analysis encompasses all major cost components - capital,
annual operating and maintenance, mid-life overhaul, and the battery
salvage value cited in Section 4.2.3 above - expressed in net present value
(NPV), assuming a 7 percent discount rate, a fourteen-year useful life, and
7,069 annual miles driven. The analysis compares how charging methods (L2
vs. DCFC) and electricity costs (no demand charge operation costs from
Table 10 vs. Demand Charge Alternative program operation costs from Table
11) impact cost estimations.
The TCO analysis for Type C school buses illustrates the same trend found
with Type A and D school bus TCO estimates: for all school bus types,
regardless of electricity utilization or charging strategy, ZESBs are currently
more expensive to own compared to their diesel counterparts.

4.3.2 School Bus Fleet Replacement Scenario Capital Costs
The school bus fleet replacement scenario costs estimated in this section are
based on the 2022 capital cost estimates for diesel and electric school
buses, including the charging hardware, installation, and incremental land
acquisition costs, detailed in Table 8 and Table 9. Each year assumes an
inflation rate of 3 percent for the capital costs.
In each of the three fleet replacement scenarios the total number of school
buses operating in Massachusetts remains constant at 9,446 vehicles over
the analysis horizon. Similarly, the proportion of vehicles by body style
(inferred by gross vehicle weight rating and aligned with Type A, C, and D)
also remains constant.
59 Partial demand charges refer to the Demand Charge Alternative Program costs outlined in Table 11.
46
CURRENT FUEL MIX REPLACEMENT SCENARIO COSTS
The Current Fuel Mix replacement scenario costs serve as a point of
reference for comparing the additional costs of ZESB deployments in the ZEV
Compliance and ZESB Swap cost estimates. Under this scenario, the school
buses in the fleet are replaced by school buses of the same fuel type and
school bus type (A, C, and D).
In the Current Fuel Mix replacement scenario, an estimated $1.82 billion in
capital costs is projected to be spent on 15,519 new school buses through
2036 in Massachusetts. Figure 11 below details the annual count of new
school buses and associated capital costs under this scenario.

ZEV COMPLIANCE REPLACEMENT SCENARIO COSTS
The ZEV Compliance scenario represents the additional capital costs of ZESB
adoption within a framework where all school bus OEMs comply with the ACT
rule sales percentage requirements. This framework aligns with minimum
47
adherence to the ACT rule, already adopted by the Massachusetts
Department of Environmental Protection (MassDEP) beginning with MY 2025
Class 2b-8 vehicles, and models ZESB adoption through 2036 at the same
rate as the ACT sales fractions apply, as visually represented in Figure 7 in

Section 75:
Section 4.1.
As described in the charging feasibility analysis in Section 4.2, not all ZESBs in
Massachusetts could feasibly charge using solely L2 chargers. The ZEV
Compliance scenario assumes 27 percent of the fossil fuel-powered school
buses replaced with ZESBs will have both a L2 EV charger for overnight
charging and a DCFC for midday charging.
In the ZEV Compliance scenario, an estimated 5,706 new ZESBs are purchased
through 2036. This would cost an additional $2.4 billion in ZESB and charging
infrastructure capital costs compared to the Current Fuel Mix scenario. Figure
12 below details the annual count of new ZESBs and associated capital costs
under this scenario.

ZESB SWAP REPLACEMENT SCENARIO COSTS
The ZESB Swap replacement scenario illustrates the additional capital costs of
a ZESB transition where 100 percent of new school buses replaced annually are
ZESBs. Like the ZEV Compliance scenario, the ZESB Swap scenario assumes 27
percent of the fossil fuel-powered school buses replaced with ZESBs will have
both a L2 EV charger for overnight charging and a DCFC for midday charging.
In the ZESB Swap scenario, an estimated 13,846 new ZESBs are purchased

infrastructure capital costs compared to the Current Fuel Mix scenario. Figure

ZESB COST IMPACTS BY SCHOOL BUS FLEET OWNERSHIP MODEL
As discussed in Section 2.0, school buses in Massachusetts are either owned
by a school district, leased by a school district or private operator, or owned
by a private operator. Private entities own more than 70 percent of school
buses in the Commonwealth, and of the 8 percent of school buses that are
leased, more than 70 percent are leased to private entities.
School bus ownership models have different implications for how school
districts incur the costs of providing ZESB transportation services. It is important
to note that in cases when school districts enter into lease agreements or
contract their operations to private companies, they typically structure their
agreements on a per-bus, per-day cost. Each ownership model changes how
school districts experience the costs to transition their school transportation
services to zero-emission as follows:
 Municipally Owned: School district bears all ZESB capital costs upfront
and the ongoing operational and maintenance expenses, including
higher insurance costs and potentially high demand charges. The
district might also receive the full benefits of potential lower fuel and
maintenance costs compared to their diesel counterparts.
 Leased: School district defrays a significant portion of ZESB capital bus
and charging infrastructure costs and incurs higher per bus per day
costs compared to their diesel counterparts, depending on the terms of
the lease agreement. The school district might also be responsible for
ZESB maintenance and operational expenses depending on the lease
terms.
 Privately Owned: School district eliminates all upfront ZESB capital costs
but pays higher per bus per day costs compared to their diesel
counterparts as the private contractors amortize their capital expenses
into the annual fees the school districts pay for transportation services.

Section 76:
4.4 Estimated School Bus Air Quality Impacts
Emissions and health impacts from school buses of all the fuel types in the
Commonwealth’s fleet fuel mix (diesel, gasoline, propane, and electric) were
estimated for the three fleet replacement scenarios for the analysis period of
50
2023-2036. Tailpipe--as well as brakewear and tirewear--emissions were
estimated for each fuel type by multiplying annual VMT per regulatory class
and age by the appropriate emissions rate. This analysis excludes upstream
emissions from electricity generation and fossil fuel manufacturing.
For the three fleet replacement scenarios, the school bus emission effects of
the following pollutants were estimated:
 Greenhouse gases (GHGs), represented as carbon dioxide equivalents
or CO e. 60
2
 Four Clean Air Act criteria pollutants and precursors: nitrogen oxides
(NOx), volatile organic compounds (VOCs), fine particulate matter
(less than 2.5 microns, expressed as PM2.5), and coarse particulate
matter (less than 10 microns, expressed as PM10).
Emissions rates for diesel and gasoline were estimated in the Environmental
Protection Agency’s (EPA) Motor Vehicle Emissions Simulator (MOVES).61
Propane emissions rates were converted to diesel emissions rates using
Argonne National Laboratory’s Alternative Fuel Life-Cycle Environmental and
Economic Transportation (AFLEET) Tool. The emissions rates used in the
analysis were specific to regulatory class, fuel type, and vehicle age.
ZESB emission rates include those from diesel heaters, brakewear, and
tirewear and were estimated separately in MOVES. The MOVES emissions
rates for Auxiliary Power Units (APUs) were determined to be the most
appropriate for representing diesel heaters because they are based on
scientific literature studying APUs in use on actual vehicles. Alternatives
examined included using European studies and using the certification rates
from the EPA’s non-road compression ignition engine emissions standards as
described in 40 CFR 60 Subpart IIII and 40 CFR I(U)(1039). Using MOVES APU
rates is a more realistic approach because MOVES uses instrumented real-
world data rather than a regulatory standard and involves fewer
60 Since greenhouse gases include several compounds, this analysis used carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2e), a
composite unit that includes CO2 as well as other greenhouse gases. CO2e normalizes each other pollutant in terms
of the warming potential of an equivalent amount of CO2. Other GHGs included in CO2e include nitrous oxide (N2O)
and methane (CH4).
61 MOVES3.1 was the latest version at the time of this analysis.
51
assumptions to use. Following EPA and FHWA, we assume no change in
emissions rates from these diesel heaters on ZESBs over time.62
Additionally, ZESBs were assumed to emit pollutants from brakewear and
tirewear at the same rates as conventional school buses.63

Section 77:
4.4.1 Total Medium and Heavy Duty vs. School Bus Emissions
The emissions and health impact results in Sections 4.4.2 and 4.4.3 below
only represent a comparative assessment exclusively among the school bus
fleet replacement scenarios. The results do not represent net emissions or
health impacts from an incentive program.
This is because the ACT rule mandates increasing sales percentage
requirements for all Class 2b-8 vehicles sold in Massachusetts starting from
MY 2025. With the ACT rule in place, an incentive program for ZESBs may not
produce additional sales of medium and heavy duty ZEVs. Due to the high
penalty cost of ACT non-compliance and the high cost of medium and
heavy duty ZEVs, OEMs are expected to supply ZEVs up to the ACT rule sales
percentages, but not beyond. Thus, a ZESB incentive is likely to redistribute
ZEV sales within the regulated vehicle categories towards ZESBs over other
ZEVs, resulting in more ZESB sales but fewer other regulated medium and
heavy duty ZEV sales in Massachusetts.
This study only provides a comparison of emissions and health impacts from
school buses, under various levels of school bus electrification. This study
does not explicitly model the ultimate emissions outcomes across all
medium and heavy duty vehicles that would result from the effects of the
interaction between the ACT rule and a statewide school bus incentive
program.

Section 78:
4.4.2 Emissions Analysis Results
The emissions analysis results, detailed in Table 16 in metric tons (MT),
illustrate that school bus emissions would generally decline in all scenarios
for almost all pollutants, but increasingly so in the ZEV Compliance and ZESB
Swap scenarios. Ozone precursors NOx and VOCs, as well as PM10, would also
decline in each scenario, despite the use of diesel heaters on ZESBs, as
conventional internal combustion school buses operated fewer miles each
year.

Figure 14 through Figure 18 below show the trends in school bus pollutant
emissions within the analysis horizon, which all follow the same basic
trajectory. There is a small increase in school bus emissions from 2023-2028
largely because the 2022 spike in new bus purchases leads to a large cohort
of fossil fuel-powered school buses that persist in the fleet and become less
efficient as they age. This effect is most obvious for NOx, as most of the
Massachusetts school bus fleet uses diesel fuel. This age spike results in a
lower school bus replacement rate until the 2022 model year buses begin to
retire more rapidly beginning in 2028. From 2028 onwards, the decline in
school bus emissions for the ZEV Compliance and ZESB Swap scenarios
accelerates rapidly as increasing proportions of replacement school buses
entering the fleet are ZESBs. By contrast, the Current Fuel Mix scenario school
53
bus emissions decline only slightly, as the only improvement mechanism is
older buses exiting the fleet.
School bus GHG emissions decline in all scenarios, as shown in Figure 14.
Under the Current Fuel Mix scenario, GHG emissions from school buses
decline by nearly 15 percent by 2036. The model accounts for expected
improvements to vehicle fuel efficiency technology but does not anticipate
major improvements to fuel economy. The reduction in school bus GHG
emissions is therefore likely a result of the school bus fleet’s age distribution,
which rapidly becomes younger beginning in 2028. Newer vehicles are
inherently more fuel efficient due to reduced wear and tear. Additionally, the
retirement of older vehicles also leads to a decrease in the number of
vehicles equipped with older, less fuel-efficient engines, further contributing
to emissions reductions.
Significant school bus GHG emissions reductions are observed in the ZEV
Compliance and ZESB Swap scenarios. In the ZEV Compliance scenario,
school bus GHG emissions decrease by approximately 76 percent in 2036
compared to 2023. In the ZESB Swap scenario, almost all school bus GHG
emissions are eliminated, for a total reduction of 99.4 percent by 2036.
Notably, the ZESB Swap scenario exhibits less sensitivity to the spike of MY
2022 buses because every new bus following that spike would be a ZESB. In
contrast, the ZEV Compliance scenario follows the ACT rule sales fractions,
and thus takes longer to adopt ZESBs into the fleet.

2023-2036
Current Fuel ZESB Swap
Mix
54
NOx emissions from school buses also decline across all scenarios, as
illustrated in Figure 15. In the Current Fuel Mix scenario, school bus NOx
emissions decrease by approximately 5 percent over the fourteen-year
horizon. This relatively small reduction for NOx is likely due to the fleet
remaining primarily diesel-powered and replacement buses using the same
technology as retiring buses, as many NOx control technologies have been
standard for some time.64
School bus NOx emissions decline in the ZEV Compliance scenario by
approximately 75 percent and in the ZESB Swap scenario by 98.7 percent by

Section 79:
2036. This decline is primarily associated with a decline in on-road internal
combustion engine activity as more ZESBs are adopted. ZESBs with diesel
heaters would still emit some NOx, but the overall reduction in on-road
engine fuel consumption resulting from ZESB conversion outweighs this
effect.
Figure 15. School Bus NOx Emissions (MT) by Fleet Replacement Scenario,
2023-2036
Current Fuel ZESB Swap
Mix
School bus VOC emissions decline in all scenarios, as shown in Figure 16.
Following a similar pattern as the other pollutants, Current Fuel Mix school
bus VOC emissions decrease slightly (about 7 percent by 2036) as the fleet’s
age distribution shifts. ZEV Compliance school bus emissions decrease by 73
percent, and ZESB Swap emissions decrease by 98 percent by 2036.
64 Note that this analysis was conducted with MOVES3.1, which was published prior to the finalization of the EPA’s final
heavy duty NOx rule. See: “Control of Air Pollution from New Motor Vehicles: Heavy Duty Engine and Vehicle
Standards,” EPA, December 20, 2022, https://www.epa.gov/system/files/documents/2023-01/new-motor-veh-air-

Diesel engines are known to produce higher levels of particulate matter
emissions compared to other fuel types. On-road diesel-powered vehicles
such as school buses must by law be fitted with catalytic converters and
particulate filters to mitigate these pollutants. However, diesel heater exhaust
systems on ZESBs are not subject to the same regulations as on-road diesel
engines, and therefore emit considerably higher pollution per gallon of fuel
burned.
In the Current Fuel Mix scenario, PM2.5 and PM10 emissions from school buses
(Figure 17 and Figure 18) hardly change over the fourteen-year analysis
horizon, as emissions control technology for these pollutants does not
change and diesel heater proliferation does not change.
In the ZEV Compliance scenario, school bus PM2.5 and PM10 emissions both
decline by 28 percent and 42 percent, respectively by 2036. In the ZESB Swap
scenario, school bus PM2.5 and PM10 emissions reduce substantially by 50
percent and 67 percent, respectively by 2036. Emission reductions for both
pollutants result from the elimination of running, idling, and starting exhaust
emissions associated with conventional vehicle operations. These emissions
savings outweigh any potential increase in emissions from the use of diesel
heaters on ZESBs during winter months.

To underscore the point made in the Section 4.4.1, these school bus
emissions results are only representative of emissions from school buses
under various scenarios for school bus electrification. They do not represent
the impacts of a potential ZESB incentive program in the presence of the ACT
rule.

Section 80:
4.4.3 Health Impact Analysis Results
The potential health impacts from school bus emissions on human health
were estimated across the three fleet replacement scenarios using the US
EPA’s CO-Benefits Risk Assessment Health Impacts Screening and Mapping
Tool (COBRA). COBRA uses a series of health impact functions developed
57
from the latest public health literature to estimate how a change in outdoor
air quality results in incidences of a variety of health outcomes.
COBRA’s health impact estimates are relative to a COBRA baseline, which is
the estimated total mass quantity of an emitted pollutant (i.e., NOx) in a
given year for all on-road vehicles.65 COBRA provides upper- and lower-
bound estimates of changes in incidence of specific health outcomes, and
provides the median values for a selection of six health impact indicators,
which are included in Table 17.
The COBRA results presented in Table 17 illustrate the cumulative change in
health impacts resulting from the change in school bus emissions in the ZESB
Swap scenario from 2023-2036.66 The COBRA results for the other two fleet
replacement scenarios exhibit fewer changes in health outcome incidences
than the ZESB Swap scenario, and are not included in the table. It should be
noted that the COBRA results do not consider the incidence of school bus
emissions on more vulnerable school-age people.
Most of the health outcome values have a cumulative impact of less than
one over the fourteen-year analysis horizon. School buses represent a small
portion of the total on-road transportation emissions inventory for the
Commonwealth of Massachusetts, thus the health impacts due to a change
in school bus emissions is limited.
65 “COBRA Questions and Answers,” EPA, June 7, 2023, https://www.epa.gov/cobra/cobra-questions-and-answers.
The COBRA baseline utilizes data from the National Emissions Inventory (developed by the US EPA). State agencies,
including the MassDEP, regularly prepare emissions inventories and submit them to be included in this national
inventory.
66 Normally, negative COBRA results indicate an increase in incidence and positive values indicate a decrease. The
signs have been inverted this table for ease of reading.

Again, it should be noted that the school bus health impact results should
not be interpreted as indicative of the interactions from a potential ZESB
incentive program and the ACT rule given this study did not incorporate the
health impacts from all medium and heavy duty vehicles subject to the ACT
rule.

Section 81:
4.4.4 Equitable Distribution of Air Quality Benefits from
ZESBs
A transition to ZESBs will involve some fossil fuel-powered school buses being
replaced with ZESBs before others, and this has implications regarding how
and to whom the benefits will be distributed. As mentioned in Section 1.3,
approximately 60 percent of low-income students take a school bus to
school. Given the high capital costs of a transition to ZESBs, it is foreseeable
that under-resourced school districts will be among the last to be served by
this new technology.
An incentive program will influence the distribution of air quality benefits.
Incorporating equity metrics into an incentive program would provide
insights into the scale of this air quality impact and could be used to ensure
program implementation was not creating an inequitable distribution of
benefits or worsening existing inequities.
Options for defining potential beneficiaries, who are currently disadvantaged,
under an equity metric include:
59
 Communities with school districts that rank highly on DESE’s equity
scale.67
 Communities with poor air quality, contingent on the availability of
relevant data.
 Communities with high proportions of Environmental Justice (EJ)
populations.68
Detailed air quality modeling is unlikely to be practical to inform program
implementation decisions. However, potential proxies for assigning where
environmental benefits are occurring include:
 The routes served by incentivized ZESBs.
 The school districts served by incentivized ZESBs.
 The garaging locations of incentivized ZESBs.

Section 82:
5.0 Recommendations for a Statewide Incentive
Program

Section 83:
5.1 Background on Incentive Structures
Incentive programs designed to support the adoption of ZEVs can be
structured in various forms. Background information on financial incentive
program types can be found below:
 Grant programs involve interested candidates developing applications
and making financial awards to the applicants based on evaluation
against a set of criteria. Grant awards can be customized based on the
applicant’s needs and the awardee typically pays the full upfront
capital cost before getting reimbursed by the grant award. Grants
sometimes provide some personalized technical assistance to
67 DESE has an existing equity framework that stratifies school districts into 12 categories based on the percentage of
residents that are eligible for state assistance, such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program or
MassHealth. Category 12 represents the districts with the greatest share of residents eligible for state assistance.
68 See for the Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs (EEA) definition of an EJ population:

awardees because the program administrator learns about the
applicant’s specific fleet and needs in their application.
 Voucher programs apply a discount immediately at purchase to lower
the upfront costs for the purchaser. While an application to receive a
voucher may be required, vouchers can also be automatic. Vouchers
are typically at a flat rate and not customizable to the purchaser.
 Rebate programs are similar to vouchers but typically involve a post-
purchase reimbursement, thus requiring the purchaser to pay the full
upfront capital of the approved purchase. Rebates can also be
structured to be provided at the point-of-sale, which would lower the
sticker price of the purchase and not involve a reimbursement.
 Use-based incentive programs pay the user a set amount based on
their usage rate, such as a payment per every mile driven on a ZEV.
This type of incentive could reduce net operating costs and encourage
the use of ZEVs after their purchase.
Desirable attributes for a ZEV incentive program would typically include those

5.2 Existing State and Federal Regulations and Programs
Relevant to ZESBs
There are existing regulations relevant to and incentive programs available
to potential purchasers of ZESBs in Massachusetts. The presence of these
existing programs, outlined below, has important implications for decisions
about providing additional statewide incentives.
THE ADVANCED CLEAN TRUCK RULE (ACT RULE)
As previously discussed in Section 4.0, the ACT rule is a medium and heavy
duty ZEV sales requirement that applies to OEMs that certify vehicles for sale
in Massachusetts in weight classes 2B through 8. OEMs can accumulate
credits for ZEV sales and will incur deficits for each non-ZEV sold in
Massachusetts starting in MY 2025.69 OEMs are considered compliant when
the credits they purchase or generate through ZEV or near-zero-emission
69 MassDEP, “Background Document on Emergency Regulation Amendments to 310 CMR 7.40.”
62
vehicle (NZEV) sales equal their deficits within a reporting year per regulatory
class.
If a manufacturer does not meet the ACT rule sales percentage
requirements, they have one model year to make up their deficit or else be
subject to a continued penalty until compliant. The penalty is approximately
$20,000 per vehicle.70 Due to the high penalty cost and high cost of medium
and heavy duty ZEVs, it is anticipated that OEMs will collectively meet but not
exceed the sales percentage requirements.
EPA CLEAN SCHOOL BUS PROGRAM (CSB)
The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) of 2021 authorized the EPA
to administer the Clean School Bus (CSB) Program, which totals $5 billion in
funding available for the replacement of diesel school buses with zero and
low emission school buses through Federal Fiscal Years (FFYs) 2022-2026.71
The first iteration of the CSB was the 2022 CSB Rebate program, which
provided funding for both the full cost of a zero-emission or clean school bus
(up to $375,000) and the cost of an L2 charger (up to $20,000).72 The 2022
CSB Rebate program structure allowed recipients to access funding quickly,
via a streamlined application process and website.
In the first round of the 2022 CSB Rebate program, five Massachusetts entities
received funding as shown in Error! Reference source not found.. The 2022
CSB Rebate awards in Massachusetts amount to $29,535,000 for 75 ZESBs. Of
note, none of these awards included propane or CNG-powered buses, which
were an option for funding.73

MASSCEC ACT SCHOOL BUS PROGRAM
The Massachusetts Clean Energy Center (MassCEC) operates the
Accelerating Clean Transportation (ACT) School Bus program. This program
was designed to complement the EPA’s CSB program and is deploying $23.3
million in funding for school bus electrification in the Commonwealth. ACT
School Bus provides two opportunities for support: advisory services and fleet
deployment.75
The advisory services program component offers free ZESB electrification
planning services. This opportunity does not provide funding to purchase a
ZESB, but rather to help public school districts and private school bus fleet
operators prepare for future funding opportunities, perform feasibility studies
and financial modeling, and develop vehicle and charging station
procurement plans.
The first round of the 2022 fleet deployment services program component
offered selected school bus fleets up to $2 million in flexible funding for ZESBs
and associated infrastructure, as well as consulting services to assist with
procurement, data collection, and future electrification planning. Table 21

purchase and lease of qualifying ZEVs, including eligible ZESBs.
The rebate values, shown in Table 22, are designated by vehicle class and
follow a declining value as rebate blocks are exhausted. School bus
purchasers can apply to the MOR-EV Trucks program to reserve a rebate
through a voucher system prior to purchasing or leasing. This reservation
system ensures that funding is available for up to 12 months once applicants
are approved. After the purchase or lease is finalized, a rebate of up to
$90,000 can be claimed.77 Of note, this program cannot be used in
combination with any other Massachusetts provided or managed funding.

programs, covering the costs on the utility side of the electric meter. On
December 30, 2022, DPU approved EV programs for the following regulated
electric companies: National Grid with a budget of $206 million, Eversource
with a budget of $188 million, and Unitil with a budget of $998,000.81 Both

National Grid and Eversource have developed their approved programs,
while Unitil has yet to do so at the time of writing. The DPU ruling requires that
eligible entities apply for other available and eligible state and federal
funding opportunities prior to seeking utility program funding. The following
utility programs are currently available for school bus fleets:
National Grid
National Grid administers the Fleet EV Charging Program that provides up to
100 percent of utility-side L2 and DCFC costs, up to $6,700 for customer-side
costs, and provides charger rebates for public fleet charging stations.82
Additionally, their Fleet Advisory Service Program offers complementary
assistance to public fleets, including electrification planning.83 The incentive
amounts are highest for Environmental Justice (EJ) communities and eligible
applicants must be National Grid customers, including municipal, school bus,
public transit, and state and federal government fleets.
Eversource
Eversource offers the EV Charging Rebate program for Massachusetts fleets,
including school bus fleets, which provides up to 100 percent of utility-side
costs to install EV chargers, up to $6,700 for customer-side costs, and
charger rebates for L2 and DCFC charging station equipment costs.84
Incentive amounts are highest for EJ communities. Eligible applicants must
be Eversource customers. Eversource has developed a fleet advisory service
offering that is currently limited to public fleets.

Section 85:
5.3 Incentive Structure Recommendations

Section 86:
1. OBJECTIVE OF INCENTIVE
If the underlying objective is to increase overall numbers of zero emission
heavy duty vehicles or to maximize total GHG and other emissions reduction,
an incentive program for ZESBs may not have the intended effect.

application.pdf?sfvrsn=85cdcd62_4.

If the ACT rule is effective at driving ZEV sales up to the specified sales
percentages, an incentive is likely to shift the balance of ZEV sales within the
regulated vehicle classes in favor of school buses and away from other ZEVs,
resulting in more ZESB sales but fewer sales of other types of ZEVs in
Massachusetts. This is because the extra ZEV credits enabled by a ZESB
incentive can be purchased by other OEMs to satisfy their ACT rule sales
percentage obligations in lieu of producing additional ZEVS. There is a risk
that an incentive would create no additional ZEV sales.
While modeling the net emissions outcomes across all classes of vehicles
regulated by the ACT rule falls outside the scope of this report’s analysis,
adding a new incentive in the presence of the ACT rule carries the theoretical
possibility of emissions increases, if selling more ZESBs results in fewer sales
of other ZEVs, depending on the relative miles traveled and emissions control
technologies between the fossil fuel school buses replaced and the fossil fuel
vehicles whose replacement is forgone.85
Given the large opportunity cost of a program that financially supports the
adoption of ZESBs, the legislature may wish to consider using these resources
for other initiatives that would reduce emissions without these policy
interactions (i.e., sources not subject to regulated sales requirements).
However, if the priority is to ensure emission reductions and/or ZEV sales occur
specifically in school bus fleets and foregone emission reductions from other
medium and heavy duty vehicles are not a concern, an incentive program for
ZESBs could be used to achieve this. This would result in the benefits of medium
and heavy duty vehicle electrification being somewhat more targeted at the
people and areas currently impacted by emissions from fossil fuel-powered
school buses.
85 Older diesel-powered vehicles typically emit more pollutants compared to their newer counterparts. For example,
MOVES3.1 estimates that a Class 7 MY 1993 diesel vehicle emits nearly nine times more NOx per mile (0.0219 kg/mi)
than a Class 7 MY 2023 diesel vehicle (0.00237 kg/mi).
68

Section 87:
2. EQUITY
If a ZESB incentive is established, the associated program should monitor
awards and adjust as needed to ensure that disadvantaged school districts are
being awarded at or above the same rate as other school districts.
It is recommended that a ZESB incentive program adopts an equity framework
based on school district population metrics. If school buses are being prioritized
for electrification to reduce school children’s exposure to school bus air
pollutants, then using a school district population-based equity framework is in
alignment with that program’s objective.

Section 88:
3. BUDGET REQUIREMENTS
If an incentive program were to be introduced to support a transition to ZESBs, it
would need access to a significant budget over multiple years because the
additional costs to transition Massachusetts’ school bus fleet are high relative to
conventional technologies. For example, if a program was designed to fund the
incremental capital cost and every school bus was replaced on its normal
replacement cycle by a ZESB starting in 2023, this program would require
approximately $5.4 billion, leading to a 99.4 percent fleet transition by
approximately 2036.86
Moreover, the amount of expenditure in a given timeframe would most likely
increase with a more aggressive speed of fleet transition. If the fleet
transition goal was targeted for 2030, for example, the program may require
a greater annual budget compared to a scenario with a later targeted
transition date to motivate school bus owners to accelerate adoption.

Section 89:
4. PROGRAM SCALABILITY
If a new ZESB incentive is developed, the program should have a scalable
structure for adjusting incentive amounts to accommodate changes in the
school bus vehicle and charging market, such as evolving technology costs,
school bus purchase price sensitivities, and changes in federal incentives.
86 It is a common practice for incentive programs to fund incremental costs, however this does not guarantee a
particular level of sales. Notably, the 2022 EPA Clean School Bus Rebate Program provided funding amounts for the
school bus and associated charging infrastructure that covered more than the incremental cost.
69

Section 90:
5. ADMINISTRATIVE SIMPLICITY
If a ZESB incentive was introduced, consideration should be given to
delivering all state support for ZESB adopters via a single mechanism,
whether it is derived from existing or newly developed interventions. This
would streamline the application process for school bus operators, enabling
them to access both financial and technical support through a unified
administrative structure and coordinate with a single point of contact.
There is already a relatively complex landscape of programs that are
targeted at or available to ZESB purchasers in Massachusetts. Adding an
additional program would increase the compliance burden for applicants,
causing applicants interested in various programs to navigate through
multiple sets of eligibility criteria, application processes, and performance
requirements. Applicants would also need to understand and make tradeoffs
between different funding sources where they were “non-stackable” or
require separate approvals before starting a project in cases where they
were stackable.
Moreover, introducing a new ZESB incentive program within the current policy
environment would further diffuse government interventions supporting ZESB
adoption and increase the challenge of determining which programs are
effective and how to improve individual programs.

Section 91:
6. AGE-BASED INCENTIVE
If a ZESB incentive is created, to minimize unintended consequences
associated with interactions with the ACT rule, it is recommended to include
a scrappage requirement targeting the oldest and most polluting school
buses as a condition for a ZESB incentive program.

Section 92:
7. PRIVATE AND PUBLIC ELIGIBILITY
If a ZESB incentive is developed, it is recommended that the program be
accessible to both public and private entities who undertake the activity that
confers eligibility for receiving an incentive (i.e., purchasing a school bus to
provide transportation service in Massachusetts).

1.0 Background
1.1 Legislative Direction
An Act Driving Clean Energy and Offshore Wind (the Act) states that the
Massachusetts Department of Transportation (MassDOT), in consultation with
the Massachusetts Department of Energy Resources (DOER) and the
Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education (DESE),
shall develop a report analyzing aspects of a transition to zero-emission
school buses (ZESBs).1
The Act asks for analysis of:
(i) The number of fossil fuel-powered school buses in use in the
Commonwealth, delineated by school district.
(ii) The number of zero-emission school buses in use in the
Commonwealth, delineated by school district.
(iii) The annual cost of operating fossil fuel-powered school buses
including, but not limited to, the cost of purchasing or contracting to
use fossil fuel-powered buses and purchasing fossil fuels.
(iv) The annual cost of operating zero-emission school buses including,
but not limited to, the cost of purchasing or contracting to use zero-
emission buses and the cost of purchasing or contracting to use
charging stations and related charging infrastructure.
(v) The projected cost differential between the sale or contracted use of
fossil fuel-powered and zero-emission school buses.
(vi) The estimated cost to replace fossil fuel-powered school buses with
zero-emission school buses.
(vii) The estimated environmental benefits of replacing fossil fuel-
powered school buses with zero-emission school buses including, but
not limited to, carbon reductions and related health benefits.
(viii) the number of school districts that own their school bus fleets and
the number of school districts that rent, lease or contract for school
bus services.

(ix) Recommendations on how to structure a state incentive program to
replace or support the replacement of all fossil fuel-powered school
buses with zero-emission school buses.
(x) Additional information relevant to informing a statewide plan to
replace or support the conversion of all school buses from fossil fuel-
powered school buses to zero-emission school buses.
This report responds to the above requirements in the following sections:
 Section 2.0 responds to the analysis requested in i, ii, and viii.
 Section 4.0 describes economic and emissions modeling and results
relevant to the analysis requested in iii, iv, v, vi, and vii.
 Section 5.0 includes the recommendations requested in ix.
 The report includes additional information relevant to informing a
statewide plan throughout the text, as requested in x.
1.2 Report Contents and Definitions
This report includes:
1. Background on the school bus market and readiness of zero-emission
school buses in the United States.
2. An overview of the school bus sector in Massachusetts, primarily
supported by stakeholder interviews conducted for this study.
3. An overview of the investor-owned utilities in Massachusetts and their
Demand Charge Alternative programs.
4. Analysis of the capital and annual operating costs of diesel and zero-
emission school buses, a comparison of the total costs of ownership
(TCO) for both diesel and electric school buses, and the costs to
transition the fleet to electric over three fleet replacement scenarios.
5. Analysis of the environmental and health impacts of the three fleet
replacement scenarios.
6. Recommendations for how to structure a statewide incentive program
that would support the replacement of fossil fuel-powered school buses
with ZESBs.

MassDOT relied on vehicle registration data from the Registry of Motor Vehicles
(RMV) on the school bus fleet in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts as of
April 5, 2023, and all analysis in this report is representative of the fleet as of
this date. This data set defines school buses as vehicles with the RMV-
assigned “Use Type” of “school bus” or “apportioned school bus.” The
Massachusetts school bus fleet, as of April 5, 2023, is summarized in more
detail in Section 2.0.
MassDOT interviewed stakeholders in the school bus sector in Massachusetts
to inform this study. These interviews included a total of 11 school districts that
represented a range of sizes and geographic locations; 4 private school bus
contractors; 1 school bus dealership; 1 utility provider; 1 electric vehicle (EV)
charging equipment vendor; 2 statewide school administration and
transportation associations; and 6 state and federal agencies that currently
administer ZESB incentive programs. This report is informed by those
conversations.
The legislation defines a zero-emission school bus as “a school bus that
produces no engine exhaust carbon emissions.” For the purposes of this report,
ZESBs are synonymous with battery electric school buses, which are the most
widely adopted and accessible type of ZESB available in the market. ZESBs
share many similarities with diesel-powered school buses, however ZESBs
contain high-voltage electrical systems powered by a battery pack and do
not include internal combustion-related components that are found in their
conventional counterparts.
1.3 School Bus Vehicle Market in the United States
There are more than 480,000 school buses that transport over 25 million
children to and from school every day in the United States.2 Approximately 60
percent of low-income students in the U.S. take a school bus to school, and 45
2 “EPA Clean School Bus Program - Second Report to Congress Fiscal Year 2022,” United States Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA), February 2023, https://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyPDF.cgi?Dockey=P1016LN0.pdf.
5

percent of non-low-income students ride a school bus.3 Most of these students
travel on diesel-powered school buses, which make up over 90 percent of the
U.S. fleet.4 Other fuel types include gasoline, propane, compressed natural gas
(CNG), and a small, but growing segment of electric battery-powered school
buses.5
School buses are typically classified into four “types” based on their size and
construction. Type A and Type B school buses are smaller and typically carry
up to 30 passengers, while Type C and Type D school buses are larger and
generally carry between 50 to 90 passengers. The most common type of
school bus is Type C, making up approximately 70 percent of the U.S. school
bus market.6 For the purposes of this report, school buses are categorized into
one of these four types.
The leading Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) for conventional school
buses are Blue Bird, IC Bus, and Thomas Built Buses.7 All three of these OEMs
offer a full line of school bus types. As ZESBs have increased in popularity, more
OEMs have introduced this technology into their vehicle offerings, including the
three most prominent OEMs mentioned, and new manufacturers have entered
the market, such as Lion Electric and GreenPower.
School buses are often custom-built by OEMs to meet the needs of their
customers. Each state and school district has differing requirements for school
buses, resulting in thousands of specifications that OEMs need to meet. Given
the production process is not standardized but rather distinct based on the

customer’s specifications, it can be challenging for OEMs to mass produce
school buses.8
1.4 Readiness of Zero-Emission School Bus Technology
Electric school buses are gaining market share in the United States. As of June
2023, just under 6,000 ZESBs have been awarded, ordered, delivered, or are
operating in 49 states, 5 territories, and 4 tribal nations. Over 1,200 of these
ZESBs are already, or imminently, transporting students to and from school.9
There are approximately 9 OEMs that manufacture 24 ZESB models, ranging
from Type A, C, and D. Type B ZESBs are not currently available on the market.10
Type A school buses have the largest selection of available models, and Type
C school buses represent the majority of orders and deliveries. Figure 1 shows
the manufacturers of the 24 available ZESB models and the number of ordered
and delivered ZESBs from each OEM as of December 2022.

WRI, June 2023, https://wri-dataportal-
prod.s3.amazonaws.com/manual/electric_school_bus_adoption_dataset_v6_2023-08Aug.zip. WRI defines each of
these ZESB statuses as follows: Awarded is when a fleet operator has been awarded funds to make a ZESB purchase;
Ordered indicates the fleet operator has submitted an award with a bus dealer to purchase a ZESB; Delivered
means the ZESB has arrived at the fleet operator’s depot; and operating means the ZESB is used regularly on school
bus routes to transport students.

Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM)
Manufacturing capacity for ZESB production in the U.S. is scaling up in response
to rising demand. For example, two ZESB OEMs, GreenPower Motor Company
and Lion Electric Company, recently built new manufacturing facilities in West
Virginia and Illinois, respectively. Additionally, Thomas Built Buses and Lightning
eMotors both expanded their existing facilities in part to meet increased ZESB
production needs.12
Lead times for ZESBs are highly variable depending on a range of
circumstances, including the school district’s needs, the OEM, and supply chain
conditions. California leads the United States in the number of delivered ZESBs,
and data from the state’s main incentive program for zero-emission vehicles
(ZEVs) indicates that the average total lead time for a ZESB is approximately
23 months.13 Based on stakeholder interviews in Massachusetts, ZESB lead
times experienced in the Commonwealth have varied from 3 months to 18
months.

Collins Bus Corporation see: “Electric School Buses,” Lightning eMotors, accessed December 19, 2023,
https://lightningemotors.com/electric-school-buses/.
13 Lee, “The Electrification of School Buses.” Data came from California’s Hybrid and Zero-Emission Truck and Bus
Voucher Incentive Project (HVIP), which included lead times for a total of 545 ZESB deliveries in California from 2017-
2021.

The upfront capital costs of ZESBs in the United States are 3-4 times more
expensive than their diesel counterparts. The batteries that power ZESBs are
particularly expensive and are the main driver of the higher upfront cost.14 Cost
comparisons of ZESBs and their diesel counterparts can be found in Section
4.3.
Battery capacity differs between ZESB manufacturers and types. A sample of
the battery capacity and approximate range of some of the 24 available ZESB
models as of March 2023 are listed in Table 1 below. The battery capacities
and ranges provided in the table are provided by the OEMs and represent the
“nameplate” or claimed estimates, which are the maximum capacity the
battery can store and distance the bus can travel when it is fully charged and
operating under ideal conditions. The “usable” battery capacity, typically 80 –
90 percent of the nameplate capacity, is the amount of energy that can be
discharged from the battery while maintaining the state of health of the
battery. The actual vehicle range will vary depending on the specific demands
of each route, including distance, elevation changes, and weather conditions.

ZESB motors have approximately 20 parts compared to 2,000 in their diesel
engine counterparts. With fewer components, some ZESB operators have
reported these vehicles are generally easier to maintain, however their high
voltage systems require specialized training for maintenance technicians.16
Operating ZESBs requires the procurement and installation of appropriate
electrical and charging infrastructure at school bus garaging locations.
Upgrades or changes to the electricity system may be required both on-site
and within the utility distribution system serving the chosen depot location.
These upgrades may include the purchase and installation of electrical
infrastructure components, such as transformers, meters, switchgear, panels,
and chargers.
Each ZESB has a maximum threshold for power acceptance, and it is essential
that school bus operators purchase chargers that are compatible with their
ZESBs. There are generally three types of chargers that service ZEVs: AC Level 1
(L1), AC Level 2 (L2), and Direct Current (DC). Given the longer dwell times for
school buses, L2 chargers are generally the standard, while ZESBs with a more
rigorous duty cycle, longer route, and/or shorter dwell time might need a DC
fast charger (DCFC), which are more expensive because of their ability to
deliver high amounts of energy in a short amount of time.17
Charging stations for ZESBs can be “networked” or internet connected,
providing the station operators with real-time data and controls. Sometimes
referred to as “Smart” charging stations, networked charging stations provide
operators with a web-based dashboard application to see all charging
stations, status of stations, and control usage of the stations including
scheduling when a vehicle connected to the station will receive power.
Charging software can help optimize charging schedules, costs, demand, and
bus performance. These software packages are often available as part of the
overall annual subscription service fees that EV station network providers
charge EV charging station operators (i.e., the ZESB owners or school districts).
The software can communicate with electric utility grid operators to utilize
real-time pricing and demand data from the utility.

2.0 The School Bus Sector in Massachusetts
2.1 School Bus Fleet in Massachusetts
As previously stated, RMV vehicle registration data was utilized to describe the
Commonwealth’s school bus fleet. This data included characteristics such as
passenger capacity, fuel type, age, ownership, garaging location, and
odometer readings. The RMV data indicated that there were 9,446 school
buses registered in Massachusetts.
There are 398 public school districts in Massachusetts and approximately
400,000 students in Massachusetts are transported by school buses annually.18
The RMV school bus data available for this analysis did not indicate if all 9,446
of these school buses are used regularly to transport students in the
Commonwealth to school. This data does not allow MassDOT to identify which
school buses serve which districts nor does it outline school districts’
transportation service arrangements or agreements.
Understanding the school bus types in the fleet is important for determining
costs given the range of costs between types. The RMV data did not include
information regarding school bus types, so each school bus type is
categorized by their passenger capacity, as show in Table 2.19 Some of the
school buses in the fleet have passenger capacities that fall outside of the
typical capacity ranges for Type A, B, C, and D school buses. Consequently,
such vehicles are classified as “Other (fewer than 16 passengers)” and “Other
(30 to 59 passengers).”

Figure 2 summarizes the statewide breakdown of school bus types by
passenger capacity. Most school buses in Massachusetts are Types C and D,
with passenger capacities between 60 and 90. Just over 14 percent of school
buses fall outside of the standard types and are classified as “Other (fewer
than 16 passengers)” and “Other (30 to 59 passengers).”

School buses in Massachusetts are fueled by five different fuel types: diesel,
gasoline, flexible fuel, propane, and electricity. 21 Approximately 76 percent of
school buses use diesel fuel, followed by gasoline, flexible fuel, propane, and
electric (Figure 4). There were 18 electric school buses registered in the
Commonwealth.
21 Flexible fuel refers to internal combustion vehicles that can operate on gasoline and any blend of gasoline and
ethanol up to 83 percent, such as E85 which is a gasoline-ethanol blend containing 51 percent to 83 percent
ethanol.

School districts in Massachusetts tailor their school transportation ownership
and operations arrangements to fit their specific needs and preferences.
School districts can either operate their entire fleet, contract out transportation
services to a private entity, or choose a combination of those two options.
Transportation service arrangements are discussed in more detail in Section
2.4.
Figure 5 illustrates the breakdown of school bus ownership statewide, with an
inset that indicates how many school buses are leased to private or municipal
entities. Private entities own more than 70 percent of school buses in the
Commonwealth, and of those that are leased, more than 70 percent are
leased to private entities. In the Commonwealth, approximately 72 school
districts own at least one school bus, while 31 own more than ten. These
numbers give us an understanding of the number of school districts that own
their school bus fleets, but do not mean they operate, or are served by, only
these buses; many of these same districts may partially lease school buses or
contract for school bus services.

school bus operates, this data does include the municipality where school
buses are garaged. Figure 6 illustrates the ownership status by garage

In summary, the school bus fleet in Massachusetts as of April 5, 2023 generally
consists of larger Type C and D buses, skews young with a median age of 5
years, primarily runs on diesel fuel, and is mostly owned by private entities.
2.2 Regulations and Laws Relevant to School Bus
Operations
Numerous regulations and laws in Massachusetts set forth guidelines for how
school transportation should operate. The following section provides a
summary of the key regulations and laws that govern school bus
transportation in the Commonwealth.
Massachusetts statutes establish the responsibility of the School Committee
to ensure transportation services are available for students to be transported
to and from home and school and other educational programs. The School
16

Committee for each district has oversight of and responsibility for the school
system and establishes criteria to determine if the district’s goals and policies
are being met.22
The procurement method for school transportation services in Massachusetts
is governed by Chapter 30B of the Uniform Procurement Act, which regulates
the procurement of supplies, services, and real property by school districts,
cities, towns, and other local jurisdictions in Massachusetts.23 Chapter 30B,
unless authorized by majority vote, also limits the initial contract term to three
years with a possibility for two one-year extensions to the initial three-year
contract, for a total potential contract duration of up to five years subject to
renegotiation and agreement between the districts and the providers.24
Massachusetts law also dictates school bus driver qualifications. Individuals
who wish to operate a school bus must obtain a Commercial Driver’s License
(CDL) with a Passenger (P) Endorsement or a School Bus (S) Endorsement.
Drivers also need a school bus driver certificate.25
Additionally, school buses registered in Massachusetts are subject to three
annual inspections conducted by the RMV during the fall, winter, and spring.
The first annual inspection occurs during the months of August and
September, the second during December and January, and the third during
April and May.26 These inspections result in a certification or rejection of a
school bus meeting state-sanctioned safety standards.
2.3 School Bus Funding
School districts are required by law to provide transportation services for some
forms of school transportation. Table 3 outlines the student populations that

are guaranteed school transportation by law. According to stakeholder
interviews, most school districts provide transportation services to students
living more than one mile from their assigned schools, while sometimes
providing services for shorter distances for elementary students.

Though the services described in Table 3 are required, state funding for most
school transportation services in Massachusetts is limited. Funding
responsibilities generally fall on municipalities. Municipalities typically cover

19

the cost of their school transportation services through general tax receipts
and school bus service fees.28
Massachusetts’ primary state financial aid program for public elementary and
secondary schools is the Chapter 70 program.29 Chapter 70, however, cannot
be used to fund general student transportation in Massachusetts. The
exception is for regional school district transportation, which is typically
reimbursed by the state at 70 to 90 percent of the total costs.
Additional state and federal funding opportunities primarily target
transportation services with higher associated costs and for high-need
students. Specifically, the Special Education Circuit Breaker, McKinney-Vento
Homeless Assistance Act, and Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) offer
financial assistance for unique student transportation services.
The Special Education Circuit Breaker is a cost-sharing state program between
school districts and the state for expenses related to educating the students
who have the highest special education needs. Transportation services for
students who are placed in out-of-district programs and are on an
Individualized Education Program (IEP) are eligible for state reimbursements
up to 25 percent. However, the Circuit Breaker does not require state
reimbursement of transportation costs for in district special education
transportation.30
Under the federal McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act, school
transportation for students experiencing homelessness is a mandatory service
for the state to qualify for various categories of federal money. Consequently,
the state is obligated to provide full reimbursement to school districts that
transport these students.31

ESSA requires school districts to work with the Massachusetts Department of
Children and Families (DCF) to provide, arrange, and fund transportation for
students in foster care to the schools that students previously attended prior
to their placement in care. This service does not receive state aid; however,
these transportation services are eligible for federal aid via approval of a Title
IV-E state plan amendment.32
2.4 School Bus Contracting Arrangements
School districts in Massachusetts must arrange school transportation services
for their students, and there are various stakeholders who determine how a
school district will do so. The superintendent is responsible for the execution of
transportation policy and regulations, including establishing bus routes.33
Based on stakeholder interviews, school transportation services are often led
by a director of transportation, director of operations, director of finance, or the
school business administrator. These school district transportation leaders
collaborate with the School Committee and other stakeholders to determine
how to provide school transportation services.
School districts may choose to either own and operate their own fleets, lease
and operate their school buses, or contract out services to a private bus
company. Some school districts choose a mix of these options. For example,
some school districts contract both general education and special education
services, while other districts contract out general education transportation
and provide special education transportation internally.
DESE sent a survey to school districts in April of 2023 asking if they “provide
[their] own self-operated regular or special education transportation?” There
were 314 school districts that responded. For regular transportation services,
48 stated “yes” and 266 replied “no.” For special education transportation
services, 81 responded “yes” and 233 responded “no.” This survey indicates that
most school districts in Massachusetts contract out services to private
companies and that school districts are more likely to self-operate special
32 “Ensuring Educational Stability for Students in Foster Care - Guidance,” Massachusetts Department of Elementary
and Secondary Education (DESE), January 18, 2018, https://www.doe.mass.edu/news/news.aspx?id=24765.
33 DESE, “Pupil Transportation Guide.”
21

education services, which generally transport fewer students than general
education services.
School districts that want to contract out transportation services are required
to follow competitive bidding processes. They issue Requests for Proposals
(RFPs) or Invitations for Bids (IFBs) to potential transportation providers,
evaluating them based on predefined criteria such as cost, service quality, and
safety records. When all other criteria are met, the only remaining determinant
is the price. Subsequently, in accordance with Chapter 30B, Section 5, school
districts select the lowest responsible and responsive bidder that meets the
transportation needs of the students while offering the best value.34 Contracts
with private operators are typically bid on a per bus per day rate and are
signed for three years with the option for two one-year extensions or for five
years.
2.5 School Bus Fleet Operations
Conversations with both school districts and private bus companies highlight
the complex and context-specific nature of school bus operations, which
encompass tasks such as route planning, driver training, safety procedures,
regulatory compliance, and the provision of specialized services, including
transportation for students with disabilities and extracurricular activities.
Each school district designs their school bus fleet operations or directs the
private bus company’s operations to ensure their individual district’s
requirements are met. School districts generally provide school transportation
services for 180 days per year for general education transportation, special
education transportation, travel for sports and extracurricular activities, and
vocational school transportation. Some districts provide summer school
transportation, which falls outside of the standard 180 days of operation per
year.
Daily duty cycles of school buses depend on the school district’s needs and
typically encompass morning routes, mid-day layovers, afternoon routes,
athletic events, and occasional field trips or extracurricular trips. This study did
34 “General Law - Part I, Title III, Chapter 30B, Section 5,” Massachusetts Legislature, accessed September 7, 2023,
https://malegislature.gov/Laws/GeneralLaws/PartI/TitleIII/Chapter30B/Section5.
22

not have access to school bus telematics, but based on stakeholder
interviews, the average daily mileage per bus varies from 10 miles to 150 miles.
School bus routes typically remain consistent throughout the year and are
structured with the goal of minimizing the total time a student spends on the
bus. Stakeholder interviews revealed that school bus routes are often
categorized into tiers based on various factors such as distance from the
school, grade levels, and start times. Additionally, the daily transportation
service schedule may vary depending on the day of the week if the district has
inconsistent weekly start or end times.
The number of stops, along with the duration of stop layovers, differs among
school districts due to diverse factors, including geographical location, student
requirements, and start and end times. Some districts have bus routes with as
few as 5 stops and 5 to 10 minutes of layover time. Other districts, specifically
those in more rural communities, have longer routes with up to 25 stops per
route.
Deadheading is also a consideration for school bus operations due to its
impact on efficiency and cost effectiveness. This occurs when school buses
operate without passengers, usually to reach their starting points or assigned
terminals. Depending on the storage locations of the individual buses, the
deadheading varies amongst school districts. Efficient school transportation
services tend to design routes to limit deadheading.
2.6 School Bus Fleet Storage and Maintenance
School bus service providers in Massachusetts have varied operating
demands, but their fleet storage and maintenance practices are relatively
similar. All operators need to determine where and how to store their school
buses, whether they own or lease the storage depot, what equipment to keep
at the storage facility, and where and how to perform fleet maintenance.
Typically, school district transportation procurement contracts require that a
school bus be stored in the same municipality as the school it serves to
minimize transit times and ensure timely pick-up and drop-off of students.
However, some districts make exceptions if the storage location is still close
23

by. For school districts that own school buses, they tend to store their fleet on
school property or at facilities located within the district. Some districts and
private operators store their fleets across multiple facilities, while others utilize
one location.
School bus operators have the choice of owning or leasing the property where
they store their fleet. This decision is primarily determined by the operator’s
budget and availability of land and storage locations in the district. Interviews
suggested that most leasing agreements are 20 years long.
School bus fleets are typically stored in outdoor, central depots, with some
depots including limited indoor storage for buses.
Based on stakeholder interviews, the mobility of buses between depots is
relatively infrequent. Generally, each depot serves a specific geographic area
or school district, and the buses assigned to that depot primarily operate
within their designated region. However, in exceptional cases, such as
maintenance needs, high-volume passenger events, or emergencies, buses
may be temporarily moved between depots to meet demand.
The typical layout of school buses at a storage facility consists of designated
parking spaces for each bus. The buses are generally parked side by side in a
row format, and there are well-defined lanes for easy access and movement
of the vehicles.
At school bus fleet facilities, a range of equipment is stored and utilized. Apart
from the school buses themselves, these facilities house maintenance and
repair tools, diagnostic equipment, and spare parts to keep the buses in
optimal condition. Additionally, they may have fueling stations and bus-
washing facilities. If fueling stations are not located at the storage facility,
operators typically fuel their fleets off-site at a location close by.
Operators that perform their own maintenance often have a dedicated facility
for maintenance and employ full-time mechanics. Other operators perform
simple repairs in-house and transfer the vehicle to the dealership or the
24

service provider for major repairs or choose to contract out all maintenance
services.
Fleet replacement practices vary between public and privately owned fleets.
Generally, school district-owned buses are replaced at the end of a bus’s life
(between 10 to 15 years). However, specific replacement schedules may be
adjusted based on factors like the bus's mileage, condition, and funding
availability. For school districts that contract with private companies for school
bus services, contract terms often require school buses to be five years old or
younger, which incentivizes private fleets to replace their buses more regularly.
2.7 Status of Zero-Emission School Bus Implementation in the
Commonwealth
Out of the 9,446 school buses in the Commonwealth, at the time RMV data
was extracted for this analysis, 18 were ZESBs. The school bus operators
interviewed that currently utilize ZESBs stated that the financial assistance
through several government programs enabled them to purchase these
buses. Operators also expressed a key success factor for ZESB adoption was a
strong relationship with their utility provider. They also emphasized the
importance of training drivers, particularly on regenerative breaking, and
having specially trained ZESB maintenance operators close by.35 Broadly, ZESB
operators expressed their ambition to continue with a transition to this
technology, with quieter bus operation and the absence of diesel emissions
among the factors motivating this ongoing transition.
A number of school districts and private operators using ZESBs collaborate
with private companies who offer a turnkey ZESB service. These turnkey ZESB
service providers typically own the ZESB and associated equipment, thereby
reducing the up-front capital cost for their clients. These providers are usually
responsible for all maintenance tasks, assist with installing charging
infrastructure at the client’s storage facility, offer driver training, and aid their
clients in seeking financial assistance. The school district is typically
35 Regenerative brakes are used in electric and hybrid vehicles and function as an energy recovering mechanism by

https://www.energy.gov/energysaver/how-regenerative-brakes-work.
25

responsible for hiring drivers. This arrangement typically entails a 10–15-year
contract.
Some of the school bus operators with ZESB experience have participated in
pilot Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) technology programs. V2G charging technology
allows ZESBs to interact with the power grid via a bi-directional charger that
facilitates a two-way energy flow. Using this technology, ZESBs can both draw
power from the grid to charge their batteries and send stored energy back to
the grid.36 Under a V2G program, the school bus operator is paid for the energy
the bus gives back to the grid. Feedback from participants indicated that in
theory, this approach could offer advantages to both the operator and the
power grid, but that the compensation provided to the ZESB operators was
modest, and the training and resources needed for V2G implementation are
significant.
Most of the fleet operators interviewed who have not yet adopted ZESBs
expressed their interest in buying them--however, the primary barrier to
adoption is the higher up-front cost of ZESBs and their associated charging
infrastructure compared to their diesel counterparts. Some districts interested
in buying ZESBs either applied for funding assistance but didn't receive it, don't
have the time or expertise to apply for grants or a plan for how to integrate
ZESBs into their fleets, or didn't know funding assistance was available.
Transitioning to ZESBs requires the establishment of charging infrastructure
and in many cases, upgrading electric systems to accommodate higher
energy demands. Interviews indicated these to be significant logistical and
financial challenges.
As mentioned earlier, there are approximately 24 ZESB models available on the
market. However, due to the specific needs of each school district, some
stakeholders expressed that there are not enough model options and lead
times are too long to meet their needs. School bus operators also expressed
uncertainty regarding available models meeting their daily mileage needs.
36 Darlene Steward, “Critical Elements of Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) Economics,” National Renewable Energy Laboratory
(NREL), September 2017, https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy17osti/69017.pdf.
26

This is particularly a concern for operators with daily bus mileage
requirements of 150 miles or more.
Many private operators in Massachusetts rely on resale values to fund their
next school bus purchase and ensure their fleet is young enough to meet
school district bid requirements. Given the ZESB market is new, there is little
information regarding market resale values, which poses a concern for private
operators. Similarly, the lifespan of a ZESB is unfamiliar, making fleet
replacement planning for school districts and private operators challenging.
3.0 Overview of Massachusetts Investor-Owned Utilities
ZESB adoption, specifically the deployment of charging infrastructure, requires
coordination with private and municipal utilities in Massachusetts.
There are currently four investor-owned electric distribution companies that
provide electricity services for a majority of towns and cities in Massachusetts:
 NSTAR Electric Company d/b/a Eversource Energy
 Massachusetts Electric Company d/b/a National Grid
 Nantucket Electric Company d/b/a National Grid
 Fitchburg Gas and Electric Light Company d/b/a Unitil
Massachusetts is also served by 41 municipal electric companies delivering
power to approximately 50 municipalities across the Commonwealth.37 This
structure creates a patchwork of different providers, each of which maintains
the electric distribution infrastructure (i.e., wires, poles, transformers, etc.) for
their specific service territory.
The economic analysis in Section 4.0 includes consideration of Demand
Charge Alternative programs for electric vehicle charging, which are only
relevant to investor-owned utilities. The focus of this section is on these
37 “Competitive Supply Glossary,” Mass.gov, accessed September 19, 2023, https://www.mass.gov/info-
details/competitive-supply-glossary.
27

investor-owned utilities, and their EV charging programs are discussed in
more detail below.
Investor-owned electric utilities charge distribution fees to electric consumers.
The prices (“rates”) that these utilities charge their customers are highly
regulated and set by the Department of Public Utilities (DPU). These utilities
must supply electricity largely on demand and typically have limited ways to
store it. Consequently, electricity must be distributed immediately to end users,
prompting providers to structure pricing in a way that encourages consistent
and predictable customer demand.
The investor-owned utilities in Massachusetts assess “demand charges” on
commercial customers who demand high power levels over short periods of
time. These utilities have structured their rates so that once a commercial
customer exceeds a peak demand or load threshold, demand charges are
triggered, which are based on the monthly maximum or peak energy kilowatt
(kW) demand.38
The kW demand of energy use is the key difference between L2 and DC EV
charging from a customer pricing standpoint. For example, if a ZESB with a 180
kW battery returns to base with 15 percent charge left, that ZESB would need
153 kW to return to a state of full charge. The school bus operator could charge
that bus for 12 hours overnight at an average of 13 kW per hour using a 19.2 kW
L2 charger, or a school bus operator could charge that bus in a single hour
during the day using a 150 kW DCFC. Both scenarios could be subject to
demand charges--however, it is more likely that the daytime DCFC charging
scenario would experience higher demand charges due to its higher
maximum energy threshold of 150 kW compared to 19.2 kW.
National Grid, Eversource, and Unitil developed Demand Charge Alternative
Programs for EV charging, which were approved by DPU.39 These programs are
designed to reduce EV charging station operating costs by providing a tiered,
38 “Understanding Your Electric Bill: Saving Money On Demand Charges and Power Factor,” Mass.gov, April 1, 2019,

28

load factor-based discount on commercial customer demand charges.40 A
load factor (LF) is the ratio of the actual kilowatt hours (kWh) delivered during
a billing period to the peak load (or peak demand in kW) during the billing
period, if the demand was constant over the billing period. These programs
are currently available for 10 years starting in 2023. All new and existing utility
customers are eligible to enroll in their service area provider’s program,
provided their EV charging stations are separately metered and the customer
is on a qualifying, EV-specific rate schedule.
The Demand Charge Alternative Programs coupled with networked chargers
and demand management software can help school bus operators mitigate
electric utility demand charges.
4.0 Evaluating the Costs and Environmental Benefits of
Zero-emission School Buses
4.1 Fleet Replacement Scenarios
FLEET REPLACEMENT SCENARIO DEFINITIONS
To enable comparisons of ZESB costs and environmental benefits with their
conventional counterparts, three school bus fleet replacement scenarios
were defined, as outlined in Table 4 below, reflecting futures in which ZESB
fleet share follows three different adoption pathways. The fleet replacement
scenarios cover the period from 2023-2036. This fourteen-year analysis
period aligns with the approximate life expectancy of a school bus and
concludes in 2036, the year following the cessation of Advanced Clean
Trucks rule (ACT rule) sales percentage escalations, described below.
In all three fleet replacement scenarios, the total number of school buses
operating in Massachusetts remains constant at 9,446 vehicles over the
analysis horizon, to simplify the analysis. Similarly, the proportion of vehicles

by body style (inferred by gross vehicle weight rating or “regulatory class”)
also remains constant.

Mix
scenario is included only to allow the calculation of the total cost
of ZESB adoption and associated emissions impacts.
Under this scenario, school bus manufacturers comply with the
ACT rule adopted by Massachusetts in 2021 and taking effect in
Model Year (MY) 2025 sales.41 The rule requires an increasing
fraction of all medium and heavy duty vehicle sales, in weight
classes 2B through 8, in Massachusetts beginning with MY 2025 be
zero-emission vehicles. These fractions vary by vehicle weight
ZEV
class.
Compliance
While the ACT rule applies to all MHDV sales and does not
specifically apply to school buses, this scenario assumes that ZESB
manufacturers comply with the ACT rule sales fraction schedule
by vehicle weight class set out in the regulation.
This scenario models an immediate shift to 100 percent ZESB
purchases. Beginning in 2024, all new school buses entering the
ZESB Swap
fleet are ZESBs.

FLEET REPLACEMENT SCENARIO ZESB FLEET SHARE
Figure 7 below illustrates the estimated ZESB fleet share for each analysis
year (2023-2036) of each fleet replacement scenario, as defined in Table 4.
These fleet share estimates take into account the age distribution of the
Massachusetts school bus fleet and a custom scrappage curve that defines
the probability of vehicles retiring from the fleet changes with age.
While used ZESBs may circulate in the fleet and individual fleets may buy and
sell individual vehicles over time, this analysis examines the statewide school
bus population.
32

Figure 7. Estimated ZESB Fleet Share by Fleet Replacement Scenario, 2023-
2036
Current ZESB Swap
Fuel Mix
ZESB fleet share is lowest for the Current Fuel Mix scenario; by design, the fleet
never gains more than 18 ZESBs (0.2 percent of the fleet).
The ZEV Compliance scenario results in a ZESB fleet share of 71 percent by
2036. The conversion rate for this scenario slows slightly in 2035, and then
begins to flatten as the Class 4-8 sales fraction ceases to increase in that
year.
The ZESB Swap scenario would achieve a nearly full ZESB fleet by 2036. The
fleet share reaches 92 percent electric in 2033 and 99.4 percent electric at
the end of the analysis timeframe in 2036. Though outside the stated
analysis horizon, the analysis predicts full electrification under the ZESB Swap
scenario by 2038.
4.2 Key Assumptions and Inputs Considerations
Estimating the economic and environmental impacts of the three fleet
replacement scenarios required assumptions about the fleet activity,
including average daily miles driven, charging requirements, and a range of
unit costs.
33

4.2.1 Fleet Activity and Mileage Assumptions
The average annual vehicle miles travelled (VMT) for each regulatory class
and age was estimated using the annual RMV mileage data from 2018-2022,
available for only 8,007 school buses. The results from the school buses with
mileage data were then scaled to reflect the full fleet of 9,446 school buses.
For the annual VMT calculation, the number of school bus operating days in
Massachusetts was estimated to be 156. The Massachusetts school year is
180 days and on average, each school bus is assumed to be used as a spare
vehicle approximately 13 percent of the time, or 24 days per year.43
The distribution of annual miles driven for school buses in Massachusetts is
presented in Figure 8, while Figure 9 shows the distribution of daily miles
driven.

Average Daily Miles
As Figure 9 shows, only 3 percent of daily miles driven exceed 100 miles. The
daily mileage results were used to determine the charging strategy for each
school bus in the fleet, as described in Section 4.2.2 below.
All ZESBs of regulatory Class 4 and above were assumed to use diesel-
powered heaters during winter months only (between November and
March). Class 2-3 school buses are assumed to use batteries for heat, given
these smaller vehicles would require far less energy to heat.
The number of winter school bus operating days from November to March
was estimated to determine the days that diesel heaters would operate.
There are typically 109 weekdays from November to March and 17 weekday
holidays, which leads to a total of 92 winter school days, of which each
vehicle would actually operate 80 days (due to the 13 percent spare vehicle
assumption). Multiplying the average daily VMT by 80 yielded the winter
mileage, which was then distributed in the same manner as with average
annual VMT, by regulatory class and age. This winter operating day estimate
was used to calculate the emissions from diesel heaters, as described in
Section 4.4.
35

4.2.2 Charging Requirement Assumptions
CHARGING FEASIBILITY STRATEGIES
A charging feasibility analysis was performed using a model that incorporated
the battery capacity, number of days of operations, weather conditions,
average daily mileage, and average speed to determine fleet charging
strategies and energy requirements.
One of the following two charging strategies was assigned to each school bus
based on estimated energy consumption rates and various operational
conditions:
1. ZESBs charge solely on L2 (19.2kW) EV chargers overnight. L2 chargers
offer fleet owners the lowest cost EV hardware options, smallest space
requirements per bus, lowest cost for installation, and lowest ongoing
costs for operations and maintenance (O&M).
2. ZESBs complete daily operations with DCFC EV stations capable of
charging buses at 150kW per hour during a mid-point of daily operations
to ensure sufficient battery charge. DCFC EV charging stations need
additional space per bus and are significantly more expensive
compared to L2 EV chargers.
CHARGING FEASIBILITY ASSUMPTIONS
The charging assumptions detailed in Table 7 below were used to determine
the charging feasibility of the 9,446 school buses based on the two charging
strategies.
36

Table 7. Charging Feasibility Model Assumptions

use)
Average School Bus Speed 25 mph44
Minimum State of Charge
15% (industry standard minimum SOC best practice)
(SOC)
Maximum State of Charge 85% (industry standard providing buffer against battery
(SOC) degradation)
Each bus is assumed to begin the day with a minimum 85 percent state of
charge (SOC) and its daily mileage is considered feasible if it ends the day
above a 15 percent battery SOC. This range considers that operating at a SOC
above 85 percent leads to battery degradation and that operating below 15
percent risks the vehicle running out of charge before it can return to the
garage.
When the average daily miles driven for a bus end with a SOC greater than 15
percent, that bus is considered feasible for electrification under an L2 (19.2kW)
overnight EV charging scenario to meet all daily service cycle energy needs.
For each bus that fell under 15 percent state of charge after the L2 overnight
only charging scenario, a midday DCFC (150kW) EV charging session option
was tested in the model to see if the bus could service the remaining route
miles. The school buses that could meet its energy needs with a DCFC session
during the daily service cycle were considered feasible for electrification.
CHARGING FEASIBILITY RESULTS
The results of this high-level charging analysis are illustrated in Figure 10. An
estimated 73 percent of the Massachusetts school bus fleet would be feasible
44 Adam Duran and Kevin Walkowicz, “A Statistical Characterization of School Bus Drive Cycles Collected via
Onboard Logging Systems,” SAE International Journal of Commercial Vehicles 6, no. 2 (2013): 400–406,

37

for overnight L2 (19.2kW) EV charging alone, while the remaining 27 percent
can complete their service routes with one mid-day DCFC EV charging session.
Less than one tenth of a percent of the fleet could not complete their daily
mileage under either charging strategy, with these school buses most likely
used for longer field trips or special routes.

These charging results were utilized to determine the use of L2 charging or DC
fast charging strategies in the fleet replacement scenario cost estimates in
Section 4.3.2.
For the fleet replacement scenario cost estimates and environmental impact
analysis below, it was assumed that all fossil fuel-powered school buses could
be replaced on a 1:1 basis with ZESBs of the same vehicle class. While less than
one percent of the school bus fleet was unsuitable for electrification, the state-
wide nature of this analysis and the fact that none of the replacement
scenarios reach 100 percent ZESB adoption by 2036 justified the use of a 1:1
replacement ratio.
4.2.3 ZESB and Diesel School Bus Cost Assumptions
School bus fleets, whether powered by fossil fuel for or zero-emission sources,
are subject to the following four categories of lifecycle costs: 1) capital
acquisition costs; 2) operations costs; 3) maintenance costs; and 4) end-of-
life costs. Each of the four main cost categories are detailed below in 2022
dollars with information on three schools bus types (A, C, & D) for ZESBs and
38

diesel-powered school buses.45 These cost assumptions are representative
and actual costs associated with ZESB adoption will vary based on a range of
factors, such as the vehicle makes and models chosen, vehicle specifications,
school district needs, site upgrades, and utility provider.
In the subsections that follow, red-colored numbers are used to illustrate ZESB
costs that exceed conventional diesel buses, while green-colored numbers are
used to illustrate ZESB costs that offer comparable savings.
The capital acquisition costs in Table 8 and Table 9 were utilized to estimate
the fleet replacement scenario costs in Section 4.3.2.
The “total” values for Type C school buses in Table 8 – Table 14 represent the
cost assumptions utilized in the total cost of ownership (TCO) analysis in
Section 4.3.1.

Table 8 below details the capital acquisition costs associated with L2 charging
for ZESB deployment.

Investments and upgrades are often needed on the utility’s side of the
electrical meter, such as a separate meter, larger transformer, new electrical
service, or a new substation.51 It is important to note that the L2 and DC EV
charging hardware and installation costs outlined in Table 8 and Table 9
represent the customer-side acquisition and installation costs and do not
include utility-side cost estimates.

ANNUAL SCHOOL BUS OPERATIONS COST ASSUMPTIONS
ZESBs potentially offer several operational cost savings advantages to diesel
vehicles based on reduced costs for energy, greater energy efficiencies, and
reduced need for additional fluids such as diesel exhaust fluid. Table 10 below
details the annual operations costs per school bus associated with L2 charging
or DC fast charging.

Table 10 above does not factor in demand charges. Table 11 illustrates
potential demand charge costs. To streamline the cost analysis, only demand
charges from investor-owned utilities with Demand Charge Alternative
Programs (National Grid, Eversource, and Unitil) were considered. These
programs consist of rate components such as a kW demand charge and a
kWh base distribution rate.
Demand charges are based on the peak rate of electricity consumption in kWs
at a facility each month over a specific time interval. The demand charges in
the existing programs range from $3.04 - $19.82/kW. The kW rates in Table 11
represent a weighted average based on how many school buses are garaged
in each utility service region. They are categorized by “low utilization” and “high
utilization,” where low utilization represents the weighted average $/kW in the
greater than 5 percent and less than or equal to 10 percent load factor
52 The annual operations costs in Table 10 would apply to all ZESBs, regardless of whether they utilize an L2 charger
or DCFC.
53 The annual average school bus mileage (7,069) from the RMV mileage data was utilized for these cost estimates.

category, and high utilization represents the weighted average $/kW in the
greater than 15 percent load factor category.

demand charge kW costs.

ANNUAL SCHOOL BUS MAINTENANCE COST ASSUMPTIONS
ZESBs offer potential maintenance advantages versus their diesel
counterparts due to their simplified mechanical components, as shown in the
“Annual Maintenance Costs” row in Table 12 below.55
However, ZESBs are currently subject to several increased costs versus diesel
school buses, primarily stemming from increased costs to insure the vehicles

DC EV fast chargers are subject to increased ongoing maintenance costs
compared to L2 EV chargers. These increased costs stem primarily from the
fact that DCFC equipment, by providing significantly higher power (150kW vs.
19.2kW) outputs over short time periods, have hardware that is routinely
subject to higher temperatures, or thermal loads, during operations. These
high operating temperatures require cooling systems within the DCFC
equipment, and these cooling systems need routine maintenance. Table 13
details the ongoing costs related to annual DCFC equipment maintenance.

of local juries, repair costs, perceived danger), coverage, caps on payouts, and other considerations.
43

For fleet owners that keep their vehicles for their full lifetime, additional mid-
life battery overhaul costs may be incurred. Electric vehicle batteries, like all
batteries, are subject to degradation over years of successive charging and
discharging cycles. Battery degradation means a diminished capacity for
batteries to store energy over their lifetime. Most ZESB manufacturers, like
conventional vehicle manufacturers, offer battery warranties for five to eight
years, often guaranteeing a range minimum, and offering a full battery
replacement if range decreases past warrantied thresholds.
Table 14 details the potential mid-life ZESB battery overhaul costs as well as
end-of-life battery salvage values (based on composite average battery sizes
for each bus type).
For the TCO estimate in Section 4.3.1, mid-life overhaul costs for ZESBs were
assumed at 8 years. Diesel school buses did not have associated mid-life
costs because diesel engines are typically replaced at 250,000 miles or more,
which is beyond the estimated lifetime mileage of the Commonwealth’s fleet.57

VEHICLE END-OF-LIFE AND RESALE VALUE
Compared to the extensive market data that exists for diesel school buses,
assessing the end-of-life and resale values of ZESBs is challenging due to
scarcity of data. Most ZESBs deployed have been operating for five years or
less and therefore have not yet reached the end-of-life stage.58 Consequently,

Transportation, September 30, 2011, https://rosap.ntl.bts.gov/view/dot/9548.

44

no end-of-life or resale values were used in the TCO or fleet replacement
scenario cost analysis.
4.3 Estimated Costs of Ownership and Fleet Replacement
Scenarios
4.3.1 Lifetime Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) Estimates
Table 15 illustrates a TCO assessment for Type C ZESBs and diesel school
buses. The TCO analysis encompasses all major cost components - capital,
annual operating and maintenance, mid-life overhaul, and the battery
salvage value cited in Section 4.2.3 above - expressed in net present value
(NPV), assuming a 7 percent discount rate, a fourteen-year useful life, and
7,069 annual miles driven. The analysis compares how charging methods (L2
vs. DCFC) and electricity costs (no demand charge operation costs from
Table 10 vs. Demand Charge Alternative program operation costs from Table
11) impact cost estimations.
The TCO analysis for Type C school buses illustrates the same trend found
with Type A and D school bus TCO estimates: for all school bus types,
regardless of electricity utilization or charging strategy, ZESBs are currently
more expensive to own compared to their diesel counterparts.

4.3.2 School Bus Fleet Replacement Scenario Capital Costs
The school bus fleet replacement scenario costs estimated in this section are
based on the 2022 capital cost estimates for diesel and electric school
buses, including the charging hardware, installation, and incremental land
acquisition costs, detailed in Table 8 and Table 9. Each year assumes an
inflation rate of 3 percent for the capital costs.
In each of the three fleet replacement scenarios the total number of school
buses operating in Massachusetts remains constant at 9,446 vehicles over
the analysis horizon. Similarly, the proportion of vehicles by body style
(inferred by gross vehicle weight rating and aligned with Type A, C, and D)
also remains constant.
59 Partial demand charges refer to the Demand Charge Alternative Program costs outlined in Table 11.
46

CURRENT FUEL MIX REPLACEMENT SCENARIO COSTS
The Current Fuel Mix replacement scenario costs serve as a point of
reference for comparing the additional costs of ZESB deployments in the ZEV
Compliance and ZESB Swap cost estimates. Under this scenario, the school
buses in the fleet are replaced by school buses of the same fuel type and
school bus type (A, C, and D).
In the Current Fuel Mix replacement scenario, an estimated $1.82 billion in
capital costs is projected to be spent on 15,519 new school buses through
2036 in Massachusetts. Figure 11 below details the annual count of new
school buses and associated capital costs under this scenario.

ZEV COMPLIANCE REPLACEMENT SCENARIO COSTS
The ZEV Compliance scenario represents the additional capital costs of ZESB
adoption within a framework where all school bus OEMs comply with the ACT
rule sales percentage requirements. This framework aligns with minimum
47

adherence to the ACT rule, already adopted by the Massachusetts
Department of Environmental Protection (MassDEP) beginning with MY 2025
Class 2b-8 vehicles, and models ZESB adoption through 2036 at the same
rate as the ACT sales fractions apply, as visually represented in Figure 7 in
Section 4.1.
As described in the charging feasibility analysis in Section 4.2, not all ZESBs in
Massachusetts could feasibly charge using solely L2 chargers. The ZEV
Compliance scenario assumes 27 percent of the fossil fuel-powered school
buses replaced with ZESBs will have both a L2 EV charger for overnight
charging and a DCFC for midday charging.
In the ZEV Compliance scenario, an estimated 5,706 new ZESBs are purchased
through 2036. This would cost an additional $2.4 billion in ZESB and charging
infrastructure capital costs compared to the Current Fuel Mix scenario. Figure
12 below details the annual count of new ZESBs and associated capital costs
under this scenario.

ZESB SWAP REPLACEMENT SCENARIO COSTS
The ZESB Swap replacement scenario illustrates the additional capital costs of
a ZESB transition where 100 percent of new school buses replaced annually are
ZESBs. Like the ZEV Compliance scenario, the ZESB Swap scenario assumes 27
percent of the fossil fuel-powered school buses replaced with ZESBs will have
both a L2 EV charger for overnight charging and a DCFC for midday charging.
In the ZESB Swap scenario, an estimated 13,846 new ZESBs are purchased
through 2036. This would cost an additional $5.4 billion in ZESB and charging
infrastructure capital costs compared to the Current Fuel Mix scenario. Figure

under this scenario.

ZESB COST IMPACTS BY SCHOOL BUS FLEET OWNERSHIP MODEL
As discussed in Section 2.0, school buses in Massachusetts are either owned
by a school district, leased by a school district or private operator, or owned
by a private operator. Private entities own more than 70 percent of school
buses in the Commonwealth, and of the 8 percent of school buses that are
leased, more than 70 percent are leased to private entities.
School bus ownership models have different implications for how school
districts incur the costs of providing ZESB transportation services. It is important
to note that in cases when school districts enter into lease agreements or
contract their operations to private companies, they typically structure their
agreements on a per-bus, per-day cost. Each ownership model changes how
school districts experience the costs to transition their school transportation
services to zero-emission as follows:
 Municipally Owned: School district bears all ZESB capital costs upfront
and the ongoing operational and maintenance expenses, including
higher insurance costs and potentially high demand charges. The
district might also receive the full benefits of potential lower fuel and
maintenance costs compared to their diesel counterparts.
 Leased: School district defrays a significant portion of ZESB capital bus
and charging infrastructure costs and incurs higher per bus per day
costs compared to their diesel counterparts, depending on the terms of
the lease agreement. The school district might also be responsible for
ZESB maintenance and operational expenses depending on the lease
terms.
 Privately Owned: School district eliminates all upfront ZESB capital costs
but pays higher per bus per day costs compared to their diesel
counterparts as the private contractors amortize their capital expenses
into the annual fees the school districts pay for transportation services.
4.4 Estimated School Bus Air Quality Impacts
Emissions and health impacts from school buses of all the fuel types in the
Commonwealth’s fleet fuel mix (diesel, gasoline, propane, and electric) were
estimated for the three fleet replacement scenarios for the analysis period of
50

2023-2036. Tailpipe--as well as brakewear and tirewear--emissions were
estimated for each fuel type by multiplying annual VMT per regulatory class
and age by the appropriate emissions rate. This analysis excludes upstream
emissions from electricity generation and fossil fuel manufacturing.
For the three fleet replacement scenarios, the school bus emission effects of
the following pollutants were estimated:
 Greenhouse gases (GHGs), represented as carbon dioxide equivalents
or CO e. 60
2
 Four Clean Air Act criteria pollutants and precursors: nitrogen oxides
(NOx), volatile organic compounds (VOCs), fine particulate matter
(less than 2.5 microns, expressed as PM2.5), and coarse particulate
matter (less than 10 microns, expressed as PM10).
Emissions rates for diesel and gasoline were estimated in the Environmental
Protection Agency’s (EPA) Motor Vehicle Emissions Simulator (MOVES).61
Propane emissions rates were converted to diesel emissions rates using
Argonne National Laboratory’s Alternative Fuel Life-Cycle Environmental and
Economic Transportation (AFLEET) Tool. The emissions rates used in the
analysis were specific to regulatory class, fuel type, and vehicle age.
ZESB emission rates include those from diesel heaters, brakewear, and
tirewear and were estimated separately in MOVES. The MOVES emissions
rates for Auxiliary Power Units (APUs) were determined to be the most
appropriate for representing diesel heaters because they are based on
scientific literature studying APUs in use on actual vehicles. Alternatives
examined included using European studies and using the certification rates
from the EPA’s non-road compression ignition engine emissions standards as
described in 40 CFR 60 Subpart IIII and 40 CFR I(U)(1039). Using MOVES APU
rates is a more realistic approach because MOVES uses instrumented real-
world data rather than a regulatory standard and involves fewer
60 Since greenhouse gases include several compounds, this analysis used carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2e), a
composite unit that includes CO2 as well as other greenhouse gases. CO2e normalizes each other pollutant in terms
of the warming potential of an equivalent amount of CO2. Other GHGs included in CO2e include nitrous oxide (N2O)
and methane (CH4).
61 MOVES3.1 was the latest version at the time of this analysis.
51

assumptions to use. Following EPA and FHWA, we assume no change in
emissions rates from these diesel heaters on ZESBs over time.62
Additionally, ZESBs were assumed to emit pollutants from brakewear and
tirewear at the same rates as conventional school buses.63
4.4.1 Total Medium and Heavy Duty vs. School Bus Emissions
The emissions and health impact results in Sections 4.4.2 and 4.4.3 below
only represent a comparative assessment exclusively among the school bus
fleet replacement scenarios. The results do not represent net emissions or
health impacts from an incentive program.
This is because the ACT rule mandates increasing sales percentage
requirements for all Class 2b-8 vehicles sold in Massachusetts starting from
MY 2025. With the ACT rule in place, an incentive program for ZESBs may not
produce additional sales of medium and heavy duty ZEVs. Due to the high
penalty cost of ACT non-compliance and the high cost of medium and
heavy duty ZEVs, OEMs are expected to supply ZEVs up to the ACT rule sales
percentages, but not beyond. Thus, a ZESB incentive is likely to redistribute
ZEV sales within the regulated vehicle categories towards ZESBs over other
ZEVs, resulting in more ZESB sales but fewer other regulated medium and
heavy duty ZEV sales in Massachusetts.
This study only provides a comparison of emissions and health impacts from
school buses, under various levels of school bus electrification. This study
does not explicitly model the ultimate emissions outcomes across all
medium and heavy duty vehicles that would result from the effects of the
interaction between the ACT rule and a statewide school bus incentive
program.

4.4.2 Emissions Analysis Results
The emissions analysis results, detailed in Table 16 in metric tons (MT),
illustrate that school bus emissions would generally decline in all scenarios
for almost all pollutants, but increasingly so in the ZEV Compliance and ZESB
Swap scenarios. Ozone precursors NOx and VOCs, as well as PM10, would also
decline in each scenario, despite the use of diesel heaters on ZESBs, as
conventional internal combustion school buses operated fewer miles each
year.

Figure 14 through Figure 18 below show the trends in school bus pollutant
emissions within the analysis horizon, which all follow the same basic
trajectory. There is a small increase in school bus emissions from 2023-2028
largely because the 2022 spike in new bus purchases leads to a large cohort
of fossil fuel-powered school buses that persist in the fleet and become less
efficient as they age. This effect is most obvious for NOx, as most of the
Massachusetts school bus fleet uses diesel fuel. This age spike results in a
lower school bus replacement rate until the 2022 model year buses begin to
retire more rapidly beginning in 2028. From 2028 onwards, the decline in
school bus emissions for the ZEV Compliance and ZESB Swap scenarios
accelerates rapidly as increasing proportions of replacement school buses
entering the fleet are ZESBs. By contrast, the Current Fuel Mix scenario school
53

bus emissions decline only slightly, as the only improvement mechanism is
older buses exiting the fleet.
School bus GHG emissions decline in all scenarios, as shown in Figure 14.
Under the Current Fuel Mix scenario, GHG emissions from school buses
decline by nearly 15 percent by 2036. The model accounts for expected
improvements to vehicle fuel efficiency technology but does not anticipate
major improvements to fuel economy. The reduction in school bus GHG
emissions is therefore likely a result of the school bus fleet’s age distribution,
which rapidly becomes younger beginning in 2028. Newer vehicles are
inherently more fuel efficient due to reduced wear and tear. Additionally, the
retirement of older vehicles also leads to a decrease in the number of
vehicles equipped with older, less fuel-efficient engines, further contributing
to emissions reductions.
Significant school bus GHG emissions reductions are observed in the ZEV
Compliance and ZESB Swap scenarios. In the ZEV Compliance scenario,
school bus GHG emissions decrease by approximately 76 percent in 2036
compared to 2023. In the ZESB Swap scenario, almost all school bus GHG
emissions are eliminated, for a total reduction of 99.4 percent by 2036.
Notably, the ZESB Swap scenario exhibits less sensitivity to the spike of MY
2022 buses because every new bus following that spike would be a ZESB. In
contrast, the ZEV Compliance scenario follows the ACT rule sales fractions,
and thus takes longer to adopt ZESBs into the fleet.

2023-2036
Current Fuel ZESB Swap
Mix
54

NOx emissions from school buses also decline across all scenarios, as
illustrated in Figure 15. In the Current Fuel Mix scenario, school bus NOx
emissions decrease by approximately 5 percent over the fourteen-year
horizon. This relatively small reduction for NOx is likely due to the fleet
remaining primarily diesel-powered and replacement buses using the same
technology as retiring buses, as many NOx control technologies have been
standard for some time.64
School bus NOx emissions decline in the ZEV Compliance scenario by
approximately 75 percent and in the ZESB Swap scenario by 98.7 percent by
2036. This decline is primarily associated with a decline in on-road internal
combustion engine activity as more ZESBs are adopted. ZESBs with diesel
heaters would still emit some NOx, but the overall reduction in on-road
engine fuel consumption resulting from ZESB conversion outweighs this
effect.
Figure 15. School Bus NOx Emissions (MT) by Fleet Replacement Scenario,
2023-2036
Current Fuel ZESB Swap
Mix
School bus VOC emissions decline in all scenarios, as shown in Figure 16.
Following a similar pattern as the other pollutants, Current Fuel Mix school
bus VOC emissions decrease slightly (about 7 percent by 2036) as the fleet’s
age distribution shifts. ZEV Compliance school bus emissions decrease by 73
percent, and ZESB Swap emissions decrease by 98 percent by 2036.
64 Note that this analysis was conducted with MOVES3.1, which was published prior to the finalization of the EPA’s final
heavy duty NOx rule. See: “Control of Air Pollution from New Motor Vehicles: Heavy Duty Engine and Vehicle
Standards,” EPA, December 20, 2022, https://www.epa.gov/system/files/documents/2023-01/new-motor-veh-air-
poll-control-hd-eng-veh-stnd-frm-2022-12-20.pdf.

Diesel engines are known to produce higher levels of particulate matter
emissions compared to other fuel types. On-road diesel-powered vehicles
such as school buses must by law be fitted with catalytic converters and
particulate filters to mitigate these pollutants. However, diesel heater exhaust
systems on ZESBs are not subject to the same regulations as on-road diesel
engines, and therefore emit considerably higher pollution per gallon of fuel
burned.
In the Current Fuel Mix scenario, PM2.5 and PM10 emissions from school buses
(Figure 17 and Figure 18) hardly change over the fourteen-year analysis
horizon, as emissions control technology for these pollutants does not
change and diesel heater proliferation does not change.
In the ZEV Compliance scenario, school bus PM2.5 and PM10 emissions both
decline by 28 percent and 42 percent, respectively by 2036. In the ZESB Swap
scenario, school bus PM2.5 and PM10 emissions reduce substantially by 50
percent and 67 percent, respectively by 2036. Emission reductions for both
pollutants result from the elimination of running, idling, and starting exhaust
emissions associated with conventional vehicle operations. These emissions
savings outweigh any potential increase in emissions from the use of diesel
heaters on ZESBs during winter months.

To underscore the point made in the Section 4.4.1, these school bus
emissions results are only representative of emissions from school buses
under various scenarios for school bus electrification. They do not represent
the impacts of a potential ZESB incentive program in the presence of the ACT
rule.
4.4.3 Health Impact Analysis Results
The potential health impacts from school bus emissions on human health
were estimated across the three fleet replacement scenarios using the US
EPA’s CO-Benefits Risk Assessment Health Impacts Screening and Mapping
Tool (COBRA). COBRA uses a series of health impact functions developed
57

from the latest public health literature to estimate how a change in outdoor
air quality results in incidences of a variety of health outcomes.
COBRA’s health impact estimates are relative to a COBRA baseline, which is
the estimated total mass quantity of an emitted pollutant (i.e., NOx) in a
given year for all on-road vehicles.65 COBRA provides upper- and lower-
bound estimates of changes in incidence of specific health outcomes, and
provides the median values for a selection of six health impact indicators,
which are included in Table 17.
The COBRA results presented in Table 17 illustrate the cumulative change in
health impacts resulting from the change in school bus emissions in the ZESB
Swap scenario from 2023-2036.66 The COBRA results for the other two fleet
replacement scenarios exhibit fewer changes in health outcome incidences
than the ZESB Swap scenario, and are not included in the table. It should be
noted that the COBRA results do not consider the incidence of school bus
emissions on more vulnerable school-age people.
Most of the health outcome values have a cumulative impact of less than
one over the fourteen-year analysis horizon. School buses represent a small
portion of the total on-road transportation emissions inventory for the
Commonwealth of Massachusetts, thus the health impacts due to a change
in school bus emissions is limited.
65 “COBRA Questions and Answers,” EPA, June 7, 2023, https://www.epa.gov/cobra/cobra-questions-and-answers.
The COBRA baseline utilizes data from the National Emissions Inventory (developed by the US EPA). State agencies,
including the MassDEP, regularly prepare emissions inventories and submit them to be included in this national
inventory.
66 Normally, negative COBRA results indicate an increase in incidence and positive values indicate a decrease. The
signs have been inverted this table for ease of reading.

Again, it should be noted that the school bus health impact results should
not be interpreted as indicative of the interactions from a potential ZESB
incentive program and the ACT rule given this study did not incorporate the
health impacts from all medium and heavy duty vehicles subject to the ACT
rule.
4.4.4 Equitable Distribution of Air Quality Benefits from
ZESBs
A transition to ZESBs will involve some fossil fuel-powered school buses being
replaced with ZESBs before others, and this has implications regarding how
and to whom the benefits will be distributed. As mentioned in Section 1.3,
approximately 60 percent of low-income students take a school bus to
school. Given the high capital costs of a transition to ZESBs, it is foreseeable
that under-resourced school districts will be among the last to be served by
this new technology.
An incentive program will influence the distribution of air quality benefits.
Incorporating equity metrics into an incentive program would provide
insights into the scale of this air quality impact and could be used to ensure
program implementation was not creating an inequitable distribution of
benefits or worsening existing inequities.
Options for defining potential beneficiaries, who are currently disadvantaged,
under an equity metric include:
59

 Communities with school districts that rank highly on DESE’s equity
scale.67
 Communities with poor air quality, contingent on the availability of
relevant data.
 Communities with high proportions of Environmental Justice (EJ)
populations.68
Detailed air quality modeling is unlikely to be practical to inform program
implementation decisions. However, potential proxies for assigning where
environmental benefits are occurring include:
 The routes served by incentivized ZESBs.
 The school districts served by incentivized ZESBs.
 The garaging locations of incentivized ZESBs.
5.0 Recommendations for a Statewide Incentive
Program
5.1 Background on Incentive Structures
Incentive programs designed to support the adoption of ZEVs can be
structured in various forms. Background information on financial incentive
program types can be found below:
 Grant programs involve interested candidates developing applications
and making financial awards to the applicants based on evaluation
against a set of criteria. Grant awards can be customized based on the
applicant’s needs and the awardee typically pays the full upfront
capital cost before getting reimbursed by the grant award. Grants
sometimes provide some personalized technical assistance to
67 DESE has an existing equity framework that stratifies school districts into 12 categories based on the percentage of
residents that are eligible for state assistance, such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program or
MassHealth. Category 12 represents the districts with the greatest share of residents eligible for state assistance.
68 See for the Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs (EEA) definition of an EJ population:

https://www.mass.gov/doc/environmental-justice-policy6242021-update/download.
60

awardees because the program administrator learns about the
applicant’s specific fleet and needs in their application.
 Voucher programs apply a discount immediately at purchase to lower
the upfront costs for the purchaser. While an application to receive a
voucher may be required, vouchers can also be automatic. Vouchers
are typically at a flat rate and not customizable to the purchaser.
 Rebate programs are similar to vouchers but typically involve a post-
purchase reimbursement, thus requiring the purchaser to pay the full
upfront capital of the approved purchase. Rebates can also be
structured to be provided at the point-of-sale, which would lower the
sticker price of the purchase and not involve a reimbursement.
 Use-based incentive programs pay the user a set amount based on
their usage rate, such as a payment per every mile driven on a ZEV.
This type of incentive could reduce net operating costs and encourage
the use of ZEVs after their purchase.
Desirable attributes for a ZEV incentive program would typically include those
in Table 18 below.

5.2 Existing State and Federal Regulations and Programs
Relevant to ZESBs
There are existing regulations relevant to and incentive programs available
to potential purchasers of ZESBs in Massachusetts. The presence of these
existing programs, outlined below, has important implications for decisions
about providing additional statewide incentives.
THE ADVANCED CLEAN TRUCK RULE (ACT RULE)
As previously discussed in Section 4.0, the ACT rule is a medium and heavy
duty ZEV sales requirement that applies to OEMs that certify vehicles for sale
in Massachusetts in weight classes 2B through 8. OEMs can accumulate
credits for ZEV sales and will incur deficits for each non-ZEV sold in
Massachusetts starting in MY 2025.69 OEMs are considered compliant when
the credits they purchase or generate through ZEV or near-zero-emission
69 MassDEP, “Background Document on Emergency Regulation Amendments to 310 CMR 7.40.”
62

vehicle (NZEV) sales equal their deficits within a reporting year per regulatory
class.
If a manufacturer does not meet the ACT rule sales percentage
requirements, they have one model year to make up their deficit or else be
subject to a continued penalty until compliant. The penalty is approximately
$20,000 per vehicle.70 Due to the high penalty cost and high cost of medium
and heavy duty ZEVs, it is anticipated that OEMs will collectively meet but not
exceed the sales percentage requirements.
EPA CLEAN SCHOOL BUS PROGRAM (CSB)
The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) of 2021 authorized the EPA
to administer the Clean School Bus (CSB) Program, which totals $5 billion in
funding available for the replacement of diesel school buses with zero and
low emission school buses through Federal Fiscal Years (FFYs) 2022-2026.71
The first iteration of the CSB was the 2022 CSB Rebate program, which
provided funding for both the full cost of a zero-emission or clean school bus
(up to $375,000) and the cost of an L2 charger (up to $20,000).72 The 2022
CSB Rebate program structure allowed recipients to access funding quickly,
via a streamlined application process and website.
In the first round of the 2022 CSB Rebate program, five Massachusetts entities
received funding as shown in Error! Reference source not found.. The 2022
CSB Rebate awards in Massachusetts amount to $29,535,000 for 75 ZESBs. Of
note, none of these awards included propane or CNG-powered buses, which
were an option for funding.73

MASSCEC ACT SCHOOL BUS PROGRAM
The Massachusetts Clean Energy Center (MassCEC) operates the
Accelerating Clean Transportation (ACT) School Bus program. This program
was designed to complement the EPA’s CSB program and is deploying $23.3
million in funding for school bus electrification in the Commonwealth. ACT
School Bus provides two opportunities for support: advisory services and fleet
deployment.75
The advisory services program component offers free ZESB electrification
planning services. This opportunity does not provide funding to purchase a
ZESB, but rather to help public school districts and private school bus fleet
operators prepare for future funding opportunities, perform feasibility studies
and financial modeling, and develop vehicle and charging station
procurement plans.
The first round of the 2022 fleet deployment services program component
offered selected school bus fleets up to $2 million in flexible funding for ZESBs
and associated infrastructure, as well as consulting services to assist with
procurement, data collection, and future electrification planning. Table 21

awardees. Notably, the first round of the ACT deployment funding awardees
mirrored the Massachusetts awardees of the EPA CSB program, with the
addition of Quincy Public Schools. The advisory services program selection
and project launch commenced in Summer 2023. Meanwhile, the application
window for Round 2 of the fleet deployment funding closes in January 2024.

DOER MOR-EV TRUCKS PROGRAM
The Massachusetts Offers Rebates for Electric Vehicles (MOR-EV) Trucks
Program is a statewide ZEV program funded by DOER and administered by
the Center for Sustainable Energy (CSE). The program offers rebates for both
purchase and lease of qualifying ZEVs, including eligible ZESBs.
The rebate values, shown in Table 22, are designated by vehicle class and
follow a declining value as rebate blocks are exhausted. School bus
purchasers can apply to the MOR-EV Trucks program to reserve a rebate
through a voucher system prior to purchasing or leasing. This reservation
system ensures that funding is available for up to 12 months once applicants
are approved. After the purchase or lease is finalized, a rebate of up to
$90,000 can be claimed.77 Of note, this program cannot be used in
combination with any other Massachusetts provided or managed funding.

MASSEVIP
MassDEP administers the Massachusetts Electric Vehicle Incentive Program
(MassEVIP) Workplace & Fleet Charging Incentives, which currently provides
funding to cover up to 60 percent of the cost of L1 and L2 EV charging
stations. The maximum allowed incentive amount is $50,000 per street
address for hardware and installation costs.79 MassEVIP will not fund
installation costs for projects funded through the utility programs described
below but will cover equipment costs.80
INVESTOR-OWNED UTILITY PROGRAMS
In Massachusetts, certain utilities offer “make-ready” electric charging
programs, covering the costs on the utility side of the electric meter. On
December 30, 2022, DPU approved EV programs for the following regulated
electric companies: National Grid with a budget of $206 million, Eversource
with a budget of $188 million, and Unitil with a budget of $998,000.81 Both

National Grid and Eversource have developed their approved programs,
while Unitil has yet to do so at the time of writing. The DPU ruling requires that
eligible entities apply for other available and eligible state and federal
funding opportunities prior to seeking utility program funding. The following
utility programs are currently available for school bus fleets:
National Grid
National Grid administers the Fleet EV Charging Program that provides up to
100 percent of utility-side L2 and DCFC costs, up to $6,700 for customer-side
costs, and provides charger rebates for public fleet charging stations.82
Additionally, their Fleet Advisory Service Program offers complementary
assistance to public fleets, including electrification planning.83 The incentive
amounts are highest for Environmental Justice (EJ) communities and eligible
applicants must be National Grid customers, including municipal, school bus,
public transit, and state and federal government fleets.
Eversource
Eversource offers the EV Charging Rebate program for Massachusetts fleets,
including school bus fleets, which provides up to 100 percent of utility-side
costs to install EV chargers, up to $6,700 for customer-side costs, and
charger rebates for L2 and DCFC charging station equipment costs.84
Incentive amounts are highest for EJ communities. Eligible applicants must
be Eversource customers. Eversource has developed a fleet advisory service
offering that is currently limited to public fleets.
5.3 Incentive Structure Recommendations
1. OBJECTIVE OF INCENTIVE
If the underlying objective is to increase overall numbers of zero emission
heavy duty vehicles or to maximize total GHG and other emissions reduction,
an incentive program for ZESBs may not have the intended effect.
82 “Fleet Electric Vehicle Charging Program,” National Grid, August 2023,

application.pdf?sfvrsn=85cdcd62_4.
67

If the ACT rule is effective at driving ZEV sales up to the specified sales
percentages, an incentive is likely to shift the balance of ZEV sales within the
regulated vehicle classes in favor of school buses and away from other ZEVs,
resulting in more ZESB sales but fewer sales of other types of ZEVs in
Massachusetts. This is because the extra ZEV credits enabled by a ZESB
incentive can be purchased by other OEMs to satisfy their ACT rule sales
percentage obligations in lieu of producing additional ZEVS. There is a risk
that an incentive would create no additional ZEV sales.
While modeling the net emissions outcomes across all classes of vehicles
regulated by the ACT rule falls outside the scope of this report’s analysis,
adding a new incentive in the presence of the ACT rule carries the theoretical
possibility of emissions increases, if selling more ZESBs results in fewer sales
of other ZEVs, depending on the relative miles traveled and emissions control
technologies between the fossil fuel school buses replaced and the fossil fuel
vehicles whose replacement is forgone.85
Given the large opportunity cost of a program that financially supports the
adoption of ZESBs, the legislature may wish to consider using these resources
for other initiatives that would reduce emissions without these policy
interactions (i.e., sources not subject to regulated sales requirements).
However, if the priority is to ensure emission reductions and/or ZEV sales occur
specifically in school bus fleets and foregone emission reductions from other
medium and heavy duty vehicles are not a concern, an incentive program for
ZESBs could be used to achieve this. This would result in the benefits of medium
and heavy duty vehicle electrification being somewhat more targeted at the
people and areas currently impacted by emissions from fossil fuel-powered
school buses.
85 Older diesel-powered vehicles typically emit more pollutants compared to their newer counterparts. For example,
MOVES3.1 estimates that a Class 7 MY 1993 diesel vehicle emits nearly nine times more NOx per mile (0.0219 kg/mi)
than a Class 7 MY 2023 diesel vehicle (0.00237 kg/mi).
68

2. EQUITY
If a ZESB incentive is established, the associated program should monitor
awards and adjust as needed to ensure that disadvantaged school districts are
being awarded at or above the same rate as other school districts.
It is recommended that a ZESB incentive program adopts an equity framework
based on school district population metrics. If school buses are being prioritized
for electrification to reduce school children’s exposure to school bus air
pollutants, then using a school district population-based equity framework is in
alignment with that program’s objective.
3. BUDGET REQUIREMENTS
If an incentive program were to be introduced to support a transition to ZESBs, it
would need access to a significant budget over multiple years because the
additional costs to transition Massachusetts’ school bus fleet are high relative to
conventional technologies. For example, if a program was designed to fund the
incremental capital cost and every school bus was replaced on its normal
replacement cycle by a ZESB starting in 2023, this program would require
approximately $5.4 billion, leading to a 99.4 percent fleet transition by
approximately 2036.86
Moreover, the amount of expenditure in a given timeframe would most likely
increase with a more aggressive speed of fleet transition. If the fleet
transition goal was targeted for 2030, for example, the program may require
a greater annual budget compared to a scenario with a later targeted
transition date to motivate school bus owners to accelerate adoption.
4. PROGRAM SCALABILITY
If a new ZESB incentive is developed, the program should have a scalable
structure for adjusting incentive amounts to accommodate changes in the
school bus vehicle and charging market, such as evolving technology costs,
school bus purchase price sensitivities, and changes in federal incentives.
86 It is a common practice for incentive programs to fund incremental costs, however this does not guarantee a
particular level of sales. Notably, the 2022 EPA Clean School Bus Rebate Program provided funding amounts for the
school bus and associated charging infrastructure that covered more than the incremental cost.
69

5. ADMINISTRATIVE SIMPLICITY
If a ZESB incentive was introduced, consideration should be given to
delivering all state support for ZESB adopters via a single mechanism,
whether it is derived from existing or newly developed interventions. This
would streamline the application process for school bus operators, enabling
them to access both financial and technical support through a unified
administrative structure and coordinate with a single point of contact.
There is already a relatively complex landscape of programs that are
targeted at or available to ZESB purchasers in Massachusetts. Adding an
additional program would increase the compliance burden for applicants,
causing applicants interested in various programs to navigate through
multiple sets of eligibility criteria, application processes, and performance
requirements. Applicants would also need to understand and make tradeoffs
between different funding sources where they were “non-stackable” or
require separate approvals before starting a project in cases where they
were stackable.
Moreover, introducing a new ZESB incentive program within the current policy
environment would further diffuse government interventions supporting ZESB
adoption and increase the challenge of determining which programs are
effective and how to improve individual programs.
6. AGE-BASED INCENTIVE
If a ZESB incentive is created, to minimize unintended consequences
associated with interactions with the ACT rule, it is recommended to include
a scrappage requirement targeting the oldest and most polluting school
buses as a condition for a ZESB incentive program.
7. PRIVATE AND PUBLIC ELIGIBILITY
If a ZESB incentive is developed, it is recommended that the program be
accessible to both public and private entities who undertake the activity that
confers eligibility for receiving an incentive (i.e., purchasing a school bus to
provide transportation service in Massachusetts).
