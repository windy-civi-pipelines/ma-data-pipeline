Introduction
Labor and Workforce Development (EOLWD) regarding the comprehensive modernization and transformation for “the
deployment of an online delivery system for unemployment insurance compensation benefits.” In addition to focusing on
unemployment, EOLWD has continued its focus on post-pandemic and long-term re-employment goals to provide the
workforce and employers of Massachusetts with a seamless and efficient job-loss-to-job-gain experience. EOLWD is
thankful to the Legislature for providing the funding to enable EOLWD to achieve the following goals:
• Provide outstanding service to the workforce and businesses of MA: Provide an improved customer
experience that is accessible to all, delivers timely and accurate benefits, is compliant with the law, is available
online, by phone, and in person, and uses taxpayer money efficiently.
• Be a national leader: Be among top performing states measured by the US Department of Labor on federal
performance measures in providing services to the workforce including timely and high-quality services,
accessibility, and equity.
• Operate efficiently and ensure program integrity: Ensure that benefits are being disbursed for eligible and
legitimate unemployment claims and eliminate ineffective or unnecessary business processes to improve
streamlined service to customers.
• Provide accurate, timely and responsive reporting: Ensure that data is accurate and provided timely, flexibly
responding to stakeholder needs and inquiries.

testing for compliance, quality, accessibility, and usability ensures a prepared system is ready for Massachusetts workers
and employers.
During the third calendar quarter of 2024, development and configuration of the new system continued to ensure
compliance with all state and federal laws and regulations. Additionally, a new Accessibility vendor was procured to
provide accessibility testing services to the project team. The Accessibility vendor was onboarded and initial rounds of
accessibility testing began in September, the goal of which is to validate that all web content meets accessibility
guidelines. Usability testing also began in September. Usability testing is being conducted to validate the user experience
and make sure the new system is easy to use for DUA customers. Four rounds of Usability testing were planned, with
testing scheduled to finish in November. The business testing phase began as scheduled on September 30th. During the
business testing phase, DUA employees test the functionality of the new system to make sure it is working as expected.
Business testing is scheduled to continue into March 2025.
Progress on Accessibility and Engagement with the Advisory Council
EOLWD appreciates the input and collaboration with the Advisory Council regarding accessibility for the unemployment
benefits system. EOLWD continues to meet with the Advisory Council every other week throughout the initiative. The
Advisory Council continues to provide EOLWD with input and EOLWD continues to address and incorporate input from
the Advisory Council regarding accessibility and equity. Advisory Council members were provided with the opportunity
to review and provide feedback on the accessibility procurement prior to its publication. All Advisory Council members
were also offered the opportunity to participate in Usability testing. A number of the Council members participated in
Usability testing and their input has been valuable.
