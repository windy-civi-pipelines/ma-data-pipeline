RE: March 2025 Certification of MBTA Base Sales Tax Revenues for Fiscal Year 2026
Dear Secretary Gorzkowicz and Secretary Tibbits-Nutt:
Pursuant to M.G.L. c. 10, § 35T, this letter certifies for Fiscal Year 2026 the MBTA Base Sales
Tax Revenue. This certification was done in consultation with the Department of Revenue. The
details of the calculations are shown in the table below.
Base Sales Tax Revenue: The base revenue amount for Fiscal Year 2026 is calculated by
multiplying the base revenue amount for the prior fiscal year by the change in the calendar
year 2024 consumer price index for all urban consumers for the Boston metropolitan area as
determined by the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the United States Department of Labor. This
figure is then compared to the percent increase in gross sales tax revenues received pursuant
to M.G.L. c. 64H and M.G.L. c. 64I for the same period. The calendar year 2024 “gross sales
tax revenues” is defined as sales tax receipts by taxpayers from nonexempt sales, less amounts
abated, refunded, or reimbursed.
Pursuant to Section 35T, if the calendar year 2024 inflation rate is greater than 3.000%, the
Fiscal Year 2026 base revenue will be 3.000%, regardless of the increase in calendar year 2024
gross sales tax revenue. The calendar year 2024 inflation rate was 3. 178%; therefore, the base
sales tax revenue growth rate for Fiscal Year 2026 is 3.000%. The table on the next page
presents the calculation of the base revenue amount.
