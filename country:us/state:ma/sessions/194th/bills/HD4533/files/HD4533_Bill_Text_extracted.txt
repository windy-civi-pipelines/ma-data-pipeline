Acorn Innovation Fund Report (FY25 Cohort)
enabled by the Legislature: “shall be used to advance the goals of job growth creation, innovation
and economic development which may include, but shall not be limited to, the construction of
prototypes, testing, market research and other steps necessary to bring the invention or concept
to market in the commonwealth.” The Acorn Innovation Fund supports principal investigators
(faculty, graduate students and post-doctoral students) at Massachusetts research institutions
(universities and medical centers) who seek to demonstrate the viability of their technology and
advance them towards commercial use. Awards can be used to: 1) further develop a prototype,
2) gather additional data to demonstrate proof of concept, or 3) obtain data to compare the
technology to existing technologies and show its competitive advantages. Several past Acorn
Innovation grant winners have gone on to spinning out startups based on their inventions and
have raised outside capital.
Here is the program summary re applications, reviewers and results for the past 8 years. Note:
During 2021, MassVentures ran the Acorn program for both the FY21 and FY22 Cohorts on behalf
of the Massachusetts Technology Transfer Center (MTTC) which was then housed at University
of Massachusetts.
MassVentures has been actively working to increase the UMass applications by working with the
UMass’s and the Executive Office of Economic Development.

Acorn Innovation Fund Report (FY25 Cohort)
FY25 Details:
Ten grants of $36,000 each, for a total of $360,000, were awarded to faculty researchers from
UMass Chan Medical School; the University of Massachusetts at Amherst; Massachusetts
Institute of Technology; Northeastern University, Tufts University; and WPI to assist them in
testing the viability of their technologies and potentially bringing their research to market.
Selected by a group of 47 external industry expert reviewers from the field of 35 applicants, the
recipients were chosen based on their written proposal and a 3 minute video submitted by each
applicant, demonstrating their project’s technical merit, commercial viability, project plan and
strength of team. Eight of the projects selected are therapeutics, diagnostics or life sciences
categories like cellular agriculture, such as hypoxia resistant first-in-class small molecules that
reprogram electron flow in the mitochondrial electron transport chain, to innovative
biochemical-based cell regulation techniques that accelerate granulation rates and sustain
granule formation and a pet food ingredient based on cultivated insect cells (CICs), representing
a marriage between the two leading alternative protein sources for pet food. Two of the projects
are advanced materials or sensor and AI physical sciences based such as technology that
transforms wet organic waste into a negative-emission mineral which can directly reduce the
embodied carbon of the construction and waste management industries or an advanced
spectrofluorometer employing machine learning for early detection of Harmful Algal Blooms.
FY25 recipients of the MassVentures Acorn Innovation Fund awards are as follows:
Jessica Spinelli PhD; UMass Chan Medical School
Novel molecular tools to reprogram the electron transport chain - Developed first-in-class small
molecules that reprogram electron flow in the mitochondrial electron transport chain. These
molecules deliver electrons to fumarate, instead of oxygen, enabling mitochondrial function
without oxygen present. Treating mice with these novel compounds makes them resistant to
hypoxia such as happens during heart attack or stroke.
Chul Park PhD and Joseph Gikonyo PhD; University of Massachusetts Amherst
Bioengineered Granulation to Catalyze Sustainable and Carbon-neutral Wastewater Treatment
Worldwide - Microbial granulation can play a crucial role in densifying and decarbonizing
wastewater treatment and promote greater access to wastewater treatment worldwide. Yet,
granulation is not a spontaneous process and is challenging to sustain. Their technology involves

Acorn Innovation Fund Report (FY25 Cohort)
innovative biochemical-based cell regulation techniques that accelerate granulation rates and
sustain granule formation.
Gregory Pazour PhD; UMass Chan Medical School
TACSTD2 Therapy for Polycystic Kidney Disease - Polycystic kidney disease is a leading cause of
kidney failure, but treatment options are limited to an expensive mediocre drug. They propose
to develop therapy using antibody drug conjugates to deliver anti-proliferative drugs to cystic
epithelium. This is expected to reduce cyst expansion and prevent the progression to kidney
failure.
S Thayumanavan PhD and Ryan Lu PhD Candidate; University of Massachusetts Amherst
Combating Resistance of NSCLC via Extracellular Protein Degradation by PolyTACs - They have
created a new approach to specifically degrade membrane proteins in cancer cells. This ability
provides a unique therapeutic opportunity for non-small cell lung cancer, which currently suffers
from poor prognosis due to resistance development.
Yubing Sun PhD and Beatriz Martinez-Martin Graduate Student; University of Massachusetts
Amherst
Advanced brain organoid models for neurological drug discovery and toxicology - They have
developed a micro-engineered device (US patent pending) for generating regionalized neural
organoids, stem cell-derived 3D models that mimic human brain structures and functions. They
aim to use this technology to develop multiple disease models for preclinical drug discovery and
environmental toxin screening.
Qinmin Zheng PhD and Andrew Whittle, Sc.D; Massachusetts Institute of Technology
Novel Spectrofluorometer and Machine Learning for Online Early Detection of Harmful Algal
Blooms - They are developing REMORA, an advanced spectrofluorometer employing machine
learning for early detection of Harmful Algal Blooms. Using a unique flow-cell design with fiber
optic light delivery, it enables superior detection and discrimination of algal groups. REMORA
offers accurate, cost-effective, in-situ monitoring for proactive water quality management.
Leanne Chukoskie PhD and Sundararaman Rengarajan PhD Candidate; Northeastern University
A sensor-integrated and gamified decision support tool to minimize blood glucose variability
- Sugar Slay is an app-based decision support tool for adolescents and young adults with Type 1
1075 Main Street, Suite 100, Waltham, MA 02451
Acorn Innovation Fund Report (FY25 Cohort)
Diabetes. The app uses sensors and gamified supports to help users discover their individual
glucose management trends and build stronger habits to minimize glucose variability and
maximize independent diabetes management and healthy lifestyle choices.
Carolyn Lee-Parsons PhD and Lauren Cole-Osborn PhD; Northeastern University
Elite CRISPR-edited Periwinkle Plants for Production of Chemotherapeutics - The Madagascar
Periwinkle plant is the only source of the chemotherapeutic vincristine. To enhance supply of
vincristine, they will use CRISPR to generate gene-edited plants with elevated concentrations of
the precursors to vincristine. They have proof-of-concept data and a pending patent for building
their prototype as the next step.
David Kaplan PhD; Tufts University
Cultivated Insect Cells for Pet Food Ingredients - Farmed animal products present challenges for
pet food manufacturers with regards to environmental sustainability goals, food safety, and
supply chain resiliency. Their proposed innovation is a pet food ingredient based on cultivated
insect cells (CICs), representing a marriage between the two leading alternative protein sources
for pet food.
Andrew Teixeira PhD and David Kenney Research Fellow; WPI
Unlocking Carbon-Negative Concrete with Municipal Solid Waste - Cement and concrete are the
central focus for industrial decarbonization efforts. Their unique technology transforms wet
organic waste into a negative-emission mineral which can directly reduce the embodied carbon
of the construction and waste management industries. Waste allows for a distributed production
of a drop-in concrete additive for widespread adoption.
