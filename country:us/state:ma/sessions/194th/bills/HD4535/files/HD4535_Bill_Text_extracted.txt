Dear Clerks Hurley and Carroll:
The Attorney General’s Fair Labor Division is pleased to submit this report on enforcement
actions and violation trends within the construction industry, pursuant to our Wage
Enforcement line item 0810-0045 of the FY25 General Appropriations Act.
Enforcement Actions & Violation Trends
In calendar year 2024, the Division issued 179 citations against 85 construction companies for
violating state wage and hour, misclassification, and prevailing wage laws. As a part of these and
other enforcement actions, more than 1,167 employees will receive over $1.1 million in
restitution and the companies will pay $587,000 in penalties to the General Fund. Construction
was the second most cited industry in 2024, representing 16 percent of all enforcement. The
violations with the highest assessments were failure to pay overtime compensation
($404,857.08), failure to make timely payment ($339,812.06), failure to pay prevailing wage
($292,437.57), and misclassification as independent contractor ($165,750.00).
The Division issued 22 letters to state and local awarding authorities, notifying them of
prevailing wage violations that occurred on their construction projects. The Division of
Capital Asset Management and Maintenance's Certification Unit was copied on each
letter.
Additionally, the Division made 103 payroll fraud referrals to the Massachusetts Council on the
Underground Economy and other agencies to investigate and combat insurance fraud and tax
evasion by unscrupulous employers.
Please contact James McCarthy in the Policy & Government Relations Division at (617) 963-
2348 with any questions.
