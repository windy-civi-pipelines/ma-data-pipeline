Re: An Analysis of Health Safety Net Patients, Providers, and Services
Dear Governor Healey and Commonwealth Leaders:
Pursuant to Chapter 12A of the Massachusetts General Laws and Section 231 of Chapter 140 of
the Acts of 2024, enclosed please find the Office of the Inspector General’s (OIG) 2025 annual report on
public healthcare, An Analysis of Health Safety Net Patients, Providers, and Services.
Office of the Inspector General for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts 2 | P age
Over the past year, the OIG’s Healthcare Division (HCD) has taken a deep dive into the
Commonwealth’s Health Safety Net (HSN) program. In this report, you will find a wealth of demographic
and statistical information on HSN patients, providers, and services rendered from 2019 through 2023.
Why did the HCD collect and analyze this data? For a simple reason: to show policymakers and the public
how the hundreds of millions of dollars spent annually on HSN services are actually allocated.
Beyond demonstrating how the money is spent, the numbers presented herein also inform
foundational elements of the HSN program. The data speaks to questions that stakeholders, including
program sponsors and funders, should be asking, such as:

Section 2:
1. Is the HSN program serving the right individuals?

Section 3:
2. Are HSN patients receiving the right services?

Section 4:
3. Does the HSN program deliver those services at a reasonable cost?

Section 5:
4. Is the HSN program achieving expected outcomes?
This report draws upon the expertise of the OIG’s data analytics team, which aggregated the HSN
data into the comprehensive format set forth in the following pages. While data on virtually any topic is
readily available in 2025, it is only helpful when it is organized in easily accessible ways. The HCD believes
that the tables and charts produced in this report are approachable and digestible. I am confident that
these visualizations can provide insight into a host of matters related to the HSN and its future direction.
I created the HCD in 2023 to examine Massachusetts Medicaid (MassHealth) and the HSN
program, as well as to review a wide range of public healthcare policy, delivery, and access issues. Through
its oversight role, the HCD identifies potential programmatic vulnerabilities within MassHealth and the
HSN and develops recommendations for improving internal controls and practices. This work furthers the
HCD’s mission of preventing fraud, waste, and abuse of public funds in these public healthcare systems.
In years past, the HCD issued one annual report summarizing its work for the year. Going forward,
the HCD will issue reports as its work is completed so that our conclusions and recommendations can be
disseminated to stakeholders sooner. We will continue to mine data and present it in constructive ways
to communicate our findings.
For now, I encourage stakeholders, including the Executive Office of Health and Human Services
and its child agencies, to take advantage of the information in this report. The data can serve as a valuable
tool as the Commonwealth works to allocate limited resources in ways that provide impact and effectively
deliver intended results.
I want to thank the many contributors to this report, especially Gregory Matthews, Director of the
Healthcare Division. I also extend my appreciation to Deputy Inspector General Susanne O’Neil; OIG Legal
Counsel Eugenia Carris; Alyssa Tasha, Elizabeth Lazar, and Stephen Gerry of the OIG’s Data Analytics
Division; senior executive assistant Nataliya Urciuoli; and the OIG’s communications and publications
teams.
Office of the Inspector General for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts 3 | P age
Please contact the HCD Director, Gregory Matthews, or me if you have any questions about this
report or the OIG’s Healthcare Division. I look forward to a continuing dialogue on the optimal use of our
healthcare dollars.
Sincerely,
Jeffrey S. Shapiro, Esq., CIG

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The Commonwealth’s Health Safety Net (HSN) pays for medically necessary services provided by
Massachusetts community health centers (CHCs) and acute hospitals (AHs) to uninsured or underinsured
Massachusetts residents with a modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) at or below 300% of the federal
poverty level, regardless of citizenship or immigration status.1 AHs are hospitals “licensed under M.G.L. c.
111, § 51 that contain a majority of medical-surgical, pediatric, obstetric, and maternity beds, as defined
by the Department of Public Health [DPH].”2 CHCs are licensed as freestanding clinics by DPH and operate
in conformance with federal law, providing primary health services such as family medicine, internal
medicine, pediatrics, obstetrics, gynecology, diagnostic laboratory and radiologic services, preventive
health services, emergency medical services, and pharmaceutical services.3 CHCs also provide referrals to
medical and health-related services, patient case management, and services that enable individuals to use
the health center, such as outreach and transportation services.
The mission of the OIG’s Healthcare Division (HCD) is to identify programmatic vulnerabilities
within the HSN and MassHealth and develop recommendations for improving internal controls and
practices to prevent fraud, waste, and abuse of public funds in these public healthcare systems.
For the HCD to effectively fulfill its oversight responsibilities for the HSN program and to conduct
future HSN reviews on issues such as potential vulnerabilities, funding and provider reimbursements,
access to services, accuracy of surcharge payments, and hospital bad debt, it is necessary to first
understand the scope and utilization of the HSN program. The OIG’s HCD therefore initiated an extensive
review of the HSN program to examine the demographic composition of the low-income patient
population who received medical, dental, and pharmaceutical services from 2019 through 2023. As
reflected in this report, this analysis provides insights on longitudinal trends in HSN services and utilization
patterns for different types and frequencies of services. Within this scope, the HCD identified how HSN
funds are used to pay for medical, dental, and pharmaceutical services rendered to uninsured or
underinsured Massachusetts residents who are eligible for HSN coverage.
The OIG's review of the HSN program found that the demographic characteristics of age and
gender cohorts remained stable over the five years examined. However, during that period there was a
sharp increase of approximately 20% in the number of Massachusetts residents whose care is paid for by

Section 6:
§330 of United States Public Law 95-626, including a Community Health Center that files a cost report as requested by the Center
for Health Information and Analysis.” The regulation specifies that such a health center must (1) be licensed as a freestanding
clinic by the Massachusetts DPH pursuant to M.G.L. c. 111, § 51; (2) meet the qualifications for certification (or provisional
certification) by MassHealth and enter into a provider agreement pursuant to 130 CMR 405.000; and (3) operate in conformance
with the requirements of 42 U.S.C. § 254b.

the HSN and who have fallen into the lowest income level measured by federal poverty levels. The review
also visually identifies regions with the highest concentration of residents who utilize the HSN for
healthcare services. This data can be cross-referenced with the number of HSN providers by region,
service location, and service type to aid healthcare policymakers in determining where additional
resources may be needed to ensure access to healthcare for low-income, uninsured, or underinsured
individuals.
The HSN review identified the most prevalent medical and dental services and procedure codes,
as well as the most common diagnosis codes for the five-year review period by gender and age. The HCD
also highlighted claim volumes and HSN payment expenditures for each category. For dental services, the
review underscored the importance of CHCs as primary providers of dental care for vulnerable low-
income residents, while also indicating areas in Massachusetts that may lack sufficient numbers of HSN
dental providers to meet the needs of residents who rely on the HSN.
The assessment of HSN pharmaceutical claims revealed that, while the majority of claims were
for cardiovascular medications, the bulk of payments were for antihyperglycemic medications, with a
notable rise in payments from 2021 and a sharper increase in 2023.
Additionally, the HCD identified 279 HSN recipients with high volumes of medical claims and
chronic conditions (“super-utilizers”). This report’s data on super-utilizers is crucial to gaining a
comprehensive understanding of the medical needs of this subgroup of HSN recipients and developing
cost-effective methods of delivering care through alternative services and programs.
The OIG believes that this in-depth review of the HSN will aid policymakers in better
understanding the needs of residents who rely on the HSN. The comprehensive overview of HSN
expenditures over the review period will also prove useful. With this report, the Executive Office of Health
and Human Services, the Health Safety Net Office, CHCs, and officials with AHs will have a valuable
demographic analysis that can guide future health delivery and program funding decisions. The OIG will
also use the findings of this report as a foundation to conduct future HSN program reviews.

BACKGROUND
I. The Office of the Inspector General
The Office of the Inspector General for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts (OIG) is a
nonpartisan, independent state agency charged with preventing and detecting fraud, waste, and abuse of
public funds and assets. Legislators created the OIG in 1981 as the first state inspector general’s office in
the country. The OIG is led by an Inspector General who is appointed by a majority vote of the Governor,
Attorney General, and State Auditor for a term of five years.4
In keeping with its broad statutory mandate, the OIG investigates allegations of fraud, waste, and
abuse in government spending. As one of its core functions, the OIG reviews programs and practices in
state agencies and municipalities to identify systemic vulnerabilities and opportunities for improvement
in the stewardship of public assets.
The OIG has a budget of approximately $10 million and a staff of around 90 employees. The OIG
has oversight of more than $120 billion in spending and the work of over 300,000 public employees across
all state and municipal public entities throughout the Commonwealth, plus suppliers, vendors,
contractors, and nonprofits that receive public funds.
II. Massachusetts Health Safety Net Program
Healthcare providers are traditionally reimbursed or paid for services by (1) out-of-pocket
payments; (2) qualified health insurance plans or individual, group, or other plans providing coverage for
healthcare services issued by an insurance company; (3) government funded insurance (e.g., Medicaid
and Medicare, or programs offered through the Massachusetts Health Connector); or (4) the Health Safety
Net program that covers the costs of medical services provided to low-income, uninsured, or underinsured
patients (see Figure 1 below).

Office of the Inspector General for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts 10 | P age
In 1985, the Massachusetts Legislature created the uncompensated care pool (UCP) with the goal
of “more equitably distributing the burden of financing uncompensated acute hospital services across all
acute hospitals . . . .”5 The purpose of the UCP was to pay for medically necessary services that acute
hospitals (AHs)6 and community health centers (CHCs)7 provided to eligible low-income, uninsured, and
underinsured patients. In addition, the UCP made reimbursements for bad debts that hospitals were
unable to recover from patients.
In 2006, the Legislature replaced the UCP with the Health Safety Net (HSN) program, funded by
the Health Safety Net Trust Fund. The purpose of the HSN program is to “maintain a healthcare safety net
by reimbursing hospitals and community health centers for a portion of the cost of reimbursable health
services provided to low-income, uninsured or underinsured residents.”8 The Division of Healthcare
Finance and Policy initially managed the HSN program, but in 2012 the Legislature transferred that
responsibility to the Office of Medicaid (MassHealth) within the Executive Office of Health and Human
Services. MassHealth created the Health Safety Net Office to oversee the HSN program.
HSN funding for provider reimbursements is derived from four sources:

Section 7:
1. Assessments on charges of AHs ($165 million);

Section 8:
2. Surcharges on payments made to institutional surcharge payers (e.g., entities and individuals,
including managed care organizations and persons enrolled in ConnectorCare, that make
payments to AHs and ambulatory surgical centers for the purchase of healthcare services,
equal to $160 million plus 50% of administration costs of the HSN program ($165 million));

Section 9:
3. Commonwealth General Fund appropriation ($16 million); and

Section 10:
4. Offset funding for uncompensated care from the Medical Assistance Trust Fund ($70 million).9
A. HSN Eligibility
The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) calculates the federal poverty level
(FPL), an annual measure of income used to determine eligibility for various federal and state assistance
programs.10 The FPL is based on household size (see Figure 2 below). It is used to assess economic needs
and is integral to the allocation of resources for healthcare, housing, food assistance, and other essential
services. The HSN program pays Massachusetts AHs and CHCs for healthcare services rendered to low-
income Massachusetts residents with household incomes at or below 300% of the FPL. Eligibility for the

B. HSN Coverage
The HSN program covers medically necessary services provided by Massachusetts AHs or CHCs.14
Services must align with those covered by MassHealth Standard.15 For recipients with a MAGI between
150% and 300% of the FPL, an annual deductible may apply. The deductible represents the portion of
healthcare costs that HSN recipients are responsible for. Both paid and unpaid bills count toward the
deductible, but only services covered by HSN contribute to it. Bills from private doctors, labs, or radiology
services do not count, even if provided within a hospital setting.16 A detailed list of eligible HSN services
provided by AHs and CHCs can be found in Appendix A.

The HSN program does not cover the following services17:

Section 11:
1. Physicians not employed by the hospital;

Section 12:
2. Ambulance services;

Section 13:
3. Lab charges not billed by an AH or CHC;

Section 14:
4. Radiology services not billed by an AH or CHC;

Section 15:
5. Durable medical equipment, except for crutches and canes provided during a medical visit;

Section 16:
6. Nonmedical services (social, educational, vocational);

Section 17:
7. Nonmedically necessary services; or

Section 18:
8. Experimental or unproven services.
C. HSN Deductible Amounts
For HSN applicants with a MAGI above 150% of the FPL, the HSN deductible is determined based
on income. The deductible amount is either the current annual cost of the lowest ConnectorCare monthly
premium ($588 as of the 2024 Member Booklet publication) or 40% of the difference between the lowest
MAGI in the applicant’s Premium Billing Family Group and 200% of the FPL, whichever is higher.18
D. HSN Medical Hardship Assistance
“Medical hardship” is a type of HSN coverage that provides assistance to residents at any income
level whose allowable medical expenses exceed a certain percentage of an individual’s or family’s income
and have become unmanageable.19 A medical hardship determination is a one-time determination and
not an ongoing eligibility category. Individuals can apply for medical hardship no more than twice within
a 12-month period. If an individual has exhausted the two HSN medical hardships within a year, they can
still receive care through (1) standard HSN coverage for eligible services; (2) MassHealth, if eligible; (3)
CHCs that provide care on a sliding scale based on income, regardless of ability to pay; or (4) hospitals with
financial assistance programs that help cover the cost of care for patients with limited incomes.
By providing financial assistance, the HSN program aims to ensure access to medically necessary
services for uninsured and underinsured low-income residents of Massachusetts, improving overall
healthcare outcomes and support for these communities.

METHODOLOGY
For this report, the OIG extracted Medicaid enrollment and HSN claims for medical, dental, and
pharmaceutical services from the MassHealth Data Warehouse20 for eligible recipients, defined as those
with:

Section 19:
1. Adjudicated HSN claims (original or adjusted) with initial service dates between January 1,
2019, and December 31, 2023; and

Section 20:
2. An active Medicaid ID during the time of service.
The primary metrics of interest include the annual number of individuals with claims, the volume
of claims, and total HSN payments from 2019 through 2023. In the case of duplicate records for a claim,
the OIG selected the most recently adjudicated version. The OIG also excluded 1,017 medical claims that
did not have service provider information.
The number of HSN recipients, claim volume, and total HSN payments were tabulated by the
following recipient demographics: age (years), race, gender, disability status, calculated percentage above
federal poverty level, and insurance status. The OIG defined non-static demographic features (i.e., income
and insurance status) based on member history data corresponding to the date of service for claim level
analyses, and the OIG summarized these characteristics over the observation year for recipient-level
analyses (see Figure 3). Due to the significant proportion of unknown responses for race status, the OIG
adjudicated these responses using data from current member/eligibility tables, and summarized race
status based on the most frequently used designation for each recipient. In addition, the analysis
categorized recipients according to which types of HSN services (medical, dental, pharmaceutical) they
received per year.
The OIG tabulated and plotted monthly, longitudinal trends for the number of Medicaid recipients
with HSN claims, total claim volume, and total HSN payments from 2019 through 2023. Descriptive
analyses of claim data were conducted separately by claim type (medical, dental, pharmaceutical) across
all years. For each claim type, the OIG summarized claim volume and total HSN payments by the following
factors: provider type, service location, primary medical diagnoses (most common), dental
services/common procedures, and treatment/medications (most common). Additionally, the OIG’s
analysis evaluated trends in HSN claim volume and payments for specific subgroups of providers, services,
and service locations, and identified the most prevalent medical diagnoses within subgroups of gender
and age.
The OIG explored geographical data to determine which regions in Massachusetts have the
highest concentration of HSN recipients, using recipients’ distinct mailing city and state as a proxy for
geographical location. This approach introduces some limitations, as mailing addresses do not always
correspond to where individuals permanently reside and addresses may not be current. In addition, the
recipient city and town data were imperfect due to missing values and incomplete or erroneous
municipality names. In a few cases, the OIG randomly assigned a city or town for Massachusetts villages

and HSN records, documents, information, and member data.

spanning more than one municipality. The analysis excluded roughly 0.05% of distinct claims with
Massachusetts mailing addresses due to missing or inaccurate city or town information. The OIG used
mailing addresses of Massachusetts medical and dental providers with at least one HSN claim from 2019
through 2023 to map their locations across the state.
Finally, the OIG identified a subset of HSN recipients with chronically high volumes of HSN medical
claims (referred to herein as “super-utilizers”) and conducted exploratory analyses to better understand
the demographic makeup of this cohort and their medical needs. The OIG classified super-utilizers as
having 25 or more medical claims per year for at least 3 consecutive years. The OIG opted to focus solely
on medical services and selected an annual claims threshold of 25 or more that was above the top 1% or
99th percentile based on the distribution of recipient HSN medical claims per year. Given the intent was
to target recipients with longstanding conditions, the OIG expanded the definition to require more than
25 medical claims per year over a period of 3 or more consecutive years to exclude individuals with acute
or transitory conditions.

RESULTS
I. Recipient Characteristics
From 2019 through 2023, the distribution of recipients by age group remained fairly consistent.
Similarly, utilization by gender also remained consistent during the review period. Overall, slightly more
than half of HSN recipients were female and the average age was approximately 41.3 years.
As for the race of HSN recipients, on average, roughly 49% of individuals did not indicate a race
or ethnicity classification. Concerning the data related to HSN recipients’ “access to insurance” (defined
as an individual’s potential to access insurance or maintain any type of insurance other than Medicare),
the OIG’s review shows that 74.1% of HSN recipients had at least one annual period where their insurance
status was unknown. The recipients of HSN represented in the “unknown” category may represent a blind
spot for stakeholders and policy experts whose healthcare policy decisions may be informed by knowing
the type of insurance coverage or level of access to insurance that HSN recipients had before becoming
HSN-eligible.
The OIG reviewed HSN recipients’ federal poverty level (FPL), the inflation-adjusted annual
measure of income used to determine eligibility for federal and state assistance programs like healthcare.
The OIG’s review of income data reflecting the FPL highlights a negative trend over the review period:
namely, that the percentage of individuals at the 0% FPL (lowest level for the date of service year) has
increased by nearly 20% since 2020.
Figure 3 displays the demographic characteristics of individuals receiving HSN services for the
years 2019 through 2023.

Figure 4 below displays the concentration of HSN recipients (individuals with at least one HSN
claim from 2019 through 2023) per 1,000 residents by Massachusetts municipality. The gradients of
shading on the map reflect the varying proportions of HSN recipients within each municipality across the
state; darker colors indicate that a region has a larger proportion of residents receiving HSN services.
Areas with the highest concentration of HSN recipients include municipalities in the Boston metro area,
Cape Cod and the islands, and Western Massachusetts.

As shown in Figure 5 below, the OIG categorized HSN recipients according to the types of service
claims (medical, dental, pharmaceutical) they received per year from 2019 through 2023. Overall, 79% of
HSN recipients had only medical claims for at least one year while roughly 33% of individuals had HSN
claims for dental services alone or in combination with other types of services.

When broken down by claim type, medical services comprised more than half of all HSN claims
and the majority of HSN payments per year, as shown in Figure 7 below.
Figure 7. Total Annual HSN Claim Volume and Payments by Claim Type (2019 – 2023).
As shown in Figures 6 and 7, in 2020 there was a prominent reduction in the number of Medicaid
members receiving HSN services, along with the volume of claims and HSN payment amounts across all
claims and by claim type (medical, dental, pharmaceutical). Figure 8 below shows how the onset of this
sharp decline occurred in mid-to-late-March 2020 (corresponding to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic)
and continued in a downward trajectory until May 2020. Following this decline, all measures steadily
rebounded during the remainder of 2020, with less prominent decreases during periods of increased
COVID-19 infection rates. Despite the upward trajectory in claim measures since early 2020, the total
monthly volume has remained below pre-COVID-19 levels across all claim types as of December 2023, as
shown in Figure 8. The reason for this trend is not readily apparent from the data reviewed; however, the
OIG can speculate that following the COVID-19 health emergency, more people qualified for MassHealth
eligibility or other forms of insurance, resulting in a reduction in HSN utilization.26
26 The Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation found that “[p]rior to the pandemic, an average of 1.76 million individuals were
enrolled in the MassHealth program each month. By April 2023, enrollment in MassHealth had grown to 2.42 million individuals,
an increase of 659,000 (38 percent).” See MassHealth Enrollment Trends: The End of Continuous Coverage & Redetermination,

Figure 9 below presents the number of provider types and service locations with HSN medical
claims, along with the total volume of medical claims and payments, over the five-year period from 2019
through 2023. Among all provider types, CHCs had the largest number of HSN claims and total payments,
followed by physicians. Outpatient hospitals and physician offices had the highest HSN claim volume and
payments for medical services as compared to other types of facility and service modalities.

27 The number of providers is defined using the unique Medicaid provider ID, while the number of sites reflects distinct provider
locations based on provider name and address. Note that the unique Medicaid identifier does not distinguish between provider
types; a unique ID may be assigned to an individual or healthcare network with multiple site locations. In addition, some
physicians may provide HSN medical services at more than one site.
28 Provider types with smaller claim volumes (less than 500) were collapsed into the “Other” category and include Qualified
Medicare Beneficiary (QMB)-only providers, dentists, audiologists, and chiropractors.
29 Service locations with smaller claim volumes (less than 1,000 claims) were collapsed into the “Other” category and include
federally qualified health centers, homes, pharmacies, homeless shelters, skilled nursing home facilities, mobile units, and nursing
facilities.

Figures 10 and 11 below display the monthly, longitudinal trends in HSN claim volume and total
payments for various types of providers and service locations with the highest number of medical claims.
In general, there was a significant reduction in the volume of HSN medical claims and total payments
coinciding with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic from mid-March through May 2020. While this
temporal reduction in HSN claims and payments is evident across the top provider categories, as shown
in Figure 10, this is not necessarily true for the provider locations and service modalities, as shown in
Figure 11. The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic had a minimal effect on the volume of inpatient hospital
HSN claims. However, the volume of medical claims and HSN payments for telehealth appointments
simultaneously rose dramatically during this period and became the predominate method for providing
services during the initial months of the pandemic. Although the volume of telehealth medical claims and
payment amounts declined in subsequent years (coinciding with the resurgence of office and outpatient
hospital claims), these metrics are still higher than the pre-COVID-19 period.
While monthly HSN claim volume and payments for medical services gradually increased following
the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, these measures have remained below their pre-COVID-19 peak
values for most types of providers and service locations and modalities.

Figure 12 below displays the service locations of Massachusetts physicians and service providers
associated with at least one HSN medical claim from 2019 through 2023, represented by the dark blue
dots on the map. The shaded areas reflect the distribution of HSN recipients across Massachusetts
municipalities, defined by the number of HSN recipients per 1,000 residents who had at least one medical
claim from 2019 through 2023.
As shown in Figure 12, the densely populated Boston metro area had the highest concentration
of HSN medical service providers and recipients, while other regions with similarly high rates of HSN
recipients had fewer service providers. This was particularly evident in Berkshire and Franklin counties in
western Massachusetts. Those counties had significantly fewer local medical professionals and facilities
associated with paid HSN services. In addition, there were widespread areas in Franklin, Hampshire,
Hampden, and Worcester counties with no local medical professionals available to serve HSN recipients.

As shown in Figure 14 below, established patient office and outpatient visits were the
predominate type of rendered medical service or procedure for HSN recipient claims from 2019 through
2023, with 1.16 million claims. In general, the most common types of rendered services were specific to
routine outpatient exams or screening and psychotherapy treatment sessions.

The images below summarize the most common primary diagnoses for HSN members from 2019
through 2023. As shown in Figure 15, a significant proportion of medical claims were for chronic conditions
such as hypertension and type 2 diabetes, followed by healthcare exams, immunizations, and mental
health conditions. These diagnoses were consistently the most prevalent codes across each year, with the
exception of COVID-19 testing and diagnosis.

health conditions.

Section 24:
4. Young adults and children had more claims for routine screenings and exams, bilateral
myopia, and immunizations.

Section 25:
5. Older adults had more claims for chronic diseases, such as hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and
malignant neoplasms.

Section 26:
6. Claims for mental health conditions were more common in adults aged 18 to 49. Treatment
for anxiety disorders (generalized or unspecified) were prevalent among young adults aged
18 to 34. Major depressive disorder (recurrent and moderate) claims were common in adults
aged 35 to 49.

IV. Dental Service Claims
Figure 19 below presents the number of providers and sites with HSN dental claims, along with
the total volume of HSN dental claims and payments over the five-year period (from 2019 through 2023)
by type of provider, service, and service location. CHCs were by far the largest providers of HSN dental
services, and most of these services were administered in an office setting. Most dental claims were for
“other” types of services, followed by diagnostic services, restorative care, and preventative treatments.

30 The number of providers is defined using the unique Medicaid provider ID, while the number of sites reflects distinct provider
locations based on provider name and address. Note that the unique Medicaid identifier does not distinguish between provider
types; a unique ID may be assigned to an individual or healthcare network with multiple site locations. In addition, some dental
professionals may provide HSN dental services at more than one site.
31 Orthodontic services, with a claim volume of less than 500, was included in “Other” services.
32 Service locations with smaller claim volumes (less than 1,000 claims) were collapsed into the “Other” category and include
inpatient hospitals, inpatient psychiatric facilities, state or local public health clinics, psychiatric facilities-partial hospitalization,
skilled nursing facilities, and ambulatory surgical centers.
Office of the Inspector General for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts 32 | P age
Figure 20 below displays the monthly longitudinal trends seen in HSN dental claims and payments
for the most common types of dental services from 2019 through 2023. Consistent with overall trends in
HSN claims, there was a steep decline in HSN claim volume and payments during the onset of the COVID-
19 pandemic (from mid-March 2020 to May 2020) followed by a steady increase in these measures over
subsequent years. This trend was similar across each of the most common types of dental services (as
seen in Figure 19 above). Despite the upward trajectory of these trends since the pandemic, as of
December 2023, the monthly claim volume and total payments remained below peak pre-COVID-19
levels, as shown for the most common types of dental services.
Figure 20. Monthly Dental HSN Claims and Payments for Common Services (2019 – 2023).
Office of the Inspector General for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts 33 | P age
Figure 21 below displays the locations of Massachusetts service providers that had at least one
HSN dental claim from 2019 through 2023, represented by the dark blue dots on the map. The shaded
areas reflect the distribution of HSN recipients across Massachusetts municipalities as defined by the
number of recipients per 1,000 residents with at least one dental claim from 2019 through 2023.
As compared to medical providers, there were significantly fewer providers with HSN dental
claims across the state. As shown in Figure 21, the densely populated Boston metro area had the highest
concentration of HSN dental service providers and recipients, while regions with similarly high rates of
HSN recipients had a much sparser distribution of local dental providers. This was particularly evident in
the Western Massachusetts counties (Berkshire, Franklin, Hampshire, and Hampden) and Southeastern
Massachusetts (Plymouth, Cape Cod, and the islands), which are experiencing dental provider shortages.
See Figure 22.
As stated by a 2021 report by the Massachusetts Health Policy Commission, “[w]hile there are 78
dentists per 100,000 population in Massachusetts, higher than the national average, only 44% of
Massachusetts dentists report that they accept patients covered by MassHealth.”33 Although the HPC
study reflects the low percentage of MassHealth dental providers that accept MassHealth, it is likely that
dentists similarly do not provide services reimbursed by the HSN.

While the largest number of HSN pharmaceutical claims were for cardiovascular drugs and
therapeutics, the bulk of HSN payments were specific to antihyperglycemic treatments, as shown in Figure
26 above and Figure 27 below. Starting in 2021, there was a substantive rise in HSN payments for
antihyperglycemic drugs, which was followed by a temporary decline in mid-2022. Payments began to
soar in late 2022, reaching a threefold increase by early 2023.
Figure 27. Monthly Pharmaceutical HSN Claims and Payments (2019 – 2023).
Office of the Inspector General for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts 40 | P age
While cardiovascular medications comprised the largest volume of HSN pharmaceutical claims,
nearly three-fourths of HSN pharmaceutical payments from 2019 through 2023 were attributed to a single
antihyperglycemic treatment, Trulicity ($1.84 million), which may account for the sharp rise in
pharmaceutical payments observed in Figure 27. In fact, the vast majority of HSN payments were for
antihyperglycemic products, as shown in Figure 28 below.

VI. Super-Utilizers
Within the population of HSN recipients with at least one HSN service from 2019 through 2023,
the OIG identified a small subset of 279 individuals with a chronically high volume of medical claims (25
or more medical claims per year for at least 3 consecutive years).
Figure 29 below displays the relationship between the annual volume of HSN medical claims and
the corresponding annual payment amounts per recipient for individuals with at least one HSN medical
claim in the period from 2019 through 2023. The dark blue, diamond-shaped observations represent
annual claims data from HSN recipients classified as super-utilizers, while the gray circles correspond to
annual claims data from all other recipients. For each recipient, the analysis included data from all
available years with HSN medical claims, regardless of utilization status.
Figure 29. HSN Member Utilization (2019 –2023).
The proportion of males to females was evenly distributed within the super-utilizer cohort, with
females representing 49.8% of the cohort and males representing 50.2%. Roughly 70.3% of recipients
were at least 50 years old, and 34.8% were 65 years or older. In addition, a higher proportion (25.1%) of
super-utilizers were classified as having a disability at any point, and approximately 31.2% had Medicare
coverage. More than half of recipients had a household income at the 0% federal poverty level.
Office of the Inspector General for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts 42 | P age
Like the overall population of HSN recipients, CHCs and physicians were the most prevalent types
of medical providers among super-utilizers, as shown in Figure 30 below. Physician offices had the highest
HSN claim volume and payments for medical services, followed by outpatient and inpatient hospital
locations.

Figure 31 below lists the top 20 medical professionals and facilities in Massachusetts with the
highest volume of HSN medical claims for super-utilizers from 2019 through 2023. More than half of these
providers are located in Boston, which is consistent with the findings of the overall population of HSN
recipients.
37 The number of providers is defined using the unique Medicaid provider ID, while the number of sites reflects distinct provider
locations based on provider name and address. Note that the unique Medicaid identifier does not distinguish between provider
types; a unique ID may be assigned to an individual or healthcare network with multiple site locations. In addition, some
physicians may provide HSN medical services at more than one site.
38 Provider types with smaller claim volumes of less than 100 were collapsed into the “Other” category and include psychiatric

Among super-utilizers, the most common types of primary diagnoses were chronic diseases,
mental health and psychiatric disorders, and alcohol dependence and substance use disorders, as shown
in Figure 32 below. While there was some overlap in primary medical diagnoses between super-utilizers
and the overall population of HSN recipients, as shown in Figure 15, psychiatric disorders and substance
use disorders accounted for a higher percentage of HSN claims among super-utilizers. Unlike the overall
population, HSN claims for routine medical exams and screenings and immunizations were not included
among the most prevalent diagnoses and procedures for super-utilizers.

CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Following a review of available HSN annual reports, the HCD aimed to better understand the HSN
program’s healthcare service expenditures by provider type, focusing on broad demographic categories
of healthcare consumers receiving services reimbursed by HSN. The HCD conducted a five-year review to
assess trends related to the demographic makeup of individuals whose care is funded by the HSN
program, along with a detailed review of services by provider type and location. This analysis also offers
insights into the impacts of the public health emergency on low-income, uninsured, or underinsured
patients and their utilization of the HSN program.
The HCD’s review provides crucial information on how hundreds of millions of dollars are spent
to provide healthcare access to the Commonwealth's most vulnerable patients. The report highlights
stable age and gender demographics during the five-year review period, but notes a 20% increase in
residents falling into the lowest federal income level and relying on HSN for medical care. The review also
identifies regions with high concentrations of HSN users and areas with low levels of dental providers,
which should aid policymakers in future resource allocations. The analysis underscores the significant role
of community health centers (CHCs) in providing dental care. The review’s information on the most
prevalent diagnoses and services provided over the review period suggests opportunities for improved
healthcare delivery to patients with chronic illnesses.
This robust demographic analysis of HSN patients, providers, and services equips policymakers
with essential information on healthcare spending, the impact of funding on service providers, the needs
of low-income patients by region, and the prevalent recipient diagnoses and services. The review is
particularly timely given the collapse of the Steward Health Care System and the increased pressure on
remaining hospitals and CHCs, which have seen a surge in patient demand.
Given the increasing financial strains faced by acute hospitals and CHCs, a comprehensive
evaluation of the Commonwealth’s HSN program is imperative for policymakers and stakeholders to:

Section 27:
1. Ensure adequate resources for healthcare service providers;

Section 28:
2. Identify regions facing provider shortages that impact access to care (e.g., HSN dental
provider shortages);

Section 29:
3. Identify patient healthcare trends and chronic medical conditions to recommend cost-
effective healthcare delivery methods; and

Section 30:
4. Develop collaborative and innovative solutions to guarantee adequate access to medical,
mental health, and dental services for Massachusetts’s low-income, uninsured, and
underinsured populations.
The HCD’s future oversight efforts will focus on identifying vulnerabilities within the HSN program
and its internal controls to prevent fraud, waste, and abuse, thereby ensuring continued access to
healthcare for eligible Massachusetts residents. Building on the findings on this report, the HCD will
conduct future oversight work to achieve these objectives.

Re: An Analysis of Health Safety Net Patients, Providers, and Services
Dear Governor Healey and Commonwealth Leaders:
Pursuant to Chapter 12A of the Massachusetts General Laws and Section 231 of Chapter 140 of
the Acts of 2024, enclosed please find the Office of the Inspector General’s (OIG) 2025 annual report on
public healthcare, An Analysis of Health Safety Net Patients, Providers, and Services.
Office of the Inspector General for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts 2 | P age

Over the past year, the OIG’s Healthcare Division (HCD) has taken a deep dive into the
Commonwealth’s Health Safety Net (HSN) program. In this report, you will find a wealth of demographic
and statistical information on HSN patients, providers, and services rendered from 2019 through 2023.
Why did the HCD collect and analyze this data? For a simple reason: to show policymakers and the public
how the hundreds of millions of dollars spent annually on HSN services are actually allocated.
Beyond demonstrating how the money is spent, the numbers presented herein also inform
foundational elements of the HSN program. The data speaks to questions that stakeholders, including
program sponsors and funders, should be asking, such as:
1. Is the HSN program serving the right individuals?
2. Are HSN patients receiving the right services?
3. Does the HSN program deliver those services at a reasonable cost?
4. Is the HSN program achieving expected outcomes?
This report draws upon the expertise of the OIG’s data analytics team, which aggregated the HSN
data into the comprehensive format set forth in the following pages. While data on virtually any topic is
readily available in 2025, it is only helpful when it is organized in easily accessible ways. The HCD believes
that the tables and charts produced in this report are approachable and digestible. I am confident that
these visualizations can provide insight into a host of matters related to the HSN and its future direction.
I created the HCD in 2023 to examine Massachusetts Medicaid (MassHealth) and the HSN
program, as well as to review a wide range of public healthcare policy, delivery, and access issues. Through
its oversight role, the HCD identifies potential programmatic vulnerabilities within MassHealth and the
HSN and develops recommendations for improving internal controls and practices. This work furthers the
HCD’s mission of preventing fraud, waste, and abuse of public funds in these public healthcare systems.
In years past, the HCD issued one annual report summarizing its work for the year. Going forward,
the HCD will issue reports as its work is completed so that our conclusions and recommendations can be
disseminated to stakeholders sooner. We will continue to mine data and present it in constructive ways
to communicate our findings.
For now, I encourage stakeholders, including the Executive Office of Health and Human Services
and its child agencies, to take advantage of the information in this report. The data can serve as a valuable
tool as the Commonwealth works to allocate limited resources in ways that provide impact and effectively
deliver intended results.
I want to thank the many contributors to this report, especially Gregory Matthews, Director of the
Healthcare Division. I also extend my appreciation to Deputy Inspector General Susanne O’Neil; OIG Legal
Counsel Eugenia Carris; Alyssa Tasha, Elizabeth Lazar, and Stephen Gerry of the OIG’s Data Analytics
Division; senior executive assistant Nataliya Urciuoli; and the OIG’s communications and publications
teams.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The Commonwealth’s Health Safety Net (HSN) pays for medically necessary services provided by
Massachusetts community health centers (CHCs) and acute hospitals (AHs) to uninsured or underinsured
Massachusetts residents with a modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) at or below 300% of the federal
poverty level, regardless of citizenship or immigration status.1 AHs are hospitals “licensed under M.G.L. c.
111, § 51 that contain a majority of medical-surgical, pediatric, obstetric, and maternity beds, as defined
by the Department of Public Health [DPH].”2 CHCs are licensed as freestanding clinics by DPH and operate
in conformance with federal law, providing primary health services such as family medicine, internal
medicine, pediatrics, obstetrics, gynecology, diagnostic laboratory and radiologic services, preventive
health services, emergency medical services, and pharmaceutical services.3 CHCs also provide referrals to
medical and health-related services, patient case management, and services that enable individuals to use
the health center, such as outreach and transportation services.
The mission of the OIG’s Healthcare Division (HCD) is to identify programmatic vulnerabilities
within the HSN and MassHealth and develop recommendations for improving internal controls and
practices to prevent fraud, waste, and abuse of public funds in these public healthcare systems.
For the HCD to effectively fulfill its oversight responsibilities for the HSN program and to conduct
future HSN reviews on issues such as potential vulnerabilities, funding and provider reimbursements,
access to services, accuracy of surcharge payments, and hospital bad debt, it is necessary to first
understand the scope and utilization of the HSN program. The OIG’s HCD therefore initiated an extensive
review of the HSN program to examine the demographic composition of the low-income patient
population who received medical, dental, and pharmaceutical services from 2019 through 2023. As
reflected in this report, this analysis provides insights on longitudinal trends in HSN services and utilization
patterns for different types and frequencies of services. Within this scope, the HCD identified how HSN
funds are used to pay for medical, dental, and pharmaceutical services rendered to uninsured or
underinsured Massachusetts residents who are eligible for HSN coverage.
The OIG's review of the HSN program found that the demographic characteristics of age and
gender cohorts remained stable over the five years examined. However, during that period there was a
sharp increase of approximately 20% in the number of Massachusetts residents whose care is paid for by

3 Id. This regulation defines a community health center as “a health center operating in conformance with the requirements of
§330 of United States Public Law 95-626, including a Community Health Center that files a cost report as requested by the Center
for Health Information and Analysis.” The regulation specifies that such a health center must (1) be licensed as a freestanding
clinic by the Massachusetts DPH pursuant to M.G.L. c. 111, § 51; (2) meet the qualifications for certification (or provisional
certification) by MassHealth and enter into a provider agreement pursuant to 130 CMR 405.000; and (3) operate in conformance
with the requirements of 42 U.S.C. § 254b.

the HSN and who have fallen into the lowest income level measured by federal poverty levels. The review
also visually identifies regions with the highest concentration of residents who utilize the HSN for
healthcare services. This data can be cross-referenced with the number of HSN providers by region,
service location, and service type to aid healthcare policymakers in determining where additional
resources may be needed to ensure access to healthcare for low-income, uninsured, or underinsured
individuals.
The HSN review identified the most prevalent medical and dental services and procedure codes,
as well as the most common diagnosis codes for the five-year review period by gender and age. The HCD
also highlighted claim volumes and HSN payment expenditures for each category. For dental services, the
review underscored the importance of CHCs as primary providers of dental care for vulnerable low-
income residents, while also indicating areas in Massachusetts that may lack sufficient numbers of HSN
dental providers to meet the needs of residents who rely on the HSN.
The assessment of HSN pharmaceutical claims revealed that, while the majority of claims were
for cardiovascular medications, the bulk of payments were for antihyperglycemic medications, with a
notable rise in payments from 2021 and a sharper increase in 2023.
Additionally, the HCD identified 279 HSN recipients with high volumes of medical claims and
chronic conditions (“super-utilizers”). This report’s data on super-utilizers is crucial to gaining a
comprehensive understanding of the medical needs of this subgroup of HSN recipients and developing
cost-effective methods of delivering care through alternative services and programs.
The OIG believes that this in-depth review of the HSN will aid policymakers in better
understanding the needs of residents who rely on the HSN. The comprehensive overview of HSN
expenditures over the review period will also prove useful. With this report, the Executive Office of Health
and Human Services, the Health Safety Net Office, CHCs, and officials with AHs will have a valuable
demographic analysis that can guide future health delivery and program funding decisions. The OIG will
also use the findings of this report as a foundation to conduct future HSN program reviews.

BACKGROUND
I. The Office of the Inspector General
The Office of the Inspector General for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts (OIG) is a
nonpartisan, independent state agency charged with preventing and detecting fraud, waste, and abuse of
public funds and assets. Legislators created the OIG in 1981 as the first state inspector general’s office in
the country. The OIG is led by an Inspector General who is appointed by a majority vote of the Governor,
Attorney General, and State Auditor for a term of five years.4
In keeping with its broad statutory mandate, the OIG investigates allegations of fraud, waste, and
abuse in government spending. As one of its core functions, the OIG reviews programs and practices in
state agencies and municipalities to identify systemic vulnerabilities and opportunities for improvement
in the stewardship of public assets.
The OIG has a budget of approximately $10 million and a staff of around 90 employees. The OIG
has oversight of more than $120 billion in spending and the work of over 300,000 public employees across
all state and municipal public entities throughout the Commonwealth, plus suppliers, vendors,
contractors, and nonprofits that receive public funds.
II. Massachusetts Health Safety Net Program
Healthcare providers are traditionally reimbursed or paid for services by (1) out-of-pocket
payments; (2) qualified health insurance plans or individual, group, or other plans providing coverage for
healthcare services issued by an insurance company; (3) government funded insurance (e.g., Medicaid
and Medicare, or programs offered through the Massachusetts Health Connector); or (4) the Health Safety
Net program that covers the costs of medical services provided to low-income, uninsured, or underinsured
patients (see Figure 1 below).

In 1985, the Massachusetts Legislature created the uncompensated care pool (UCP) with the goal
of “more equitably distributing the burden of financing uncompensated acute hospital services across all
acute hospitals . . . .”5 The purpose of the UCP was to pay for medically necessary services that acute
hospitals (AHs)6 and community health centers (CHCs)7 provided to eligible low-income, uninsured, and
underinsured patients. In addition, the UCP made reimbursements for bad debts that hospitals were
unable to recover from patients.
In 2006, the Legislature replaced the UCP with the Health Safety Net (HSN) program, funded by
the Health Safety Net Trust Fund. The purpose of the HSN program is to “maintain a healthcare safety net
by reimbursing hospitals and community health centers for a portion of the cost of reimbursable health
services provided to low-income, uninsured or underinsured residents.”8 The Division of Healthcare
Finance and Policy initially managed the HSN program, but in 2012 the Legislature transferred that
responsibility to the Office of Medicaid (MassHealth) within the Executive Office of Health and Human
Services. MassHealth created the Health Safety Net Office to oversee the HSN program.
HSN funding for provider reimbursements is derived from four sources:
1. Assessments on charges of AHs ($165 million);
2. Surcharges on payments made to institutional surcharge payers (e.g., entities and individuals,
including managed care organizations and persons enrolled in ConnectorCare, that make
payments to AHs and ambulatory surgical centers for the purchase of healthcare services,
equal to $160 million plus 50% of administration costs of the HSN program ($165 million));
3. Commonwealth General Fund appropriation ($16 million); and
4. Offset funding for uncompensated care from the Medical Assistance Trust Fund ($70 million).9
A. HSN Eligibility
The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) calculates the federal poverty level
(FPL), an annual measure of income used to determine eligibility for various federal and state assistance
programs.10 The FPL is based on household size (see Figure 2 below). It is used to assess economic needs
and is integral to the allocation of resources for healthcare, housing, food assistance, and other essential
services. The HSN program pays Massachusetts AHs and CHCs for healthcare services rendered to low-
income Massachusetts residents with household incomes at or below 300% of the FPL. Eligibility for the

B. HSN Coverage
The HSN program covers medically necessary services provided by Massachusetts AHs or CHCs.14
Services must align with those covered by MassHealth Standard.15 For recipients with a MAGI between
150% and 300% of the FPL, an annual deductible may apply. The deductible represents the portion of
healthcare costs that HSN recipients are responsible for. Both paid and unpaid bills count toward the
deductible, but only services covered by HSN contribute to it. Bills from private doctors, labs, or radiology
services do not count, even if provided within a hospital setting.16 A detailed list of eligible HSN services
provided by AHs and CHCs can be found in Appendix A.

The HSN program does not cover the following services17:
1. Physicians not employed by the hospital;
2. Ambulance services;
3. Lab charges not billed by an AH or CHC;
4. Radiology services not billed by an AH or CHC;
5. Durable medical equipment, except for crutches and canes provided during a medical visit;
6. Nonmedical services (social, educational, vocational);
7. Nonmedically necessary services; or
8. Experimental or unproven services.
C. HSN Deductible Amounts
For HSN applicants with a MAGI above 150% of the FPL, the HSN deductible is determined based
on income. The deductible amount is either the current annual cost of the lowest ConnectorCare monthly
premium ($588 as of the 2024 Member Booklet publication) or 40% of the difference between the lowest
MAGI in the applicant’s Premium Billing Family Group and 200% of the FPL, whichever is higher.18
D. HSN Medical Hardship Assistance
“Medical hardship” is a type of HSN coverage that provides assistance to residents at any income
level whose allowable medical expenses exceed a certain percentage of an individual’s or family’s income
and have become unmanageable.19 A medical hardship determination is a one-time determination and
not an ongoing eligibility category. Individuals can apply for medical hardship no more than twice within
a 12-month period. If an individual has exhausted the two HSN medical hardships within a year, they can
still receive care through (1) standard HSN coverage for eligible services; (2) MassHealth, if eligible; (3)
CHCs that provide care on a sliding scale based on income, regardless of ability to pay; or (4) hospitals with
financial assistance programs that help cover the cost of care for patients with limited incomes.
By providing financial assistance, the HSN program aims to ensure access to medically necessary
services for uninsured and underinsured low-income residents of Massachusetts, improving overall
healthcare outcomes and support for these communities.

METHODOLOGY
For this report, the OIG extracted Medicaid enrollment and HSN claims for medical, dental, and
pharmaceutical services from the MassHealth Data Warehouse20 for eligible recipients, defined as those
with:
1. Adjudicated HSN claims (original or adjusted) with initial service dates between January 1,
2019, and December 31, 2023; and
2. An active Medicaid ID during the time of service.
The primary metrics of interest include the annual number of individuals with claims, the volume
of claims, and total HSN payments from 2019 through 2023. In the case of duplicate records for a claim,
the OIG selected the most recently adjudicated version. The OIG also excluded 1,017 medical claims that
did not have service provider information.
The number of HSN recipients, claim volume, and total HSN payments were tabulated by the
following recipient demographics: age (years), race, gender, disability status, calculated percentage above
federal poverty level, and insurance status. The OIG defined non-static demographic features (i.e., income
and insurance status) based on member history data corresponding to the date of service for claim level
analyses, and the OIG summarized these characteristics over the observation year for recipient-level
analyses (see Figure 3). Due to the significant proportion of unknown responses for race status, the OIG
adjudicated these responses using data from current member/eligibility tables, and summarized race
status based on the most frequently used designation for each recipient. In addition, the analysis
categorized recipients according to which types of HSN services (medical, dental, pharmaceutical) they
received per year.
The OIG tabulated and plotted monthly, longitudinal trends for the number of Medicaid recipients
with HSN claims, total claim volume, and total HSN payments from 2019 through 2023. Descriptive
analyses of claim data were conducted separately by claim type (medical, dental, pharmaceutical) across
all years. For each claim type, the OIG summarized claim volume and total HSN payments by the following
factors: provider type, service location, primary medical diagnoses (most common), dental
services/common procedures, and treatment/medications (most common). Additionally, the OIG’s
analysis evaluated trends in HSN claim volume and payments for specific subgroups of providers, services,
and service locations, and identified the most prevalent medical diagnoses within subgroups of gender
and age.
The OIG explored geographical data to determine which regions in Massachusetts have the
highest concentration of HSN recipients, using recipients’ distinct mailing city and state as a proxy for
geographical location. This approach introduces some limitations, as mailing addresses do not always
correspond to where individuals permanently reside and addresses may not be current. In addition, the
recipient city and town data were imperfect due to missing values and incomplete or erroneous
municipality names. In a few cases, the OIG randomly assigned a city or town for Massachusetts villages
20 The Executive Office of Health and Human Services maintains the MassHealth Data Warehouse, which contains MassHealth
and HSN records, documents, information, and member data.
Office of the Inspector General for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts 14 | P age

spanning more than one municipality. The analysis excluded roughly 0.05% of distinct claims with
Massachusetts mailing addresses due to missing or inaccurate city or town information. The OIG used
mailing addresses of Massachusetts medical and dental providers with at least one HSN claim from 2019
through 2023 to map their locations across the state.
Finally, the OIG identified a subset of HSN recipients with chronically high volumes of HSN medical
claims (referred to herein as “super-utilizers”) and conducted exploratory analyses to better understand
the demographic makeup of this cohort and their medical needs. The OIG classified super-utilizers as
having 25 or more medical claims per year for at least 3 consecutive years. The OIG opted to focus solely
on medical services and selected an annual claims threshold of 25 or more that was above the top 1% or
99th percentile based on the distribution of recipient HSN medical claims per year. Given the intent was
to target recipients with longstanding conditions, the OIG expanded the definition to require more than
25 medical claims per year over a period of 3 or more consecutive years to exclude individuals with acute
or transitory conditions.

RESULTS
I. Recipient Characteristics
From 2019 through 2023, the distribution of recipients by age group remained fairly consistent.
Similarly, utilization by gender also remained consistent during the review period. Overall, slightly more
than half of HSN recipients were female and the average age was approximately 41.3 years.
As for the race of HSN recipients, on average, roughly 49% of individuals did not indicate a race
or ethnicity classification. Concerning the data related to HSN recipients’ “access to insurance” (defined
as an individual’s potential to access insurance or maintain any type of insurance other than Medicare),
the OIG’s review shows that 74.1% of HSN recipients had at least one annual period where their insurance
status was unknown. The recipients of HSN represented in the “unknown” category may represent a blind
spot for stakeholders and policy experts whose healthcare policy decisions may be informed by knowing
the type of insurance coverage or level of access to insurance that HSN recipients had before becoming
HSN-eligible.
The OIG reviewed HSN recipients’ federal poverty level (FPL), the inflation-adjusted annual
measure of income used to determine eligibility for federal and state assistance programs like healthcare.
The OIG’s review of income data reflecting the FPL highlights a negative trend over the review period:
namely, that the percentage of individuals at the 0% FPL (lowest level for the date of service year) has
increased by nearly 20% since 2020.

years 2019 through 2023.

Figure 4 below displays the concentration of HSN recipients (individuals with at least one HSN
claim from 2019 through 2023) per 1,000 residents by Massachusetts municipality. The gradients of
shading on the map reflect the varying proportions of HSN recipients within each municipality across the
state; darker colors indicate that a region has a larger proportion of residents receiving HSN services.
Areas with the highest concentration of HSN recipients include municipalities in the Boston metro area,
Cape Cod and the islands, and Western Massachusetts.

As shown in Figure 5 below, the OIG categorized HSN recipients according to the types of service
claims (medical, dental, pharmaceutical) they received per year from 2019 through 2023. Overall, 79% of
HSN recipients had only medical claims for at least one year while roughly 33% of individuals had HSN
claims for dental services alone or in combination with other types of services.

When broken down by claim type, medical services comprised more than half of all HSN claims
and the majority of HSN payments per year, as shown in Figure 7 below.
Figure 7. Total Annual HSN Claim Volume and Payments by Claim Type (2019 – 2023).
As shown in Figures 6 and 7, in 2020 there was a prominent reduction in the number of Medicaid
members receiving HSN services, along with the volume of claims and HSN payment amounts across all
claims and by claim type (medical, dental, pharmaceutical). Figure 8 below shows how the onset of this
sharp decline occurred in mid-to-late-March 2020 (corresponding to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic)
and continued in a downward trajectory until May 2020. Following this decline, all measures steadily
rebounded during the remainder of 2020, with less prominent decreases during periods of increased
COVID-19 infection rates. Despite the upward trajectory in claim measures since early 2020, the total
monthly volume has remained below pre-COVID-19 levels across all claim types as of December 2023, as
shown in Figure 8. The reason for this trend is not readily apparent from the data reviewed; however, the
OIG can speculate that following the COVID-19 health emergency, more people qualified for MassHealth
eligibility or other forms of insurance, resulting in a reduction in HSN utilization.26
26 The Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation found that “[p]rior to the pandemic, an average of 1.76 million individuals were
enrolled in the MassHealth program each month. By April 2023, enrollment in MassHealth had grown to 2.42 million individuals,
an increase of 659,000 (38 percent).” See MassHealth Enrollment Trends: The End of Continuous Coverage & Redetermination,

Figure 9 below presents the number of provider types and service locations with HSN medical
claims, along with the total volume of medical claims and payments, over the five-year period from 2019
through 2023. Among all provider types, CHCs had the largest number of HSN claims and total payments,
followed by physicians. Outpatient hospitals and physician offices had the highest HSN claim volume and
payments for medical services as compared to other types of facility and service modalities.

27 The number of providers is defined using the unique Medicaid provider ID, while the number of sites reflects distinct provider
locations based on provider name and address. Note that the unique Medicaid identifier does not distinguish between provider
types; a unique ID may be assigned to an individual or healthcare network with multiple site locations. In addition, some
physicians may provide HSN medical services at more than one site.
28 Provider types with smaller claim volumes (less than 500) were collapsed into the “Other” category and include Qualified
Medicare Beneficiary (QMB)-only providers, dentists, audiologists, and chiropractors.
29 Service locations with smaller claim volumes (less than 1,000 claims) were collapsed into the “Other” category and include
federally qualified health centers, homes, pharmacies, homeless shelters, skilled nursing home facilities, mobile units, and nursing
facilities.
Office of the Inspector General for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts 22 | P age

Figures 10 and 11 below display the monthly, longitudinal trends in HSN claim volume and total
payments for various types of providers and service locations with the highest number of medical claims.
In general, there was a significant reduction in the volume of HSN medical claims and total payments
coinciding with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic from mid-March through May 2020. While this
temporal reduction in HSN claims and payments is evident across the top provider categories, as shown
in Figure 10, this is not necessarily true for the provider locations and service modalities, as shown in
Figure 11. The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic had a minimal effect on the volume of inpatient hospital
HSN claims. However, the volume of medical claims and HSN payments for telehealth appointments
simultaneously rose dramatically during this period and became the predominate method for providing
services during the initial months of the pandemic. Although the volume of telehealth medical claims and
payment amounts declined in subsequent years (coinciding with the resurgence of office and outpatient
hospital claims), these metrics are still higher than the pre-COVID-19 period.
While monthly HSN claim volume and payments for medical services gradually increased following
the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, these measures have remained below their pre-COVID-19 peak
values for most types of providers and service locations and modalities.

Figure 12 below displays the service locations of Massachusetts physicians and service providers
associated with at least one HSN medical claim from 2019 through 2023, represented by the dark blue
dots on the map. The shaded areas reflect the distribution of HSN recipients across Massachusetts
municipalities, defined by the number of HSN recipients per 1,000 residents who had at least one medical
claim from 2019 through 2023.
As shown in Figure 12, the densely populated Boston metro area had the highest concentration
of HSN medical service providers and recipients, while other regions with similarly high rates of HSN
recipients had fewer service providers. This was particularly evident in Berkshire and Franklin counties in
western Massachusetts. Those counties had significantly fewer local medical professionals and facilities
associated with paid HSN services. In addition, there were widespread areas in Franklin, Hampshire,
Hampden, and Worcester counties with no local medical professionals available to serve HSN recipients.

Figure 13 below lists the top 25 medical professionals and facilities in Massachusetts with the
highest volume of HSN medical claims. More than half of these providers are in Boston, which is consistent

As shown in Figure 14 below, established patient office and outpatient visits were the
predominate type of rendered medical service or procedure for HSN recipient claims from 2019 through
2023, with 1.16 million claims. In general, the most common types of rendered services were specific to
routine outpatient exams or screening and psychotherapy treatment sessions.

The images below summarize the most common primary diagnoses for HSN members from 2019
through 2023. As shown in Figure 15, a significant proportion of medical claims were for chronic conditions
such as hypertension and type 2 diabetes, followed by healthcare exams, immunizations, and mental
health conditions. These diagnoses were consistently the most prevalent codes across each year, with the
exception of COVID-19 testing and diagnosis.

Figures 16 and 17 below summarize the top diagnosis codes by gender (top 10) and age (top 5).
Some observations include:
1. Routine health exams appear for each demographic group.
2. Chronic conditions such as hypertension and type 2 diabetes were prevalent for both males
and females.
3. Differences between males and females were typically related to gender-specific care and
health conditions.
4. Young adults and children had more claims for routine screenings and exams, bilateral
myopia, and immunizations.
5. Older adults had more claims for chronic diseases, such as hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and
malignant neoplasms.
6. Claims for mental health conditions were more common in adults aged 18 to 49. Treatment
for anxiety disorders (generalized or unspecified) were prevalent among young adults aged
18 to 34. Major depressive disorder (recurrent and moderate) claims were common in adults
aged 35 to 49.

30 The number of providers is defined using the unique Medicaid provider ID, while the number of sites reflects distinct provider
locations based on provider name and address. Note that the unique Medicaid identifier does not distinguish between provider
types; a unique ID may be assigned to an individual or healthcare network with multiple site locations. In addition, some dental
professionals may provide HSN dental services at more than one site.
31 Orthodontic services, with a claim volume of less than 500, was included in “Other” services.
32 Service locations with smaller claim volumes (less than 1,000 claims) were collapsed into the “Other” category and include
inpatient hospitals, inpatient psychiatric facilities, state or local public health clinics, psychiatric facilities-partial hospitalization,
skilled nursing facilities, and ambulatory surgical centers.

Figure 20 below displays the monthly longitudinal trends seen in HSN dental claims and payments
for the most common types of dental services from 2019 through 2023. Consistent with overall trends in
HSN claims, there was a steep decline in HSN claim volume and payments during the onset of the COVID-
19 pandemic (from mid-March 2020 to May 2020) followed by a steady increase in these measures over
subsequent years. This trend was similar across each of the most common types of dental services (as
seen in Figure 19 above). Despite the upward trajectory of these trends since the pandemic, as of
December 2023, the monthly claim volume and total payments remained below peak pre-COVID-19
levels, as shown for the most common types of dental services.

Figure 21 below displays the locations of Massachusetts service providers that had at least one
HSN dental claim from 2019 through 2023, represented by the dark blue dots on the map. The shaded
areas reflect the distribution of HSN recipients across Massachusetts municipalities as defined by the
number of recipients per 1,000 residents with at least one dental claim from 2019 through 2023.
As compared to medical providers, there were significantly fewer providers with HSN dental
claims across the state. As shown in Figure 21, the densely populated Boston metro area had the highest
concentration of HSN dental service providers and recipients, while regions with similarly high rates of
HSN recipients had a much sparser distribution of local dental providers. This was particularly evident in
the Western Massachusetts counties (Berkshire, Franklin, Hampshire, and Hampden) and Southeastern
Massachusetts (Plymouth, Cape Cod, and the islands), which are experiencing dental provider shortages.
See Figure 22.
As stated by a 2021 report by the Massachusetts Health Policy Commission, “[w]hile there are 78
dentists per 100,000 population in Massachusetts, higher than the national average, only 44% of
Massachusetts dentists report that they accept patients covered by MassHealth.”33 Although the HPC
study reflects the low percentage of MassHealth dental providers that accept MassHealth, it is likely that
dentists similarly do not provide services reimbursed by the HSN.

While the largest number of HSN pharmaceutical claims were for cardiovascular drugs and
therapeutics, the bulk of HSN payments were specific to antihyperglycemic treatments, as shown in Figure
26 above and Figure 27 below. Starting in 2021, there was a substantive rise in HSN payments for
antihyperglycemic drugs, which was followed by a temporary decline in mid-2022. Payments began to
soar in late 2022, reaching a threefold increase by early 2023.

While cardiovascular medications comprised the largest volume of HSN pharmaceutical claims,
nearly three-fourths of HSN pharmaceutical payments from 2019 through 2023 were attributed to a single
antihyperglycemic treatment, Trulicity ($1.84 million), which may account for the sharp rise in
pharmaceutical payments observed in Figure 27. In fact, the vast majority of HSN payments were for
antihyperglycemic products, as shown in Figure 28 below.

VI. Super-Utilizers
Within the population of HSN recipients with at least one HSN service from 2019 through 2023,
the OIG identified a small subset of 279 individuals with a chronically high volume of medical claims (25
or more medical claims per year for at least 3 consecutive years).
Figure 29 below displays the relationship between the annual volume of HSN medical claims and
the corresponding annual payment amounts per recipient for individuals with at least one HSN medical
claim in the period from 2019 through 2023. The dark blue, diamond-shaped observations represent
annual claims data from HSN recipients classified as super-utilizers, while the gray circles correspond to
annual claims data from all other recipients. For each recipient, the analysis included data from all
available years with HSN medical claims, regardless of utilization status.
Figure 29. HSN Member Utilization (2019 –2023).
The proportion of males to females was evenly distributed within the super-utilizer cohort, with
females representing 49.8% of the cohort and males representing 50.2%. Roughly 70.3% of recipients
were at least 50 years old, and 34.8% were 65 years or older. In addition, a higher proportion (25.1%) of
super-utilizers were classified as having a disability at any point, and approximately 31.2% had Medicare
coverage. More than half of recipients had a household income at the 0% federal poverty level.
Office of the Inspector General for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts 42 | P age

Like the overall population of HSN recipients, CHCs and physicians were the most prevalent types
of medical providers among super-utilizers, as shown in Figure 30 below. Physician offices had the highest
HSN claim volume and payments for medical services, followed by outpatient and inpatient hospital
locations.

Among super-utilizers, the most common types of primary diagnoses were chronic diseases,
mental health and psychiatric disorders, and alcohol dependence and substance use disorders, as shown
in Figure 32 below. While there was some overlap in primary medical diagnoses between super-utilizers
and the overall population of HSN recipients, as shown in Figure 15, psychiatric disorders and substance
use disorders accounted for a higher percentage of HSN claims among super-utilizers. Unlike the overall
population, HSN claims for routine medical exams and screenings and immunizations were not included
among the most prevalent diagnoses and procedures for super-utilizers.

CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Following a review of available HSN annual reports, the HCD aimed to better understand the HSN
program’s healthcare service expenditures by provider type, focusing on broad demographic categories
of healthcare consumers receiving services reimbursed by HSN. The HCD conducted a five-year review to
assess trends related to the demographic makeup of individuals whose care is funded by the HSN
program, along with a detailed review of services by provider type and location. This analysis also offers
insights into the impacts of the public health emergency on low-income, uninsured, or underinsured
patients and their utilization of the HSN program.
The HCD’s review provides crucial information on how hundreds of millions of dollars are spent
to provide healthcare access to the Commonwealth's most vulnerable patients. The report highlights
stable age and gender demographics during the five-year review period, but notes a 20% increase in
residents falling into the lowest federal income level and relying on HSN for medical care. The review also
identifies regions with high concentrations of HSN users and areas with low levels of dental providers,
which should aid policymakers in future resource allocations. The analysis underscores the significant role
of community health centers (CHCs) in providing dental care. The review’s information on the most
prevalent diagnoses and services provided over the review period suggests opportunities for improved
healthcare delivery to patients with chronic illnesses.
This robust demographic analysis of HSN patients, providers, and services equips policymakers
with essential information on healthcare spending, the impact of funding on service providers, the needs
of low-income patients by region, and the prevalent recipient diagnoses and services. The review is
particularly timely given the collapse of the Steward Health Care System and the increased pressure on
remaining hospitals and CHCs, which have seen a surge in patient demand.
Given the increasing financial strains faced by acute hospitals and CHCs, a comprehensive
evaluation of the Commonwealth’s HSN program is imperative for policymakers and stakeholders to:
1. Ensure adequate resources for healthcare service providers;
2. Identify regions facing provider shortages that impact access to care (e.g., HSN dental
provider shortages);
3. Identify patient healthcare trends and chronic medical conditions to recommend cost-
effective healthcare delivery methods; and
4. Develop collaborative and innovative solutions to guarantee adequate access to medical,
mental health, and dental services for Massachusetts’s low-income, uninsured, and
underinsured populations.
The HCD’s future oversight efforts will focus on identifying vulnerabilities within the HSN program
and its internal controls to prevent fraud, waste, and abuse, thereby ensuring continued access to
healthcare for eligible Massachusetts residents. Building on the findings on this report, the HCD will
conduct future oversight work to achieve these objectives.
