Introduction
The Office of Community Corrections (OCC) submits this report consistent with the provisions of
Chapter 140 of the Acts of 2024, Line Item 0339-1003.
The OCC is a government organization within the Probation Service of the Massachusetts Trial Court.
Pursuant to M. G. L., c. 211F, the OCC is charged the development and implementation of community-
based programs that serve as an alternative to jail and prison for those that might otherwise be
incarcerated. These programs may be used at the pretrial and dispositional phase of the judicial process
and as a means of support for those returning from a period of incarceration.
The OCC delivers programs and services through two main initiatives. First, the OCC contracts with
social service providers and county sheriff’s departments to operate a network of community-based
facilities known as Community Justice Support Centers (Support Centers). There are eighteen Support
Centers in Massachusetts. Support Centers deliver cognitive behavioral treatment, education, career
counseling, clinical case management, and community services as an alternative to jail, house of
correction, and prison. Second, the OCC operates the Community Service Program to help those subject
to probation supervision engage with community partners as volunteers in lieu of incarceration and allow
those engaged in programming at Support Centers to practice skills they have learned.
OCC programs are available to people at various stages of the criminal justice process and through
various pathways. The “pathways” are the statutory authority by which a person accesses the Support
Center. They include the following:
Mandatory/Supervised Pathways
1. Intensive Supervision with Treatment (IST)
Per M.G.L. c. 211F § 3, a court can sentence a person who has been convicted of a crime to
community supervision at the Community Justice Support Center in lieu of a period of
incarceration. This sentence is administered as a special condition of probation by the probation
department. A person who is sentenced to Intensive Supervision with Treatment (IST) submits to
a risk/needs assessment which is used to develop a treatment plan. The treatment plan includes all
the programs that are necessary to reduce the likelihood that the person will engage in further
conduct that may result in justice involvement. Programming can include cognitive behavioral
therapy to address decision making or drug/alcohol use, education towards a GED/HiSET or
other credential, career counseling, clinical case management to address physical/behavioral
health, housing, cultural competency and other responsivity needs, and community service to
allow clients the opportunity to practice skills. People can also come to IST as a means of
graduated re-entry from parole, the Sheriff’s Department, or the Department of Correction.
2. Pretrial Treatment
Per M.G.L. c. 211F § 3A(b), if a person has been arraigned on an offense, they can request to
participate in the programming provided via IST, in lieu of bail or as a condition of release. The
Pretrial Treatment pathway allows a person to engage in programming at the Support Center
while they await trial. In Pretrial Treatment the person has access to all the same programming,
services, and supports they would have gotten had they been sentenced to IST. However, these
interventions happen before they have been convicted of a crime. This may allow the person who
does well in programming to get a favorable recommendation from the district attorney or a
favorable sentence from the judge when the matter is resolved.

3. Pretrial Services
Per M.G.L. c. 211F § 3A, if a person has been arraigned on an offense, the court can order them
to report to the Support Center in lieu of bail or as a condition of release. The Pretrial Services
pathway allows a person to remain at liberty while their case is pending. To increase the
likelihood that the person will report to court, they are required to check-in at the Support Center
on a periodic basis. During the check-in the Support Center staff can help the person find a place
to live, get a job, get connected to a primary care or behavioral health provider, enroll in
MassHealth or DTA benefits. This is different than Pretrial Treatment because the person has not
consented to participate. Therefore, the Support Center only offers case management services to
the person on a voluntary basis. The person does not receive rehabilitative services through the
Support Center. Rather, the Support Center refers the person to community resources for any
support they request.
4. Probation Referral (For Court-Ordered Program)
Per M.G.L. c. 211F § 3B, people that are subject to probation supervision may be referred to the
Support Center or the Community Service Program by a probation officer to resolve a condition
of probation if they have had a risk, needs assessment, are at an appropriate supervision level, and
have had a condition ordered by the court that can be fulfilled by a program available at the
Support Center.
Voluntary Pathways/Ralph Gants Project
1. Probation Referral (Upon Agreement)
Also under M.G.L. c. 211F § 3B, people can go to the Support Center on a voluntary basis to
work on a criminogenic need area with a referral from their probation officer. Because
participation at the Support Center is voluntary through this pathway, the Support Center does not
report the individual’s progress with the supervising agency.
2. Re-entry Services
The Ralph Gants Project (RGP) provides services to those that are justice involved on a voluntary
basis. Through RGP, any person that has been formerly incarcerated can come to a Support
Center for help with anything they need to stay safe in their community. The Re-entry Services
Coordinator at the Support Center can help a person get a state ID, engage with housing services,
get a GED/HiSET, engage with employment services and vocation training. The Public Benefits
Coordinator can help a person get enrolled in MassHealth, access SNAP benefits, SSI/SSDI, or
any other safety net program for which they are eligible.

History
The following provides a brief history of the Office of Community Corrections.
Prison Overcrowding
In 1980, 5,441 people were committed to county houses of correction in Massachusetts. By the end of the
decade the number of county commitments increased more than 150% to 13,721. At the state prisons, the
number of people committed increased by more than 200% from 1,234 in 1980 to 3,794 in 1990. In 1997,
county commitments peaked at 19,842.
Boston Bar Association (BBA)/ Crime and Justice Foundation Report
In 1990, faced with a crisis affecting the criminal justice system, the Boston Bar Association and the
Crime and Justice Foundation convened a task force to study the prison overcrowding problem and make
policy recommendations toward its resolution.
Recommendations
While the BBA task force made no inquiry into the underlying cause of increased prison commitments it
characterized the problem as being a result of increasing incarceration rates, longer sentences and jailing
of substance abusers. The task force resolved that it would not be possible to “build our way out” of the
problem. Among the recommendations it made were:
1. Establish a sentencing commission to revise sentencing law, develop sentencing guidelines and
serve as principal author for future sentencing amendments
2. Establish intermediate sanctions using the latest programmatic technologies
In recommending intermediate sanctions the task force referred to the lack of options between probation
and incarceration as a serious gap in the criminal justice system. The task force found that “there are
many offenders for whom a sanction greater than probation is appropriate and others for whom prison is
not appropriate.” The task force recommended intermediate sanctions that incorporate “supervision—
through urinalysis, daily schedules and a regular reporting structure; accountability—through curfews and
community service; and treatment—through substance abuse counseling, employment and training.”
Truth in Sentencing
As a result of the public debate over criminal justice policy, the Massachusetts Legislature passed a series
of reforms commonly referred to as “Truth in Sentencing” laws. Among these laws were statutes that
established the Massachusetts Sentencing Commission and the Office of Community Corrections (OCC).
The Massachusetts Sentencing Commission was charged with promoting truth in sentencing, proposing
modifications of law for sentencing, and proposing sentencing guidelines that incorporate intermediate
sanctions. The Office of Community Corrections was charged with development and implementation of
intermediate sanctions.
Mission Statement
The mission of the Office of Community Corrections is the establishment of intermediate sanctions which
offer a continuum of sanctions and services for probation, parole, sheriffs, and the Department of
Correction. This interagency and community collaboration supports public safety.
Consistency with Massachusetts Sentencing Commission
Pursuant to G. L. c. 211F, § 2(c) the executive director of the Office of Community Corrections shall
work in consultation with the [sentencing] commission…to ensure consistency between sentencing
guidelines and community corrections.
Intermediate Sanction Levels
The Office of Community Corrections adopted Intermediate Sanction Levels from the Massachusetts
Sentencing Commission’s Report to the General Court, April 10, 1996, “The commission... adopted the
notion of a continuum of four levels of intermediate sanctions, based on the constraints on personal
liberty associated with the sanction...” Community Justice Support Centers are designed to facilitate the
5

intensive supervision of offenders, delivering integrated services and sanctions which correspond to
intermediate sanction levels three and four.
In April 2018, the Sentencing Commission released revised guidelines that dispensed with the
Intermediate Sanction Levels and instead referenced only the imposition of intermediate sanctions. The
law provides that programs developed by the OCC be used as intermediate sanctions for those that are
justice involved.
2018 Criminal Justice Reform
In 2018 Massachusetts adopted two comprehensive criminal justice reform bills that impacted the Office
of Community Corrections by expanding access to Support Centers. Specifically, the reforms created
statutory authority for:
1. courts to order participation in Support Center programs at the pretrial phase of a case either with
or without the consent of the defendant,
2. probation officers to refer people that are subject to probation supervision to Support Centers to
satisfy conditions of probation under certain circumstances, and
3. for probation officers to refer people that are subject to probation supervision to Support Centers
to get any help they need on a voluntary basis.
Further statutory authority was granted through appropriations to the Office of Community Corrections to
develop the Gants Reentry Services Program so that those returning to the community after a period of
incarceration can access resources at the Support Center.
Sentencing to community corrections
Pursuant to G. L. c. 211F, § 3 (a) “Any court exercising jurisdiction is authorized to sentence any eligible
offender to a community corrections program…” and that sentence is imposed, “…as a condition of
probation…”
Referral to community corrections for reentry
Pursuant to G. L. c. 211F, §4 (c) “…the resources of community corrections programs shall be utilized by
the parole board for the purpose of parole supervision.” Furthermore, statutory authority has been granted
to the OCC through appropriations for the Gants Re-entry Services Program which provides support to
those returning to the community after a period of incarceration on a voluntary basis.

Mandated Reporting Items
(a) the performance standards used to assess the success of Community Justice Support Centers
(Support Centers);
Support Centers are operated via Interdepartmental Service Agreement (ISA) with county sheriff’s
department or contract with community-based service providers. Requests for Response/Proposal are
issued for agreements required to operate Support Centers. Upon the execution of appropriate agreements,
the OCC evaluates the success of the Support Center using the following criteria:
1.) Contractor’s fidelity to the agreement,
2.) Performance measures of participants (attendance, drug test results, etc.),
3.) Community and stakeholder considerations, and
4.) Outcomes of intermediate sanction (Intensive Supervision with Treatment) participants.
A note about evaluating the Community Justice Support Center based on participant performance.
The OCC works with our partners to ensure that the interventions delivered at each Support Center are
evidence-based and administered with fidelity to the underlying research. The evidence is clear that
incorporating practices like Motivational Interviewing, Risk/Need/Responsivity, Treatment Matching,
Contingency Management, and Manualized Cognitive Behavioral Therapy can reduce recidivism.
However, because Support Centers constitute an interdepartmental and inter-branch collaboration, the
relative “success” of a Support Center is dependent on some factors beyond the control of the OCC and its
contracted vendors of service.
The data presented here are influenced not only by the rehabilitative interventions made at the Support
Center, but by the supervision decisions made by the probation, parole, or corrections officer that
supervises the case. Therefore, it is insufficient to rely on these data alone to evaluate performance of the
Support Center; rather, the Support Center are evaluated by these data in combination with the
professional oversight undertaken by OCC Regional Program Managers (RPM).
RPMs conduct weekly Support Center visits in which they attend clinical and multidisciplinary team
meetings, conduct meetings with stakeholders, review case files and interact with Support Center staff,
probation and parole officers, sheriff’s departments, prosecution and defense bar and program participants.
Through this management structure the OCC plays an active role in monitoring contract compliance and
promotes criminal justice collaboration.

(d) standards for terminating contracts with underperforming Community Justice Support
Centers;
Pursuant to G.L. ch. 211F § 4 the Executive Director reserves the right to place any Community Justice
Support Center under the administrative control of the OCC due to noncompliance with OCC program
standards, or in the interest of public safety.
The OCC shall move to terminate contracts with Support Center vendors when:
1. The failure of a contractor to perform represents an immediate threat to the public safety;
2. The performance of a contractor deviates from the agreement so substantially as to defeat the
purpose of the contract;
3. The contractor fails to make a good-faith effort to resolve an allegation of contract
noncompliance after repeated attempts to do so by the OCC;
4. A funding appropriation is not renewed;
5. A funding appropriation to the OCC is reduced thereby rendering the contracted services
inconsistent with the priority to implement intermediate sanctions in a manner that has the
greatest impact on promoting the public safety;
6. Exigent circumstances render some portion of the contractor’s performance impossible due to
loss.
If the OCC alleges an incident of noncompliance due to the quality of performance, the OCC shall
exhaust all reasonable measures to resolve contractor noncompliance before seeking to terminate the
agreement.
14

(e) a plan for increasing the use of Community Justice Support Centers by the courts, the
department of correction, and the sheriffs;
The core elements of the OCC’s plan to increase the use of Support Centers remain unchanged:
1. Communication from the inside out. Messaging about the Support Centers begins with a focus on the
core value shared across stakeholders of enhancing community safety and progresses to how and
what Support Centers do to achieve positive outcomes.
a. Why- Enhance community safety.
b. How- Deploy Evidence-Based Practices that are innovative and motivational to change
behavior.
c. What- Facilitate enhanced supervision for probationers, parolees and pre-release participants
that are at high-risk for recidivism.
2. Engage stakeholders. Deliver the message of the Support Centers to stakeholders at every level of the
criminal justice system including judges, lawyers, probation and parole officers, sheriff’s
departments, victim’s services, and community-based treatment and service providers.
3. Create a results-oriented culture. Articulate goals, measure progress, cascade success, link success to
incentives, and communicate success/challenges.
Highlights of progress in FY25 include the following:
Expansion of Re-entry Services. The OCC is committed to assisting previously incarcerated individuals
as they navigate re-entry services. Through the Ralph Gants Project, the OCC has assisted 909 re-entry
and 124 voluntary probation referral clients and made 5,016 connections and referrals to community-
based services such as housing, identification, food, clothing, substance use treatment, employment, and
MassHealth.
Cultural Competency. In response to a burgeoning need, Support Centers now have a full Spanish-
speaking program schedule from 9am-4pm along two evening sessions. This schedule provides culturally
competent CBT programming statewide to address all criminogenic need domains via Spanish-speaking
facilitators.
OCC managers continued to meet for quarterly training sessions in a series called, “What's the DEIL:
Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and Leadership.” Sessions are facilitated by field experts and topics covered
topics have included equity for non-apparent disabilities, Native American history of local tribes, and
identifying implicit bias in the workplace.
Training. The OCC continues to increase training opportunities for Support Center staff. Almost all OCC
Program Managers are certified Motivational Interviewing (MI) trainers, and many are becoming certified
ORAS trainers. Enabling OCC staff to be MI and ORAS trainers will increase the capacity for Support
Center staff to be trained more quickly when hired. As part of this effort, the OCC offers monthly drug
testing training to Support Center staff and four MI skill building sessions each calendar year.
In FY25, the OCC has introduced a new curriculum to its programming inventory called, “Reasoning and
Rehabilitation.” This interactive training addresses the Criminal Attitudes and Behavioral Patterns domain
in the ORAS, which is an important supplement to the Support Centers’ already robust programming to
assist participants with their need areas.
15

Partnership with UMass Chan Medical School. In FY25, the Office of Community Corrections
continued its partnership with the University of Massachusetts Chan Medical School, Implementation
Science & Practice Advances Research Center. UMass Chan works with community justice support
centers to ensure fidelity to evidence-based practice in the following key areas:
1. Risk/Need assessment. Tracking interrater reliability of the administration of a fourth-generation
Risk/Need Assessment (ORAS-CST);
2. Treatment matching. Monitoring the reliability with which Support Center staff are engaging
participants in the type of programming that addresses their needs based on the risk/need
assessment; and
3. Cognitive-behavioral treatment. Monitoring and informing the use of best practices in delivery
of CBT in a group session.
To further enhance Support Center’s capacity to execute a Risk, Need, Responsivity model that reduces
recidivism, UMass Chan is assisting the OCC to understand how its Community Service Program (CSP)
can be reorganized to maintain its connection to the community while becoming more focused on
building strengths in clients. In the past service projects were driven solely by demand in the community
for volunteer support. While community needs are still an important part of the community service
mission, aligning projects with the strengths of program participants enhances opportunities to reduce
recidivism in the long run. This work requires enhanced training of community service employees
including Risk, Need, Responsivity and Motivational Interviewing. This project is ongoing and has
included surveys of staff, program participants, and other system stakeholders.
UMass Chan also facilitates a Community Advisory Board (CAB)for the Community Justice Support
Centers. The CAB comprises eight members all of whom have previous experience in the criminal justice
system. The CAB has been meeting since August 2024 and conducts monthly meetings wherein CAB
members review Support Center polices, procedures, and initiatives. CAB members have helped revise
Support Center Participant Handbooks, reviewed new curricula, and discussed other policy initiatives at
Support Centers. Engaging the voices of those affected by the system is a best practice to ensure that
policies, procedures, and initiatives at the Support Center have the desired impact on program
participants.
Community Outreach. From September to November 2024, all 18 Support Centers held Open Houses
