Office of the Child Advocate Annual Report, FY24
Letter from the Child Advocate
I am pleased to present the Fiscal Year 2024 (FY24) report of the activities of the Office of the Child
Advocate (OCA). The OCA is committed to ensuring that children and their families receive high-
quality, effective, and timely state services while also identifying gaps in services and
recommending improvements to systems, policies, and practices. This past year was marked by
significant challenges and accomplishments. The OCA remains steadfast in our belief that through
collaboration and targeted action, we can create a future where every child in the Commonwealth
is safe, supported, and thriving. You will see in this report steady growth at the OCA in the number
of staff, our ombuds function capacity, the range of research topics we conduct, and the number
and size of the projects we pursued.
This year we incorporated the Center on Child Wellbeing & Trauma into the OCA. The OCA is
dedicated to ensuring that state service agencies and their contracted providers are trauma
responsive. This work includes trainings and technical assistance on how trauma impacts behavior,
emotions, and the development of children and the adults who care for them. This knowledge and
related skills can prevent re-traumatization and promote resilience. The Center was created
through the work of the Childhood Trauma Taskforce, which the OCA chairs, and was originally
launched as a project housed at the ForHealth Consulting Division of UMass Chan Medical School.
The Center’s goal is to provide support and training to child-serving organizations and state
agencies across the Commonwealth. To better serve state agencies, the Center shifted to become a
fully incorporated division of the OCA during FY24. Incorporating the Center as a new division
within the OCA has provided us with the unique opportunity to apply the OCA’s approach to
systemic change in the field of trauma and resilience training. The incorporation of the Center also
contributed to our growth in staff, as the OCA has increased from a staff of 20 in FY23 to a staff of
30 at the end of FY24, with further growth planned for FY25.
In addition to the growth of the OCA staff, we are expanding our reach and depth. This includes
direct outreach to youth in group-care settings to enhance awareness of our Complaint Line, which
is available to help youth understand their rights and get the resources they need. It also includes
translating the OCA’s mandated reporter training into Spanish. Nearly 8,000 individuals completed
the training from its launch in August 2023 to the end of the fiscal year. In FY24, we also partnered
with the Department of Youth Services to expand the Massachusetts Youth Diversion Program to
more counties throughout the Commonwealth. We also issued a number of policy reports with
recommendations for improvements in the quality and availability of state services, most notably a
report with recommendations for expansion of the Family Resource Center network.
I want to extend my sincere and heartfelt thanks to the OCA staff for their dedication to improving
the lives of the Commonwealth’s children. I also wish to express my gratitude to the Legislature,
the Governor, our many partners in the public sector, advocacy organizations, and families who
support and collaborate with us daily. Without your continued partnership and support, the OCA
would not be able to achieve its mission.
Sincerely,
Maria Z. Mossaides

Office of the Child Advocate Annual Report, FY24
Executive Summary
This OCA Annual Report provides a high-level description of the actions and activities
undertaken in FY24 to advance our strategic goals and reach a future where all children—and
specifically children in the care and/or custody of the Commonwealth—can thrive.
Through its oversight functions, the OCA:
• Responded to 532 inquiries on the Complaint Line.
• Received and reviewed 278 critical incident reports involving 380 children.
• Received and reviewed 465 Department of Children and Families (DCF) reports of
supported allegations of abuse and/or neglect of children in out-of-home settings
involving 676 children.
• Received and reviewed 15 DCF Foster Care Review safety alerts involving 17 children.
The OCA also conducted research on a variety of issues, including problematic sexual behaviors
in children, prevention of drowning for children with autism spectrum disorder, and barriers and
opportunities to increase language access in child-serving systems. OCA staff conducted a
landscape assessment of state-sponsored direct services for children, released additional data
on juvenile justice involvement, and issued a notice and request for public comment about the
revised DCF annual report. That research resulted in the release of the following reports:
• The Massachusetts Youth Diversion Program: Impact Report, Year One of
Implementation, October 2023
• Childhood Trauma Task Force 2023 Annual Report, December 2023
• Massachusetts Juvenile Justice System 2023 JJPAD Annual Report, January 2024
• Family Resource Centers: Recommendations for Increasing Access and Improving Service
Delivery, April 2024
• The Massachusetts Youth Diversion Program: Year Two Program Data, May 2024
• Evaluation of a Housing Stabilization and Support Program for Transition Age Youth
Involved with the Department of Children & Families, June 2024
• Public Comment Summary and Response: Department of Children and Families Annual
Report, August 2024
Nearly 8,000 individuals successfully completed the OCA’s mandated reporter training; the
Center on Child Wellbeing & Trauma (CCWT) conducted trainings about trauma-informed and
responsive practices for a variety of professionals and organizations at state agencies and their
providers; the Quality Assurance Team worked to raise awareness of the Complaint Line,
especially with young people living in congregate care; and the OCA provided funding for
diversion services in seven counties through the Massachusetts Youth Diversion Program, for
play spaces for newcomer families living in shelters, and for young mothers through Roca Inc.’s.
Young Mothers program.
The OCA led boards and task forces that advance conversations and create critical connections
between key partners:

Office of the Child Advocate Annual Report, FY24
• The Juvenile Justice Policy and Data Board
• The Childhood Trauma Task Force
• Child Fatality Review in partnership with the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner and
Department of Public Health (DPH)
• Child Sexual Abuse Prevention Task Force in partnership with the Children’s Trust
Legislatively, the OCA advocated for initiatives that will improve the well-being of children and
families and service delivery for children involved in the child protective and juvenile justice
systems, including but not limited to:
• Advancing a foster children’s bill of rights.
• Improving the Child Requiring Assistance system.
• Making key juvenile justice data available.
• Transferring authority of the Child Fatality Review program to a joint chairmanship
between the OCA and DPH.
• Addressing the needs of substance-exposed newborns.
Finally, the OCA underwent substantial growth in FY24 with the incorporation of the Center on
Child Wellbeing & Trauma. This growth was coupled with increased administrative capacity,
attention to the development of standard operating procedures, and a revision of the data
collection system that supports the OCA’s core functions. Ten new employees joined the OCA to
support these functions, with more hiring anticipated in FY25.
The OCA stands ready as a partner and collaborator to provide system navigation to individuals,
identify gaps in state services, and work toward continuous improvement of policy, practice,
regulations, and laws.

Office of the Child Advocate Annual Report, FY24
Introduction
In FY24 the Office of the Child Advocate released our FY24-FY26 strategic framework. The
framework is the result of a strategic planning process that started with the question, “What is
the OCA’s vision for the Commonwealth’s children and their families, and what will it take to get
there?” The framework identifies eight key goals that must be achieved by the Commonwealth
to reach a future where all our children—and specifically our children in the care and/or
custody of the Commonwealth—can thrive. These goals guide decisions about OCA projects and
initiatives:
• Safety, High-Quality Services & Continuous Quality Improvement (CQI): Children in the
care and/or custody of the Commonwealth are safe and receiving the services they
need, and the state agencies serving them are continuously improving with well-
functioning quality assurance mechanisms in place.
• Prevention and Breaking the Cycle: There is a comprehensive, coordinated statewide
approach to supporting families with the aim of reducing child protective service and
juvenile justice system involvement, particularly for those families for whom persistent
disparities in supports exist and for families with multi-generational involvement.
• Transition into Adulthood: Youth receiving state services transition into adulthood with
the support they need to succeed.
• Addressing the Needs of Diverse Populations: Our state child-serving systems are
addressing the needs of traditionally underserved populations, including racially and
ethnically diverse populations, LGBTQ+ youth, and newcomer families.
• High/Complex Behavioral Health Needs: The needs of children and youth with high
and/or complex behavioral health needs are met, including their needs for timely
delivery of and navigation to appropriate support.
• Awareness of Services: Families and youth, and those who serve them, are aware of
available supports and services.
• High-Quality Data: Our state agencies serving children and families use high-quality
data to inform decision making and continuous quality improvement.
• OCA Capacity: The OCA has the expertise, reputation, relationships, capacity, and
operational infrastructure to execute its mission.
The following report provides a high-level description of the actions and activities undertaken
by the OCA in FY24. The first section provides a description of all major projects organized by
oversight functions, including descriptions of and actions taken in response to the reports and
inquiries received by the OCA.

Office of the Child Advocate Annual Report, FY24
Strategic Priorities & Initiatives
The following section describes the major projects the OCA worked toward in FY24, organized
by the OCA’s eight strategic goals. While projects are described under specific priorities to help
organize communication about our efforts, many projects address multiple goals.
Goal 1: Safety, High-Quality Services, and Continuous Quality Improvement
Children in the care and/or custody of the Commonwealth are safe and receiving the
services they need, and the state agencies serving them are continuously improving with
well-functioning quality assurance mechanisms in place.
OCA’s Quality Assurance Oversight
The OCA quality assurance function is grounded in the OCA statute, which requires the OCA to
ensure that children who are involved with an executive agency receive timely, safe, and
effective services. The OCA statute establishes several pathways for information about state
services to come to the OCA’s attention. These are the operation of an OCA Complaint Line,
receipt of critical incident reports, and receipt of DCF supported allegations of abuse and/or
neglect of children in out-of-home settings. Although not statutorily required, as part of the
OCA’s long-term efforts to strengthen the Foster Care Review process, in FY22 the OCA also
began to receive Foster Care Review safety alerts1 from DCF.
As a result of these established pathways, in FY24 the OCA received 532 Complaint Line
inquiries, 278 critical incident reports, 465 DCF supported reports of abuse and/or neglect in
out-of-home settings, and 15 Foster Care Review safety alerts. OCA quality assurance staff
provided advice and systems navigation to the 379 individuals who contacted the Complaint
Line and reviewed each concern brought to the OCA’s attention. OCA quality assurance staff also
reviewed every critical incident report, DCF supported report of abuse and/or neglect in an out-
of-home setting, and Foster Care Review safety alert. As a result of this work, OCA staff followed
up with external state agencies and/or service providers regarding 426 reports/inquiries, filed
four allegations of abuse and/or neglect (51As) with DCF, and conducted one non-public
investigation. The OCA may initiate a formal investigation when we determine the actions or
inactions of a reporting agency were egregious and significantly contributed to the harm of a
child or young adult. Typically, it is a critical incident report that brings cases to our attention for
investigation, though the OCA has discretion to investigate any matter that aligns with our
statutory oversight obligations. Formal investigations may be non-public or public. Formal
investigations include recommendations for implementation, which the OCA monitors through
our ongoing oversight.
The OCA’s engagement with external agencies because of our quality assurance oversight work
can take several forms and has multiple goals. The primary goal is to ensure that children are
safe, that they are receiving the services they need, and that barriers to those services are

Office of the Child Advocate Annual Report, FY24
resolved. The engagement can also provide additional information and context through
discussion of agency policies and practices. This informs the OCA’s individual case review work
as well as our overall mission of ensuring that children and their families receive effective
services.
Our work in this area also informs our day-to-day oversight of state agencies, our participation
in the Child Fatality Review (CFR) program, as well as our work on various other boards and
commissions and related research projects. We use the information to identify case practice
concerns specific to the child and family involved, as well as system-wide patterns and trends
about child maltreatment, injury, suicide, and other issues or associated risk factors. More
broadly, this information helps us:
• Determine policy and/or practice changes that could be instituted or refined to increase
the safety of children.
• Determine whether there are trends or patterns that may need to be addressed by new
policies or procedures.
• Identify trends where the Commonwealth would benefit from greater data gathering
and analysis.
For more function-specific information and data, see the Oversight Functions of this report.
Improving Trauma-Responsive Practices in Congregate Care Programs
Beginning in FY22 and continuing through FY24, the Center on Child Wellbeing & Trauma
worked with community-based congregate care service providers to improve the adoption of
trauma-informed and responsive practices. The goal of this work is to enhance services to
children placed in congregate care. Over this multi-year period, CCWT—through partnerships
with DCF and the Children’s League of Massachusetts—engaged with 26 congregate care
organizations to provide in-depth assessment, training, and technical assistance.
CCWT administered an evidence-based assessment known as the Trauma-Informed
Organizational Assessment (TIOA). This tool, developed by the National Child Traumatic Stress
Network, assesses whether an organization is trauma responsive across eight key metrics, and
identifies training and technical assistance needs. By the end of FY24, a total of 1,748 child-
serving professionals across the 26 organizations completed the TIOA through CCWT.
After the assessment, CCWT staff provided participating organizations with 9-12 months of
individualized training and technical assistance. This included training; regular coaching sessions
focused on practices, policies, and program implementation; and drafting and implementing
best practice materials. The process engaged every organizational level from leadership to direct
care staff. Based on this work, organizations modified their intake practices to be more trauma
responsive, implementing secondary traumatic stress interventions to increase staff retention,
and creating reflective supervision training and practices.
8

Office of the Child Advocate Annual Report, FY24
After that, organizations were reassessed using the TIOA to determine areas of improvement or
ongoing challenges. Overall, sites reported significant improvement across all nine domains of
the TIOA.
The OCA in Action: Meeting the Needs of Children
Dr. John* contacted the OCA regarding Ashley*, a youth in DCF care who was a frequent
visitor to Dr. John’s emergency department. Dr. John reported concerns regarding
Ashley’s frequent running away from her congregate care program and the program’s
ability to meet Ashley’s needs. Upon review of Ashley’s record, the OCA learned that
Ashley experienced extensive abuse at a young age resulting in some complex physical
and emotional needs with long-lasting effects. Through communication with the DCF
area office, Ashley was moved to another program that could meet her needs. Ashley
then contacted the OCA directly about not feeling safe at the new program and
inconsistent visits with her clinician. Through her own advocacy and advocacy of the
OCA, Ashley was moved to a more appropriate placement. The OCA continues to monitor
Ashley’s case to ensure that she is receiving the services she needs.
Goal 2: Prevention and Breaking the Cycle
There is a comprehensive, coordinated statewide approach to supporting families with the aim
of reducing child protective service and juvenile justice system involvement, particularly for
those families for whom persistent disparities in supports exist and for families with multi-
generational involvement.
Training for Mandated Reporters
The OCA chaired the Mandated Reporter Commission (MRC), established by the Childhood
Wellness Bill of 2019, from 2020-21. In 2021, the MRC published a report that, among other
things, identified the importance of providing profession-specific training to educate mandated
reporters on their responsibilities to identify and report child maltreatment to DCF. This includes
exploring correct identification of abuse and/or neglect, differentiating neglect from poverty,
considering the roles bias and cultural considerations play in evaluating whether to make a
report, and structured decision-making skills that will prevent potential overreporting of
families to the DCF system.
In response to the MRC’s findings, the OCA created and launched a free, online and on-demand
general training designed for all mandated reporters, as well as a module specifically designed
for school personnel that delves deeper into issues particularly relevant to Massachusetts K-12
educators. The training (both the general module and the profession-specific module) launched
in August of 2023. The OCA prioritized the creation of the educator-specific module because
schools are where children are most frequently seen outside the home and educators generate
the highest number of mandated reports submitted to DCF each year, making educators a
particularly important group to reach.
9

Office of the Child Advocate Annual Report, FY24
The trainings are accompanied by an extensive resource library, available online at any time and
without the prerequisite of taking the training. The resource library provides mandated
reporters with Massachusetts-specific resources to learn more about relevant topics and
services. The resource library also provides valuable tools to assist mandated reporters with
connecting families to services when concerns don’t rise to the level of abuse and/or neglect, as
well as an optional structured worksheet to help mandated reporters think through whether a
situation requires a report to DCF.
From August 21, 2023-June 30, 2024, a total of 7,897 individuals successfully completed the
training. A total of 341 organizations—including schools, childcare providers, religious groups,
medical and dental providers, and sports and recreation organizations—registered to assign the
training to their staff. A report describing the OCA mandated reporter training curriculum,
additional outcome data, lessons learned, and future evaluation and expansion plans will be
issued in FY25.
Massachusetts Youth Diversion Program
The OCA has prioritized expanding statewide diversion opportunities for youth and improving
community-based interventions as part of our focus on reducing juvenile justice system
involvement for the children in Massachusetts. In FY24, that work included an ongoing
partnership with The Department of Youth Services (DYS) to improve and expand the
Massachusetts Youth Diversion Program (MYDP), a youth diversion initiative that provides high-
quality, evidence-based youth programming that can serve as an alternative to arresting youth
or prosecuting them through the juvenile court. There is a strong body of research showing that
diverting youth away from the juvenile justice system can be an effective strategy for improving
life outcomes for youth, while preserving and protecting public safety and reducing court
processing costs.2
The OCA chairs the Juvenile Justice Policy and Data (JJPAD) Board. Based on the
recommendations made in the JJPAD Board’s 2019 report on diversion, and modeled after
JJPAD’s Model Program Guide, DYS and the OCA partnered to launch the MYDP as a pilot
program in December of 2021 in three counties. In FY23, the pilot phase of the program
concluded, and the program expanded to serve two additional counties. In FY24, two more
counties were added, resulting in juvenile diversion services available in Essex, Middlesex,
Worcester, Plymouth, Hampden, Bristol, and Barnstable (Cape and the Islands) counties.
The diversion services at each site include a diversion coordinator dedicated to accepting
referrals of youth to the program, conducting necessary assessments, developing a diversion
agreement, matching services, and providing ongoing case management. There is also a DYS-
funded diversion manager, who acts as a central coordinator across all sites.
The OCA works closely with our partners at DYS to monitor implementation. In FY24, this
included:

Office of the Child Advocate Annual Report, FY24
• Monthly reviews of program data, highlights of which were presented to the JJPAD
Board.
• Publishing two impact reports discussing data from Year 1 (published October 2023) and
Year 2 (published May 2024) of implementation.
• Partnering with ForHealth Consulting at UMass Chan Medical School to conduct an
extensive evaluation of the program, the results of which were published in August
2024.
As part of the FY24 Massachusetts state budget, with the full support of the OCA, funding and
full operational responsibility shifted to DYS for FY25 through the creation of a line item. The
OCA will continue to partner with DYS on the MYPD, with the ultimate goal of expanding the
program statewide to ensure youth across the Commonwealth have access to high-quality
diversion services.
Pretrial Detention & Dually Involved Youth
A wide body of research makes clear that even a short stay in pretrial detention3 can have a
significant negative impact on youth, including increasing their chances of re-offending and
deepening their systems involvement. It is therefore imperative that pretrial detention be used
as infrequently as possible. Massachusetts made a concerted effort to decrease the use of
pretrial detention for youth through initiatives, policy changes, and practice shifts, and was
largely successful: From FY15 to FY24, pretrial detention admissions for youth dropped by 57%.
However, use of pretrial detention has increased in recent years, including a 33% increase in
pretrial detention admissions from FY22 to FY24 and a 68% increase in youth
supervised/monitored pretrial by probation in FY23 compared to FY22.
The majority of youth who are detained are held as a result of bail or personal recognizance
being revoked after an alleged violation of pretrial or probation condition. Just under half (47%,
n=420) of all pretrial detention admissions in FY24 were for youth who were involved with DCF,
including some who were in the care and/or custody of the Commonwealth.4
This intersection between pretrial detention and other state service (primarily DCF) involvement
has not previously been publicly studied or reported in Massachusetts. The JJPAD Board
determined it was worth further examining and launched two initiatives: one focused on the
pretrial phase and one focused on dually involved youth who cross over from the child
protection system to DYS.
In FY24, OCA staff conducted stakeholder interviews, carried out a literature review of national
research, and requested and analyzed relevant state data for both projects. OCA staff also led
numerous JJPAD and subcommittee meetings that convened members from across child-serving
state agencies, the judiciary, and advocacy and provider communities to discuss these issues. In
3 See Appendix E: Glossary of Terms for a definition of pretrial detention.
4 “Youth who were involved with DCF” refers to a youth who already either was in the care/custody of DCF or had an open case
with DCF at the time of pretrial detention.
11

Office of the Child Advocate Annual Report, FY24
FY25, the JJPAD Board will publish a report on the pretrial phase and complete its research for
the dually involved youth project.
Roca, Inc.’s Young Mothers Program
Mothers younger than 20 are at higher risk for mental health challenges and may find parenting
very difficult, due to their age as well as the impact of any trauma on their parenting skills.5
Young mothers are more likely to be the victim/survivor of abuse and to have experienced high
levels of trauma. They also experience higher levels of PTSD and a higher incidence of substance
use disorder.6 Studies indicate those experiences may lead to higher risk of multi-generational
trauma and systems involvement.7 Their children are at higher risk of negative outcomes, such
as poor physical and mental health, lower academic achievement, and lower lifetime earnings in
adulthood.8

Massachusetts sites: Boston, Chelsea, Lynn, Holyoke, and Springfield.
The program also worked with Tufts University Interdisciplinary Evaluation Research in FY24 on
an implementation and outcome evaluation, including identification of key outcomes to track,
risk and needs assessment, assessment of the program’s impact on young children, dosage of
programming, model intensity, and length of programming. This evaluation is ongoing.
Review of Family Resource Network
Massachusetts Family Resource Centers (FRCs), overseen by DCF, are community-based centers
that provide a wide array of family support services. FRC services are meant to help reduce
family involvement with DCF and the Child Requiring Assistance (CRA) system in the juvenile

court. In FY24, the OCA conducted a review of FRCs and issued an April 2024 report making
recommendations for improvements to the FRC structure and operations.
Findings and recommendations in the FRC report are based on information gathered from
interviews and focus groups with a wide variety of executive branch, legislative, and judicial
stakeholders, community and advocacy organizations, FRC staff, and FRC consumers, as well as
an analysis of a large amount of data on FRC operations and children involved in other state
systems, including DCF and the CRA system. The findings from the report indicate that while
FRCs provide valuable support to families across the Commonwealth, there is considerable
variation from one FRC to another. Further, the recent expansion of the role and scope of FRCs
without staffing or budget expansions has led to staff stress and reduced focus on preventing
systems involvement. Similarly, the landscape of human services has changed in critical ways
since FRCs were first procured, resulting in duplication of services and/or lack of alignment in
key areas. Many more families across the Commonwealth could likely benefit from FRC services.
Increased alignment with, and support from, other state and local entities would help improve
FRC effectiveness.
The report also issued recommendations for improvement in the following categories:
• Focus FRCs on a priority goal of preventing entry (or re-entry) to the child protective
services and Child Requiring Assistance systems.
• Expand funding for FRCs, which should be funneled toward increasing staff and
expanding sites.
• Enhance support from, and integration with, other state systems and services.
In FY25, the OCA will continue to advocate for these recommendations with the Legislature and
key state agencies. The OCA will also offer continued technical assistance to support the
advancement of these vital changes.
The OCA in Action: Ensuring a Safer Future
Megan* contacted the OCA on behalf of her son Albert*, who was physically assaulted by a
counselor at an after-school program. Megan reported that the incident was significant in
nature and resulted in the counselor’s termination from the program as well as Albert needing
therapy to process the incident. Megan’s concerns included poor communication from the
program about the incident and poor communication from DCF regarding the
investigation. The OCA discovered that several reports of abuse and neglect were filed with
DCF on behalf of Albert regarding the assault, and both were screened out, with the rationale
that the child is no longer at risk from the counselor as a result of the counselor’s
termination. The OCA reached out to the DCF area office about the need to investigate the
incident to ensure there is no future risk to other children. The area office filed a new report
which was supported so that the abusive counselor is now listed in DCF’s central registry of
abusers.

Child Sexual Abuse Prevention Task Force
The OCA has served as the co-chair of the Child Sexual Abuse Prevention (CSAP) Task Force in
partnership with the Children’s Trust since 2014. Although the Task Force’s legislative
authorization expired in November 2022, the work of the Task Force continues through the
commitment of the OCA and the Children’s Trust and continued funding from the General
Court. The OCA and Children’s Trust chose to transition the Task Force into an advisory council
following the end of the group’s statutory authorization. The advisory council continues to
convene experts in the field to discuss CSAP strategies and to implement the Safe Kids Thrive
website, which provides modules for youth-serving organizations to conduct a self-assessment
to evaluate child safety and then adopt the sexual abuse prevention framework.
In FY25, the OCA and Children’s Trust will complete development and begin implementation of a
new three-year strategic plan focused on the following six goals:
• Increase youth-serving organizations’ awareness of, access to, and utilization of CSAP
training and technical assistance.
• Develop a comprehensive approach to the response and prevention of problematic
sexual behaviors in children and adolescents.
• Build awareness of CSAP and improve access and utilization of CSAP resources for
parents and caregivers.
• Enhance state policies and programs to promote CSAP and reduce systemic barriers to
implementation.
• Increase the availability of CSAP research and data critical to meeting CSAP goals.
• Refocus CSAP partnerships to successfully implement the previously listed goals.
The OCA will lead projects related to policy development, legislative advocacy, and research to
advance these goals.
Goal 3: Transition Into Adulthood
Youth receiving state services transition into adulthood with the support they need to
succeed.
Supporting High-Risk Young Mothers
Transitioning into adulthood comes sooner and is fraught with additional challenges for young
parents, especially young mothers. The Department of Transitional Assistance (DTA) and the
Department of Public Health oversee programs focused on supporting young mothers, including
a service provider network of close to 100 providers. CCWT partnered with DTA and DPH to
increase trauma responsive resources training and technical assistance to that provider
network. In FY24, the team developed an eight-module toolkit for young parent providers and
implemented a five-session training series for the provider network on the toolkit, covering
topics such as the developmental needs of adolescents, trauma resilience and healing-centered
engagement, and best practices in working with parents under 25. The toolkit was successfully
piloted and fully launched in October 2024 and can be found at Supporting Parents Under 25: A
toolkit for, and by, Young Parent Program—Child Trauma and Wellbeing. Assuring that services
14

Office of the Child Advocate Annual Report, FY24
for young parents are trauma-informed and responsive improves service delivery and can
support successful transition into adulthood.
Transition Aged Youth Housing Stabilization & Support Program
For youth transitioning to adulthood from childhood involvement with state systems such as
DCF, it is vital they have access to safe and stable housing once they turn 18 years old. Youth can
opt in for additional DCF services after they turn 18, although some youth choose not to do so.
Youth who do not opt in for additional services are at high risk of homelessness, disrupted
education, unemployment, and behavioral health challenges.
In early 2021, the OCA partnered with the Executive Office of Health and Human Services
(EOHHS) to launch a Transition Aged Youth (TAY) Housing Stabilization and Support Program
(HSSP) pilot project. The goal of this project was to better connect youth in DCF custody with
supports to help their transition to adulthood when those youth choose not to sign a Voluntary
Placement Agreement post-age 18.
The HSSP program provides youth (17 and over) who have decided not to opt in to DCF services
after turning 18, or are unlikely to opt in, with access to a dedicated young adult housing
stability specialist employed by a community-based organization, who can help them connect to
housing, education, employment, income, and other supports.
For the first several years of the program the OCA and EOHHS partnered with UMass Chan
Medical School to conduct an evaluation of the program. Data from the program shows that the
HSSP has yielded a consistently positive impact on its participants, as youth were significantly
more likely to have secure housing and employment after participation.
The FY24 evaluation concluded the pilot and evaluation phases of this successful program. From
FY25 onward, data collection and analysis will be conducted by EOHHS. The OCA supports the
transition to a solely EOHHS program. This is consistent with the OCA’s strategy of partnering
with state entities to design, implement, and evaluate innovative pilot programs and then step
back once that phase is complete and the program is established.
Goal 4: Addressing the Needs of Diverse Populations
Our state child-serving systems are addressing the needs of traditionally underserved
populations, including racially and ethnically diverse populations, LGBTQ+ youth, and
newcomer families.
Trauma-Informed and Responsive Services for Newcomers
The number of migrant families coming to Massachusetts has significantly increased in recent
years and includes many children and families who experienced significant trauma.10 In
response to this increase in newcomers, the Commonwealth created Welcome Centers and
10 “...the administration has logged more than 11,000 migrants from October 2022 through September 2023, the federal fiscal
year. That represents an increase of more than 152 percent over the previous fiscal year.” Gross, S. J. (2024, April 1). How Many
Migrants Have Arrived in Massachusetts? It’s Hard to Know for Sure, but They Keep Coming. - The Boston Globe.
BostonGlobe.com. https://www.bostonglobe.com/2024/04/01/metro/how-many-migrants-in-massachusetts/
15

Office of the Child Advocate Annual Report, FY24
placed families with children in need of housing in hotels and other non-traditional locations.
Due to the exigency of the situation, some shelters were set up quite rapidly. Shelter staff
quickly recognized the acuity of the needs of the newcomer families and how deeply affected
many of them are by trauma.
CCWT partnered with the Executive Office of Housing and Living Communities (EOHLC), EOHHS,
and the Department of Early Education and Care (EEC) to support shelter staff providers and
other staff working to support newcomers. CCWT immediately responded, creating and
executing training to providers on trauma-responsive interventions and tools. Over 1,000
attendees across the Commonwealth, including providers working with children in shelters,
participated in the three-part training series. Sessions focused on understanding trauma and its
impact on newcomers; promising practices for working with newcomers, with a focus on
reducing or preventing re-traumatization; and addressing the secondary traumatic stress
experienced by staff providing support to these children and families. While initially focused on
the EOHLC and EEC’s Coordinated Family and Community Engagement (CFCE) contracted
partners, the training series expanded to include staff from various child-serving systems
statewide, such as DTA, DCF, DPH, and public schools from multiple districts. Representatives
from Catholic Charities, Boys and Girls Clubs, YMCAs, and other agencies across the
Commonwealth also participated. Over 90% of participants indicated that they found the
sessions provided valuable information that improved the quality of how they interacted with
newcomer families and children.
Beyond training support, the OCA also provided concrete material resources. Shelters at hotels
and other nontraditional shelter sites had limited places for young children to play. The OCA
provided funding to EEC to create play spaces in larger hotel and emergency shelter locations.
The play spaces were designed to be trauma-informed, using a soothing color palate and
natural woods and incorporating toys that encourage creativity, allowing children to develop
their own play, rather than pre-scripted materials or toys with batteries.
The OCA also provided funding for EEC to expand services for families with young children. The
funds allowed 22 CFCE grantees to increase the provision of multi-generational and related child
development activities for 7,435 children in 37 emergency assistance shelters. In addition to
running a large number of playgroups, the funding allowed for the purchase of supplies and
materials given to families to extend learning, such as books in Haitian Creole, Spanish,
Portuguese, and English. Over 5,580 educational materials (e.g. culturally and developmentally
relevant items, such as counting blocks, puzzles, and spatial awareness toys) and over 8,690
books were distributed.
Assessing Opportunities for Improving Language Access to Services
One in four Massachusetts residents speaks a language other than English at home.11 Language
access is critical to ensuring individuals are aware of, able to access, and benefit from supports
available to them. However, sufficient language access supports are inconsistently available in
11 Census Bureau Profile—Massachusetts. https://data.census.gov/profile/Massachusetts?g=040XX00US25
16

Office of the Child Advocate Annual Report, FY24
many government services, creating a major barrier for individuals accessing government-
provided services, resources, and information.
On September 13, 2023, Massachusetts Governor Maura Healey signed Executive Order #615,
Promoting Access to Government Services and Information by Identifying and Minimizing
Language Access Barriers. The purpose of this Executive Order is to ensure equitable delivery of
services and resources for residents with limited English proficiency (LEP) by requiring
Massachusetts executive department agencies to develop language access plans. This is a
welcome development demonstrating the Commonwealth’s commitment to addressing this
challenge.
Providing sufficient language access can be a particular challenge for state-contracted child and
family service providers, which in many cases are smaller community-based organizations. The
OCA is working in partnership with service providers to identify gaps and opportunities for
improvement as well as creative solutions, including those that could be deployed more
efficiently at scale, with the goal of making recommendations to state agencies that fund these
services.
Throughout FY24, the OCA interviewed individuals at state-contracted child and family service
organizations to better understand the challenges service providers face in serving families for
whom English is not a primary language. These interviews informed the development of a
language access needs-assessment survey covering the following domains:
• Understanding how LEP individuals interact with state-contracted service providers.
• Identification and assessment of LEP communities that are served by service providers.
• Provision of language assistance services.
• Organizational policies and contracted staff training.
The OCA’s research and work in this area will continue in FY25.
Toolkits for Providers Working with LGBTQ+ Youth
LGBTQ+ youth experience higher levels of trauma, bullying, harassment, violence, physical and
sexual abuse, and bias compared to their heterosexual and cisgender peers.12 They also
experience higher levels of suicide and mental health complexities. Ensuring that human
services providers can recognize and address the needs of LGBTQ+ youth, which can help them
better support these youth who may be dealing with challenging situations, is a critical goal of
the OCA.
In FY24, CCWT partnered with experts, including an LGBTQ+ youth advisory group, to develop a
series of trainings and toolkits to support providers working with the LGBTQ+ youth population.
This process included determining local and national best practices, working with experts who
identify as LGBTQ+, completing interviews and focus groups with LGBTQ+ youth, and developing
a series of trainings for community providers, educators, and healthcare workers.

Sexual Orientation. JAMA Psychiatry, 79(4), 377. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35195677/
17

Office of the Child Advocate Annual Report, FY24
CCWT developed three online toolkits geared to specific provider populations. By tailoring the
information to each setting, providers can obtain concrete solutions and approaches to reducing
trauma, healing, and promoting resilience for LGBTQ+ youth.
Goal 5: High/Complex Behavioral Health Needs
The needs of children and youth with high and/or complex behavioral health needs—
including the need for timely delivery of and navigation to appropriate support—are met.
Addressing Problematic Sexual Behavior
Children who exhibit problematic sexual behaviors (PSB)13 can face complex behavioral health
and educational challenges that greatly impact their lives at home and in their communities.
Although they may at some point and in some circumstances become involved with the child
protection and/or juvenile justice systems, there is no one state agency statutorily responsible
for ensuring that children with PSB receive the appropriate interventions and services. Instead,
there is a patchwork system for identifying and serving children in need of support in this area.
And despite the efforts of many, critical service gaps exist.
As co-chair of the Massachusetts Legislative Task Force for the Prevention of Child Sexual Abuse,
the OCA received concerns from professionals across sectors regarding these gaps in services for
children who engage in PSB. Research shows that most sexual assaults of children are
committed by other children; it also shows that with the right therapeutic supports, children
who exhibit PSB are highly unlikely to recidivate.14,15 This means that addressing the needs of
children with PSB is vital both for the children themselves and for child sexual abuse prevention
in general.
OCA staff conducted interviews with over 60 providers and stakeholders across child-serving
sectors about PSB, including members of the CSAP PSB working group, followed by quantitative
data analysis of the findings and an extensive review of evidence-based research on this topic.
Through that work the OCA found that in Massachusetts:
• Many of the identification and referral pathways for PSB do not lead to services for
children.
• There are gaps in services to prevent and effectively respond to PSB.
• There are inequitable and, at times, overly punitive responses to PSB incidents.
• There is a lack of data to inform needs and system response.
13 Problematic sexual behaviors involve sexual body parts, happen outside of children’s expected developmental trajectory,
cause harm to the child who is exhibiting the behaviors or to others, and do not respond to typical caregiving strategies.

Office of the Child Advocate Annual Report, FY24
In FY25, the OCA will release a report detailing the above-mentioned findings and making
recommendations for Massachusetts to have a more effective and trauma-responsive system of
supports for children who engage in PSB and their families.
Supporting Children with Trauma-Related Behavioral Needs in Early Education & Care Settings
Trauma can have significant impacts on a child’s physical and emotional well-being. When
children experience trauma, it can affect their ability to form relationships, regulate their
emotions, and learn. Early education and care settings offer unique opportunities to promote
safety and well-being for children with trauma histories. Trauma-informed and responsive
approaches in early learning settings can reduce stress, anxiety, and depression in children. They
can also reduce educators’ stress and feelings of helplessness when they are responding to
children with trauma histories. Creating a trauma-informed and responsive early education and
care environment is critical for supporting the needs of children who have experienced trauma
and ensuring their success in learning and development.
Educators may struggle to support children with trauma-related behavioral needs. Early
education and care programs often struggle to prevent exclusionary practices in response to
challenging behaviors. To address this challenge, CCWT is partnering with EEC to design and
implement a multi-pronged approach to developing and sustaining a trauma-responsive early
education system.
This work includes:
• Learning Management System Training: Developing an online foundational training in
trauma, race, resilience, and the Guiding Principles of Trauma-Informed and Responsive
Care for all EEC providers. This asynchronous training was completed in December 2024
and will be provided to all early childhood educators starting in February 2025.
• Professional Development Core Champions Training: To continue supporting educators
to develop their trauma-responsive skills, this series will offer additional training and
technical assistance to support educators and program staff and prepare them to cope
with the challenging work of serving young children impacted by trauma and their
families. The series will launch in February 2025.
• Trauma-Responsive Training for Frontline EEC Staff: To support EEC licensors and
investigators, CCWT is offering full-day trainings on trauma, race, and resilience. This
work will launch in January 2025.

Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and Unintentional Fatalities Due to Wandering
Since 2018, the OCA has collaborated with the chair of the Child Fatality Review (CFR) program
in the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner (OCME) and DPH to implement and continuously
improve the CFR program.16 As part of that effort, the CFR program began exploring
demographic inequities in child fatalities in 2020. In FY24, the program focused on exploring
inequities in fatality rates associated with autism spectrum disorder. While ASD is not a life-
limiting diagnosis, specific behaviors and an affinity for water sometimes seen in children with
ASD can contribute to an increased risk of unintentional fatality.17,18 A 2017 study of National
Vital Statistics data from 2010-16 reported that drowning was the leading cause of death for
children with ASD, many instances of which occurred within the context of unsupervised
elopement from the child’s home (also known as wandering).19 In FY24, CFR staff conducted a
literature review and more than 40 key informant interviews to gather information on best
practices in wandering prevention and the accessibility of those best practices in Massachusetts.
The OCA in Action: A Door to Children’s Rights
Gabrielle* is a 17-year-old youth in the custody of DCF who resides out of state in a
congregate care setting. Gabrielle contacted the OCA reporting that the door to her
bedroom was taken off the hinges. Gabrielle stated this was a concern for her because she
was unable to use her coping skills privately when she became dysregulated. The OCA
contacted both Massachusetts DCF and the out-of-state agency advocating for Gabrielle’s
door to be returned, as removal of the door is a violation of her rights. The OCA learned
that the program has a ‘no-closed-door’ policy and will remove doors from youth to ensure
their safety. The out-of-state licensing agency noted that there are no restrictions in their
regulations about removing a youth’s door. As a result, updates are being made to the
licensing agency’s rules and regulations, making it a violation of a child’s rights to remove
their bedroom door.
Promoting Trauma-Responsive Practices in Schools
Since 2021, there has been an increase in mental health disorders in youth, including
depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation.20 This increased prevalence of mental health
challenges is concerning, especially because mental health challenges were already the number
one cause of disability and poor life outcomes in young people before the COVID-19
pandemic.21 The OCA, through CCWT and in partnership with Thriving Minds, has supported

youth in school settings through a training and technical assistance group focused on mental
health in schools.
In FY24, Thriving Minds offered more than 25 professional learning community sessions in four
different series, to share information with practitioners across schools and districts and to
support the implementation of specific strategies for advancing mental health and trauma-
responsive practices. Topics included Navigating the Effects of Vicarious Trauma; Trauma-
Focused Therapeutic Supports: Practices and Techniques for School Mental Health Staff; Special
Topics on Marginalized Populations; and Unpacking Tier I Trauma-informed Supports for
Students. Thriving Minds also provided tailored coaching for over a dozen school districts
working to implement trauma-responsive practices and strengthen students’ social and
emotional learning, behavioral and mental health, and wellness. Each district was paired with an
experienced coach who provided ongoing support and guidance.
Goal 6: Awareness of Services
Families and youth, and those who serve them, are aware of available supports and
services.
Youth Engagement Initiative and Increased Complaint Line Outreach
The OCA Complaint Line is available for anyone to express concern or seek information and
resources about a state service a child or young adult is receiving or is eligible to receive, and
our statute prioritizes youth as a target group for the Complaint Line. Yet, consistent with prior
years, in FY24 youth accounted for roughly 2% of the individuals who contacted the Complaint
Line. The OCA recognizes this lack of contact from youth is likely due to a lack of awareness of
our Complaint Line among this population.
To better reach youth, the OCA designed a Complaint Line outreach campaign specifically to
ensure that youth who may need information, guidance, or help are aware of the OCA
Complaint Line and how to access it. This project is called the OCA Youth Engagement Initiative
and is designed with an initial focus on youth in congregate care settings. The OCA drafted
materials, including a poster, and engaged with providers and others for feedback as to the best
ways to disseminate these materials. The OCA surveyed employees of DCF, DYS, the Department
of Mental Health (DMH), the Commission on LGBTQ Youth, the Children’s League of
Massachusetts, and others to develop these materials. The poster will be displayed in EEC-
licensed congregate care facilities aiming to increase awareness of the Complaint Line. See
Appendix F: Complaint Line Poster for the poster.
In addition to outreach to youth, the OCA is continuously working to increase awareness about
the Complaint Line more generally. In FY24 the OCA conducted three briefings for legislators
and their staff about the Complaint Line. The OCA also hosted meet-and-greets with other state
ombuds, including with DMH, the Department of Developmental Services (DDS), DCF,
MassHealth, the Massachusetts Commission for the Blind, and the Massachusetts Commission
for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing. We continue to update the resources listed on the OCA
21

Office of the Child Advocate Annual Report, FY24
website to streamline information and resources. The OCA plans to continue this outreach in
the next fiscal year.
Service Mapping and System Navigation
Through the Complaint Line, OCA quality assurance staff provided support to 379 people as
they navigated ombuds, legal, child protective services, and educational systems. Providing that
navigation requires constant scanning of the service landscape in Massachusetts and staying
abreast of new and changed agency policies and programs. To support that work, OCA staff
undertook a service mapping project by compiling a list of procurements, contracted entities,
and programs that provide direct services to children.22
The service mapping project led to a rudimentary overview of all state-provided child services in
Massachusetts. According to the search, 21 state agencies provide direct service using well over
200 service models and with over 12,000 licensed, contracted, or regulated organizations.
Findings from that landscape assessment were vetted with select agencies and shared with key
partners on an as-needed basis. The project highlights the depth of programs and services
available in Massachusetts, as well as the challenge facing people who are trying to navigate the
service landscape and maintain up-do-date lists of services, providers, and eligibility. The OCA is
exploring service and system navigation landscapes for opportunities to streamline access to,
and information about, state-sponsored direct services.
Understanding Trauma Supports for Massachusetts Children and Families
As chair of the Childhood Trauma Task Force (CTTF), the OCA staffs the research, writing, and
presentation of findings about how the Commonwealth can better identify and provide services
to youth who have experienced trauma. In FY24, CTTF’s research efforts focused on learning
more about trauma supports in three key sectors: early education and care, K-12 schools, and
juvenile justice. To better understand these supports, CTTF set up panel presentations from
state agencies and community-based organizations about their efforts to support children and
families who have experienced trauma as well as the staff that works with them. These
presentations are discussed in CTTF’s 2023 Annual Report. The report shares that there is no
single repository of all available trauma services in Massachusetts. Organizations often develop
their own provider directories for internal use, while others rely on various existing directories.
Directories available to the public include:
• Massachusetts Behavioral Health Help Line, funded by DMH and operated by the
Massachusetts Behavioral Health Partnership, connects individuals to a range of
treatment services for mental health and substance use.
• LINK-KID, a referral system of UMass Chan Medical School, was created to streamline
access to evidence-based trauma treatments.
22 The OCA defines direct services as “any type of state-sponsored assistance or support that involves personal interaction
between a provider and a recipient.” In Massachusetts, some direct services are provided by Commonwealth employees, some
are regulated or licensed by the Commonwealth, and some are delivered through contracts, which are governed by
procurements and funding criteria.
22

Office of the Child Advocate Annual Report, FY24
• Network of Care Massachusetts, a directory of over 5,000 programs and organizations
across the Commonwealth, is managed by the Massachusetts Association for Mental
Health and privately funded.
• Massachusetts Behavioral Health Partnership’s directory includes over 1,200 behavioral
health providers from their network.
• William James College INTERFACE Referral Service is a toll-free line to help families find
licensed mental health providers that match the caller’s location, insurance, and
specialty needs. This service is only open during the workday and is limited to 53
participating municipalities in Central Massachusetts, MetroWest, and the South Shore.
In FY25, the OCA will continue to focus on better understanding related training requirements of
professionals working for child-serving state agencies.
The OCA in Action: Addressing Concerns and Ensuring Better Care
Annabelle* contacted the OCA with concerns for their 16-year-old daughter, Genevieve*.
Genevieve has been involved with DMH for years due to concerns around suicidal ideations
and self-harming behaviors. Annabelle had concerns regarding Genevieve’s treatment while
in a DMH facility as Genevieve was making minimal-to-no improvements. The OCA reached
out to DMH and was able to discuss Annabelle’s concerns regarding Genevieve with DMH
senior leadership. With this collaboration the OCA was able to learn more about Genevieve’s
needs. Genevieve was able to be transferred to another intensive DMH facility where some of
Annabelle’s concerns could be addressed.
Goal 7: High-Quality Data
Our state agencies serving children and families use high-quality data to inform decision
making and continuous quality improvement.
Juvenile Justice Policy and Data Board Annual Data Report
The JJPAD Board, which is chaired and staffed by the OCA, released its 2023 JJPAD Annual
Report in January 2024. This report describes FY23 juvenile justice system data trends and key
takeaways, including:
• There was an increase in use of the juvenile justice system in Massachusetts in FY23
compared to FY22, and, generally, there has been an increase in system use since pre-
pandemic (FY19). This increase begins at the “front door” of the system with an increase
in applications for complaint (driven in particular by an increase in arrests) and continues
through all major court process points.
• This increase is driven by increases in cases involving youth alleged of
misdemeanor/lower-level offenses. This is true even at process points that involve
taking a youth into custody (e.g., arrests, detention), which generally involve more
serious offenses.
23

Office of the Child Advocate Annual Report, FY24
• The number of cases of youth entering and moving through the juvenile justice system
in FY23 was lower than it was prior to passage of the Criminal Justice Reform Act (CJRA)
(FY18). However, if the recent rates of increase over the past two years continue,
system use will revert to pre-CJRA levels in the next one to two years.
• Additionally, racial and ethnic disparities worsened at the beginning stages of the
system compared to the prior fiscal year, particularly with regard to applications for
complaint brought by arrest rather than by a court summons.
• Youth held at DYS have higher rates of behavioral health needs, educational challenges,
and—in some cases—trauma than last fiscal year, including an increase in the
percentage of youth detained who have current child welfare system involvement.
JJPAD encouraged the state to implement the numerous recommendations that it has made in
prior reports within the following three themes:
• Increase opportunities to divert youth away from the system prior to court involvement.
• Address the policies and practices in the Commonwealth contributing to racial and
ethnic disparities in the juvenile justice system.
• Improve the triaging of and access to supports for youth with unmet needs.
The OCA will publish the JJPAD’s 2024 Annual Report in early 2025.
Juvenile Justice Data Website
To make informed policy recommendations, our state agencies and the public need access to
high-quality data across all juvenile justice system process points. The OCA’s Interactive Juvenile
Justice System Data Website was created with that mission in mind, using data provided to the
OCA by our partners in the judiciary and executive branches through the annual JJPAD data
collection process.
The OCA partnered with our colleagues at the Executive Office of Technology Services and
Security to launch the webpage in 2020, with significant input and collaboration with the
entities contributing data to the website. The website was launched in 2020, and the OCA
continues to build new pages as juvenile justice system partners have increased their data
availability.
In FY24, OCA staff maintained the data website, updated the data to include FY23 trends, and
(as discussed below) created a new page dedicated to measures of racial and ethnic disparities.
In FY25, the OCA plans to release new webpages dedicated to presenting data on how youth
enter the juvenile justice system (i.e., arrests/summons) and how cases are resolved. The OCA
will update data across the website to include FY24 updates.
Racial and Ethnic Disparities in our Juvenile Justice System
It is well documented that racial and ethnic disparities are persistent in our state’s juvenile
justice system. The OCA-chaired JJPAD Board has highlighted these disparities in the juvenile
justice system in each of its annual reports as well as in its 2022 Racial and Ethnic Disparities at
the Front Door of Massachusetts’ Juvenile Justice System. To address racial and ethnic
24

Office of the Child Advocate Annual Report, FY24
disparities in a system as complex as the juvenile justice system, comprised of multiple state and
local agencies, our state must rely on accurate data reporting and measures of disparity. This
data must be accessible to the public. Toward this aim, in FY24, the OCA launched a new page
on our Juvenile Justice System Interactive Data Website that reports specially on racial and
ethnic disparities over time and across process points in the juvenile justice system.
This new racial and ethnic disparities page explains how we measure disparities in the juvenile
justice system and gives users the ability to explore the racial and ethnic disparities that exist
across juvenile justice process points and over time. The dashboards detail data reported by the
Trial Court, Massachusetts Probation Services, and DYS as part of the JJPAD Board annual
reporting process.
DCF Annual Report Public Comment Project
In December 2022, the Child Welfare Data Work Group (DWG), co-chaired by DCF and the OCA,
released its final report based on a multi-year analysis of ways to streamline and improve public
reporting by DCF. The DCF FY22 Annual Report reflects the changes recommended in DWG’s
final report.23 To ensure the redesigned report accomplishes the goals set before the DWG, the
OCA issued a request for public comment in June 2023. The public comment request guided
members of the public to submit written comments about the utility of the FY22 Annual Report
and the extent to which the redesign meets the needs of the public.
The OCA received seven responses to the call for public comments. Respondents acknowledged
the improvements made in the DCF annual report and stated that more of the data they are
looking for is now available. They also provided feedback and insight into additional data,
context, and analysis that they believe would improve the utility of the DCF annual report.
Those improvements most frequently related to reporting on education, neglect allegation
subclassifications, consumer characteristics, budget revenue and expenditures, decision-
making, placements, and service provision. In particular, respondents were looking for
improvements and additions to stratifications by identity characteristics, such as race, ethnicity,
and gender identity. In total, respondents requested an additional 152 metrics, submitted 20
research questions related to their work, and provided numerous examples of additional
narratives, explanations, and definitions that, if addressed, would better serve their needs.
In collaboration with DCF, the OCA reviewed each response, organized the requests and
feedback, then conducted a feasibility assessment. The assessment showed that several of the
requests are now feasible using the new Child Protective Services Dashboard, which launched in
July 2023, or through sources such as the Foster Care Review Annual Report and National Youth
In Transition Data Set. It also found that many requests are currently being considered by DCF,
while others need additional information or clarity, or pose data quality or privacy concerns.
Overall, the assessment found that while the new annual report structure is more complete,
there is still more that can and should be done to ensure child protective services data are as
transparent, robust, and user-friendly as possible.
Based on the review, the OCA makes the following five priority recommendations:
23 FY22 took place from July 1, 2021-June 30, 2022.
25

Office of the Child Advocate Annual Report, FY24
• DCF, the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education (DESE), and the OCA
should develop a strategy for making information on educational outcomes for DCF-
involved children more accessible and robust.
• DCF should define subcategories for neglect and work to build more nuanced neglect
reporting into the DCF data structure.
• DCF should add additional data metrics to the annual report where feasible,
especially related to mandated reporting and TAY.
• DCF should continue to conduct an annual review to determine if metrics with data
quality concerns have improved enough to be considered for reporting.
• The Legislature should ensure DCF and the Executive Office of Health and Human
Services Information Technology team that supports DCF are adequately staffed and
funded to produce highly contextualized and robust data reports.
Respondents and the OCA acknowledge that addressing everything described in the comments
would take time and that a staggered improvement approach would achieve more in the long
run.
Goal 8: OCA Capacity
The Office of the Child Advocate has the expertise, reputation, relationships, capacity, and
operational infrastructure to execute its mission.
Incorporation of the Center on Child Wellbeing & Trauma
The Center on Child Wellbeing & Trauma was incorporated into the OCA. This move provides
the Commonwealth with an evidence-based state agency resource for training and technical
assistance related to trauma-informed and responsive practices for children.24
Growth in Staff & Operations
The incorporation of CCWT required the OCA to create new positions to support both the work
of CCWT as well as the operations of the OCA. In total, the OCA grew from 20 staff at the end of
FY23 to 30 at the end of FY24. To support the growing team, the OCA revised the employee
handbook and engaged all staff in strategic planning and updated policies. The senior leadership
team created a plan for regular all-staff in-service training and professional development
sessions geared toward intra-agency engagement, knowledge sharing, and collaboration.
Data Collection CQI
The OCA is committed to excellence and believes that continuous quality improvement,
including regular reviews and updates to our data collection system and reporting structure, will
enable us and the agencies we oversee to deliver timely, effective, and culturally responsive
services. As such, substantial changes were made to the OCA data collection system in FY24.
The OCA revised our data collection system to streamline reporting on areas that we have
determined are of concern, to streamline findings from OCA case reviews, and to track the
24 See About the Office of the Child Advocate, pg. 96.
26

Office of the Child Advocate Annual Report, FY24
OCA’s follow-up and outreach to state agencies. Since 2018, the OCA has utilized Salesforce, a
cloud-based database system, to record and track the work of the OCA quality assurance team.
Salesforce allows the OCA to track quantitative and qualitative information about children,
perpetrators, institutions, and other incident-specific information that comes to our attention. It
also provides flexibility to customize data metrics and reports to identify emerging and ongoing
trends across the child-serving system.
The revision to the data collection system resulted in improvement in the OCA’s capacity to
identify concerns with the provision of state services, regardless of how the information was
brought to the OCA’s attention. The revision also permitted the collection of additional
information about the actions the OCA took to address issues it identified through a case review
and an external agency’s response to the OCA’s feedback. Finally, the system revision
streamlines data collection of identity characteristics such as race, ethnicity, sex, gender, sexual
orientation, disabilities, and systems involvement.
27

Office of the Child Advocate Annual Report, FY24
Oversight Functions
The OCA is required by statute (Chapter 18C of the Massachusetts General Laws) to perform
several functions to ensure that children involved with an executive branch agency, particularly
children served by the child protective services or juvenile justice systems, receive timely, safe,
and effective services. Fulfilling these duties is our top priority and includes the following:
• Complaint Line:25 Respond to concerns about state services provided to individual
children or families. Youth, family members, foster parents, advocates, attorneys, and
other various individuals contact the OCA Complaint Line to express concerns, ask
questions, or receive resources and information about a service a child is receiving or
eligible to receive.
• Critical Incident Reports:26 Receive and review reports from state agencies regarding
children or youth who die or experience a near fatality, serious bodily injury, or an
emotional injury while receiving state services.
• Foster Care Review Safety Alerts:27 Receive and review DCF Foster Care Review safety
alerts (as of July 2022).
• Supported Reports of Abuse and/or Neglect in Out-of-Home Settings:28 Receive and
review DCF reports of supported allegations of abuse and/or neglect of children in out-
of-home settings.
• Investigations: The OCA may initiate a formal investigation when we determine the
actions or inactions of a reporting agency were egregious and significantly contributed
to the harm of a child or young adult. Typically, a critical incident report brings cases to
our attention for investigation, though the OCA has discretion to investigate any matter
that aligns with our statutory oversight obligations. Formal investigations may be non-
public or public. Formal investigations include recommendations for implementation
which the OCA monitors through our ongoing oversight.29
25 See Appendix E: Glossary of Terms for definitions.
26 See Appendix E: Glossary of Terms.
27 Foster Care Review Safety Alerts are not a statutory obligation of the OCA, however they are reviewed and analyzed in the
same fashion as CIRs. For more information about Foster Care Review safety alerts, see the FY23 OCA Annual Report.

Abuse and/or Neglect in
Out-of-Home Settings
When a complaint, critical incident report, Foster Care Review safety alert, or DCF-supported
report of abuse and/or neglect in an out-of-home setting is received, the OCA quality assurance
staff conduct an immediate review to learn more about the circumstances that brought it to the
attention of the OCA and any state agency involvement with the child and family. When the OCA
determines that the actions or inactions of an agency may have contributed to the complaint or
incident, or that the child, youth, or family is not receiving the services required to meet their
needs, we may request additional reports from the agency, speak with agency senior leadership
staff, and/or further review case records to learn more about the family’s history and
involvement with the agency. Through internal review of a complaint or report received, when
the OCA identifies an individual case practice concern or system-wide pattern or trend, we
contact the agency involved and take necessary steps to resolve the matter.
While the OCA reviews all complaints and reports received from or about all child-serving state
agencies, the OCA’s mandate is to focus on the children in the care and/or custody of DCF and
DYS.31 Complaints about DCF and reports received from DCF undergo a thorough review of the
family’s DCF electronic record. The purpose of this review is to understand the family and their
needs, to substantively review DCF’s understanding of the family and their needs, and to
evaluate DCF’s efforts to assist and engage the family and protect the child from harm. In this
context, the OCA will identify what worked well and where there are opportunities for
improvement in policy and case practice across the system or with the specific family, and
identify state agency policy, case practice, and service delivery concerns. When the OCA
determines follow-up with a state agency is necessary, we confirm that the agency involved
received the OCA feedback and that all case practice concerns identified through the OCA’s
review are resolved appropriately and in a timely manner to ensure the safety and well-being
of the children involved and/or to improve services for the family.
In addition to our work improving the individual quality and delivery of services to children and
families, the OCA uses the information reported to our office in these key areas to inform our
30 This number includes both complaints and inquiries related to information and referrals. Complaint Line inquiries do not
always involve a specific child, nor do individuals always share details about specific children for whom they have a concern or
request.
31 See Appendix E: Glossary of Terms for a definition of state custody. Please note, children in state custody are not always
placed out-of-home.
29

Office of the Child Advocate Annual Report, FY24
work across the state child-serving systems. This includes identifying preventative actions the
Commonwealth can take to reduce the incidence of harm to all children and young adults,
making recommendations for policy and practice changes to prevent future risks to children,
and identifying trends where the Commonwealth would benefit from additional data gathering
and analysis. Our quality assurance work also informs us of our day-to-day oversight of state
agencies, our participation in the Child Fatality Review program, our various other boards and
commissions, and related research projects.
The following section of this report explains the OCA quality assurance core functions, findings,
and actions taken based on the improved data captured in FY24. Additional years of data are
presented where necessary to provide context and show trends. In aggregate, these data inform
OCA’s special initiatives and oversight of state agencies.
Complaint Line
One of the most critical OCA statutory functions is Complaint: An expression of
responding to concerns about state services provided to dissatisfaction with any agency
children. The OCA Complaint Line is available for anyone to or program that provides

specific topic.
child receiving state services is encouraged to contact the
OCA Complaint Line.
OCA Complaint Line staff are skilled social workers who serve as system navigators and are
available to provide support, information, resources, non-legal advice and, at times, be a neutral
arbitrator between an individual and the agency of concern. When Complaint Line staff
determine that the decision making or practices of a state agency places—or could place—a
child at substantial risk, we contact the appropriate state agency through designated liaisons to
ensure the child’s safety and well-being as well as improvement of services. As mandated
reporters, if the OCA staff have reasonable cause to believe a child has been maltreated or is at
substantial risk of maltreatment, we immediately file a report of child abuse and/or neglect
with DCF.
In FY24, the OCA received 532 Complaint Line inquiries. This is a 10% increase in inquiry volume
compared to FY23 and is the highest volume of inquiries the OCA has ever received in a fiscal
year.
As in prior years, 80% (424) of the Complaint Line inquiries involved a complaint while 20%
(108) were requests for information or a referral. While each inquiry is presented as one case in
30

our data reporting here, each inquiry involves additional conversations and information-
gathering efforts between the OCA, the individual, and the state agency involved.

Demographics
The OCA collects demographic and social identity characteristics of the individuals who contact
the Complaint Line. This data collection is intended to identify populations that could benefit
from additional outreach, to allow for comparison to state service numbers for equitable
representation, and to assess our own response.32 Table 3 describes the percentage of the 379
individuals who contacted the Complaint Line for whom the OCA was able to collect identity
characteristics.

As the majority of inquiries the OCA receives is about services to DCF-involved individuals, the
OCA analyzed the above data and determined that the Complaint Line population is more
representative of individuals served by DCF than it is of the general population, with Black, non-
Hispanic (NH) and Hispanic individuals overrepresented compared to the general population. 33
Individuals who contact the Complaint Line are disproportionally multiracial compared to the
Massachusetts population and DCF consumer population. White non-Hispanic individuals are
also overrepresented in Complaint Line data compared to the population served by DCF. The
data below show that Complaint Line awareness could be improved for individuals who are
Hispanic or Latino, American Indian/Alaska Native, and Asian. The OCA recognizes that not all
Complaint Line inquiries are made by people with state system involvement themselves, so the
comparisons below are of interest but are not determinative of the reach the OCA has to
persons who may find the Complaint Line helpful.

Individuals who contacted the Complaint Line were usually parents (48%), followed by providers
(18%), and other relatives (14%).36 Children themselves (2%) rarely contacted the Complaint
Line. In FY24 the OCA began a targeted outreach campaign to youth living in congregate care
settings to better reach and serve that population. To learn more, see Youth Engagement
Initiative and Increased Complaint Line under Goal 6 of this report.

female, 48% male), with eight individuals identifying as transgender, gender-nonconforming,
androgenous, or another gender identity (2%). Seventeen individuals who contacted the

Overview of Complaints
The OCA recorded 424 complaint inquiries in FY24, an 8% increase compared to FY23. Figure 3
provides a comparison of complaint classifications year over year from FY20 through FY24.
Complaints most frequently relate to DCF (342, 81%).37 This is expected given the OCA’s
mandate to focus on children in the care and/or custody of the Commonwealth and that DCF
serves the most children in the care and/or custody of the Commonwealth. The Complaint Line
received approximately 38 inquiries related to services provided, licensed, or regulated by child-
serving state agencies other than DCF. Twenty-one related to schools; six involved DMH; four
involved DDS; one involved MassHealth; one involved DPH; one involved DYS; one involved DTA;
two involved EEC; and one involved EOHHS.
Individuals also contacted the Complaint Line with concerns about court involvement (53, 13%),
education (28, 7%), behavioral health (13, 3%), physical health (5, 1%), and other (30, 7%).38
Behavioral Health complaints were collected as a distinct category for the first time in FY24. The
data presented in this report should not be interpreted as a decline in the quality of services
provided by the behavioral health system in Massachusetts. Complaints in the “other” category
related to housing and homelessness, financial resources and vouchers, and concerns for the
physical conditions of a child’s living space. Except for education and physical health, there was
an increase in every complaint category in FY24 compared to FY23. The volume of DCF and
court-related complaints are within normal range compared to prior years.
37 DCF served 98,647 parents/caregivers, children and youth involved in 35,639 cases, including 64,264 children of any age open
for services (i.e., open in an assessment or in a clinical/adoption case) at minimum one day within the fiscal year.
38 Percentages will not sum to 100 because individuals may mention more than one area of concern.

DCF Complaints
The 342 complaints received on the Complaint Line involving DCF reflect a small number of the
nearly 65,000 children, youth, and young adults served by DCF, including the nearly 10,000
children DCF serves in an out-of-home placement every year.39 The comparatively small number
of cases that come to our attention out of the number of families served is not a commentary
on the seriousness of the complaints raised. The OCA processes complaints through the lens of
individual cases and through the lens of trends across the system. The OCA works to verify the
concerns raised by individuals and remedy situations when our independent assessment
indicates that the agency should take action. The OCA also provides additional resources to
individuals to ensure that they bring their complaints forward in appropriate venues.
Individuals complaining about DCF most frequently alleged concerns about DCF personnel (149,
44%). These concerns include allegations of DCF staff not responding to an individual’s
outreach, alleged disrespect by DCF personnel, missing paperwork (including safety plans and
family assessments), and lack of follow-through of a family member’s visitation rights with
children in out-of-home placements.
The second largest DCF complaint category involves placement of a child(ren) in out-of-home
settings (98, 29%).40 In this area, individuals expressed concerns that a child’s placement is
inappropriate for them, a placement request or change was denied, a placement is changing
inappropriately, the time a child spent in a placement is inappropriate, and the quality of a

placement is problematic. Some individuals expressed concerns about the type of placement, or
inconsistent placement visits by workers.
Similarly, 70 inquiries involved a concern about the care and/or custody of a child involved with
DCF, and 44 involved concerns that a child with DCF involvement—those being served by DCF in
their home setting as well as in out-of-home settings—is being abused or neglected. Others
expressed concerns about the Family Assessment and Action Plan and a variety of other issues,
including DCF investigations, family visitation, delays in establishing an Interstate Compact on
the Placement of Children, fair hearings, payments and vouchers, and records requests.

Court Involvement Complaints
Of the 53 complaints about the court process, 43% involved disagreement with the judge’s
decision, often as it related to the custody of a child. A handful of inquiries also expressed
complaints about legal representation, a delay in court proceedings, and alleged bias during
court proceedings. Other complaints included nonadherence to, or enforcement of, a judge’s
orders, and perceived conflicts of interest with judges and attorneys.
Education Complaints
Of the 28 inquiries involving complaints about education, 68% were about the school
administration’s response to a student’s needs or concerns. Individuals also complained about
accessing or adhering to an Individualized Education Plan (IEP) or 504 plan and/or the need for a
different educational placement (10, 36%). Five inquiries involved bullying, three involved
alleged unfair or inappropriate school discipline, and one involved dissatisfaction with school
transportation services.

Behavioral or Physical Health Complaints
Of the 18 inquiries related to behavioral or physical health (13 and 5 respectively), complaints
mostly related to medication errors or medication mismanagement by non-parental caregivers,
hospital or emergency department boarding, hospitalizations, and adequacy or quality of
therapeutic services.
Overview of Information and Referral Inquiries
The OCA received 108 information and referral inquiries in FY24, a 20% increase compared to
FY23. Inquiries about education (30), DCF (25), and other (34) were the most common. 41
Inquiries related to DCF, education, and court involvement increased while requests related to
physical health decreased. That decrease may be due to the updated Complaint Line
categorization schema: Behavioral health requests were not collected as a distinct category until
FY24 and may have previously been classified as physical health inquiries.
41 Counts will not sum to total number because there may be multiple requests for information and referral in a single inquiry.

Education Information and Referral
Inquiries about the education system have increased year over year since FY21. The increase
from FY23 to FY24 is larger than previous increases (21% from FY22 to FY23 compared to 76%
from FY23 to FY24). This may indicate more awareness of the Complaint Line and the OCA’s
ability to provide support or information. Of particular note, the OCA’s launch of a mandated
reporter training with a profession-specific module for education professionals may explain
some of this increase, as the training may raise awareness about the OCA and its functions.
Nearly half of the 30 education information and referral inquiries in FY24 involved IEPs or 504
plans. Topics included how to request special education, best practices in the development of
an education plan, and special education options. Individuals also asked for information about
expectations for school responsiveness, school discipline, bullying, how to change school
enrollment, and funding of out-of-district education placements. Other inquiries involve
requests for general information about education and immigration, the DESE problem
resolution system, how to request education records, and how to access an educational
advocate.

Other Information and Referral
Inquiries related to “other” issues increased 3% from FY23 to FY24. These inquiries included
state service and systems navigation, the OCA’s position on policy debates and legislative
actions, information about the OCA’s mandated reporter training, and requests for previously
released OCA reports.43
Inquiries regarding the legal system increased 33% from 12 in FY23 to 16 in FY24. The most
frequently occurring request for information was what to do in case of disagreement with a
judge. Individuals who contacted the Complaint Line also asked questions about legal
representation and a host of other topics, such as visitation rights and opportunities, how to
obtain a legal advocate, and navigating the legal system.
As previously mentioned, behavioral health and physical health inquiries were not categorized
separately in prior fiscal years and are broken out for the first time in this FY24 Annual Report.
Data collection will improve over time and the data presented in this report should not be
interpreted as a decline in the quality of services provided by the behavioral health system in
Massachusetts. The most frequently occurring behavioral health inquiry was about out-of-home
placement that did not involve DCF (3, 43%). Individuals also asked questions about navigating
behavioral health services and supports, service delivery expectations, and emergency
department boarding. Other behavioral health topics include requests for information about
how to support a child’s mental health during their parent’s divorce and parental engagement
with mental health treatment.
The OCA in Action: Supporting Kinship Families
Rebecca* contacted the OCA with concerns for her 2-year-old grandson Joshua,* who is in the
custody of the Department of Children and Families. Rebecca stated that she is the kinship
placement for Joshua. Rebecca reported that prior to Joshua being placed in her home, DCF
agreed to pay for daycare. Rebecca stated that once Joshua started daycare, DCF refused to
pay. Rebecca was able to show the OCA communications between herself and DCF where DCF
initially stated they would pay for daycare. Rebecca noted this is a big financial strain on her
and her family as she was not expecting to pay. The OCA contacted DCF inquiring about what
their plan is regarding daycare payments, as this is something they agreed upon prior to
Joshua being placed in Rebecca’s home. DCF initially responded back to the OCA that they will
pay for two months and then will assess monthly. The OCA reached back out to DCF for
clarification, and DCF reported they will continue to pay for daycare monthly until Joshua is
adopted.
43 Some of these requests may have qualified as public records requests and were handled accordingly by the OCA general
counsel.

the same child or youth if the child or youth receives services from more than one agency. For
this reason, the number of CIRs does not equal the number of critical incidents or the number
of children and youth involved.
Critical Incident Report Overview
The OCA received 278 CIRs in FY24, which is lower than the number the OCA received in
previous years. Figure 9 shows year-over-year trends related to CIRs received from state
agencies for the past five fiscal years. Given the high volume of children and families involved
with DCF and the nature of DCF’s work, DCF unsurprisingly continued to submit the majority
(87%) of the total number of CIRs the OCA received in FY24.47 Notably, the number of reports
DCF submitted decreased for the third fiscal year in a row, and DPH reported substantially fewer
CIRs in FY24. The Massachusetts Commission for the Blind submitted their first CIR in FY24.
44 Most often, the OCA receives CIRs from the state agencies organized under EOHHS. See Figure 9: CIRS Received by State
Agencies p. 41 for more information.
45 See Appendix E: Glossary of Terms for definitions of fatality, near fatality, serious bodily injury, and emotional injury.
46 See Appendix C. Additional Core Function Data and Context, Critical Incidents for more information.
47 DCF reports critical incidents involving children in its custody, children and youth receiving services, and children and youth
whose families had any DCF involvement within the preceding 12 months. Other EOHHS child-serving agencies only report
critical incidents to the OCA for children and youth currently receiving services. This difference in reporting contributes to the
higher volume of reports submitted to the OCA compared to other child-serving agencies.

Figure 10:
Critical Incident Outcomes by Fiscal Year (FY20-FY24)

Office of the Child Advocate Annual Report, FY24
Fatality
A fatality occurs when a child who is receiving state services dies.48
In FY24, the OCA received 72 fatality CIRs related to the death of 71 children, which is less than
those received in the past two years (FY23, 101; FY22, 81; FY21, 56; FY20, 58; and FY19, 61).
This decrease does not reflect public health data; nationally and in Massachusetts, child
fatalities increased for the first time in three decades in 2021 and continued to rise in calendar
year 2023, with another rise projected in 2024.49
The decrease in critical incident report fatalities was the result of fewer reported deaths from
injuries, medical events and overdose, with the most substantial reduction from medical
events, such as complex medical conditions, heart attacks and seizure disorders (52 to 32).
The reduction in reported medical event fatalities coincides with a decrease in reporting from
DPH. The cause and manner were not initially known for a larger portion of the reported deaths
compared to prior years. Deaths from physical abuse, suicide, and sudden unexpected infant
death (SUID) remained relatively the same while reported deaths from violence increased for
the third year in a row.
Near Fatality
Near fatalities are accidental and can be the result of a medical condition or the result of
abuse and/or neglect. A verbal certification by a physician that the child or young adult’s
condition is considered life-threatening is needed for an incident to meet the CIR definition of
a near fatality .
In FY24, near fatality CIRs remained comparable to previous years (36 near fatalities were
reported in FY24, compared to 48 in FY23, 28 in FY22, 35 in FY21, and 15 in FY20). While the
overall number remained stable, the causes of the events were different, with more deaths
from medical events and violence and fewer from overdoses and suicides.
Serious Bodily Injury
Serious bodily injuries are accidental, the result of an underlying medical condition, or the
result of abuse and/or neglect, and lead to bodily injury “which involves a substantial risk of
death, extreme physical pain, protracted and obvious disfigurement, or protracted loss or
impairment of the function of a bodily member, organ, or mental faculty or emotional
distress.”50
The number of CIRs involving serious bodily injuries remained about the same in FY24, with 61
reported serious bodily injuries compared to 62 in FY23, 72 in FY22, 112 in FY21, and 95 in FY20.
While the overall number remained stable, the causes of the events were different. Compared

to FY23, there were more serious bodily injuries due to violence and sexual assault in FY24 and
fewer from overdoses.
Emotional Injury
An emotional injury occurs when a child is known to witness the fatality or life-threatening
incident of an individual related to an unexpected medical event, overdose, suicide, or violent
act.51
Emotional injury is consistently the most frequent critical incident reported. The number of CIRs
involving an emotional injury remained about the same in FY24, with 220 reported compared to
224 in FY23. This is low compared to previous years.
Witnessing an overdose remained the leading cause of reported emotional injuries in FY24; the
OCA received 111 witness-to-overdose CIRs. This represents the lowest number of witnesses-to-
overdose emotional injury reports the OCA has received since FY20 and a five-year downward
trend in the number of witnesses-to-overdose reports received. This coincides with a reported
reduction in overall deaths from overdose by DPH in 2023 and continuing in 2024.52,53
The OCA also received 23 reports regarding a child witnessing a person attempt or die by suicide
in FY24. This number is closer to the number of reports received in FY21 and FY20, but higher
than what we have seen in the recent past. Reports regarding a child or youth witnessing
violence also increased substantially in FY24 compared to prior years, with 21 such reports
received. CIRs about children witnessing unexpected medical events that lead to a fatality or
near fatality increased the most, to 33 in FY24. This is the highest number of witnesses to
medical events that the OCA has received. Figure 11 presents year-over-year data about the
nature of emotional injuries children experienced as described in the CIRs received by the OCA.
51 The OCA term and definition of emotional injury is not consistently used in child welfare or scientific research. As such,
emotional injuries are best understood as a type of adverse childhood experience (ACE), a term coined by the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to describe examples of abuse, neglect, and household dysfunction that could be
potentially traumatic for children and have a lifelong impact on their overall health, safety, and well-being. The OCA uses the
term emotional injury to differentiate between a child witnessing an event (e.g. seeing a caregiver overdose) and a child being
the direct victim of the event (e.g. overdosing themselves) in any setting, such as a home, community, or other out-of-home
setting.

Demographics54
Of the 380 children who experienced a critical incident, sex assigned at birth is available for 367
of them (97%). Of those, approximately 53% were identified as male and 47% were identified as
female. While emotional injury CIRs were slightly skewed toward females, males were more
likely to be the subject of a reported fatality, near fatality, or serious bodily injury. Figure 12
describes the proportion of reported outcomes for children identified as male compared to
female.55
54 Demographic information, such as age, gender, race, and ethnicity, are collected at the time the report is received either from
the critical incident report, a representative at the reporting agency, or DCF’s electronic database. Sex/gender is as reported by
agency; collection methodology may vary by agency and may not reflect the child’s identity or sex identified at birth. Data on
the sexual orientation of children who are the subject of a report, and whether they identify as transgender, is currently only
available for a very small proportion of CIRs the OCA receives. Given the very high percentage of “unknowns,” that data is not
reported here. However, the OCA continues to prioritize improving the frequency and accuracy of demographic information
reported to the OCA, including sexual orientation and gender identity, and we hope to be able to provide additional
demographic data in future reports.
55 Figure 12 does not include counts for unknown sex assigned at birth. Totals for event outcomes may not equal totals shown
above because of this.

Age is available for all but four children appearing in CIRs. The children involved ranged from
infants under 1 year of age to 26 years old, and primarily involved those ages 1 to 17 years
old.56 We observed the following trends and themes for age cohorts of children involved:
• Fewer CIRs involving infants were reported in FY24 compared to FY23 (43 compared to
85). This fiscal year’s reports were mostly the result of a death from SUID or a complex
medical condition, or suspected abuse resulting in serious bodily injury.
• Reports involving children ages 1 to 14 years old were overwhelmingly related to
emotional injuries, specifically witnessing someone overdose.
• Fatalities were least prevalent in the 5 to 9 age group, and the OCA received many more
CIRs for this age group in FY24 compared to FY23 (89 compared to 60).
• Reports involving 15-to-19-year-olds were more frequently related to physical harm,
especially serious bodily injuries, compared to the other age groups.
• The rare reports related to young adult consumers that meet OCA reporting criteria
predominately resulted in fatality related to substance use and unintentional injuries,
such as car crashes.57

child experienced.58

Race and ethnicity information is available for 66% of the children appearing in CIRs (288
children). Figure 14 describes the proportion of reports that involved children of specific races
and ethnicities by event outcome and excludes cases where the race/ethnicity was unknown.
This analysis should be interpreted with caution, as conclusions may be skewed by the limited
availability of data. The figure provides context on under- and overrepresentation by outcome,
and the most frequently occurring critical incidents for each race/ethnicity group.
Children who are Black non-Hispanic or multiracial non-Hispanic are disproportionately
represented in serious bodily injuries and fatalities compared to the overall population and the
DCF consumer population. In particular, fatalities occur disproportionately among Black non-
Hispanic children. The Child Fatality Review program explores root causes of inequities for
children in its FY22 Annual Report.
White children are disproportionally overrepresented in CIRs compared to the DCF child
consumer population.59 This overrepresentation is driven by the number of White children
experiencing emotional injuries resulting from witnessing an overdose.

Causes of Critical Incidents
The OCA categorizes and analyzes all events that led to the injury or death of the child involved
in the critical incident. The Office of the Chief Medical Examiner makes the final determination
regarding the cause and manner of death; the critical incident report to the OCA provides
59 DCF submitted 87% of CIRs; use caution while interpreting this data.

important information about the nature and circumstances of the event that led to the injury or
death of a child or young adult.60
The OCA is committed to working across the various child-serving systems, and particularly in
collaboration with state agencies, to prevent the physical harm and/or death of all children and
young adults due to injury, overdose, suicide, and violence. In addition to the information and
efforts described below, the OCA will continue to work with the reporting agencies to develop
strategies aimed at protecting children’s safety.
Injury
Childhood injury is often preventable, yet nationwide more than 7,000 children and youth ages
birth to 19 die each year because of unintentional injuries.61 According to DPH, injuries are a
leading cause of death among Massachusetts children, particularly drowning, poisoning, and
transportation injuries.62 There were fewer CIRs about an unintentional injury to a child in FY24
(40) compared to FY23 (53). In FY24 injury-related trends from the OCA data included:
• The most frequently reported unintentional physical injuries are falls (12), car crashes
(8), fires/burns (7), and drowning (3), which most frequently result in serious bodily
injury.
• Five unintentional injury-related fatalities resulted from drowning (3), a car crash (1) and
fire/burn (1).
• No unintentional injury-related near-fatalities were reported.
• Seven emotional injuries were caused by a child witnessing the fatal or life-threatening
injury of another individual due to a firearm (3), fall (2), car crash (1), and fire/burn (1).

Overdose
The critical incidents reported to the OCA reflect children experiencing drug exposure or a child
witnessing a fatal or life-threatening overdose, and OCA data do not account for overdoses
experienced or witnessed by children in Massachusetts who were not receiving state services.
In this context, the OCA recognizes the issue is much more widespread than the OCA data
reflect, and there continues to be a deep impact of the ongoing opioid epidemic on children.
In FY24 the OCA saw a sizable reduction in the number of critical incidents involving children
who suffered a fatality, near fatality, or serious bodily injury, or who witnessed someone
overdose. The number of reported critical incidents in which a child experienced an overdose
decreased in FY24 to 23 (1 fatality, 19 near fatalities, and 3 serious bodily injuries). This breaks a
five-year trend of increasing reports of physical harm to children from overdose (from 15 in
FY19 to 22 in FY20, 32 in FY21, 34 in FY22, 37 in FY23, and 23 in FY24). This also coincides with a
DPH-reported reduction in overall deaths from overdose in 2023 and continuing in 2024.63
According to DPH, “[T]here were 2,125 confirmed and estimated opioid-related overdose
deaths in 2023, which is 232 fewer than in 2022” and is a 10% reduction in the overdose death
rate.64
DPH data show that males are disproportionately represented in overdose deaths and that,
while the overall death rate is decreasing, the decrease is not spread equitably across
race/ethnicity groups. The DPH-reported reduction was driven by a significant reduction in the
rate of White non-Hispanic people dying, but overdose death rates increased among Black non-

Hispanic people, and people who are Hispanic experienced a smaller reduction in the overdose
death rate.
The 23 children who overdosed and were reported to OCA ranged from infants to youth and
were evenly divided between boys and girls. The children were predominately Hispanic (45%).
Most were not in state custody and/or care at the time of the event (21 not in state custody, 2 in
state custody). Of the two children who were in state custody at the time of the overdose, one
experienced a fatality and the other experienced a near fatality, and both were in a public place
at the time of their overdose. One was 26 years old and the other was 17. One overdose
involved fentanyl, benzodiazepines, and marijuana, while the other involved an unknown
substance. Neither individual was in an out-of-home placement.65
Experts point to witnessing an overdose as an adverse childhood experience (ACE).66 ACEs are
linked with negative health and well-being outcomes for the child later in life. The negative
impact of witnessing an overdose is compounded by the fact that children exposed to
overdoses are often also victims of neglect, which puts them at an increased risk of complex
trauma. Critical incidents involving children who witnessed an overdose comprised two-thirds
(or more) of all emotional injury events from FY19 through FY24. The OCA received 111 CIRs
involving 112 children witnessing an overdose in FY24. More than half were under the age of 10
(56%). In FY24, of the 112 children reported to the OCA who witnessed an overdose, 80%
resulted in near fatalities to the person who overdosed while 20% resulted in fatalities. Two of
those children were in state custody when they witnessed the overdose. One overdose took
place in the child’s home, while the other took place in a shelter.

Physical Abuse
Physical abuse is the non-accidental commission of any act by a caregiver which causes or
creates substantial risk of physical injury to a child.67
While the overall number of physical abuse critical incidents increased sharply from FY19 (6) to
FY20 (21), they decreased from FY21 to FY24 (19, 18, 16, and 14 respectively). These reports
resulted in a fatality, a near fatality, 10 serious bodily injuries, and 2 emotional injuries of 12
children. In addition:
• Eight of the 12 children involved in a physical abuse critical incident were 1 year old or
younger (66%).
• One infant was in foster care at the time of the incident, though the setting of where the
injuries occurred could not be determined.
• In DCF’s investigation of the allegation of abuse, the child’s parent was determined to be
the perpetrator in 85% of the incidents. The perpetrator could not be identified in the
remaining cases.

Suicide and Suicide Attempts
According to DPH, “[S]uicides are a significant yet largely preventable
public health problem.”68 Suicide and suicide-attempt critical
incidents increased in FY23 and FY24 after a low in FY22. CIRs
regarding suicide or suicide attempts are still lower than pre-
pandemic levels. Suicide is complex and multifactorial; the OCA
continues to seek to understand and work toward prevention of
suicide, particularly for agency-involved children and youth.
In FY24 the OCA received 14 reports of a physical injury due to
suicide, including five fatalities, four near fatalities, and five serious
bodily injuries. All suicides and attempts resulting in death or bodily
injury involved youth ages 12 to 20. Six of those youth were in the
care and/or custody of the state at the time of the event. Of those six
reports, one resulted in fatality, two resulted in near fatalities, and three resulted in serious
bodily injuries. Four were in a secure facility,69 one was in their home, and one was in a public
place.
Emotional injuries caused by witnessing suicide or suicide attempts increased from 12 in FY23
to 23 in FY24; this is the highest number of reports received since FY20. Eleven of the events
resulted in a fatality and 12 resulted in a near fatality. In 80% of the reports a child witnessed
their parent’s suicide or suicide attempt (19), and in four reports they witnessed their sibling’s
suicide attempt or death. Children who witnessed a suicide or suicide attempt ranged from 3 to
17 years old, and 35% were younger than 10.

Suicide and Suicide Attempt Events in CIRs by Outcome (FY20-FY24)

Office of the Child Advocate Annual Report, FY24
Unexpected Medical Events
Some CIRs reported to the OCA involve the fatality or near fatality of a child due to life-limiting
medical conditions or other complex health needs; these numbers are small compared to other
categories of CIR. These types of reports are most often received from DPH and DDS. In FY24, 31
children reported to the OCA died from medical events, while six experienced a near fatality and
one experienced serious bodily injury. The number of reported fatalities decreased in FY24,
which coincides with a decrease in overall reports from DPH. (See Figure 9: CIRs Received by
State Agencies (FY20-FY24) p. 41.) Fatalities reported by DPH frequently involve a child receiving
care coordination services provided by the DPH’s Bureau of Family Health and Nutrition. Care
coordination services are for families with a child or youth (up to age 23) who have special
health care and/or complex coordination needs.
The children reported to the OCA who suffered a fatal medical event ranged from birth to 17
years old. Fifty-eight percent (58%) of reported medical event fatalities were children 10 years
old or younger, including seven children who were 1 year old or younger. Fifty-four percent
(54%) of the children were identified as males and 42% as females. Three were in state custody
at the time of the event, including one fatality and two near fatalities.
The OCA received substantially more reports of children witnessing unexpected fatal medical
events in FY24 than we have in the past. Of the 33 children who witnessed an unexpected
medical event in FY24, 45% resulted from a parent’s medical event, 42% from a sibling’s medical
event, 9% from another family member’s event, and 3% from a non-relative’s event. The events
were the result of complications from pre-existing medical conditions as well as incidents of
cardiac arrest. Children who witness an unexpected or untimely death experience more
difficulty in the initial acceptance and long-term adjustment than children who witness
anticipated/natural deaths.70 It is estimated that about 10% of bereaved children experience
grief reactions of sufficient severity to produce clinically significant impairment.71

Violence
Reported events in which a child was a victim of, or witness to, community violence increased
substantially in FY24 compared to prior years and were the same as FY20 reporting levels. In
FY24, 25 children reported to the OCA were victims of community violence, and 21 witnessed
violent events. The physically harmed children were between the ages of 10 and 21, and 28%
were between the ages of 18 and 21. Firearms played a role in 88% of these physical injuries,
with the remaining 12% caused by stabbing. Seventy-two percent (72%) of these youth were
receiving services from DCF while 24% were involved with DYS and one was involved with the
Massachusetts Commission for the Blind. Six children were in state custody at the time of the
event, including one who died, two who were near fatally injured, and three who sustained
serious bodily injuries. Four incidents took place in a public place, one took place at home, and
it is unclear where the other event took place. None of the children were in an out-of-home
placement at the time of the incident.
Twenty-one children reported to the OCA witnessed violence; the victim of violence was their
parent’s spouse or partner in 29% of the reports, a parent in 24%, a sibling in 19%, a peer in
14%, and another family member or person in 14%. Nineteen incidents were reported by DCF
while DYS and DMH each reported one incident. Three of the child witnesses were in state
custody at the time of the incident; one occurred after a youth absconded from a DYS secure
facility, and two involved children in DCF foster care. All three occurred in a public place.

Foster Care Review Safety Alerts
Federal and state laws require that DCF implement a Foster Care Review (FCR) process.72 This
review applies only to children who are removed from the custody of their parents and occurs
at least every six months while the child remains in placement. The review is a monitoring
mechanism to measure progress toward a child’s permanency goal.
A Foster Care Review is facilitated by a three-person panel consisting of a member of the DCF
Foster Care Review Unit (an independent unit within DCF), an administrator from a DCF area
office, and a community volunteer. When the FCR panel, through its review of progress toward a
child’s permanency goal, becomes concerned for the safety of a child in out-of-home care, the
panel generates a safety alert. In July 2022 the OCA began receiving Foster Care Review safety
alerts as part of the OCA’s long-term efforts to strengthen the Foster Care Review process. By
receiving the FCR safety alert and conducting a review of the related DCF case, the OCA
provides an additional layer of oversight to ensure that the needs and well-being of the
child(ren) are addressed.
In the second year of implementing this new protocol, the OCA received 15 Foster Care Review
safety alerts from the more than 11,000 Foster Care Reviews that took place. This represents a
substantial reduction in reports received by the OCA compared to FY23, when 36 safety alerts
were submitted.
The FCR safety alerts received by the OCA were predominately for female children (71%) and
children of color (93%). The children ranged in age from 1 to 18 years old. Reports
predominantly involved children with whom the reviewers felt there was insufficient DCF
caseworker contact. Insufficient DCF caseworker contact resulted from various issues, such as
72 United States Social Security Act, 42 USC 675 Sec 475 (5) (B) ; Department of Children and Families statute MGL c. 18B, §6A.

inconsistent visits to the placement, poor communication with out-of-state counterparts, and
refusal of a foster parent to allow DCF into a home. They also involved children who were
missing or absent from their placement at the time of the review, for whom reviewers felt
additional efforts from DCF were necessary to locate and engage the child. Children with whom
there was insufficient contact were mostly between the ages of 16 and 18, although a 3- and a
9-year-old were also insufficiently contacted while in the physical custody of their biological
parent(s).
Five of the 17 children named in these reports were not in foster care at the time of the Foster
Care Review. Those children had sibling(s) in foster care. When reviewers convened to review
progress in the foster child’s case, they identified concerns about the biological parents’
inadequate progress in meeting family action and assessment plan goals. The inadequate
progress caused enough concern for the reviewers to submit a safety alert on behalf of the
sibling who was still residing in their home. These children were between the ages of 1 and 11.
Two FCR safety alerts involved concerns about the caregiver’s capacity to meet the needs of the
foster child, one involved injuries a foster child sustained, and another expressed concerns
about premature reunification between the child and their family.73

A critical part of the OCA’s responsibility is to ensure that children are safe and protected from
harm across all settings, with a particular focus on children in out-of-home settings.74 The
Massachusetts system of investigating child abuse and/or neglect75 includes a mandatory report
73 For more information about actions taken by the OCA related to these and other concerns, please see Findings &
Interventions, page 59.
74 Out-of-home settings include foster care, congregate care, child care, public and private schools, after-school and summer
programs, school-funded transportation, and hospitals. See Appendix E: Glossary of Terms for definitions.
75 The Massachusetts system is governed by M.G.L. c. 119 § 51B(l).

to the OCA (among other agencies) when DCF76 determines that a child was abused and/or
neglected in certain out-of-home settings. Out-of-home settings include foster care, congregate
care, child care, public schools, private schools, after-school and summer programs, residential
and inpatient therapeutic programs, and school-funded transportation companies.77
OCA staff review and analyze each report to evaluate the safety and well-being of the child(ren)
involved in the incident, policy and practice concerns with the particular out-of-home setting,
the quality of the DCF investigation, and trends and patterns related to the care of children in
out-of-home settings. If the OCA identifies a significant concern in any of these areas, the OCA
will immediately follow up with DCF as either the investigator of the report of abuse and/or
neglect or the entity responsible for providing ongoing case management services to the child
and family and/or the licensing, regulatory, or funding agency to gather more information and
ensure the concerns are addressed.
In FY24, the OCA received 465 supported reports of abuse and/or neglect in out-of-home
settings involving 676 children and 515 alleged perpetrators. This is the highest volume of
reports ever received by the OCA. It was a 10% increase from FY23 and a 55% increase from
FY22.

from settings in the “other” category compared to FY23. Those reports came from hospitals
(16), transportation companies (14), private schools (9), community-based programs (8), and
unknown settings (2).
76 Only DCF is mandated to send abuse and/or neglect reports to the OCA. However, the OCA may request reports of abuse
and/or neglect from other agencies, such as EEC, as necessary.

The number of reports regarding congregate care and foster care remains stable, while reports
about public schools increased 22%, and reports about child care increased 12%. The reason for
this increase in supported reports of abuse and/or neglect in out-of-home settings is not yet
known.

Child Care
In FY24 the OCA received 93 supported reports of abuse and/or neglect in childcare settings
involving 149 children. For context, in FY23 EEC licensed 8,351 family childcare, group, and
school-age programs with the capacity to serve 271,437 children.79 Reports were regarding
center-based (76, 82%) and independent home-based (17, 18%) programs.80 Of those 93
supported reports, 99% involved neglect, 30% involved physical abuse, and 3% involved
sexual abuse and/or sexual exploitation.81 The OCA reviews of these incidents categorized risk
of emotional/psychological harm as the most prevalent incident concern (43), followed by
improper behavior management (41), and improper/inadequate supervision (40).82 There were
reported increases across all the OCA-created incident concern categories, however, the
increase was largest for risk of emotional or psychological harm and improper behavior
management.
Congregate Care
Year over year, congregate care settings yield the most supported reports of abuse and/or
neglect in out-of-home settings. In FY24, the OCA received 145 supported reports of abuse
and/or neglect in congregate care settings involving 198 children. This is two fewer reports than
the OCA received in FY23 but is still substantially higher than in prior years.83 For context, in
FY23 DCF served 1,299 children in congregate care, DYS served 162 children in residential
commitment and 647 overnight arrest admissions, and the Bureau of Substance Abuse and
79 Massachusetts Department of Early Education and Care. (2023, November 13). Licensed and Funded Child Care Providers: E2C

Addiction served 51 .84 Though the volume of reports is lower this year, the number of children
involved is substantially higher. These reports came from residential schools (79, 54%), group
homes (41, 28%), and secure facilities (25, 17%). Of the 145 supported reports in FY24, 97%
involved neglect, 29% involved physical abuse, and 6% involved sexual abuse, exploitation or
human trafficking.85,86 The OCA’s review of these cases found that improper or inadequate
supervision is the most prevalent concern category (69), followed by improper behavior
management (48), and boundary issues (31). A small portion of cases (3) involve failure to
provide health and/or medical care.87

Findings & Interventions
The OCA uses the information reported to our office through our statutory functions to inform
our work across the state child-serving systems. When a complaint, critical incident report,
Foster Care Review safety alert, or DCF supported report of abuse and/or neglect in an out-of-
home setting is received, the OCA quality assurance staff conducts an immediate administrative
review to learn more about the circumstance that brought it to the attention of the OCA and
state agency involvement with the child and family. When the OCA identifies a need for
clarifying information, an individual case practice concern, or a system-wide pattern or trend,
we follow a standard operating procedure of contacting a designated senior leadership liaison at
the agency involved. Through these liaisons, the OCA receives information requests or works
collaboratively to ensure necessary actions are taken to resolve the OCA concerns, thereby
improving state services to children and families.
The OCA responds to and offers guidance to all individuals who contact our Complaint Line.
After an in-depth assessment of the situation presented and after the provision of guidance and
referrals to support the individual, the OCA may also decide to follow up with the state agency
involved. The OCA takes such action when we identify the need for additional or clarifying
information, share the concerns brought to our attention, and/or determine that OCA
intervention is required to assist in resolving those concerns. In all instances of state agency
follow-up, the OCA continues regular communication with the relevant state agency liaison until
our concerns are alleviated.
The OCA staff conduct an immediate review of all CIRs and Foster Care Review safety alerts to
learn more about the circumstances of the incident and the reporting agency’s involvement
with the child and family. When the OCA determines the actions or inactions of a reporting
agency may have played a role in the incident or that the child, young adult, or family, is not

receiving quality services to meet their needs, we may obtain additional reports from the
agency, speak with agency senior leadership staff, and further review case records to learn more
about the family’s history and involvement with the agency.
OCA staff review and analyze each DCF supported report of abuse and/or neglect in an out-of-
home setting. The purpose of this review is to evaluate the immediate safety and well-being of
the child(ren) involved and the thoroughness of the DCF investigation. After a review, the OCA
may reach out to the reporting agency or a licensing entity to obtain and review their
investigations and corrective actions plans. The OCA obtains this information to review any
challenges the out-of-home setting is experiencing, such as workforce retention, staff training,
or unclear or lacking programmatic policy. The OCA may also obtain this information to ensure
that proper follow-up has been done to reduce or eliminate the risk to children who remain in
the setting or to prevent further harm.
In FY24, the OCA followed up with designated state agency liaisons at DCF, DMH, DPH, DYS, EEC,
DESE, DDS, DTA, and EOHHS about service delivery in 426 reports and inquiries.93 This includes:
• 109 of 532 Complaint Line inquiries (103 complaints and six requests for information or
a referral).
• 158 of 465 DCF supported reports of abuse and/or neglect in out-of-home settings.
• 148 of 278 CIRs.
• 11 of 15 Foster Care Review safety alerts.
The reasons for follow-up varied by agency, as did the actions taken by an agency to resolve the
issues. Table 7 provides an agency-by-agency overview of the number of reports or inquiries
about which the OCA followed up and the reasons for that follow-up.
93 As of the writing of this report, an additional 31 reports or inquiries were still under review with a pending determination
about the need to follow up with an external agency (18 CIRs, 1 Complaint Line inquiry, 12 supported reports of abuse and/or
neglect in an out-of-home setting).

DCF Case Practice Concerns and Response
While the OCA receives and reviews reports and inquiries coming from EOHHS child-serving
state agencies, the OCA’s statutory mandate is to focus particularly on children in the care or
custody of the Commonwealth. When a report or inquiry involving DCF comes to our attention,
OCA staff conduct a thorough review of the family’s DCF electronic record. The purpose of this
review is to understand the child’s and family’s needs, to substantively review DCF’s
understanding of the family’s needs, and to evaluate DCF’s efforts to assist and engage the
family and protect the child from harm. In this context, the OCA identifies what worked well in
DCF case practice and where there are opportunities for improvement at the area office level, at
the regional level, and across the system or with a specific family.
Regardless of the method by which the OCA receives information, the OCA communicates
identified case practice concerns to a designated liaison at DCF on an immediate and ongoing
basis. This liaison shares the information with the regional and area office management where
the family receives services and ensures that the DCF senior leadership team is aware of the
OCA concerns. The regional and area office responds to the OCA’s concerns by providing the
OCA with details about the steps they have taken or will take to address the OCA’s identified
concerns. The OCA ensures that all concerns identified through the OCA’s review are resolved
appropriately and in a timely manner to ensure the safety and well-being of the children
involved and, as appropriate, to improve services to the child and family.
In FY24, the OCA identified case practice concerns in 329 of the 1,342 (24%) reports and
inquiries that the OCA reviewed.95 This includes case practice concerns in 125 CIRs (38%), 88
Complaint Line inquiries (17%), 12 FCR safety alerts (80%), and 104 DCF supported reports of
abuse and/or neglect in out-of-home settings (22%).
Case practice concerns were stratified into two categories: intake/response and ongoing case
practice.96 These two categories are based on DCF’s policies and procedures and how they
structure familial engagement. One-hundred-fourteen cases had intake or response concerns,
237 had ongoing case practice concerns, and 22 had both intake/response and ongoing case
practice concerns for a total of 329 cases with at least one concern at either process point.97
Concerns with ongoing case practice were more prevalent than concerns with intake/response.
Table 8 describes the most frequently identified concerns for intake/response and ongoing case
practice.
Adult consumer engagement, especially regarding father engagement, was the most frequently
occurring concern, and predominately took place during ongoing case practice. That is followed
by concerns about clinical formulation during ongoing case practice, and administrative
concerns, such as documentation and dictation, which occurred during both intake/response
and ongoing case practice, though these concerns were more prevalent at intake/response.
95 The OCA may reach out to an agency even if there are no identified concerns, or we may not reach out about all cases with an
identified concern. Therefore, the number of cases with a concern and the number of cases about which the OCA reached out
are not equal.
96 See Appendix E: Glossary of Terms for definitions.
97 Numbers will not sum to total because any given case may yield more than one concern at either process point.

When OCA staff members determine, through our review, that DCF has done exemplary work
with a family or has gone above and beyond their policy and practice requirements, the OCA
also provides this feedback to DCF. The OCA recognizes that positive feedback helps recognize
good work and supports a culture of productive and fair engagement with families.98 Positive
case practices can occur during intake/response or ongoing case practice. Of the 769 cases
reviewed for which information about positive case practices is available, the OCA identified 79
cases with exceptional practices (19 CIRs, 40 Complaint Line inquiries, 20 supported reports of
abuse and/or neglect in out-of-home settings). Table 9 describes the nature of the positive case
practices. Other positive practices include trauma-informed and responsive support, proactive
referrals and outreach, and sibling visitation support.

Of the 356 reports and inquiries about which the OCA followed up with DCF, the OCA did not
require a response in 93 cases. An additional 26 cases are pending response or are not fully
resolved as of the writing of this report. DCF provided a response for the remaining 237
instances. According to DCF, nearly half (110, 47%) of the OCA-identified concerns resulted from
pertinent information not being documented in the DCF electronic record at the time of the
OCA review.
For other cases, DCF responded by acknowledging the OCA-identified concerns. Those concerns
were addressed directly with the staff involved in 87 cases, including 17 instances where DCF
Central Office or upper management became involved in the resolution.
DCF also convened an Area or Regional Clinical Review Team (ACRT/RCRT) or specialist
consultation to address the case practice concerns within the appropriate area office in 39
cases, took action to retrain staff using case examples highlighted by the OCA in 14 cases,
corrected 11 administrative issues, and changed six case decisions. DCF also filed two reports of
abuse or neglect and modified two permanency plans based on OCA feedback. The 75 cases
with other responses include DCF’s provision of additional clarifying information to the OCA that
resolved the concern, and disagreements in policy interpretation.

The OCA monitors the effects of our case practice identification as part of our ongoing oversight

DCF regarding our concerns until they are fully addressed. As noted above, in most cases, DCF
addresses the OCA concerns by bringing those concerns directly to appropriate DCF staff at all

levels (caseworker, supervisor, area management, etc.). Additionally, our improved data
collection and reporting helps the OCA focus our interventions across the child-serving system
on what is most relevant to children and families.

Office of the Child Advocate Annual Report, FY24
Final Thoughts
As evidenced by the information in this report, there is a broad array of pressing issues facing
the children of the Commonwealth. With that in mind, the OCA’s annual strategic planning
process included a focus on the intended impact of our work. We reflected on our statutory
mandate, and through engagement with and by OCA staff, we worked to answer questions
about the values underpinning the agency’s work, what impact the OCA hopes to achieve, and
the OCA’s vision for the future of the children of the Commonwealth. Together, we crafted core
values to reflect our agency’s approach to the work and to guide our agency as our office
continues to develop. The following values are the guiding principles for which we stand as an
organization:
We are Child-Centered: We put children and their ability to thrive at the center of our work. We
seek to uphold the human rights of children in the Commonwealth and ensure that they
are treated with the respect and dignity they deserve. We commit to bringing the voices
of children and youth into our work. We recognize that helping children to thrive often
requires helping their families to thrive as well. We are dedicated to actively addressing
policies, protocols, and practices that disenfranchise children and their families.
We are Trauma-Informed and Responsive: We are committed to creating environments and
systems that promote growth, resilience, and empowerment for children, families, staff,
and communities impacted by trauma. While caring for ourselves and each other in the
face of secondary traumatic stress, we prioritize self-awareness and well-being practices,
and foster a culture of compassion, empathy, and support.
We Believe Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Belonging are Central to our Work: We believe
outcomes for children improve when they are supported by diverse, equitable, and
inclusive communities and services. The OCA is in a continual process of improvement in
ensuring that we prioritize diversity and inclusion, especially lived experience, in our
operations and all aspects of our work. We commit to checking our biases and
assumptions to foster unique perspectives that create a diverse workplace where
everyone can thrive, innovate, and contribute to our shared mission. We strive to ensure
a future where all children are safe and valued and have equitable access to the services
and support they need. We commit to bringing forward actionable, equitable, and
practical solutions to reduce systemic drivers of marginalization and inequity.
We Value Collaboration: We respect our relationships with communities, agencies, and
organizations and strive to work honestly and collaboratively with all stakeholders and
each other. We are committed to listening to, learning from, and acting on the input of
all people invested in our mission, including those internal to the agency. We are
dedicated to creating a collaborative culture where everyone feels valued, empowered,
and included.
66

Office of the Child Advocate Annual Report, FY24
We Strive for Excellence: We believe all organizations serving children and their families—
including the OCA—must be accountable for providing timely, effective, and culturally
responsive services. We are a research and data-driven organization, committed to
continuous quality improvement, and we strive to provide high-quality public service.
In coming years, the OCA will report on the results of various projects and initiatives we
undertake in service of these values and our strategic goals.

Office of the Child Advocate Annual Report, FY24
Appendix A: Legislative Priorities
The Office of the Child Advocate recommends legislative changes only after thorough study and
review. The OCA’s legislative priorities listed below will, when taken together, help make
children safer in our Commonwealth, strengthen our office, and help connect children and
families with access to critical resources they need. All of this is in the pursuit of our mission of
helping children thrive.
The list below reflects the OCA’s legislative priorities during the 193rd Legislative Session (2023-
2024). FY24 included the second year of the legislative session, and the OCA continued to
advocate for a variety of pieces of critical legislation. Unfortunately, many of our key legislative
priorities did not successfully pass the Legislature this session, with one notable exception: An
Act relative to substance exposed newborns, which we are pleased to report was signed into law
in December 2024. We will continue working with our legislative partners to pass legislation to
improve the lives of children and families of the Commonwealth and update the OCA’s statute
to better serve our mission.
Strengthening the Office of the Child Advocate and Child Welfare Protections
H165/S124, An Act enhancing child welfare protections
This piece of legislation would help uphold and enhance the independence of the OCA and help
us achieve our mission of protecting the most vulnerable children in Massachusetts. Born out of
the tragic deaths of David Almond and Harmony Montgomery, this bill would help better
protect children, families, and foster parents.
An Act enhancing child welfare protections reinforces the independence of the OCA, enhances
the OCA’s powers and responsibilities, enacts educational supports for children in foster care,
outlines new data collection requirements for DCF, and clarifies the data reporting structure for
DCF. These data collection requirements for DCF and the clarification of the data reporting
structures stem from the work of the DCF Data Work Group, which the OCA co-chaired.
Protecting Newborns Exposed to Substances and Providing Supports for Families
H166/S129, An Act relative to substance exposed newborns / An Act relative to medication-
assisted treatment
Under current law, health care professionals are required to submit a report of abuse and/or
neglect to DCF every time an infant is born exposed to a substance that causes physical
dependence—regardless of whether they believe the child’s health and well-being is at
continued risk. DCF data demonstrate that about half of these infants are not found to be at
substantial risk of abuse and/or neglect warranting involvement from DCF at the time of the
report.
As an alternative to automatically filing a report when a child is born substance-exposed, this
legislation supported by the OCA would:
• Create a dual notification system, whereby healthcare providers systematically send DPH
de-identified notifications of substance-exposed newborns, only filing a report to DCF
69

Office of the Child Advocate Annual Report, FY24
when they believe the birthing parent might continue to use substances in a way that
could lead to child abuse and/or neglect.
• Strengthen our existing systems of support for perinatal individuals with substance use
challenges.
• Establish strong data collection and analysis requirements. Additionally, this bill requires
DCF, DPH, and the OCA to report on the impacts of the above-mentioned legislative
changes on abuse and/or neglect reporting, child safety, service gaps, and any disparate
impact this policy change may have had, including those pertaining to racial
disproportionality.
This bill promotes the health, well-being, and safety of substance-exposed newborns by
protecting infants from unsafe situations, all the while encouraging parents struggling with
substance use disorders to seek help and be supported in their recovery journey.
A Bill of Rights for Children in Foster Care
H164/S68, An Act establishing a bill of rights for children in foster care
The OCA supports this proposed change to the law as a complement to the foster parents’ bill
of rights, which was passed and became Mass. General Laws c.119 § 23C. Just as the Legislature
recently passed a bill of rights for foster parents, the OCA agrees strongly that children in foster
care deserve similar statutory protections.
Specifically, this bill would ensure that foster children have the right to receive medical, dental,
and behavioral health services, as well as access to gender-affirming care—crucial for LGBTQ+
children. It spells out that each child should have access to healthy food, clothing, personal care
products, and items that preserve and promote the child’s family’s culture or religion.
The bill makes clear that each child shall have the right to file complaints with the DCF
ombudsman’s office and the OCA and shall be free from retaliation or punishment for asserting
this right.
Improving the Children Requiring Assistance System
H134/S101, An Act regarding families and children in need of assistance
This bill would address the findings from over two years of study of the current Child Requiring
Assistance system by the JJPAD Board, as well as its collaborative work crafting
recommendations for improvement. JJPAD’s 2022 Children Requiring Assistance (CRA) report
details the significant shortcomings of the current CRA system, nearly a decade following major
reforms made to what was previously called the Children in Need of Services (CHINS) system.
This legislation would:
• Expand the role and function of Family Resource Centers to support more children and
families outside of the court process. This was the Legislature’s initial intent with setting
up FRCs in 2012. This bill codifies processes and, subject to appropriation, gives the FRCs
the authority to convene multiple agencies and organizations to support a youth’s needs
with the goal of keeping them out of the juvenile justice system.
70

Office of the Child Advocate Annual Report, FY24
• Change the juvenile court CRA filing process to ensure the court is a true “last resort”
option by requiring probation officers to determine that all community-based options
were exhausted by the petitioner prior to filing a CRA petition, and when those options
weren’t exhausted, connecting the petitioner with community supports, including local
FRCs.
• Raise the lower age of juvenile court jurisdiction from 6 years old to 12 years old for
CRA filings to align with the state’s delinquency system, and ensure that the state is
serving our youngest and most vulnerable youth outside of the court process.
For the reforms proposed in this bill to be successful, the OCA strongly emphasizes that statute
change must be matched with additional funding to ensure Family Resource Centers can add
staff to support the influx of additional cases that may result from this shift in process.
Transfer of Child Fatality Review
H162/S92, An Act relative to child fatality review
This bill would transfer the chairmanship of the Child Fatality Review program from the Office of
the Chief Medical Examiner to a joint chairmanship between the OCA and DPH.
This transfer would adequately reflect the role that DPH currently plays in supporting the
program as well as the funding, facilitation, and policy-setting specialization provided by the
OCA. The proposed legislation would also add the EEC to the state Child Fatality Review team.
Legislation to this effect has advanced through the legislative process several times.
Strengthening the OCA’s Ability to Analyze Data from Juvenile Court Records
H1486/S1000, An Act clarifying the Child Advocate’s authority to access juvenile records
The OCA currently has statutory authority to access court records as well as criminal offender
record information (CORI) reviews. Although the courts have permitted the OCA access to
individual files on a case-by-case basis for the purposes of investigations, the OCA has been
denied access to data on juvenile court records held by the state Department of Criminal Justice
Information Services (DCJIS) because the OCA’s statute does not explicitly authorize access to
juvenile records from DCJIS. Having access to this data would allow the OCA to better fulfill
requests for information received from the Legislature.
Bail Procedures for Justice-Involved Youth
H1494/S993, An Act updating bail procedures for justice-involved youth
In 2019, the JJPAD Board recommended eliminating the $40 administrative bail fee imposed on
justice-involved youth and amending juvenile arrest procedures to require that the bail
magistrate, rather than the officer in charge, makes the decision about whether an arrested
youth should be released or held on bail. Under current law, the officer in charge at the police
station is given the authority to release a youth or call the bail magistrate to make a bail
determination. This has led to confusion and inconsistent practices across the state.
An Act updating bail procedures for justice-involved youth would enact these recommendations
from the JJPAD Board. This legislation also codifies the standing order issued by the Executive
Office of the Trial Court during the COVID-19 pandemic, giving bail magistrates the authority to
administer any oath or required affirmations while taking bail through telephone or virtual
71

Office of the Child Advocate Annual Report, FY24
options, in addition to the traditional in-person measures. It would also permit bail to be paid
through a virtual or mobile payment option. Bail fees were eliminated as part of an outside
section of the FY24 budget.
Other Legislation the OCA Has Supported
In addition to the top priorities outlined above, the OCA from time to time weighs in on a
variety of pieces of legislation. The OCA submitted written testimony with regards to a number
of bills in FY24:
• HB4241 / S2703, An Act to prevent abuse and exploitation
• H476, An Act providing for alternatives to fines for failure to send
• H161/S74, An Act relative to children’s advocacy centers and the Massachusetts
Children’s Alliance
• HB1604, An Act addressing investigations of reports of abuse and neglect
• S82, An Act Authorizing the Commonwealth of Massachusetts to establish additional
mandated reporters for the purpose of the protection and care of children
• S2593, An Act to prevent the imposition of mandatory minimum sentences based on
juvenile adjudications
• S105, An Act relative to supporting families dealing with sudden unexplained death in
pediatrics
• SB111, An Act establishing a commission on the status of children and youth
• H189, An Act to establish a Massachusetts children’s cabinet
• HB153, An Act to eliminate disproportionality and inequities for at-risk children
72

Office of the Child Advocate Annual Report, FY24
Appendix B: Boards and Commissions
Juvenile Justice Policy and Data Board (JJPAD): The OCA chairs the JJPAD Board, which was
created as part of An Act relative to criminal justice reform (Chapter 69 of the Acts of 2018).
JJPAD is a permanent entity that is chaired by the Child Advocate and comprised of members
representing a broad spectrum of stakeholders involved in the juvenile justice system.
Childhood Trauma Task Force (CTTF): The OCA chairs CTTF, which was created by An Act
relative to criminal justice reform (Chapter 69 of the Acts of 2018). CTTF is a permanent entity
charged with determining how the Commonwealth can better identify and provide services to
youth who have experienced trauma, with the goal of preventing future juvenile justice system
involvement.
Mandated Reporter Commission (MR Commission): In November 2019, the Child Health and
Wellness Bill established the MR Commission. Chaired by the Child Advocate, and with
members from a wide range of viewpoints from public entities and groups who have extensive
experience with mandated reporting in the Commonwealth, the MR Commission was charged
with reviewing the mandated reporter law and regulations for reporting child abuse and/or
neglect and making recommendations on how to improve the response to, and prevention of,
child abuse and/or neglect. The Commission was sunset on June 30, 2021, following the release
of its final report to the Legislature.
Child Welfare Data Work Group (DWG): The DWG, which the OCA co-chaired with DCF
beginning in 2017, was charged by the Legislature (Section 128 of Chapter 47 of the Acts of
2017) with reviewing the current list of DCF’s statutorily mandated reports and recommending
which reports could be eliminated or streamlined, and what new reporting was needed. The
DWG was sunset in December 2022 following the release of its final report to the Legislature.
Child Fatality Review (CFR): The CFR program was established in 2000 following the passage of
M.G.L. c. 38, § 2A and fulfills a federal requirement for Title IV Part E funding SEC. 470. [42
U.S.C. 670]. The purpose of Child Fatality Review is to decrease the incidence of preventable
child fatalities and near fatalities. The law requires Massachusetts to have two types of CFR
teams: local child fatality review teams (CFRTs), which are coordinated by the district attorneys,
and a state child fatality review team (SCFRT). The OCA provides management and coordination
of the CFR program, funds related epidemiological work at the Department of Public Health,
and is a statutorily named member of the state and local teams. The OCME currently chairs the
body. See Appendix A: Legislative Priorities, Transfer of Child Fatality Review, for more
information.
Child Sexual Abuse Prevention Task Force (CSAP): The Massachusetts Legislative Task Force for
the Prevention of Child Sexual Abuse was created in 2014 (Section 34 of Chapter 431 of the Acts
of 2014) to create a framework for preventing child sexual abuse in the Commonwealth. CSAP is
chaired by the director of the OCA and the executive director of the Children’s Trust and is
composed of 30 legislatively named public and private organizations and elected and appointed
73

Office of the Child Advocate Annual Report, FY24
officials. The Task Force’s authorization expired in November 2022, but the group continues to
meet on important issues related to child sexual abuse prevention.
National Center on Substance Abuse and Child Welfare Policy Academy: In September 2022,
DCF and DPH were selected by the National Center on Substance Abuse and Child Welfare
(NCSACW) to jointly participate in the 2023 Policy Academy: Advancing Collaborative Practice
and Policy: Promoting Health Development and Family Recovery for Infants, Children, Parents
and Caregivers Affected by Prenatal Substance Exposure. The purpose of the 2023 Policy
Academy was to enhance the Commonwealth’s capacity to meet the needs of infants and their
caregivers affected by substance use disorder and prenatal substance exposure. The OCA senior
leadership is a member of the Core Team of cross-agency and cross-system partners who
developed the goals. Following the development of these goals, in March 2023, Massachusetts
was selected to receive in-depth technical assistance (IDTA) from the NCSACW to support their
implementation. The IDTA launched in May 2023 and since this time the OCA has been actively
involved in advancing the implementation of these goals through the Child Advocate’s
leadership on the Oversight Committee and OCA staff representation on the core team and
several work groups.
74

Office of the Child Advocate Annual Report, FY24
Appendix C: Additional Core Function Data & Context
Revised Complaint Line Reporting Schema
In prior years, the Complaint Line coding schema included options for abuse and neglect and
child welfare without much context as to the root of the concern or issue. The OCA developed a
new coding scheme that provides more nuance and context about the reasons individuals are
contacting the OCA. The team also worked to recategorize prior year data to align with the new
data metrics. The new structure provides the following options, which are used for complaints
and information and referral inquiries to provide a clearer understanding of issues and needs.
• Court involvement
• DCF
• Education
• Mental and/or behavioral health
• Other
• Physical health
In prior years, inquiries related to behavioral or mental health were not collected as a distinct
category. The new reporting schema allows OCA staff to pull out those concerns more readily.
When reviewing the FY24 data, please keep this new reporting schema in mind.

Outcome

Office of the Child Advocate Annual Report, FY24
Consistent with prior fiscal years, nearly all supported reports in child care involved neglect.
Major themes in FY24 relate to risk of emotional/psychological harm, improper behavior
management, and inadequate or improper supervision. Risk of emotional/psychological harm
often occurred in the context of improper behavior management or improper/inadequate
supervision. Inadequate supervision reports mostly resulted in physical injuries or failure to
provide basic needs and sometimes related to improper behavior management, such as
exclusionary practices. In cases involving inadequate supervision, staff left a child or children
alone for extended periods, left a child with an unapproved caretaker, or did not notice a child
left a facility unattended. Failure to provide basic needs also occurred from a child accessing a
harmful substance, such as an allergen or a vape pen. Risk of psychological harm related to
caregiver substance use, domestic violence, and conditions of the facility. Improper behavior
management involved yanking, grabbing, pinching, threatening, and vulgar language.
Supported physical abuse reports related to the childcare provider or employee’s inappropriate
response to a child’s behaviors or inappropriate attempt to modify a child’s behaviors that
resulted in injury, including corporal punishment. These cases often included grabbing, slapping,
hitting, pushing, or force-feeding a child.
Supported sexual abuse reports in FY24 occurred only in center-based childcare settings and
involved a child being sexually abused by a provider or provider’s family member and child
pornography.

Of the 25 supported reports involving 43 children in a secure facility run by DYS, 93% involved
neglect (40), 30% involved physical abuse (13), and none involved sexual abuse and/or sexual
exploitation.
In FY24, incidents resulting in supported reports of neglect mostly involved situations in which
inappropriate or inadequate supervision or boundary issues resulted in youth running away
from the program, engaging in consensual or coercive sexual contact with one another, and/or
using illicit substances. Incidents resulting in supported reports of neglect also include boundary
issues such as staff communicating with children on social media, allowing children to use a staff
member’s cell phone, providing children illicit substances, and failure to report elopement.
Improper behavior management relates to an inappropriate response or attempt to modify a
child’s behavior, such as yelling, demeaning, and/or physically grabbing, shoving, or improperly
restraining a child (when such contact does not rise to the level of abuse). Failure to provide
basic needs mostly occurred in residential schools and involved neglecting a child’s hygiene or
medication needs or exposing a child to violence.
Supported reports of physical abuse include injuries to the child due to a staff person’s
negligent behavior or inappropriate response to the child’s behavior such as pushing, choking,
slapping, and unapproved or incorrectly performed restraints and escorts.
Incidents resulting in supported reports of sexual abuse related to staff engaging in sexually
explicit conversation and/or an emotional or physical relationship with a youth in the program.

Office of the Child Advocate Annual Report, FY24
Appendix E: Glossary of Terms
Abuse and/or neglect: In relation to the Complaint Line, this refers to DCF’s response to a
report of abuse and/or neglect; maltreatment of a child at home or in an out-of-home setting.
Boundary issues: Relates to a supported report of neglect in an out-of-home setting. The
provider violates physical and/or emotional boundaries with a child.
Care and/or custody of child: In relation to OCA case review findings, this refers to a concern
that DCF left the child in the care and/or custody of a parent or caregiver or removed the child
from the care and/or custody of a parent or caregiver.
Child care: For the purposes of this report, child care references center-based, independent
home-based, and provider-affiliated home-based programs.
Child-specific foster care: Foster care placements where a non-kinship individual(s) is identified
and licensed as a placement for a particular child (e.g., teacher or parent(s) of the placed child’s
friend). This is a person with whom the family or child has a strong bond and who is significant
in their life. This was incorporated by DCF into kinship foster care in FY24.
Child welfare: In relation to the Complaint Line, this refers to a lack of responsiveness from DCF
staff; placement of a child in DCF care and custody; parent or grandparent visitation rights;
adoption or guardianship process.
Clinical formulation: DCF is not holistically assessing the family based on all available
information to create a realistic plan of required changes that will promote a child’s safety,
permanency, and well-being. Clinical formulation requires a thorough review of DCF’s history
with the family.
Collateral contact: In relation to OCA case review findings, this refers to a determination that
the risk posed to the child was not fully assessed because the DCF case management team did
not contact professionals and/or natural supports or did not ask questions that elicited
information necessary to inform clinical formulation. Cases are not identified for this concern if
the barrier to obtaining information is the result of parent/caregiver refusal to provide releases
of information.
Comprehensive foster care: Foster homes that offer more intense therapeutic care and
supports for children with more complex needs. This service is only provided by licensed foster
care agencies in accordance with the licensing requirements of EEC and DCF.
Congregate care: A wide range of out-of-home group placements for children that provide 24-
hour supervision in a variety of structured settings. This includes group homes, residential
treatment programs, and secure facilities for those involved in the juvenile justice system. These
placements offer both short-term stabilization as well as longer-term group care. Parents and
caregivers can place their child in select congregate care programs, though children are
87

Office of the Child Advocate Annual Report, FY24
commonly placed in congregate care through DCF, DMH, DYS or other state agencies within or
outside of Massachusetts.
COVID-19: In relation to the Complaint Line, this refers to concerns arising from a lack of
adherence to COVID-19 protocols.
Critical incident report: State agencies providing services to children or youth must notify the
OCA if a child suffers a fatality, near fatality, serious bodily injury, or emotional injury. These
notifications are referred to as critical incident reports.
DCF case management: In relation to the Complaint Line, this refers to DCF’s response to a
report of abuse and/or neglect; removal of a child; service coordination or case oversight;
frequent changes in social workers.
DCF personnel: In relation to the Complaint Line, this refers to delay or lack of response to a
parent or caregiver’s questions or concerns; unprofessional communication; non-adherence to
home-visiting requirements as outlined in the DCF Ongoing Casework and Documentation
Policy.
DCF specialist consultation: In relation to case review findings, this refers to a determination
that a DCF specialist consultation was not completed during the response although there were
identified complex or high-risk factors that warranted one.
Delayed or no health care: Relates to a supported report of neglect in an out-of-home setting.
The provider failed to ensure the child has proper and timely physical, dental, or behavioral
health care.
Diversion: Any program that allows a youth who commits an offense to be directed away from
more formal juvenile justice system involvement. Diversion is considered an alternative
response to arrest and/or prosecution in juvenile court.
Dually involved youth: Youth who are involved with the child protection system who also
become involved with the juvenile justice system.
Education: The OCA uses this term in two ways:
• In relation to an allegation of neglect, this refers to a failure to provide the child with
proper educational opportunities.
• In relation to the Complaint Line, this refers to concerns or requests for information
related to bullying, an Individualized Education Plan (IEP) for a child, and/or special
education.
Emotional injury: An emotional injury occurs when a child is known to witness the fatality or
life-threatening incident of an individual related to an unexpected medical event, overdose,
violent act, or suicide.
88

Office of the Child Advocate Annual Report, FY24
Experiences: In terms of a critical incident, this is used to capture the multitude of outcomes
and characteristics that can occur from one single event, leading to a critical incident report. For
example, one critical incident report can involve two children—one who died, and one who
experienced a serious bodily injury and witnessed the death of the other child. This would be
captured as one report involving two children and three experiences.
Failure to meet basic needs: Relates to a supported report of neglect in an out-of-home setting.
The provider did not meet the child’s needs for food, shelter, and clothing. This also includes
situations where there are safety concerns regarding the physical environment where services
are provided.
Fatality: In terms of a critical incident, fatality occurs when a child between birth to 24 years old
dies.
Foster Care Review safety alert: Safety alerts are generated by Foster Care Reviewers at the end
of a Foster Care Review if an immediate safety concern is identified for the child/youth. The
safety alert is immediately sent to the DCF area office responsible for the case. The area director
must document a response to the safety alert within one working day.
Foster Care Review: A Foster Care Review panel convenes every six months for every child in
out-of-home placement to provide oversight and ensure that every child and youth under the
state's custody has a permanency plan, which defines a safe and permanent home. The
implementation of a Foster Care Review process is a federal requirement.104
Foster care: When a child is removed from their home due to abuse and/or neglect, foster care
is one type of setting in which they may be placed. As the Commonwealth’s designated child
protective services agency and the one that serves more children and families than any other
EOHHS agency, DCF places the most children in foster care, however DYS can also place children
in foster care.
Secure facility: A DYS or provider facility characterized by locked entrances and exits and other
physically restrictive construction that typically includes locked bedrooms as well as procedures
that are intended to prevent a client from departing without the approval of the Department.
Healthcare: The OCA uses this term in two ways:
• In relation to an allegation of neglect, this refers to a caregiver and/or staff failing to
provide the child with appropriate physical or behavioral health care.
• In relation to the Complaint Line, this refers to MassHealth coverage; extended stays in
emergency rooms for behavioral health reasons; children not receiving services and
support for their healthcare needs.

documentation in the record that a child in DCF custody is being visited monthly in their
placement, such as foster care or congregate care.
Independent living: A wide range of residential options that afford youth to live on their own
and still access resources.
Injury: In terms of a critical incident, injury relates to non-medical physical harm that is
unintentional. Injuries can result in fatality, near fatality, or serious bodily injury. If they are
witnessed, they can result in an emotional injury.

elsewhere classifiable.
Outcome decision: In relation to case review findings, this refers to an OCA disagreement with
an intake or response decision either regarding the critical incident or a prior DCF intake and

substantial risk of death, extreme physical pain, protracted and obvious disfigurement, or
protracted loss or impairment of the function of a bodily member, organ, or mental faculty, or
emotional distress.”105
Sex assigned at birth: The determination about sex that parents and doctors make upon birth of
the child based on perceived biological characteristics, such as external reproductive organs.
While these data are presented in binary, the OCA acknowledges that 1.7% of the population is
intersex or has sexual or reproductive variations and 5.3% of youth in Massachusetts identify as
trans. While the OCA also gathers information about people’s gender identity, numbers are low
and excluded from stratifications to prevent potential identification.
Sexual assault: In terms of a critical incident, sexual assault results in fatality, near fatality, or
serious bodily injury. If witnessed, it can result in an emotional injury.
Social determinants of health (SDOH): Nonmedical factors that influence health, well-being,

Supported report and/or allegation of abuse and/or neglect: When DCF receives a report of
abuse and/or neglect (51A), DCF gathers information to determine whether the allegations
meet DCF criteria for suspected abuse and/or neglect, if there is immediate danger to the safety
of a child, whether DCF involvement is warranted, and how best to respond. DCF begins its
screening process (intake) immediately upon receipt of a 51A report. If a 51A is “screened in,” it
is assigned for a child protective response to determine whether there is reasonable cause to
believe that a child has been abused and/or neglected. Screened-in is categorized as requiring
either an immediate emergency response or a nonemergency response. For information about

state services, with a particular focus on ensuring that the Commonwealth’s most vulnerable
and at-risk children have the opportunity to thrive. Through collaboration with public and
private stakeholders, the OCA identifies gaps in state services and recommends improvements
in policy, practice, regulation, and/or law. The OCA also serves as a resource for families who are
receiving, or are eligible to receive, services from the Commonwealth. The OCA executes its
mission by:
• Overseeing and monitoring the services delivered by child-serving state agencies.
• Improving the collection, use, and transparency of state agency data.
• Identifying gaps in and concerns with how state agencies and systems serve at-risk
children, and recommending and advocating for solutions, including changes to improve
coordination across agencies.
• Advising on and leading efforts for systemic change in policies, programs, and practices
affecting vulnerable and at-risk children.
• Partnering with state agencies to improve service quality through the development and
launch of innovation and incubation projects.
• Serving as an ombudsperson, including providing information and referral support, for
families who are receiving, or are eligible to receive, services from the Commonwealth.
• Ensuring that state service agencies are trauma-informed.
• Promoting child and family well-being.
In FY24, the OCA incorporated the Center on Child Wellbeing & Trauma (CCWT) directly into the
OCA. The Center was originally launched as a project housed at the For Health Consulting
Division of UMass Chan Medical School to provide vital support and training to child-serving
organizations and state agencies across the Commonwealth to become trauma-informed and
responsive through information sharing, trainings, communities of practice, technical
assistance, and coaching. The Center uses the Framework for Trauma-Informed and Responsive
Organizations, developed by the OCA-led CTTF.
