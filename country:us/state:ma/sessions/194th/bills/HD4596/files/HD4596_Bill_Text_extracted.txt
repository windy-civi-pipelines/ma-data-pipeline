Jeffrey C. Riley
Commissioner
Dear Members of the General Court:
I am pleased to submit this progress report for FY22, describing the ongoing work of the
Department of Elementary and Secondary Education (Department) in supporting districts as they
develop and implement 3-year plans, as detailed in Section 1S(c) of the Student Opportunity Act
(Chapter 132 of the Acts of 2019). Districts’ plans, commonly referred to as SOA Plans, are
intended to address—and ultimately close—longstanding gaps in learning experiences, academic
outcomes, and lifetime outcomes for students from historically underserved groups. These
include English learners, students with disabilities, students from high-poverty backgrounds and
other student groups.
As highlighted in the Department’s FY21 progress report, the COVID-19 pandemic has
substantially impacted the timeline for both the development of districts’ SOA plans and their
implementation. The FY22 state budget, signed by Governor Baker on July 16, 2021, was the
first to appropriate additional Chapter 70 aid and implement the new funding formula enacted in
the Student Opportunity Act (SOA). As such, academic year 21-22 represents the first full year
of SOA plan implementation that includes investments from additional Chapter 70 aid. In light
of the impact of the pandemic, as well as the large infusion of federal ESSER funds, the
Department asked districts to develop robust amendments to their original SOA plans, which
were due on April 1, 2022.
This report expands upon testimony I provided at the Joint Committee on Education’s November
22, 2022, informational hearing. In addition to describing the Department’s implementation of
the FY22 SOA plan amendment data collection and review process, this report summarizes key
findings drawn from districts’ amended plans and outlines the Department’s next steps for
implementation.
Massachusetts has been recognized for the progress our students have made over the last decade
in overall student achievement, but persistent opportunity and achievement gaps remain,
especially for our students of color, low-income students, English learners, and students with
disabilities. Closing these gaps is our urgent and collective work; the Student Opportunity Act
supports our efforts to ensure that all students are prepared for success after high school.
I look forward to providing future updates to you regarding the implementation of the Student
Opportunity Act. Please contact Chief Schools Office Komal Bhasin at komal.bhasin@mass.gov
with any questions.
Sincerely,
Jeffrey C. Riley
Commissioner of Elementary and Secondary Education

Introduction and Overview
The Department of Elementary and Secondary Education respectfully submits this Report to the
Legislature pursuant to Chapter 132 of the Acts of 2019, The Student Opportunity Act:
Annually, not later than December 31, the commissioner shall submit a report to the clerks
of the house of representatives and the senate and the chairs of the joint committee on
education on the progress made in addressing persistent disparities in achievement among
student subgroups in the aggregate and within subcategories on a statewide basis;
provided, however, that district and school-level data shall be made available on the
department’s website along with the report. (M.G.L. Ch. 69 § 1S (d))
The Student Opportunity Act revised the Chapter 70 funding formula to ensure a more equitable
distribution of state education funds with a goal of ensuring every student has access to a high-
quality public education regardless of zip code. The legislation calls on districts to apply the
increased funding to implement evidence-based practices that will close gaps in learning
experiences, achievement, and post-secondary outcomes for student groups that have historically
been least well served, and in many cases were most harmed by pandemic-caused disruptions in
teaching and learning.
The 2021-22 school year was the first full year districts received funding under the Student
Opportunity Act (SOA) and the first full year districts’ SOA plans had been implemented.
Districts submitted their initial three-year SOA plans in January 2021 and submitted amendments
to revise their plans in April 2022. Districts were asked to focus their amendments on needs that
emerged during the pandemic, as well as address how they were using SOA funds and federal
Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief funds (ESSER), as well as other funding
sources, to close opportunity and outcome gaps for underserved student groups. Each district’s
amended plan is publicly posted on the Department's website in accordance with the SOA
legislation.
The Department carefully reviewed drafts of each district’s SOA plan amendment and provided
feedback to support effective plan development. While the Department supports and monitors all
districts with their SOA plans and initiatives, a specific focus has been on the 25 districts
receiving $1.5 million or more in additional Chapter 70 in SY 2021-22, or “high funding
districts.”
Plan amendment submissions in April 2022 confirm that districts focus on supporting
underserved student groups and implementing evidence-based programs outlined in the SOA
legislation, many of which are specifically targeted to pandemic recovery efforts.
This report focuses on early findings about districts’ plans for funding evidence-based practices
to close gaps and shares the progress of implementation through SOA amendments. It also
provides context for how the pandemic has impacted the development and implementation of
district plans.
1
Equitable Distribution of State Education Funds
The Foundation Budget Review Commission’s October 2015 recommendations, which were
adopted in the Student Opportunity Act Legislation that followed in November 2019, addressed
the state’s overall underinvestment in education and revised the formula used to allocate funds to
districts to include:
▪ Raising per pupil funding for English learners; more for those in high schools.
▪ Special education allocation is based on the actual number of students with disabilities
(SWD), not assumptions/estimates
▪ More funding for districts with high concentrations of poverty.
▪ Increasing funding for health care costs of active employees and retirees by basing costs
on up-to-date health insurance trend data collected by the state’s Group Insurance
Commission (GIC)
By 2027, the state expects to phase in well over $1 billion in additional funding for education,
with the majority directed toward chronically underfunded districts. Of note, the 25 districts
receiving $1.5 million or more in additional Chapter 70 funds in FY22 received 84 percent of the
additional education funding being phased in during that fiscal year (almost $183.5 million of the
total $219.6 million FY22 increase in Chapter 70 aid.)

Impact of the Pandemic
As a result of school closures during the pandemic, the first full year of 3-year gap closing
implementation using additional Chapter 70 funding by districts was delayed, taking place
during the academic year 2021-2022. Districts’ original 3-year gap-closing plans were submitted
to the Department in January 2021, rather than April 2020 as defined in the statute. While the
pandemic delayed the implementation of the Student Opportunity Act, substantial funding from
federal Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief (ESSER) began flowing to districts
in July 2020; by fall of 2022, districts in Massachusetts had received almost $2.6 billion in
ESSER funding alone. The table below provides an overall timeline of funding decisions,
funding availability, and plan submissions.

The SOA legislation requires districts to provide annual updates to report the progress made in
closing gaps for identified student groups. In response to the impact of the pandemic, the April
2022 amendment process provided districts the opportunity to revise and refine their plans.
3
SOA 3-Year Gap Closing Plans
The SOA legislation calls for districts’ 3-year gap-closing plans to include the following key
components:
• Based on an analysis of disaggregated analysis of state and local data, identify which
student groups are experiencing gaps in student learning experiences and outcomes.
• The key evidence-based program areas the district is focusing on to narrow gaps for
identified student groups.
• Multi-funding stream investments districts are making in each identified evidence-based
program area.
• Metrics districts expect to use to measure progress.
• Family/caregiver engagement structures.
• Stakeholder involvement in the plan development and implementation process.
In FY22 the Department recommended 21 evidence-based program areas (EBPs) that fall into
four broad categories: enhanced core curriculum, targeted student supports, talent development,
and conditions for student success. Similarly, districts’ ESSER III plans also provided
information about the evidence-based program areas that their funds would implement to address
the loss of instructional time, selected from a list strongly aligned with the one provided by the
Department for SOA amendments.
April 2022 SOA Amendment Process
Intended to reinforce the value of stakeholder engagement, meaningful progress monitoring, and
focused work in implementing a select and appropriate set of evidence-based practices, the
amendment process provided districts with the opportunity to revisit and revise their original
plans. To support this process, the Department rolled out revised guidance and supports to
districts beginning in late fall 2021. Written guidance and overview webinars highlighted the
expectations for amendments, asking districts to adjust plans to better respond to pandemic-
related needs and funding from the federal Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief
(ESSER) fund. The April 2022 amendments were not intended to reflect a district’s
comprehensive improvement plan. Emphasis was placed on the importance of working with
stakeholder groups, developing meaningful indicators for progress monitoring, and assessing
their plans relative to key features of evidence-based practices.
April 2022 SOA Amendment Feedback
The SOA Team at the Department reviewed submitted plan amendments to ensure adherence to
statutory requirements and alignment with expectations contained in the submission guidelines.
Feedback from the SOA team aimed to ensure that districts' 3-year gap-closing plans would
effectively communicate to all of the Commonwealth's stakeholders (i.e., districts' and schools'
local stakeholders, the state legislature, the broader education community, and the general
public) that strong collective efforts are being made across the state to close opportunity gaps for
student groups—particularly students with disabilities, English learners, students of color, and
students from economically disadvantaged communities. Details about the feedback process and
the criteria used to review plans are available on the Department’s Student Opportunity Act web
pages.

In reviewing districts’ April 2022 amendments, the SOA team provided detailed feedback to
districts. The components evaluated included student gap analysis and student group selection;
selection of evidence-based practices and metrics; budget and resource allocation; engagement of
families; and engagement of stakeholders in plan development. For each area, districts received
feedback on where their plans met statutory requirements, where the plans required additional
information to meet statutory requirements, and where the plans would benefit from additional
information or detail. For this last category of feedback, districts had the opportunity to submit
revisions to strengthen their plans by providing greater clarity and transparency for stakeholders.
For elements of plans that did not yet meet statutory requirements, districts were provided clear
guidance on what information was missing and instructed to update their submission with the
needed information.
As required by the statute, all district FY22 Amendments were posted ina dashboard on the
Department’s website.
Based on the strengths and areas for growth evidenced in prior district plans and amendments,
the SOA team has identified three key areas where they will provide additional guidance and
support to districts, in advance of the April 2024 deadline for new 3-year gap-closing plans:
• Quality and sophistication of disaggregated data analysis
• Engaging in meaningful stakeholder engagement
• Engaging in effective progress monitoring, including the selection of meaningful metrics
and setting targets to measure impact
Continuing to support districts in strengthening their ability to analyze, engage, and monitor—
and to communicate their plans and findings in a way that allows stakeholders to understand and
engage—provides additional benefits to districts and their communities.

Key Findings from April 2022 SOA Amendments
Student Groups Targeted for Gap Closing
A review of plans shows that districts are focusing supports on underserved student groups
prioritized in the SOA legislation, including:
• Students with disabilities: 70% of districts statewide and 96% of high funding districts
• High needs students: 65% statewide; 84% of high funding districts
• Economically disadvantaged students: 47% statewide; 64% of high funding districts
• English learners and former English learners: 44% statewide; 88% of high-funding
districts
Evidence-based Program Areas
Guidance from the Department’s SOA team encouraged districts to commit to a small number of
high-impact, evidence-based program areas to close opportunity and achievement gaps among
groups of students they serve.
Statewide, districts identified an average of 2.6 evidence-based program areas to focus on. All
but one of the districts receiving $1.5 million or more in additional FY22 Chapter 70 funds
selected between three and five evidence-based program areas to focus on. Among those districts
receiving less than $1.5 million, three-quarters (74 percent) identified between one and three
evidence-based program areas.
The evidence-based practices selected most often by districts reflected the challenges many
districts faced while emerging from the pandemic. This includes a focus on accessible instruction
for all learners and meeting the social-emotional and mental health needs of students.
Specifically, more than a third of all districts chose:
• the implementation of high-quality instructional materials;
• inclusion and/or co-teaching for students with disabilities and English learners;
• expanding the capacity to address social-emotional learning and mental health needs of
students and families; and
• Research-based early literacy programs.
Of these practices, 64 percent of high-funding districts identified inclusion and/or co-teaching as
a focus, followed closely by meeting students’ and families’ social-emotional and mental health
needs. Thirty-six percent of high-funding districts are also focusing on expanded access to full-
day, high-quality pre-kindergarten for 4-year-olds, and 28% are focused on facilities
improvements to create healthy and safe school environments. In addition, between 20% and
25% of these districts also prioritize diversifying the educator/administration workforce,
implementing Acceleration Academies, and improving Early College programming. Table 3
below displays the evidence-based program areas most often selected by all districts, districts
receiving $1.5 million or more, and districts receiving less than $1.5 million.

Implementation Indicators
To better understand where districts are in implementing evidence-based practices and to track
that progress over time, the template for SOA amendments that were due April 2022 included a
set of closed-ended implementation indicators for each evidence-based program area. The
Department’s SOA team worked with the program offices most closely aligned with each
evidence-based program area to develop between 3-10 program components that are hallmarks
of high-quality approaches to implementation.
These implementation indicators provide districts with a list of key elements for each evidence-
based practice and the Department with a uniform data set that can be aggregated across districts.
The indicators for each evidence-based practice are available in the FY22 SOA Implementation
Indicators Resource developed for districts. Districts indicated which components were part of
their approach and characterized the current implementation stage for each.
In the aggregate, these data provide a snapshot of what districts are implementing, and the stage
of implementation. The vast majority of districts report that are incorporating all of the high-
quality program components associated with the EBPs in their plans. There is considerably more
variation in the data describing the implementation stage for each. This information is useful to
the Department as it considers where to invest its limited resources to provide supports for
evidence-based program areas, including guidance, professional development offerings, and
grant funding.
At the individual district level, interested stakeholders can see the detailed aspects of districts’
implementation. Data in individual district plans also serve as a starting point for Department
staff to engage in follow-up conversations with districts about the quality of implementation and
allocation of resources.
Financial Investments in EBPs
With their 3-year plans in January 2021, and amendments in April 2022, districts submitted
budget projections showing the financial expenditures allocated to each evidence-based practice
they selected. It is important to note that since the state does not currently provide multi-year
Chapter 70 budget projections to districts, districts were not asked to provide multi-year budget
projections in their plans. Districts submitted braided expenditures for existing and increased
Chapter 70, ESSER, and other state and federal grant funds for each year in which plans were
collected, in recognition of the fact that districts pull from multiple sources to fund their
priorities. This approach to reporting allows us to see significantly greater scope of investments
in the EBPs than if we focused solely on increased Chapter 70 funding.
Table 4 represents the evidence-based practices most invested in according to district reporting
in the SOA amendments submitted in April 2022. The total investments reported for these 7
evidence-based practices is more than the entire increase in Chapter 70 in FY22.

Funding sources: ESSER I, ESSER II, ESSER III, Local funding (including Chapter 70), Other Federal grants (e.g., Title grants), other state grants (e.g., GLEAM grants), Mass
Business Authority Funds, Other
Districts’ three-year plans represent just one of many data sources DESE will draw upon to
assess the implementation and impact of the SOA. The Department plans to use data across
multiple sources (e.g., end-of-year spending reports, student outcome data, and evidence-based
program grant data) to gain a more complete understanding of the fiscal impact of the revised
Chapter 70 funding formula, as well as assess the impact of evidence-based investments on
closing learning and outcome gaps for our students that are least well-served.
Support from the Department
In response to districts’ areas of focus and statewide data following the pandemic, the
Department is directly supporting districts with the implementation of multiple evidence-based
program areas. This support includes grant programs, professional development networks, and
other resources. Most districts receiving $1.5 million or more in additional Chapter 70 funding in
SY2021-22 also have one or more schools designated as in need of assistance in the
accountability system. As such, these districts are prioritized to receive direct supports from the
Department including additional funding and targeted support in allocating resources, planning,
implementation, and progress monitoring from the Department’s Statewide System of Support
teams.

Looking Ahead
Districts are now in the process of developing SOA Progress Reports in which they will provide
an update on the implementation of the evidence-based program areas in their plans, share
highlights about early indicators of improvement and gap-closing for targeted student groups,
and describe how FY23 funds from multiple sources are being leveraged to support the
implementation of their plans. Progress reports are due April 1, 2023. Following a review of
plans, districts’ progress reports will be posted on the Department website, in accordance with
the SOA legislation.
Districts will develop new 3-year gap-closing plans during the 2023-24 academic year. New
plans will be closely aligned with the Department’s new academic vision and strategic
objectives, which will be shared with districts in June 2023. Guidelines for developing new plans
will also be informed by lessons learned through the development and implementation of
districts’ first set of 3-year plans. The Department expects to issue guidelines, resources, and
supports to districts in October 2023. New plans will be due on April 1, 2024.

Jeffrey C. Riley
Commissioner
Dear Members of the General Court:
I am pleased to submit this progress report for FY22, describing the ongoing work of the
Department of Elementary and Secondary Education (Department) in supporting districts as they
develop and implement 3-year plans, as detailed in Section 1S(c) of the Student Opportunity Act
(Chapter 132 of the Acts of 2019). Districts’ plans, commonly referred to as SOA Plans, are
intended to address—and ultimately close—longstanding gaps in learning experiences, academic
outcomes, and lifetime outcomes for students from historically underserved groups. These
include English learners, students with disabilities, students from high-poverty backgrounds and
other student groups.
As highlighted in the Department’s FY21 progress report, the COVID-19 pandemic has
substantially impacted the timeline for both the development of districts’ SOA plans and their
implementation. The FY22 state budget, signed by Governor Baker on July 16, 2021, was the
first to appropriate additional Chapter 70 aid and implement the new funding formula enacted in
the Student Opportunity Act (SOA). As such, academic year 21-22 represents the first full year
of SOA plan implementation that includes investments from additional Chapter 70 aid. In light
of the impact of the pandemic, as well as the large infusion of federal ESSER funds, the
Department asked districts to develop robust amendments to their original SOA plans, which
were due on April 1, 2022.
This report expands upon testimony I provided at the Joint Committee on Education’s November
22, 2022, informational hearing. In addition to describing the Department’s implementation of
the FY22 SOA plan amendment data collection and review process, this report summarizes key
findings drawn from districts’ amended plans and outlines the Department’s next steps for
implementation.
Massachusetts has been recognized for the progress our students have made over the last decade
in overall student achievement, but persistent opportunity and achievement gaps remain,
especially for our students of color, low-income students, English learners, and students with
disabilities. Closing these gaps is our urgent and collective work; the Student Opportunity Act
supports our efforts to ensure that all students are prepared for success after high school.
I look forward to providing future updates to you regarding the implementation of the Student
Opportunity Act. Please contact Chief Schools Office Komal Bhasin at komal.bhasin@mass.gov
with any questions.

Sincerely,
Jeffrey C. Riley
Commissioner of Elementary and Secondary Education

Introduction and Overview
The Department of Elementary and Secondary Education respectfully submits this Report to the
Legislature pursuant to Chapter 132 of the Acts of 2019, The Student Opportunity Act:
Annually, not later than December 31, the commissioner shall submit a report to the clerks
of the house of representatives and the senate and the chairs of the joint committee on
education on the progress made in addressing persistent disparities in achievement among
student subgroups in the aggregate and within subcategories on a statewide basis;
provided, however, that district and school-level data shall be made available on the
department’s website along with the report. (M.G.L. Ch. 69 § 1S (d))
The Student Opportunity Act revised the Chapter 70 funding formula to ensure a more equitable
distribution of state education funds with a goal of ensuring every student has access to a high-
quality public education regardless of zip code. The legislation calls on districts to apply the
increased funding to implement evidence-based practices that will close gaps in learning
experiences, achievement, and post-secondary outcomes for student groups that have historically
been least well served, and in many cases were most harmed by pandemic-caused disruptions in
teaching and learning.
The 2021-22 school year was the first full year districts received funding under the Student
Opportunity Act (SOA) and the first full year districts’ SOA plans had been implemented.
Districts submitted their initial three-year SOA plans in January 2021 and submitted amendments
to revise their plans in April 2022. Districts were asked to focus their amendments on needs that
emerged during the pandemic, as well as address how they were using SOA funds and federal
Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief funds (ESSER), as well as other funding
sources, to close opportunity and outcome gaps for underserved student groups. Each district’s
amended plan is publicly posted on the Department's website in accordance with the SOA
legislation.
The Department carefully reviewed drafts of each district’s SOA plan amendment and provided
feedback to support effective plan development. While the Department supports and monitors all
districts with their SOA plans and initiatives, a specific focus has been on the 25 districts
receiving $1.5 million or more in additional Chapter 70 in SY 2021-22, or “high funding
districts.”
Plan amendment submissions in April 2022 confirm that districts focus on supporting
underserved student groups and implementing evidence-based programs outlined in the SOA
legislation, many of which are specifically targeted to pandemic recovery efforts.
This report focuses on early findings about districts’ plans for funding evidence-based practices
to close gaps and shares the progress of implementation through SOA amendments. It also
provides context for how the pandemic has impacted the development and implementation of
district plans.

Equitable Distribution of State Education Funds
The Foundation Budget Review Commission’s October 2015 recommendations, which were
adopted in the Student Opportunity Act Legislation that followed in November 2019, addressed
the state’s overall underinvestment in education and revised the formula used to allocate funds to
districts to include:
▪ Raising per pupil funding for English learners; more for those in high schools.
▪ Special education allocation is based on the actual number of students with disabilities
(SWD), not assumptions/estimates
▪ More funding for districts with high concentrations of poverty.
▪ Increasing funding for health care costs of active employees and retirees by basing costs
on up-to-date health insurance trend data collected by the state’s Group Insurance
Commission (GIC)
By 2027, the state expects to phase in well over $1 billion in additional funding for education,
with the majority directed toward chronically underfunded districts. Of note, the 25 districts
receiving $1.5 million or more in additional Chapter 70 funds in FY22 received 84 percent of the
additional education funding being phased in during that fiscal year (almost $183.5 million of the
total $219.6 million FY22 increase in Chapter 70 aid.)

Commonwealth’s students, they serve 65 percent of its English learners and half of its low-
income students,

Impact of the Pandemic
As a result of school closures during the pandemic, the first full year of 3-year gap closing
implementation using additional Chapter 70 funding by districts was delayed, taking place
during the academic year 2021-2022. Districts’ original 3-year gap-closing plans were submitted
to the Department in January 2021, rather than April 2020 as defined in the statute. While the
pandemic delayed the implementation of the Student Opportunity Act, substantial funding from
federal Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief (ESSER) began flowing to districts
in July 2020; by fall of 2022, districts in Massachusetts had received almost $2.6 billion in
ESSER funding alone. The table below provides an overall timeline of funding decisions,
funding availability, and plan submissions.

The SOA legislation requires districts to provide annual updates to report the progress made in
closing gaps for identified student groups. In response to the impact of the pandemic, the April
2022 amendment process provided districts the opportunity to revise and refine their plans.
3

SOA 3-Year Gap Closing Plans
The SOA legislation calls for districts’ 3-year gap-closing plans to include the following key
components:
• Based on an analysis of disaggregated analysis of state and local data, identify which
student groups are experiencing gaps in student learning experiences and outcomes.
• The key evidence-based program areas the district is focusing on to narrow gaps for
identified student groups.
• Multi-funding stream investments districts are making in each identified evidence-based
program area.
• Metrics districts expect to use to measure progress.
• Family/caregiver engagement structures.
• Stakeholder involvement in the plan development and implementation process.
In FY22 the Department recommended 21 evidence-based program areas (EBPs) that fall into
four broad categories: enhanced core curriculum, targeted student supports, talent development,
and conditions for student success. Similarly, districts’ ESSER III plans also provided
information about the evidence-based program areas that their funds would implement to address
the loss of instructional time, selected from a list strongly aligned with the one provided by the
Department for SOA amendments.
April 2022 SOA Amendment Process
Intended to reinforce the value of stakeholder engagement, meaningful progress monitoring, and
focused work in implementing a select and appropriate set of evidence-based practices, the
amendment process provided districts with the opportunity to revisit and revise their original
plans. To support this process, the Department rolled out revised guidance and supports to
districts beginning in late fall 2021. Written guidance and overview webinars highlighted the
expectations for amendments, asking districts to adjust plans to better respond to pandemic-
related needs and funding from the federal Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief
(ESSER) fund. The April 2022 amendments were not intended to reflect a district’s
comprehensive improvement plan. Emphasis was placed on the importance of working with
stakeholder groups, developing meaningful indicators for progress monitoring, and assessing
their plans relative to key features of evidence-based practices.
April 2022 SOA Amendment Feedback
The SOA Team at the Department reviewed submitted plan amendments to ensure adherence to
statutory requirements and alignment with expectations contained in the submission guidelines.
Feedback from the SOA team aimed to ensure that districts' 3-year gap-closing plans would
effectively communicate to all of the Commonwealth's stakeholders (i.e., districts' and schools'
local stakeholders, the state legislature, the broader education community, and the general
public) that strong collective efforts are being made across the state to close opportunity gaps for
student groups—particularly students with disabilities, English learners, students of color, and
students from economically disadvantaged communities. Details about the feedback process and
the criteria used to review plans are available on the Department’s Student Opportunity Act web
pages.

In reviewing districts’ April 2022 amendments, the SOA team provided detailed feedback to
districts. The components evaluated included student gap analysis and student group selection;
selection of evidence-based practices and metrics; budget and resource allocation; engagement of
families; and engagement of stakeholders in plan development. For each area, districts received
feedback on where their plans met statutory requirements, where the plans required additional
information to meet statutory requirements, and where the plans would benefit from additional
information or detail. For this last category of feedback, districts had the opportunity to submit
revisions to strengthen their plans by providing greater clarity and transparency for stakeholders.
For elements of plans that did not yet meet statutory requirements, districts were provided clear
guidance on what information was missing and instructed to update their submission with the
needed information.
As required by the statute, all district FY22 Amendments were posted ina dashboard on the
Department’s website.
Based on the strengths and areas for growth evidenced in prior district plans and amendments,
the SOA team has identified three key areas where they will provide additional guidance and
support to districts, in advance of the April 2024 deadline for new 3-year gap-closing plans:
• Quality and sophistication of disaggregated data analysis
• Engaging in meaningful stakeholder engagement
• Engaging in effective progress monitoring, including the selection of meaningful metrics
and setting targets to measure impact
Continuing to support districts in strengthening their ability to analyze, engage, and monitor—
and to communicate their plans and findings in a way that allows stakeholders to understand and
engage—provides additional benefits to districts and their communities.

Key Findings from April 2022 SOA Amendments
Student Groups Targeted for Gap Closing
A review of plans shows that districts are focusing supports on underserved student groups
prioritized in the SOA legislation, including:
• Students with disabilities: 70% of districts statewide and 96% of high funding districts
• High needs students: 65% statewide; 84% of high funding districts
• Economically disadvantaged students: 47% statewide; 64% of high funding districts
• English learners and former English learners: 44% statewide; 88% of high-funding
districts
Evidence-based Program Areas
Guidance from the Department’s SOA team encouraged districts to commit to a small number of
high-impact, evidence-based program areas to close opportunity and achievement gaps among
groups of students they serve.
Statewide, districts identified an average of 2.6 evidence-based program areas to focus on. All
but one of the districts receiving $1.5 million or more in additional FY22 Chapter 70 funds
selected between three and five evidence-based program areas to focus on. Among those districts
receiving less than $1.5 million, three-quarters (74 percent) identified between one and three
evidence-based program areas.
The evidence-based practices selected most often by districts reflected the challenges many
districts faced while emerging from the pandemic. This includes a focus on accessible instruction
for all learners and meeting the social-emotional and mental health needs of students.
Specifically, more than a third of all districts chose:
• the implementation of high-quality instructional materials;
• inclusion and/or co-teaching for students with disabilities and English learners;
• expanding the capacity to address social-emotional learning and mental health needs of
students and families; and
• Research-based early literacy programs.
Of these practices, 64 percent of high-funding districts identified inclusion and/or co-teaching as
a focus, followed closely by meeting students’ and families’ social-emotional and mental health
needs. Thirty-six percent of high-funding districts are also focusing on expanded access to full-
day, high-quality pre-kindergarten for 4-year-olds, and 28% are focused on facilities
improvements to create healthy and safe school environments. In addition, between 20% and
25% of these districts also prioritize diversifying the educator/administration workforce,
implementing Acceleration Academies, and improving Early College programming. Table 3
below displays the evidence-based program areas most often selected by all districts, districts
receiving $1.5 million or more, and districts receiving less than $1.5 million.

Implementation Indicators
To better understand where districts are in implementing evidence-based practices and to track
that progress over time, the template for SOA amendments that were due April 2022 included a
set of closed-ended implementation indicators for each evidence-based program area. The
Department’s SOA team worked with the program offices most closely aligned with each
evidence-based program area to develop between 3-10 program components that are hallmarks
of high-quality approaches to implementation.
These implementation indicators provide districts with a list of key elements for each evidence-
based practice and the Department with a uniform data set that can be aggregated across districts.
The indicators for each evidence-based practice are available in the FY22 SOA Implementation
Indicators Resource developed for districts. Districts indicated which components were part of
their approach and characterized the current implementation stage for each.
In the aggregate, these data provide a snapshot of what districts are implementing, and the stage
of implementation. The vast majority of districts report that are incorporating all of the high-
quality program components associated with the EBPs in their plans. There is considerably more
variation in the data describing the implementation stage for each. This information is useful to
the Department as it considers where to invest its limited resources to provide supports for
evidence-based program areas, including guidance, professional development offerings, and
grant funding.
At the individual district level, interested stakeholders can see the detailed aspects of districts’
implementation. Data in individual district plans also serve as a starting point for Department
staff to engage in follow-up conversations with districts about the quality of implementation and
allocation of resources.
Financial Investments in EBPs
With their 3-year plans in January 2021, and amendments in April 2022, districts submitted
budget projections showing the financial expenditures allocated to each evidence-based practice
they selected. It is important to note that since the state does not currently provide multi-year
Chapter 70 budget projections to districts, districts were not asked to provide multi-year budget
projections in their plans. Districts submitted braided expenditures for existing and increased
Chapter 70, ESSER, and other state and federal grant funds for each year in which plans were
collected, in recognition of the fact that districts pull from multiple sources to fund their
priorities. This approach to reporting allows us to see significantly greater scope of investments
in the EBPs than if we focused solely on increased Chapter 70 funding.
Table 4 represents the evidence-based practices most invested in according to district reporting
in the SOA amendments submitted in April 2022. The total investments reported for these 7
evidence-based practices is more than the entire increase in Chapter 70 in FY22.

Districts’ three-year plans represent just one of many data sources DESE will draw upon to
assess the implementation and impact of the SOA. The Department plans to use data across
multiple sources (e.g., end-of-year spending reports, student outcome data, and evidence-based
program grant data) to gain a more complete understanding of the fiscal impact of the revised
Chapter 70 funding formula, as well as assess the impact of evidence-based investments on
closing learning and outcome gaps for our students that are least well-served.
Support from the Department
In response to districts’ areas of focus and statewide data following the pandemic, the
Department is directly supporting districts with the implementation of multiple evidence-based
program areas. This support includes grant programs, professional development networks, and
other resources. Most districts receiving $1.5 million or more in additional Chapter 70 funding in
SY2021-22 also have one or more schools designated as in need of assistance in the
accountability system. As such, these districts are prioritized to receive direct supports from the
Department including additional funding and targeted support in allocating resources, planning,
implementation, and progress monitoring from the Department’s Statewide System of Support
teams.

Looking Ahead
Districts are now in the process of developing SOA Progress Reports in which they will provide
an update on the implementation of the evidence-based program areas in their plans, share
highlights about early indicators of improvement and gap-closing for targeted student groups,
and describe how FY23 funds from multiple sources are being leveraged to support the
implementation of their plans. Progress reports are due April 1, 2023. Following a review of
plans, districts’ progress reports will be posted on the Department website, in accordance with
the SOA legislation.
Districts will develop new 3-year gap-closing plans during the 2023-24 academic year. New
plans will be closely aligned with the Department’s new academic vision and strategic
objectives, which will be shared with districts in June 2023. Guidelines for developing new plans
will also be informed by lessons learned through the development and implementation of
districts’ first set of 3-year plans. The Department expects to issue guidelines, resources, and
supports to districts in October 2023. New plans will be due on April 1, 2024.
