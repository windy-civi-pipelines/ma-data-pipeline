DEPARTMENT OF TRANSITIONAL ASSISTANCE
FISCAL YEAR 2024 REPORT ON STANDARD BUDGETS OF ASSISTANCE FOR
TRANSITIONAL AID TO FAMILIES WITH DEPENDENT CHILDREN
AUGUST 2024
LEGAL BACKGROUND & CONTEXT
The Department of Transitional Assistance (DTA) submits this report in accordance with G.L. c. 18, §2(B)(g) and
c. 118, §2 and the decision of the Supreme Judicial Court in Coalition for the Homeless v. Secretary of Human
Services, 400 Mass. 806 (1987).
In accordance with the decision of the Supreme Judicial Court, the Department, in order to conduct a
meaningful review under G.L. c. 18, §2(B)g), "must issue a written report which shall either provide or permit a
comparison in dollars between standard budgets of assistance of each successive year and which shall discuss
the adequacy of [TAFDC] grant levels in comparison with the standard budget or budgets of assistance and
with changes in the consumer price index."
The amounts actually paid to TAFDC families are determined by the Legislature each year when, in line item
4403-2000 of the General Appropriation Act, the Legislature establishes the "standard of need", which
determines the eligibility level, and the "standard of payment," which determines the benefit or grant level.
The Court recognized that the Department may be confronted with a dilemma in dealing with the benefit level
authorized by the budget and its duty under c. 118, §2 to provide aid sufficient to enable then-AFDC parents
to bring up their children properly in their own homes. The Court required the Department to respond to this
dilemma as follows: "If in any year the department concludes that the funds appropriated for AFDC purposes
are insufficient to permit it to furnish that level of financial aid which §2 directs it to provide, the department
has an obligation to bring its inability to comply with the payment level described in §2 to the attention of the
Legislature and to ask that it appropriate an adequate sum or that it provide some other solution to the
dilemma.”
The Court held that the Department, in determining whether sufficient funds have been appropriated to give
financial assistance at the level required by §2, may consider the assistance provided to parents with
dependent children not only through AFDC but also through other financial assistance programs, such as the
Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP, formerly known as Food Stamps), fuel assistance, and
public or subsidized housing programs.
This is the thirty-eighth report on the Standard Budgets of Assistance completed by DTA. The first report,
released in August 1986, formulated three Standard Budgets of Assistance for AFDC families in FY87. The
standards were based on the components of a typical budget for a family of three at that time including
housing, utilities, food, clothing, personal care, transportation, household operation and furnishings, and
other goods and services. In each subsequent year, DTA updated those internally-developed budgets from
1986 in producing this report using the Consumer Price Index (CPI), a common measure of inflation. Standard
Budgets of Assistance Reports from previous years can be found on DTA’s website1.

In order to improve the usability of this report, as of March 2022, the Department updated its methodology to
use the Federal Poverty Level (FPL) as a comparative standard in determining whether current benefit levels
are adequate. FPL is a common benchmark used by many federal and state programs, including SNAP,
Medicaid, and WIC2. While the federal poverty level does not adjust for regional variations in costs of living, it
is a widely-used standard for income and poverty and, as such, provides a common measure by which the
Legislature may assess the overall adequacy of TAFDC benefits as it makes decisions regarding TAFDC funding
in the state budget process.
THE TRANSITIONAL AID TO FAMILIES WITH DEPENDENT CHILDREN PROGRAM
The Transitional Aid to Families with Dependent Children (TAFDC) program provides financial assistance and
employment programming to families with children, and pregnant women, with little or no income.
Participants receive child care and transportation assistance to support their engagement in education,
training, or other employment related activities. Certain TAFDC participants are required to perform a work-
related activity as a condition of eligibility.
While its predecessor, Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC), was 50% federally funded, the 1996
Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act (PRWORA) replaced the federal reimbursement with a
federal block grant, known as Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF). States have discretion in how
they spend the TANF block grant, subject to certain federal limitations. Prior to the passage of PRWORA, the
Commonwealth passed its own welfare reform program in 1995. Section 110 of Chapter 5 of the Acts of 1995.
As part of this legislative package, the AFDC program became the TAFDC program and was modified to
promote the principles of family unity, individual responsibility, and self-reliance by structuring financial and
economic incentives and disincentives that promoted such principles. This was a radical shift of focus from
AFDC as primarily an income maintenance program to TAFDC, which was intended to move clients beyond
reliance on public benefits by developing their skills and experience and providing opportunity to increase
their economic mobility. These remain the core principles of TAFDC today.
In recent years, DTA has emphasized removing barriers to economic mobility and helping families find paths to
success. Through policy reforms, the Department has continued to better promote work, enhance the
Department’s employment support programming, and explore new approaches to meaningfully engage with
families who receive TAFDC benefits.
See Table 1 for current TAFDC benefit and eligibility levels – respectively, the standard of payment and
standard of need, as described in the state’s General Appropriations Act (GAA) – by family size. Language in
the TAFDC line item requires the benefit level to equal the eligibility level, such that an increase to one will
increase the other. This language has been included in the program’s line item since 1986 (FY87). There will be
no change in benefit level and the eligibility level in FY24.

TAFDC BENEFITS & FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL
The Federal Poverty Level is published each year by the federal Department of Health and Human Services and
is used to determine eligibility for various income-based public programs. Originally developed in 1965, the
FPL is meant to illustrate the minimum amount of income that people need to purchase food and other
necessities. The FPL is adjusted for inflation each year using the CPI. The standards set by the FPL are used as a
benchmark for eligibility for federal benefits. In Massachusetts, MassHealth, Emergency Shelter Assistance,
and SNAP all use a percentage or multiplier of the FPL to determine program eligibility limits. For example,
SNAP program eligibility is generally set at 200% of FPL in Massachusetts.
See Table 2 for a comparison of TAFDC benefit and eligibility levels compared to the FPL.

OTHER TAFDC BENEFITS AVAILABLE TO TAFDC FAMILIES
In addition to the “cash” benefit grant, TAFDC families are eligible to receive a number of other cash benefits
or special payments from DTA:
RENT ALLOWANCE. A rent allowance is available to families receiving TAFDC who live in private, unsubsidized
housing. The rent allowance is currently $40 per month or $480 annually and is received in addition to a
family's regular TAFDC grant. Approximately 41% of all families received the rent allowance each month they
received TAFDC in FY23.
CLOTHING ALLOWANCE. Each child who received TAFDC in September 2023 received a clothing allowance of $450.
A typical family of three is comprised of a single mother and two children, and therefore received a clothing
allowance payment totaling $900 in FY24.
$50 CHILD SUPPORT DISREGARD PAYMENT. The Department returns the first $50 of current child support collected
by the Department of Revenue on behalf of the TAFDC family to the family without reducing their grant. In
FY23, approximately 13% of the TAFDC caseload received a $50 child support disregard payment in any given
month. On an annual basis, a family may receive up to $600 in child support disregard payments. The actual
value of child support disregard payments differs, depending on whether a recipient is receiving SNAP
benefits. Under federal regulations, clients receiving SNAP benefits have their SNAP benefits reduced when
they receive a child support disregard payment. For every $10 in child support received, a family will lose
about $3 in SNAP benefits. Thus, for a family receiving SNAP, the annual value of child support disregard
payments is about $420.
5

CRIB AND LAYETTE PAYMENTS. Families with an infant under six months are eligible for a $300 payment to
purchase a crib or layette. In FY23, there were a total of 2,896 Crib and Layette payments made to TAFDC
clients.
RELOCATION BENEFITS. A relocation benefit of up to $1,000 may be provided to secure permanent housing for a
family that has been in a family shelter, a shelter for domestic violence, or a teen structured living program for
a period of 60 days or more. The relocation benefit is for expenses directly related to the family’s inability to
secure permanent housing and may be used for expenses including advance rent, security deposit, rent
arrearage, utility arrearages or deposit, storage, and/or moving expenses. During FY23, there were
approximately 349 cases that utilized relocation benefits with an average benefit of $964.
WORK RELATED EXPENSE AND EARNED INCOME DISREGARDS. Families with earned income are eligible for a work-
related expense of $200 from their gross wages. This deduction is used in determining both eligibility and
grant amounts. Once families are found eligible for benefits, if they are working, they are also eligible for a
100% earnings disregard for six months as long as their income does not exceed 200% of the Federal Poverty
Level. Thereafter, if they remain on benefits, they receive the monthly $200 work-related expense deduction
and an additional 50% earnings disregard for as long as the family remains eligible for assistance.
OTHER BENEFIT PROGRAMS AVAILABLE TO FAMILIES ON TAFDC
In addition to benefits and allowances available through the TAFDC program, families receiving TAFDC are
often eligible for other benefits provided by or funded through other state agencies and/or the federal
government. These benefits include:
Public and Subsidized Housing. Both the federal government and the Commonwealth operate public housing
and rent subsidy programs. Where and in what type of housing a TAFDC family lives can also have a significant
impact on their overall net resources and budget. Families who live in public or subsidized housing pay a
maximum of 30% of their monthly adjusted income for rent. For these families, the TAFDC grant is counted as
income and is considered in the rent calculation. Approximately 42% of all families receiving TAFDC resided in
public or subsidized housing at any given time during FY23. A majority of families receiving TAFDC live in
private housing and pay market rate rent. Moreover, families who live in metropolitan Boston and on Cape
Cod are likely to pay higher housing costs than clients in other areas of the state.
Child Care. The Department works closely with the Department of Early Education and Care (EEC) to ensure
families receiving TAFDC can access child care. DTA authorizes child care for families receiving TAFDC who are
working or participating in an approved education, employment, or training activity. Transitional child care is
available for families whose TAFDC case closed within the prior 12 months and who are currently employed or
enrolled in an education or training program. These families may be required by EEC to pay a parent fee to the
child care provider. In FY23, EEC served an average of 9,672 children a month from 6,618 active families
receiving TAFDC. The average subsidy per slot for these families was $20,297.
Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). Funded by the federal government and administered by
the state, SNAP provides eligible families with Electronic Benefits Transfer (EBT) cards that can be used to
purchase food in the same manner as a debit or bank card. The maximum FY23 SNAP benefit available to a
family of three was $8,880. The average SNAP benefit for families receiving TAFDC in FY23 was $559. In FY23,
6

approximately 96% of all families receiving TAFDC participated in SNAP. The fact that some families did not
participate may be due to a number of factors, including living with another family whose income makes the
household ineligible for SNAP benefits.
Fuel Assistance. Administered by the Executive Office of Housing and Livable Communities (EOHLC), and as a
joint effort by the federal and state government, fuel assistance is available through the Low-Income Home
Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP). LIHEAP provides fuel payments to ensure that adequate heating and
energy assistance is available to families living with low-income across the Commonwealth. In FY23, LIHEAP
provided fuel assistance to 6,934 families receiving TAFDC. Approximately 78% of these families were electric
or natural gas utility customers who received a maximum of $1,750 (average benefit of gas was $1,181 and
average benefit of electric was $1,210), 17% were oil customers who received a maximum benefit of $2,550
(average benefit of $1,878), and the remaining customers had alternate forms of heating, such as wood,
propane, and coal.
Federal Earned Income Tax Credit. The Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) is a tax benefit for working people
who earn low or moderate incomes. Workers who qualify for the EITC and file a federal tax return can get
back some or all of the federal income tax that was taken out of their pay during the year, plus a refund up to
the maximum EITC level. In 2023, a worker with one child and an adjusted gross income less than $46,560 was
eligible for an EITC of up to $3,995. A worker with two children and an adjusted gross income less than
$52,918 was eligible for an EITC of up to $6,604. A worker with three or more qualifying children and an
adjusted gross income less than $56,838 was eligible for a maximum credit of up to $7,430.
Massachusetts Earned Income Tax Credit. The Massachusetts state EITC is 40% of the federal EITC.
Emergency Shelter. Administered by EOHLC, the Emergency Assistance (EA) program provides emergency
shelter placements for families who have become homeless. In FY23, approximately 5% of families receiving
TAFDC were placed in emergency shelter.
Other Benefits. Families receiving TAFDC are often eligible for a variety of other federal and state programs
including universal free school breakfast and lunch to school children; free transportation to medical
appointments through MassHealth, if needed; and food supplements through the Special Supplemental
Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC).
Table 4, on the next page, indicates the approximate extent to which families receiving TAFDC receive these
additional benefits.

TAFDC WORK PROGRAM AND IMPACT OF EARNINGS
TAFDC recipients are required to participate in work-related activities as a condition of eligibility, unless
specifically exempted. The primary goals of DTA’s employment programs are to assist TAFDC clients to prepare
for and connect with career pathways and resolve barriers for sustained employment. DTA case managers
connect TAFDC clients to employment and training programs by referring them to appropriate activities based
on their skill level and economic mobility goals.
As noted above, to better promote and support work, in FY19 the Department developed and implemented an
“earned income disregard” for TAFDC clients with earnings to be able to maintain 100% of their earnings,
along with their benefits, for up to six months following employment, provided they do not earn more than
200% of the federal poverty level (FPL), and 50% thereafter. Benefits for work-required clients are subject to a
program time limit (24 months out of 60 consecutive months). Approximately 14% of all TAFDC families
received the earned income disregard each month in FY23.
Table 5, on the next page, shows the impact of part-time earnings, along with the federal and state Earned
Income Tax Credits, on a TAFDC household’s overall income.

In 2021, DTA launched a rebrand of its employment services programs, now known as the DTA Pathways to
Work Program. The goal of the program redesign is to provide access to meaningful, tailored career pathways
for families by offering participants more time and resources to invest in training, education, job readiness
activities, and economic mobility goals. Career pathway programs, when combined with supportive services,
make it easier for clients with higher barriers to employment to earn industry-recognized credentials
necessary for higher wage jobs; to provide opportunities for more flexible education and training; and to
attain market identifiable skills that can transfer into work opportunities that provide for asset retention and
economic independence.
CONCLUSION
The purpose of the TAFDC program is to help families meet their basic needs while setting and achieving
personally meaningful goals on their economic mobility path and permanent exit from public benefits. TAFDC
benefits provide a vital lifeline of economic support for our state’s lowest income families. While the grants
have not kept pace with inflation and have lost value compared to the FPL since 1989, the vast majority of
families who qualify for TAFDC generally also receive a package of other public benefits including SNAP,
MassHealth and, in some cases, housing and heating assistance. Over the past several years, in partnership
with the broader workforce system, DTA has pursued a series of reforms to better support and promote
meaningful career path opportunities for TAFDC clients to enable them to increase their household incomes in
the short term, while working towards longer term economic security.
