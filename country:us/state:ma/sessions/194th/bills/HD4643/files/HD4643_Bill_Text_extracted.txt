Task Force Overview
• The Rest Home Task Force was established in 2024 with the enactment of Section 27 of Chapter 197 of
the Acts of 2024, An Act to Improve Quality and Oversight of Long-term Care, and was charged with
evaluating the governance and regulatory structure of rest homes in the Commonwealth.
• The Task Force was chaired by Executive Office of Health and Human Services Undersecretary for
Health, Kiame Mahaniah, acting as the designee of the Secretary of Health and Human Services, and was
comprised of a diverse panel of lawmakers, public health professionals, industry stakeholders, rest home
administrators, and experts in health care administration and finance (see full list in Appendix B).
• The Task Force met five times from January to March 2025 and was required to submit its
recommendations to the Clerks of the House of Representatives and Senate and the House and Senate
Committees on Ways and Means, not later than April 1, 2025.
• All meetings were subject to the Open Meeting Law and minutes were taken and approved for each
meeting. Appendix C outlines the meetings and input provided, including the individuals who presented.
All materials considered by the Task Force as well as minutes of the Task Force’s meetings were posted
on a publicly-available webpage: https://www.mass.gov/rest-home-task-force
Note: With the new federal administration and rapidly changing landscape for federal funding, it remains
uncertain the extent to which policies and funding from the U.S. Department of Health and Human
Services (HHS) and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) will change and, if so, how those
changes may impact rest home services.

Background – Key Definitions
• Rest Home: a residential care facility that provides 24-hour supervision and supportive services for aged,
infirm, and at times indigent populations, who may have difficulty in caring for themselves, but do not
routinely require nursing care. Rest homes provide housing, meals, activities, and arrange and coordinate
medical services for individuals who need a supportive living arrangement. Rest homes are licensed by the
Massachusetts Department of Public Health (DPH).
– Some rest home beds, classified as “Level IV” beds, are located within skilled nursing facilities (SNFs),
which are considered “multi-level” or “hybrid” facilities (see map and table on Slide 18).
– Per 105 CMR 150.00 Standards for Long Term Care Facilities, religious order homes do not require a
license from DPH to operate. These homes must meet all local health and safety requirements.
• Nursing Facility: alternatively known as “skilled nursing facilities” (SNFs), nursing facilities are supportive
living environments for aged or infirm residents that provides a wide range of health and personal care
services. Services at nursing facilities focus more on medical care than most rest home or assisted living
facilities, and may include rehabilitation services, such as physical, occupational, and speech therapy. Similar
to rest homes, nursing facilities are licensed by DPH.
• Assisted Living Residence: private residences that offer housing, meals, and personal care services to aging
adults who live independently. Assisted living residences (ALRs) are certified by the Executive Office of
Aging & Independence (AGE) and are designed for adults who can live independently in a home-like
environment but may need help with daily activities such as housekeeping, meal preparation, bathing,
dressing, and/or medication assistance. ALRs do not provide medical or nursing services and are not
designed for people who need serious medical care. Most assisted living residents pay fees privately, and the
cost for each ALR can vary depending on the size, services, and location of the residence.
4
Background – Key Definitions (cont.)
• RCC-Q: the Resident Care Cost Quotient (RCC-Q) is a methodology for tracking spending across rest
homes, including investments in direct care staff, infection control, and other resident care related
expenditures that have a direct and meaningful impact on overall resident quality of life, health, and well-
being. The RCC-Q serves as a mechanism to strengthen resident quality of care by holding rest homes
financially accountable for managing their revenue and investing in resident care related costs, including
direct care staffing.
– To increase and incentivize greater expenditure in these areas, EOHHS required residential care
facilities to begin reporting resident care expenditures and revenue in September 2023 for the
purposes of calculating the RCC-Q.
– EOHHS conducts audits of RCC-Q reports for five rest homes each year, selected based on their
RCC-Q score (>80%), size of the facility (to represent a distribution across the industry), and whether
the facility was audited in the prior year.
– Please refer to the detailed overview included in the Rest Home Payment and Rate Overview
presentation from the Task Force’s 1/24/2025 meeting for additional information.
• DCC-Q: similar to the RCC-Q for rest homes, the Direct Care Cost Quotient (DCC-Q) is a methodology
for tracking spending at nursing facilities, the key difference being that nursing facilities are not permitted to
include the salaries for administrators, executive directors, and responsible parties (RPs) in their reporting
as direct care staff.
– Since October 2023, all nursing facilities participating in the Massachusetts Medicaid (“MassHealth”)
program are required to complete the DCC-Q, as part of a series of reforms to promote a higher
standard of care and improved infection control.
5
Background – Oversight of Rest Home Quality / Resident Experience
EOHHS provides oversight of rest homes and ensures the quality of residents’ experience through the following:

Section 7:
1. Long-Term Care (LTC) Ombudsperson Program – rest home-specific activities
• The LTC Ombudsperson acts as an advocate and independent mediator to resolve problems between
residents and rest homes as they relate to the health, welfare, and rights of those they serve.
• Independently investigates any issues that are reported by residents, family members, or resident advocates,
visiting facilities on a regular basis and allowing residents to voice their complaints and work toward
resolutions with staff before issues can escalate.
• In 2024, the three largest categories of complaints included: 1) Residents’ Autonomy, Choice, Rights;
2) Admissions, Transfers, Discharges, Evictions; and 3) Environment.

Section 8:
2. DPH Bureau of Health Care Safety and Quality (BHCSQ)
• The DPH BHCSQ conducts unannounced visits to all DPH-licensed facilities on a bi-annual basis, or ad-hoc
when specific licensure complaints are raised. The BHCSQ team consults with the local LTC Ombudsperson
prior to visits, as appropriate.
• Surveys are conducted by BHCSQ licensure surveyors who survey all types of licensed healthcare facilities.
The full list of the relevant regulations are reviewed with administrators, including census, capacity, prior
incident reports, any medical records, personnel files, vaccination reporting, and all policies and procedures.
• When onsite, surveyors ask whether any residents wish to speak with them, offering to converse with them
privately out of earshot of staff. Surveyors also make efforts to seek out residents who may have submitted
a complaint or been involved in a reported incident.
6
Background – Oversight of Rest Home Quality / Resident Experience (cont.)

Section 9:
3. DPH Complaint Unit
• The DPH Complaint Unit follows up on resident complaints and consults with the appropriate LTC
Ombudsperson as part of its investigation/review. Complaints are sorted into two distinct categories:
facility-reported incidents and resident complaints.

Section 10:
1. Facility-reported incidents
– Current regulations require that facility administrators notify the DPH Complaint Unit directly
when certain incidents of a serious nature occur. These incidents may include allegations of
abuse, falls with injury, elopements, death, criminal acts, resident rights, medication incidents, etc.
– In 2024, DPH received 300 facility reports. None of these reports resulted in the facility being
deemed in immediate jeopardy, but were instead indications of facility owners’ adherence to
their regulatory requirements and diligent oversight of their operations.

Section 11:
2. Resident complaints
– As with the LTC Ombudsperson Program, resident complaints may be submitted directly to the
DPH Complaint Unit. These complaints are triaged by the DPH Complaint Unit and investigated.
– Examples of resident complaints may include falls/injuries, elopements, resident rights, quality of
care, environment, billing, etc.
– In 2024, DPH received 115 resident complaint reports. In many cases, these reports were
duplicative of self-reported incidents also reported by facilities.

Task Force’s Findings by Charge
Charge
• The Task Force was charged with evaluating the governance and regulatory structure of rest homes in the
Commonwealth, including an examination of the following:
(i) the licensing, regulatory and reporting structure for rest homes;
(ii) an inventory of licensed rest homes and licensed rest home beds;
(iii) the location and service areas of existing rest homes;
(iv) a review of rest home closures since 2015;
(v) a review of the recommendations implemented from the Nursing Facility Task Force report
issued pursuant to Section 91 of Chapter 41 of the Acts of 2019;
(vi) the feasibility of receiving federal reimbursement for rest home expenses; and
(vii) a review of the current rate structure for rest homes compared to the actual cost of care to
residents.
• The Task Force was required to submit its findings, including any recommendations, or proposed legislation
necessary to carry out its recommendations, to the Clerks of the House of Representatives and the Senate
and to the House and Senate Committees on Ways and Means, not later than April 1, 2025.
• The full text of the legislation establishing the Task Force is available: Chapter 197, Section 27 of the Acts of
2024
• On the following slides are the Task Force’s overall findings, as well as individual findings based on each
aspect of the Task Force’s charge.
9
Task Force’s Findings by Charge
Overall Findings
• Over the course of its deliberations, the Task Force considered each aspect of its charge, dedicating specific
meetings to discussing payment and rate structures, regulatory oversight of rest homes, past efforts at
reform, as well as the real-world experiences of administrators of both small and large rest homes.
• From its earliest meetings, members noted that for various reasons, rest homes appear to be less well-
understood than other residential services for the aging community, such as assisted living residences or
skilled nursing facilities.
• Presentations and testimony provided to the Task Force during these meetings illustrated the variety of
settings and types of services offered across the rest home industry, the complexities of the licensing and
regulatory structure surrounding rest homes, and the desire of the industry for a renewed commitment to
reform.
• What emerged in the Task Force’s discussions was an appreciation for the critical role that these residences
play in ensuring that aging populations across the Commonwealth have access to housing and supportive
services in environments which foster dignity and respect.
10
Task Force’s Findings – Charge (i)
Charge
i. Examine the licensing, regulatory and reporting structure for rest homes
Findings
• Several state agencies support rate setting, payment, licensure and patient care responsibilities, including:

Section 12:
1. The Center for Health Information and Analysis (CHIA) – Reviews cost reports and develops rate
methodology options to present to EOHHS.

Section 13:
2. MassHealth / Office of Long-Term Services and Supports (OLTSS) – Makes direct payments to rest
homes with funds from DTA to make up the difference between the combined federal and state
SSI/SSP benefits and the actual cost of rest home care.

Section 14:
3. The Department of Transitional Assistance (DTA) – Serves as payer using State Supplemental Program
(SSP) and Emergency Aid to Elderly, Disabled, and Children (EAEDC).

Section 15:
4. The Department of Public Health (DPH) – Oversees licensing, regulates, inspects, and quality
assurance (complaint unit and inspections) for rest homes.

Section 16:
5. UMass Medical School – Oversees submission of SSI/SSP and RCC-Q data and administers the SSP
payments under agreements with OLTSS and DTA.

Section 17:
6. EOHHS Ombudsman Program – Works to resolve problems between residents and rest homes, as
they relate to the health, welfare, and rights of those served.
• The following slides outline the licensing, regulatory and reporting structure for rest homes in more detail.

12
Task Force’s Findings – Charge (i) (cont.)
Charge
i. Examine the licensing, regulatory and reporting structure for rest homes
Findings – Licensing
• DPH holds licensing authority over rest homes in the Commonwealth, requiring licensure renewal every two
years.
• Initial licensure of rest homes and any renovations afterwards require completion of a Plan Review for
Health Care Facilities. Plan Review includes the architectural review of the physical plant to determine
compliance with Facility Guidelines Institute (FGI) guidelines.
• Initial licensure/Change of Ownership (CHOW) requires Health care facility initial licensure and change of
ownership | Mass.gov as a LTC facility for the provision of Level IV services.
– This includes an initial licensure application, suitability (the review of information to
determine acceptable or right for ownership), and CORI checks, along with other application
documentation such as local municipality approval, and a fee.
– For a brand-new rest home, “Determination of Need” approval may also be required, which supports
the development of innovative health delivery methods and population health strategies within the
health care delivery system; and to ensure that resources will be made reasonably and equitably.
• For licensure renewals, DPH mails applications to facilities approximately 90 days prior to expiration, along
with a letter detailing the required documentation for submitting the application.
13
Task Force’s Findings – Charge (i) (cont.)
Charge
i. Examine the licensing, regulatory and reporting structure for rest homes
Findings – Regulatory and Reporting Structure
• The Bureau of Health Care Safety and Quality (BHCSQ) at DPH oversees regulatory requirements for the
operation of rest homes (Level IV Long Term Care Facilities), outlined in the following standards:
– 105 CMR 150.00: Standards for long-term care facilities | Mass.gov
– 105 CMR 153.00: Licensure procedure and suitability requirements for long-term care facilities |
Mass.gov
– 105 CMR 155.00: Patient and resident abuse prevention, reporting, investigation, penalties and registry |
Mass.gov
• The Health Care Facility Reporting System (HCFRS) is a web-based system overseen by BHCSQ that health
care facilities must use to report incidents and allegations of abuse, neglect, and misappropriation.
• Complaints can be submitted via the Consumer/Resident/Patient Complaint Form available on the webpage
of the Division of Health Care Facility Licensure and Certification Complaint Unit, which investigates each
complaint.
• Massachusetts rest homes must also report annually aggregate Health Care Personnel COVID-19 and
influenza data through the HCFRS: Health Care Personnel COVID & Influenza Vaccination References and
Resources

Task Force’s Findings – Charges (ii) & (iii)
Charge
ii. Examine an inventory of licensed rest homes and licensed rest home beds
iii. Examine the location and service areas of existing rest homes
Findings – Inventory of Rest Homes and Rest Home Beds
• There are currently 74 DPH-licensed rest homes operating in the Commonwealth:
– 58 freestanding rest homes with a total of 2,002 beds (see map and table on Slide 17).
– 16 skilled nursing facilities (SNFs) have rest home (Level IV) beds and are known as multi-level or
hybrid facilities, with a total of 624 Level IV beds (see map and table on Slide 18).
• In addition, there are a handful of religious rest homes that are not licensed and tracked by DPH. Per 105
CMR 150.00 Standards for Long Term Care Facilities, religious order homes do not require a license from
DPH to operate and are not included in the count. However, these homes must meet all local health and
safety requirements.
• Of the 58 freestanding rest homes referenced above, 31 are private/for-profit, 21 are non-profit. The financial
status of the remaining 6 rest homes is not tracked by DPH, as these facilities do not admit public residents
and are therefore not required to submit annual cost reports.
15
Task Force’s Findings – Charges (ii) & (iii) (cont.)
Charge
ii. Examine an inventory of licensed rest homes and licensed rest home beds
iii. Examine the location and service areas of existing rest homes
Findings – Service Areas
• Typically, the term “service area,” when used in the context of the health care system, is defined by the home
address of a patient for a given health care facility or service or based on the hospital location where a
patient is treated.By definition, a rest home is the home address for its residents, therefore, this definition
cannot be applied to patients or residents occupying a rest home. DPH does not have or collect home
addresses for residents prior to their admission to a rest home. Moreover, selection of a rest home location
may be influenced by the home address of family members rather than the prior address of the resident.
• For the purposes of this report, DPH has applied the six EOHHS regional definitions as a proxy for “service
areas” of existing rest homes: Boston, Central, Metro West, Northeast, Southeast, and Western
Massachusetts (see map and table on the following slide).

Task Force’s Findings – Charge (v)
Charge
v. Review the recommendations implemented from the Nursing Facility Task Force report issued pursuant to

Section 18:
Section 91 of Chapter 41 of the Acts of 2019
Findings
• The Nursing Facility Task Force was established through the Acts of 2019 and convened six times from
September 2019 through January 2020, charged with evaluating ways to ensure the financial stability of
skilled nursing facilities, considering the role of skilled nursing facilities within the continuum of elder care
services, and addressing current workforce challenges.
• While there was some discussion of rest homes, the majority of the Nursing Facility Task Force's work
focused on the nursing facility industry.
• Through its deliberations, the Task Force reached consensus on 19 “points of agreement,” summarized in
the group’s final report submitted to the Legislature on 1/31/2020. As referenced by the MARCH
representative during the Rest Home Task Force’s deliberations, during the 1/10/2020 meeting of the
Nursing Facility Task Force, MARCH proposed a number of recommendations related to rest homes that
were not ultimately adopted.
• These 19 points of agreement were distilled by the Nursing Facility Task Force into four “policy goals,” each
with their own “policy proposals” (see following slides for additional details).
• The full Nursing Facility Task Force report is available at:

Charge
vi. Examine the feasibility of receiving federal reimbursement for rest home expenses
Findings
• With the new federal administration and rapidly changing landscape for federal funding, it remains uncertain
the extent to which policies and funding from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)
and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) will change and, if so, how those changes may
impact rest home services.
• Rest home services are currently ineligible for federal reimbursement through Federal Medical Assistance
Percentage (FMAP), as they are not included in the list of Medicaid services approved by CMS.
• Public rest home residents often have MassHealth coverage, but they are not required to be on MassHealth
to access rest home services. However, some residents with MassHealth coverage, such as those on
MassHealth Standard, may qualify for certain Long-Term Services and Supports (LTSS) services. Many
residents already receive LTSS services, including Adult Day Health (ADH), Day Habilitation, and Home
Health, for which MassHealth receives federal matching funds.
• Given that rest homes are institutional settings, under the current CMS rules, obtaining a waiver to cover
certain services provided by rest homes would be challenging. Furthermore, even if CMS were to approve
such a waiver, rest homes would then be subject to specific Medicaid requirements for service provision.
Additionally, all residents receiving these services would need to be MassHealth members.
27
Task Force’s Findings – Charge (vii)
Charge
vii. Review the current rate structure for rest homes compared to the actual cost of care to residents
Findings
• Several state agencies support rate setting and payments: EOHHS, CHIA, and DTA evaluate costs, revenues
and budget constraints yearly to determine rates. These rates are required to be promulgated annually.
• The following information is compiled and analyzed to determine rest home rates:
• Submitted to CHIA annually by rest homes (due by June).
• Analysis typically completed by CHIA in a 6-8 month timeframe.
Cost Reports
• Required data includes assets, liabilities,revenues, expenses, bed
counts,resident days, and mortgage/loan information.
• Submitted twice a year to EOHHS by rest homes (due on March 1st and
Resident Care Cost September 1st).
Quotient (RCC-Q) Filings • Required data includes resident care expenses on direct care staff and
revenues.
Budget Appropriation • Additional funding earmarked by the Legislature.
• Please refer to the detailed overview included in the Rest Home Payment and Rate Overview presentation
from the Task Force’s 1/24/2025 meeting for additional information.

Task Force’s Recommendations
29
Task Force’s Recommendations
Recommendations:
• Based on the information, resources, and testimony presented to the Task Force, a set of long-term
strategies were developed that fall under the following five broad categories:

Section 19:
1. Update regulatory requirements to ensure standard expectations of care and distribution of funding
across rest homes.

Section 20:
2. Enhance financial reporting requirements to increase transparency and best identify impacts of costs on
rest homes.

Section 21:
3. Increases in data collection to improve access to data related to quality of care, patient demographics,
and geographic trends in occupancy.

Section 22:
4. Increase engagement among regulatory and industry stakeholders.

Section 23:
5. Increase rest home industry’s access to capital funding.
• Under each category, various proposals were developed, prioritizing both the long-term sustainability of the
rest home industry and the current realities of the federal landscape and specifically the priorities of the
incoming federal administration.
• Members discussed the draft proposals during the 2/28/2025 and 3/14/2025 Task Force meetings.
30
Task Force’s Recommendations (cont.)
1 Update regulatory requirements to ensure standard expectations of care and
distribution of funding across rest homes
A Collaborate with the rest home industry to review and propose updates to the rest home regulations to
both streamline and modernize the current regulations for licensed rest homes and ensure high quality of
care for rest home residents, including exploring establishing reasonable staffing requirements for rest
homes.
i. As part of considerations of staffing requirements, conduct an analysis of current staffing
levels, standards of care. Components would include staffing levels, turnover rates and impact
on quality of care.
ii. Explore feasibility of client related quality measures such as survey responses on care,
environment and experience, family communication (especially where they go when a rest
home is closed) and autonomy of clients.
B Conduct an analysis to report on the viability of receiving federal approval to receive Federal Medical
Assistance Percentages (FMAP) for rest home services and identify any necessary changes to current law
or regulatory requirements that would facilitate rest homes being eligible for FMAP.
31
Task Force’s Recommendations (cont.)
1 Update regulatory requirements to ensure standard expectations of care and
distribution of funding across rest homes
C In the instance where additional funding is allocated to rest homes, consider the following rate
adjustments:
• Lower the occupancy standard from 90% and increase the cap on variable costs from 85%
• Use alternative inflation forecasting data (e.g., Massachusetts CPI) for updating rates
• Adjust the methodology for determining capital rates
• Combine the two existing add-ons, the DTA/EAEDC and Resident Care add-ons, into a single
DTA add-on, structured to benefit rest homes that have a larger percentage of residents receiving
DTA benefits.
• Provide staffing add-ons for rest homes with higher use of nursing staff, reflecting higher acuity
needs of residents.
D Increase the Personal Needs Allowance (PNA) for rest home residents that receive public subsidy, to
enhance the dignity of residents and address the current PNA of $72.80.
32
Task Force’s Recommendations (cont.)
2 Enhance financial reporting requirements to increase transparency and best
identify impacts of costs on rest homes
A Strengthen cost report data submissions by requiring rest homes to submit financial statements with cost
reports and identifying any existing redundancies relative to reporting requirements in an effort to
streamline those requirements.
B Update the RCC-Q report submission process, allowing rest homes to petition EOHHS for a temporary
“waiver” if a rest home was below the RCC-Q threshold because the costs incurred by the rest home to
make physical plant improvements were more than 10% of the rest home’s annual revenue in the
reporting year.
C Ensure transparency and accountability in the RCC-Q submissions by annually publishing the RCC-Q
scores on the EOHHS website, in the manner it is currently done for the DCC-Q scores for nursing
facilities.
33
Task Force’s Recommendations (cont.)
3 Increase data collection to improve access to data related to quality of care,
patient demographics and geographic trends in occupancy
A Monitor the Commonwealth’s needs for rest home services in all geographic areas by collecting staffing
and occupancy data from rest homes on a regular basis in a manner which does not impose significant
administrative burden on rest homes.
i. Explore the feasibility of conducting a detailed analysis of geographic disparities in rest home
services and occupancy rates with the goal of developing strategies to address these disparities.
B Improve hospitals and other providers’ awareness of rest homes by publishing a dedicated page
containing information about rest home services, an interactive map of rest homes, and their contact
information.
34
Task Force’s Recommendations (cont.)
4 Increase engagement among regulatory and industry stakeholders
A DPH holds annual meetings with rest home providers to share important information, including common
survey findings and best practices, and to engage in Q&A with providers, with the aim of improving care
for rest home residents.
B Establish an internal EOHHS working group to explore the topics raised during the deliberations of the
Rest Home Task Force, with regular engagement from the rest home industry.
C EOHHS, DTA, DPH and MassHealth meet with the Joint Committee on Aging and Independence on a
quarterly basis to discuss the implementation of recommendations included in the Rest Home Task Force
report.
35
Task Force’s Recommendations (cont.)
5 Increase rest home industry’s access to capital funding
A Spend the $10 million for capital projects at rest homes authorized by the Legislature in the 2024
Economic Development Bill (Chapter 238, Acts of 2024, An Act Relative to Strengthening
Massachusetts’ Economic Leadership). See note below.
Note: Task Force members discussed the need for additional capital funding for the rest home industry.
However, for a capital earmark in a bond bill to be funded, it must be included in the Governor’s annual
capital investment plan (CIP), published in the spring each year. The Administration is aware of the
authorization and will consider this program in the context of all other funding requests received, all capital
needs across the Commonwealth, the amount of capital spending that the Commonwealth can prudently
afford, and whether the request is eligible for tax-exempt bond financing per federal tax law.
36
Task Force’s Recommendations (cont.)
Recommendations on Which the Task Force Was Unable to Reach Clear Agreement
• Establish a requirement for a 5-year Strategic Plan outlining agency and industry roles, timelines, as well as
anticipated outcomes, to serve as a framework for this collaboration and allow the incorporation of any
recommendations that may come from the other groups, such as the Viability and Sustainability of Long-Term
Care Facilities Task Force, as well as the Senior Housing Commission.
• Change the use and methodology of the RCC-Q, including:
– Align the current RCC-Q requirements for rest homes with the DCC-Q requirements for nursing
facilities by lowering the RCC-Q threshold to 75% and prorating the self-reported costs related to the
rest homes ED/CEO/owner(s) and staff not providing direct care services.
– Eliminate the RCC-Q, establishing an alternative rating system focused on quality-of-care.
– Allow Administrator and Responsible Person Cost
– Conduct an independent analysis of the relevant allowable costs, goals, criteria and outcomes of the
RCC-Q, and the impact of including private revenue and revenue from endowments.
• Conduct an independent analysis of rate adequacy and cost reporting that would inform any regulatory
revision related to costs associated with minimum staffing levels and recommend any new or updated
financial reporting requirements.

Task Force’s Recommendations (cont.)
Recommendations on Which the Task Force Was Unable to Reach Clear Agreement (cont.)
• Address the capital needs of rest homes across the state through a number of possible mechanisms:
– Conduct a capital needs assessment for all facilities;
– Ensure that rest homes with Level IV Nursing Homes are eligible for funds from the Long-Term Care
Workforce and Capital Fund in the 2024 Long Term Care bill (Chapter 197 of the Acts of 2024, An
Act to Improve Quality And Oversight of Long-term Care);
– Explore whether supportive housing funds in the 2024 Economic Development bond bill (Chapter 238,
Acts of 2024, An Act Relative to Strengthening Massachusetts’ Economic Leadership) could be used for
rest homes; and
• Amend the construction standards for rest homes to allow rest homes to be renovated in accordance with
residential building codes similar to those allowed for Assisted Living Residences. Current regulations require
rest homes to comply with health care facility regulations, subject to plan review at DPH, and Determination
of Need requirements. All of these requirements make it extremely challenging and costly to renovate and
update rest homes.
• Explore whether DPH regulations and licensing applications could include questions regarding previous
ownership of rest homes (as part of suitability criteria).

Task Force Overview
• The Rest Home Task Force was established in 2024 with the enactment of Section 27 of Chapter 197 of
the Acts of 2024, An Act to Improve Quality and Oversight of Long-term Care, and was charged with
evaluating the governance and regulatory structure of rest homes in the Commonwealth.
• The Task Force was chaired by Executive Office of Health and Human Services Undersecretary for
Health, Kiame Mahaniah, acting as the designee of the Secretary of Health and Human Services, and was
comprised of a diverse panel of lawmakers, public health professionals, industry stakeholders, rest home
administrators, and experts in health care administration and finance (see full list in Appendix B).
• The Task Force met five times from January to March 2025 and was required to submit its
recommendations to the Clerks of the House of Representatives and Senate and the House and Senate
Committees on Ways and Means, not later than April 1, 2025.
• All meetings were subject to the Open Meeting Law and minutes were taken and approved for each
meeting. Appendix C outlines the meetings and input provided, including the individuals who presented.
All materials considered by the Task Force as well as minutes of the Task Force’s meetings were posted
on a publicly-available webpage: https://www.mass.gov/rest-home-task-force
Note: With the new federal administration and rapidly changing landscape for federal funding, it remains
uncertain the extent to which policies and funding from the U.S. Department of Health and Human
Services (HHS) and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) will change and, if so, how those
changes may impact rest home services.
3

Background – Key Definitions
• Rest Home: a residential care facility that provides 24-hour supervision and supportive services for aged,
infirm, and at times indigent populations, who may have difficulty in caring for themselves, but do not
routinely require nursing care. Rest homes provide housing, meals, activities, and arrange and coordinate
medical services for individuals who need a supportive living arrangement. Rest homes are licensed by the
Massachusetts Department of Public Health (DPH).
– Some rest home beds, classified as “Level IV” beds, are located within skilled nursing facilities (SNFs),
which are considered “multi-level” or “hybrid” facilities (see map and table on Slide 18).
– Per 105 CMR 150.00 Standards for Long Term Care Facilities, religious order homes do not require a
license from DPH to operate. These homes must meet all local health and safety requirements.
• Nursing Facility: alternatively known as “skilled nursing facilities” (SNFs), nursing facilities are supportive
living environments for aged or infirm residents that provides a wide range of health and personal care
services. Services at nursing facilities focus more on medical care than most rest home or assisted living
facilities, and may include rehabilitation services, such as physical, occupational, and speech therapy. Similar
to rest homes, nursing facilities are licensed by DPH.
• Assisted Living Residence: private residences that offer housing, meals, and personal care services to aging
adults who live independently. Assisted living residences (ALRs) are certified by the Executive Office of
Aging & Independence (AGE) and are designed for adults who can live independently in a home-like
environment but may need help with daily activities such as housekeeping, meal preparation, bathing,
dressing, and/or medication assistance. ALRs do not provide medical or nursing services and are not
designed for people who need serious medical care. Most assisted living residents pay fees privately, and the
cost for each ALR can vary depending on the size, services, and location of the residence.
4

Background – Key Definitions (cont.)
• RCC-Q: the Resident Care Cost Quotient (RCC-Q) is a methodology for tracking spending across rest
homes, including investments in direct care staff, infection control, and other resident care related
expenditures that have a direct and meaningful impact on overall resident quality of life, health, and well-
being. The RCC-Q serves as a mechanism to strengthen resident quality of care by holding rest homes
financially accountable for managing their revenue and investing in resident care related costs, including
direct care staffing.
– To increase and incentivize greater expenditure in these areas, EOHHS required residential care
facilities to begin reporting resident care expenditures and revenue in September 2023 for the
purposes of calculating the RCC-Q.
– EOHHS conducts audits of RCC-Q reports for five rest homes each year, selected based on their
RCC-Q score (>80%), size of the facility (to represent a distribution across the industry), and whether
the facility was audited in the prior year.
– Please refer to the detailed overview included in the Rest Home Payment and Rate Overview
presentation from the Task Force’s 1/24/2025 meeting for additional information.
• DCC-Q: similar to the RCC-Q for rest homes, the Direct Care Cost Quotient (DCC-Q) is a methodology
for tracking spending at nursing facilities, the key difference being that nursing facilities are not permitted to
include the salaries for administrators, executive directors, and responsible parties (RPs) in their reporting
as direct care staff.
– Since October 2023, all nursing facilities participating in the Massachusetts Medicaid (“MassHealth”)
program are required to complete the DCC-Q, as part of a series of reforms to promote a higher
standard of care and improved infection control.
5

Background – Oversight of Rest Home Quality / Resident Experience
EOHHS provides oversight of rest homes and ensures the quality of residents’ experience through the following:
1. Long-Term Care (LTC) Ombudsperson Program – rest home-specific activities
• The LTC Ombudsperson acts as an advocate and independent mediator to resolve problems between
residents and rest homes as they relate to the health, welfare, and rights of those they serve.
• Independently investigates any issues that are reported by residents, family members, or resident advocates,
visiting facilities on a regular basis and allowing residents to voice their complaints and work toward
resolutions with staff before issues can escalate.
• In 2024, the three largest categories of complaints included: 1) Residents’ Autonomy, Choice, Rights;
2) Admissions, Transfers, Discharges, Evictions; and 3) Environment.
2. DPH Bureau of Health Care Safety and Quality (BHCSQ)
• The DPH BHCSQ conducts unannounced visits to all DPH-licensed facilities on a bi-annual basis, or ad-hoc
when specific licensure complaints are raised. The BHCSQ team consults with the local LTC Ombudsperson
prior to visits, as appropriate.
• Surveys are conducted by BHCSQ licensure surveyors who survey all types of licensed healthcare facilities.
The full list of the relevant regulations are reviewed with administrators, including census, capacity, prior
incident reports, any medical records, personnel files, vaccination reporting, and all policies and procedures.
• When onsite, surveyors ask whether any residents wish to speak with them, offering to converse with them
privately out of earshot of staff. Surveyors also make efforts to seek out residents who may have submitted
a complaint or been involved in a reported incident.
6

Background – Oversight of Rest Home Quality / Resident Experience (cont.)
3. DPH Complaint Unit
• The DPH Complaint Unit follows up on resident complaints and consults with the appropriate LTC
Ombudsperson as part of its investigation/review. Complaints are sorted into two distinct categories:
facility-reported incidents and resident complaints.
1. Facility-reported incidents
– Current regulations require that facility administrators notify the DPH Complaint Unit directly
when certain incidents of a serious nature occur. These incidents may include allegations of
abuse, falls with injury, elopements, death, criminal acts, resident rights, medication incidents, etc.
– In 2024, DPH received 300 facility reports. None of these reports resulted in the facility being
deemed in immediate jeopardy, but were instead indications of facility owners’ adherence to
their regulatory requirements and diligent oversight of their operations.
2. Resident complaints
– As with the LTC Ombudsperson Program, resident complaints may be submitted directly to the
DPH Complaint Unit. These complaints are triaged by the DPH Complaint Unit and investigated.
– Examples of resident complaints may include falls/injuries, elopements, resident rights, quality of
care, environment, billing, etc.
– In 2024, DPH received 115 resident complaint reports. In many cases, these reports were
duplicative of self-reported incidents also reported by facilities.

and to the House and Senate Committees on Ways and Means, not later than April 1, 2025.
• The full text of the legislation establishing the Task Force is available: Chapter 197, Section 27 of the Acts of
2024
• On the following slides are the Task Force’s overall findings, as well as individual findings based on each
aspect of the Task Force’s charge.
9

Task Force’s Findings by Charge
Overall Findings
• Over the course of its deliberations, the Task Force considered each aspect of its charge, dedicating specific
meetings to discussing payment and rate structures, regulatory oversight of rest homes, past efforts at
reform, as well as the real-world experiences of administrators of both small and large rest homes.
• From its earliest meetings, members noted that for various reasons, rest homes appear to be less well-
understood than other residential services for the aging community, such as assisted living residences or
skilled nursing facilities.
• Presentations and testimony provided to the Task Force during these meetings illustrated the variety of
settings and types of services offered across the rest home industry, the complexities of the licensing and
regulatory structure surrounding rest homes, and the desire of the industry for a renewed commitment to
reform.
• What emerged in the Task Force’s discussions was an appreciation for the critical role that these residences
play in ensuring that aging populations across the Commonwealth have access to housing and supportive
services in environments which foster dignity and respect.
10

Task Force’s Findings – Charge (i)
Charge
i. Examine the licensing, regulatory and reporting structure for rest homes
Findings
• Several state agencies support rate setting, payment, licensure and patient care responsibilities, including:
1. The Center for Health Information and Analysis (CHIA) – Reviews cost reports and develops rate
methodology options to present to EOHHS.
2. MassHealth / Office of Long-Term Services and Supports (OLTSS) – Makes direct payments to rest
homes with funds from DTA to make up the difference between the combined federal and state
SSI/SSP benefits and the actual cost of rest home care.
3. The Department of Transitional Assistance (DTA) – Serves as payer using State Supplemental Program
(SSP) and Emergency Aid to Elderly, Disabled, and Children (EAEDC).
4. The Department of Public Health (DPH) – Oversees licensing, regulates, inspects, and quality
assurance (complaint unit and inspections) for rest homes.
5. UMass Medical School – Oversees submission of SSI/SSP and RCC-Q data and administers the SSP
payments under agreements with OLTSS and DTA.
6. EOHHS Ombudsman Program – Works to resolve problems between residents and rest homes, as
they relate to the health, welfare, and rights of those served.
• The following slides outline the licensing, regulatory and reporting structure for rest homes in more detail.
11

Task Force’s Findings – Charge (i) (cont.)
Findings (cont.)
• Several state agencies support rate setting, payment, licensure and patient care responsibilities.
12

Task Force’s Findings – Charge (i) (cont.)
Charge
i. Examine the licensing, regulatory and reporting structure for rest homes
Findings – Licensing
• DPH holds licensing authority over rest homes in the Commonwealth, requiring licensure renewal every two
years.
• Initial licensure of rest homes and any renovations afterwards require completion of a Plan Review for
Health Care Facilities. Plan Review includes the architectural review of the physical plant to determine
compliance with Facility Guidelines Institute (FGI) guidelines.
• Initial licensure/Change of Ownership (CHOW) requires Health care facility initial licensure and change of
ownership | Mass.gov as a LTC facility for the provision of Level IV services.
– This includes an initial licensure application, suitability (the review of information to
determine acceptable or right for ownership), and CORI checks, along with other application
documentation such as local municipality approval, and a fee.
– For a brand-new rest home, “Determination of Need” approval may also be required, which supports
the development of innovative health delivery methods and population health strategies within the
health care delivery system; and to ensure that resources will be made reasonably and equitably.
• For licensure renewals, DPH mails applications to facilities approximately 90 days prior to expiration, along
with a letter detailing the required documentation for submitting the application.
13

Task Force’s Findings – Charge (i) (cont.)
Charge
i. Examine the licensing, regulatory and reporting structure for rest homes
Findings – Regulatory and Reporting Structure
• The Bureau of Health Care Safety and Quality (BHCSQ) at DPH oversees regulatory requirements for the
operation of rest homes (Level IV Long Term Care Facilities), outlined in the following standards:
– 105 CMR 150.00: Standards for long-term care facilities | Mass.gov
– 105 CMR 153.00: Licensure procedure and suitability requirements for long-term care facilities |
Mass.gov
– 105 CMR 155.00: Patient and resident abuse prevention, reporting, investigation, penalties and registry |
Mass.gov
• The Health Care Facility Reporting System (HCFRS) is a web-based system overseen by BHCSQ that health
care facilities must use to report incidents and allegations of abuse, neglect, and misappropriation.
• Complaints can be submitted via the Consumer/Resident/Patient Complaint Form available on the webpage
of the Division of Health Care Facility Licensure and Certification Complaint Unit, which investigates each
complaint.
• Massachusetts rest homes must also report annually aggregate Health Care Personnel COVID-19 and
influenza data through the HCFRS: Health Care Personnel COVID & Influenza Vaccination References and
Resources
14

Task Force’s Findings – Charges (ii) & (iii)
Charge
ii. Examine an inventory of licensed rest homes and licensed rest home beds
iii. Examine the location and service areas of existing rest homes
Findings – Inventory of Rest Homes and Rest Home Beds
• There are currently 74 DPH-licensed rest homes operating in the Commonwealth:
– 58 freestanding rest homes with a total of 2,002 beds (see map and table on Slide 17).
– 16 skilled nursing facilities (SNFs) have rest home (Level IV) beds and are known as multi-level or
hybrid facilities, with a total of 624 Level IV beds (see map and table on Slide 18).
• In addition, there are a handful of religious rest homes that are not licensed and tracked by DPH. Per 105
CMR 150.00 Standards for Long Term Care Facilities, religious order homes do not require a license from
DPH to operate and are not included in the count. However, these homes must meet all local health and
safety requirements.
• Of the 58 freestanding rest homes referenced above, 31 are private/for-profit, 21 are non-profit. The financial
status of the remaining 6 rest homes is not tracked by DPH, as these facilities do not admit public residents
and are therefore not required to submit annual cost reports.
15

Task Force’s Findings – Charges (ii) & (iii) (cont.)
Charge
ii. Examine an inventory of licensed rest homes and licensed rest home beds
iii. Examine the location and service areas of existing rest homes
Findings – Service Areas
• Typically, the term “service area,” when used in the context of the health care system, is defined by the home
address of a patient for a given health care facility or service or based on the hospital location where a
patient is treated.By definition, a rest home is the home address for its residents, therefore, this definition
cannot be applied to patients or residents occupying a rest home. DPH does not have or collect home
addresses for residents prior to their admission to a rest home. Moreover, selection of a rest home location
may be influenced by the home address of family members rather than the prior address of the resident.
• For the purposes of this report, DPH has applied the six EOHHS regional definitions as a proxy for “service
areas” of existing rest homes: Boston, Central, Metro West, Northeast, Southeast, and Western
Massachusetts (see map and table on the following slide).

Task Force’s Findings – Charge (v)
Charge
v. Review the recommendations implemented from the Nursing Facility Task Force report issued pursuant to
Section 91 of Chapter 41 of the Acts of 2019
Findings
• The Nursing Facility Task Force was established through the Acts of 2019 and convened six times from
September 2019 through January 2020, charged with evaluating ways to ensure the financial stability of
skilled nursing facilities, considering the role of skilled nursing facilities within the continuum of elder care
services, and addressing current workforce challenges.
• While there was some discussion of rest homes, the majority of the Nursing Facility Task Force's work
focused on the nursing facility industry.
• Through its deliberations, the Task Force reached consensus on 19 “points of agreement,” summarized in
the group’s final report submitted to the Legislature on 1/31/2020. As referenced by the MARCH
representative during the Rest Home Task Force’s deliberations, during the 1/10/2020 meeting of the
Nursing Facility Task Force, MARCH proposed a number of recommendations related to rest homes that
were not ultimately adopted.
• These 19 points of agreement were distilled by the Nursing Facility Task Force into four “policy goals,” each
with their own “policy proposals” (see following slides for additional details).
• The full Nursing Facility Task Force report is available at:

Task Force’s Findings – Charge (vi)
Charge
vi. Examine the feasibility of receiving federal reimbursement for rest home expenses
Findings
• With the new federal administration and rapidly changing landscape for federal funding, it remains uncertain
the extent to which policies and funding from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)
and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) will change and, if so, how those changes may
impact rest home services.
• Rest home services are currently ineligible for federal reimbursement through Federal Medical Assistance
Percentage (FMAP), as they are not included in the list of Medicaid services approved by CMS.
• Public rest home residents often have MassHealth coverage, but they are not required to be on MassHealth
to access rest home services. However, some residents with MassHealth coverage, such as those on
MassHealth Standard, may qualify for certain Long-Term Services and Supports (LTSS) services. Many
residents already receive LTSS services, including Adult Day Health (ADH), Day Habilitation, and Home
Health, for which MassHealth receives federal matching funds.
• Given that rest homes are institutional settings, under the current CMS rules, obtaining a waiver to cover
certain services provided by rest homes would be challenging. Furthermore, even if CMS were to approve
such a waiver, rest homes would then be subject to specific Medicaid requirements for service provision.
Additionally, all residents receiving these services would need to be MassHealth members.
27

Task Force’s Findings – Charge (vii)
Charge
vii. Review the current rate structure for rest homes compared to the actual cost of care to residents
Findings
• Several state agencies support rate setting and payments: EOHHS, CHIA, and DTA evaluate costs, revenues
and budget constraints yearly to determine rates. These rates are required to be promulgated annually.
• The following information is compiled and analyzed to determine rest home rates:
• Submitted to CHIA annually by rest homes (due by June).
• Analysis typically completed by CHIA in a 6-8 month timeframe.
Cost Reports
• Required data includes assets, liabilities,revenues, expenses, bed
counts,resident days, and mortgage/loan information.
• Submitted twice a year to EOHHS by rest homes (due on March 1st and
Resident Care Cost September 1st).
Quotient (RCC-Q) Filings • Required data includes resident care expenses on direct care staff and
revenues.
Budget Appropriation • Additional funding earmarked by the Legislature.
• Please refer to the detailed overview included in the Rest Home Payment and Rate Overview presentation
from the Task Force’s 1/24/2025 meeting for additional information.

Task Force’s Recommendations
29

Task Force’s Recommendations
Recommendations:
• Based on the information, resources, and testimony presented to the Task Force, a set of long-term
strategies were developed that fall under the following five broad categories:
1. Update regulatory requirements to ensure standard expectations of care and distribution of funding
across rest homes.
2. Enhance financial reporting requirements to increase transparency and best identify impacts of costs on
rest homes.
3. Increases in data collection to improve access to data related to quality of care, patient demographics,
and geographic trends in occupancy.
4. Increase engagement among regulatory and industry stakeholders.
5. Increase rest home industry’s access to capital funding.
• Under each category, various proposals were developed, prioritizing both the long-term sustainability of the
rest home industry and the current realities of the federal landscape and specifically the priorities of the
incoming federal administration.
• Members discussed the draft proposals during the 2/28/2025 and 3/14/2025 Task Force meetings.
30

Task Force’s Recommendations (cont.)
1 Update regulatory requirements to ensure standard expectations of care and
distribution of funding across rest homes
A Collaborate with the rest home industry to review and propose updates to the rest home regulations to
both streamline and modernize the current regulations for licensed rest homes and ensure high quality of
care for rest home residents, including exploring establishing reasonable staffing requirements for rest
homes.
i. As part of considerations of staffing requirements, conduct an analysis of current staffing
levels, standards of care. Components would include staffing levels, turnover rates and impact
on quality of care.
ii. Explore feasibility of client related quality measures such as survey responses on care,
environment and experience, family communication (especially where they go when a rest
home is closed) and autonomy of clients.
B Conduct an analysis to report on the viability of receiving federal approval to receive Federal Medical
Assistance Percentages (FMAP) for rest home services and identify any necessary changes to current law
or regulatory requirements that would facilitate rest homes being eligible for FMAP.
31

Task Force’s Recommendations (cont.)
1 Update regulatory requirements to ensure standard expectations of care and
distribution of funding across rest homes
C In the instance where additional funding is allocated to rest homes, consider the following rate
adjustments:
• Lower the occupancy standard from 90% and increase the cap on variable costs from 85%
• Use alternative inflation forecasting data (e.g., Massachusetts CPI) for updating rates
• Adjust the methodology for determining capital rates
• Combine the two existing add-ons, the DTA/EAEDC and Resident Care add-ons, into a single
DTA add-on, structured to benefit rest homes that have a larger percentage of residents receiving
DTA benefits.
• Provide staffing add-ons for rest homes with higher use of nursing staff, reflecting higher acuity
needs of residents.
D Increase the Personal Needs Allowance (PNA) for rest home residents that receive public subsidy, to
enhance the dignity of residents and address the current PNA of $72.80.
32

Task Force’s Recommendations (cont.)
2 Enhance financial reporting requirements to increase transparency and best
identify impacts of costs on rest homes
A Strengthen cost report data submissions by requiring rest homes to submit financial statements with cost
reports and identifying any existing redundancies relative to reporting requirements in an effort to
streamline those requirements.
B Update the RCC-Q report submission process, allowing rest homes to petition EOHHS for a temporary
“waiver” if a rest home was below the RCC-Q threshold because the costs incurred by the rest home to
make physical plant improvements were more than 10% of the rest home’s annual revenue in the
reporting year.
C Ensure transparency and accountability in the RCC-Q submissions by annually publishing the RCC-Q
scores on the EOHHS website, in the manner it is currently done for the DCC-Q scores for nursing
facilities.
33

Task Force’s Recommendations (cont.)
3 Increase data collection to improve access to data related to quality of care,
patient demographics and geographic trends in occupancy
A Monitor the Commonwealth’s needs for rest home services in all geographic areas by collecting staffing
and occupancy data from rest homes on a regular basis in a manner which does not impose significant
administrative burden on rest homes.
i. Explore the feasibility of conducting a detailed analysis of geographic disparities in rest home
services and occupancy rates with the goal of developing strategies to address these disparities.
B Improve hospitals and other providers’ awareness of rest homes by publishing a dedicated page
containing information about rest home services, an interactive map of rest homes, and their contact
information.
34

Task Force’s Recommendations (cont.)
4 Increase engagement among regulatory and industry stakeholders
A DPH holds annual meetings with rest home providers to share important information, including common
survey findings and best practices, and to engage in Q&A with providers, with the aim of improving care
for rest home residents.
B Establish an internal EOHHS working group to explore the topics raised during the deliberations of the
Rest Home Task Force, with regular engagement from the rest home industry.
C EOHHS, DTA, DPH and MassHealth meet with the Joint Committee on Aging and Independence on a
quarterly basis to discuss the implementation of recommendations included in the Rest Home Task Force
report.
35

Task Force’s Recommendations (cont.)
5 Increase rest home industry’s access to capital funding
A Spend the $10 million for capital projects at rest homes authorized by the Legislature in the 2024
Economic Development Bill (Chapter 238, Acts of 2024, An Act Relative to Strengthening
Massachusetts’ Economic Leadership). See note below.
Note: Task Force members discussed the need for additional capital funding for the rest home industry.
However, for a capital earmark in a bond bill to be funded, it must be included in the Governor’s annual
capital investment plan (CIP), published in the spring each year. The Administration is aware of the
authorization and will consider this program in the context of all other funding requests received, all capital
needs across the Commonwealth, the amount of capital spending that the Commonwealth can prudently
afford, and whether the request is eligible for tax-exempt bond financing per federal tax law.
36

Task Force’s Recommendations (cont.)
Recommendations on Which the Task Force Was Unable to Reach Clear Agreement
• Establish a requirement for a 5-year Strategic Plan outlining agency and industry roles, timelines, as well as
anticipated outcomes, to serve as a framework for this collaboration and allow the incorporation of any
recommendations that may come from the other groups, such as the Viability and Sustainability of Long-Term
Care Facilities Task Force, as well as the Senior Housing Commission.
• Change the use and methodology of the RCC-Q, including:
– Align the current RCC-Q requirements for rest homes with the DCC-Q requirements for nursing
facilities by lowering the RCC-Q threshold to 75% and prorating the self-reported costs related to the
rest homes ED/CEO/owner(s) and staff not providing direct care services.
– Eliminate the RCC-Q, establishing an alternative rating system focused on quality-of-care.
– Allow Administrator and Responsible Person Cost
– Conduct an independent analysis of the relevant allowable costs, goals, criteria and outcomes of the
RCC-Q, and the impact of including private revenue and revenue from endowments.
• Conduct an independent analysis of rate adequacy and cost reporting that would inform any regulatory
revision related to costs associated with minimum staffing levels and recommend any new or updated
financial reporting requirements.
37

Task Force’s Recommendations (cont.)
Recommendations on Which the Task Force Was Unable to Reach Clear Agreement (cont.)
• Address the capital needs of rest homes across the state through a number of possible mechanisms:
– Conduct a capital needs assessment for all facilities;
– Ensure that rest homes with Level IV Nursing Homes are eligible for funds from the Long-Term Care
Workforce and Capital Fund in the 2024 Long Term Care bill (Chapter 197 of the Acts of 2024, An
Act to Improve Quality And Oversight of Long-term Care);
– Explore whether supportive housing funds in the 2024 Economic Development bond bill (Chapter 238,
Acts of 2024, An Act Relative to Strengthening Massachusetts’ Economic Leadership) could be used for
rest homes; and
• Amend the construction standards for rest homes to allow rest homes to be renovated in accordance with
residential building codes similar to those allowed for Assisted Living Residences. Current regulations require
rest homes to comply with health care facility regulations, subject to plan review at DPH, and Determination
of Need requirements. All of these requirements make it extremely challenging and costly to renovate and
update rest homes.
• Explore whether DPH regulations and licensing applications could include questions regarding previous
ownership of rest homes (as part of suitability criteria).
