MESSAGE FROM COMMISSION CHAIR
2024: A Year of Milestones
My fellow commissioners join me in commending POST Staff for their accomplishments this year. Our report describes POST’s
accomplishments in Calendar Year 2024 and summarizes activities anticipated in Calendar Year 2025. Our report also provides
statutory reporting data for Fiscal Year 2024 (July 1, 2023 – June 30, 2024).
POST’s mission is to improve policing and enhance public confidence in law enforcement. In 2024, we continued making significant
progress in fulfilling our mission while also meeting key obligations and deadlines set forth in the statute. We certified and
recertified thousands of officers, initiated or resolved dozens of disciplinary cases, promulgated auditing regulations, expanded
staff capacity, and we made significant technological enhancements, which included launching a new website.
POST receives complaints from the public and incident reports from law enforcement agencies on a regular basis. Our staff
reviews each of those reports as part of our commitment to answering every member of the public who submits a complaint. We
rely on law enforcement agencies to investigate many of those complaints, and we collaborate with those agencies to bring cases
to the Commission and/or publish the relevant disciplinary information.
In 2024, we recertified 5,951 officers with last names Q–Z and certified 2,193 police academy graduates. To prepare for the second
round of recertification (officers with last names A–H in July 2025, previously recertified in 2022), the Commission formed a
Certification Policy Subcommittee. Between February and December 2024, the Subcommittee met eight times to review public
comments, consider recertification modifications, and explore approaches to assess officers’ character, physical fitness and
behavioral health.
Looking ahead to 2025, we anticipate that the number of cases brought before the Commission will increase. We will continue to
advance policies and standards related to law enforcement agency certification, standardized use of force reporting and more. To
support our increasing workload, we anticipate that POST will continue to grow, much as it did in 2024 when it increased from 37 to
49 staff members. To that end, the budget request for Fiscal Year 2026 includes funding for an additional seven employees.
We remain committed to fulfilling the mission of police reform, strengthening policing in Massachusetts and fostering public trust
in law enforcement.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
During its third full year of operations, the Commission achieved important milestones required by POST’s statute (Chapter 253 of
the Acts of 2020, also referred to as Police Reform). Major accomplishments in 2024 include:
LEA Portal Expands to Include Complaint and Incident Reporting
• POST soft-launched the Law Enforcement Agency (LEA) Portal for complaint and incident reporting in January 2024 to select
law enforcement agencies. The Information and Technology Division conducted five virtual training sessions in February 2024
for 250 users and issued training materials via web and social media before launching the portal to all agencies in March

Section 5:
2024. POST continues to develop portal functionality to make the interactions via the portal more efficient and to capture
additional information, including officer commendation letters.
Certification Developments
• POST convened a new Certification Policy Subcommittee in February 2024 to address certification policy for 2025 and beyond.
The Subcommittee focused on officer health and wellness and held a physical fitness panel event in October 2024. The
Subcommittee ultimately adopted a policy aligning officer certification expiration dates with officer birth dates and proposed
reviewing in-service training requirements annually, rather than triennially.
• Additionally, the Certification Division opened the LEA portal in May 2024 to aid in the processing of 5,951 officers with last
names Q-Z for recertification. The MPTC completed the third and final Bridge Academy, which enabled the Commission to
certify an additional 1,400 officers.
Development of Key Regulations
• The Commission held public hearings and reviewed public comments on draft regulations and policies. The Commission
promulgated 555 CMR 12.00: Maintenance, Reporting, and Auditing of Law Enforcement Records and discussed drafts of 555
CMR 13.00: Law Enforcement Agency Certification Standards.
New Website
• In August 2024, POST launched its new website, www.mapostcommission.gov, which resulted in a substantial increase in
public engagement. In 2025, POST plans to deploy a business intelligence tool to enhance the Commission’s public data
reporting and analytics, as contemplated by POST’s statute.

PROVISIONS OF THE POLICE REFORM ACT OF 2020
Chapter 253 of the Acts of 2020 (also referred to as Police Reform) established the POST Commission. Police Reform charged the
Commission with creating a mandatory certification process for police officers and law enforcement agencies, along with the
following goals:

Section 6:
1. CERTIFY NEW AND EXISTING Police Reform outlines certain requirements for certifying new officers and
OFFICERS EVERY THREE YEARS. recertifying existing officers. Police Reform initially certified all active officers and
required new officers to be certified according to certain criteria. Police Reform also
required that all officers be recertified every three years. To distribute the certifica-
tion workload, Police Reform set expiration dates for certification based on officers'
last names. The Commission recertified officers with last names A-H on July 1, 2022;
officers with last names I-P on July 1, 2023; and officers with last names Q-Z on July 1,

Section 7:
2024. The coming year will bring changes to the recertification process, as POST will
recertify officers with last names A-H for the second time on July 1, 2025.

Section 8:
2. I N VESTIGATE ALLEGATIONS POST’s mission includes establishing and conducting an adjudicatory process for

condition or revoke officers’ certification or mandate retraining. A revocation, or

conduct. Once POST decertifies an officer, POST submits the officer’s name to

within two business days and provide POST final reports and disciplinary
dispositions once the agency has completed its investigation. When investigating
misconduct, POST staff analyze the information provided by agencies to identify
patterns and situations that may warrant referral to prosecuting agencies.

Officers with last names I through P June 30, 2023
Division staff also collaborate with the MPTC to ensure
Officers with last names Q through Z June 30, 2024
officers comply with training requirements.
As noted, officers covered by POST’s statute must renew The Commission requires officers’ agencies to assist the
their certification every three years. Officers who were Commission in verifying certain requirements set by POST’s
active on July 1, 2021 were automatically certified under statute and to submit certain information necessary for
POST’s statute. POST’s statute also provided that those recertifying officers. POST’s statute also required that the
initial certifications would expire as follows: Commission certify all new officers who attended and
graduated from a police academy before December 1, 2021.
THE CERTIFICATION STANDARDS FOR ALL OFFICERS INCLUDE:
(i) Attained the age of 21;
(ii) Successful completion of a high school education or equivalent, as determined by the Commission;
(iii) Successful completion of the basic training program approved by the MPTC;
(iv) Successful completion of a physical and psychological fitness evaluation approved by the Commission;
(v) Successful completion of a state and national background check, including but not limited to fingerprinting and a full
employment history. If the applicant was previously employed in law enforcement in any state or United
States territory or by the federal government, the applicant’s full employment record, including complaints and discipline,
will be evaluated in the background check;
(vi) Passage of an examination approved by the Commission;
(vii) Possession of current first aid and cardiopulmonary resuscitation certificates or the equivalent, as determined by
the Commission;
(viii) Successful completion of an oral interview administered by the Commission; and
(ix) Being of good moral character and fit for employment in law enforcement, as determined by the Commission.
The Division of Certification, in consultation with the Division of Standards, also creates and maintains a database of records
for each certified officer. The Division regularly publishes a monthly searchable officer status database on the Commission’s
website with the help of the Communications Division.
PAGE 8 | MASSACHUSETTS POST COMMISSION ANNUAL REPORT 2024
OPERATIONS
The Division of Certification currently has nine employees: a director; senior certification advisor; certification manager; four senior
certification specialists; and two data analysts.
The Division processes officer information utilizing the LEA portal, a web-based platform that debuted in 2023. During the 2024
recertification cycle, the Division used the portal to process the recertification of officers with last names Q-Z. The Division
provided a recertification packet and supporting documentation to law enforcement agencies on April 1, 2024.
In July 2024, the Division processed recertification applications and notified law enforcement agencies of its decision via email. The
Division processed 5,951 certification and recertification applications in 2024, bringing the total number of certified officers to
22,270. After processing these applications, the Division sent a report to each law enforcement agency detailing the results.
Authorized users can access recertification data via the portal at any time.
This year, the Division implemented automated information processing through the LEA portal, creating certification documents,
templates and online forms to streamline the communication of officer status changes to POST. The Division also updated officer
history tracking to ensure compliance with 555 CMR 8.00: Databases and Dissemination of Information.
CONCLUSION OF THE BRIDGE ACADEMY
Police Reform required standardization of police training. Officers that never attended a full-time police academy, but were active,
had policing experience and/or had attended reserve training or were working part time, had the opportunity to attend a Bridge
Academy (approximately 200 hours) to meet the standard set by Police Reform.
The final group of officers who qualified to attend the Bridge Academy were part-time or reserve officers with last names Q-Z. The
deadline for officers to attend the Bridge Academy passed on June 30, 2024. Going forward, officers who missed their opportunity to
attend a Bridge Academy will be required to attend a full police academy to be certified.
COMPLIANCE WITH TRAINING REQUIREMENTS
To confirm officer compliance with training requirements such as In-Service Training, the Division regularly queries MPTC
information. Technology and data sharing with the MPTC has streamlined this process.
In November 2023, the Division debuted the School Resource Officer (SRO) certification application on the Commission’s website for
law enforcement agencies seeking to certify an SRO. SROs must be certified law enforcement officers before they can be issued
the additional SRO certification. As of December 2024, POST has issued 503 SRO certifications.
PAGE 9 | MASSACHUSETTS POST COMMISSION ANNUAL REPORT 2024
CERTIFICATION POLICY SUBCOMMITTEE
An officer’s certification is valid for three years. In 2024, the Commission began considering changes to the 2025 recertification
process, given that many officers previously certified (officers with last names A-H) are due for recertification on July 1, 2025.
The Commission created a Certification Policy Subcommittee to consider and advise on certain certification policy areas, like
whether an officer applying for recertification continues to satisfy the certification requirements set by POST’s statute. The
Subcommittee, comprised of Commissioners Larry Calderone, Hanya Bluestone and Marsha Kazarosian, held its first meeting in
February 2024. The Subcommittee considered the certification processes implemented thus far; the timing for the next round of
certification; statutory certification standards; and recertification policy questions. The Subcommittee requested, received and
considered public comments.
The Subcommittee held eight meetings from February 2024 to December 2024, examining ongoing certification requirements,
including physical and psychological fitness evaluations; oral interviews; assessments of good moral character and in-service
training. The Subcommittee examined these requirements while exploring policy questions on the frequency of these verifications.
The Subcommittee largely focused on ongoing certification requirements rather than those that only need to be verified once
during initial certification. Requirements that only need initial verification include being at least 21, possessing a high school
diploma or equivalent and completing a basic training program. The Subcommittee considered research on maintaining physical
and psychological fitness, drawing on other jurisdictions' approaches and recommended strategies. The Subcommittee also
discussed proposed changes to the 555 CMR 7.00: Recertification regulations to improve the process for officers seeking recertifi-
cation, starting with the July 1, 2025 group.
The Subcommittee adopted a policy that the full Commission approved, aligning officers' certification expiration with their birth
month by extending subsequent certification periods to three years plus their birth date. The Subcommittee also recommended
evaluating annual in-service training requirements separately from the three-year certification cycle.
FUTURE GOALS
In 2025, the Commission will begin the law enforcement agency certification process. In addition to policies and standards for
officers, the Division is required to establish minimum certification standards for all law enforcement agencies that include use
of force and reporting; officer code of conduct; officer response procedures; criminal investigation procedures; juvenile
operations; internal affairs and officer complaint investigation procedures; detainee transportation and collection and preserva-
tion of evidence.
The Division also plans to establish a reporting system so that the public may access certain information concerning any given
officer, including an officer’s certification status and publicly available disciplinary information. The Division also plans to collect
and add letters of commendation to the Commission’s public database, as outlined in 555 CMR 8.00: Databases and
Dissemination of Information.
The Division plans to hire a deputy director of certification and a data analyst manager in 2025, bringing the Division to 11 staff
members.

DIVISION OF STANDARDS
The Division of Police Standards investigates allegations of police misconduct, makes disciplinary recommendations to the
Commission and conducts adjudicatory hearings on behalf of the Commission.
The Division receives complaints regarding allegations of officer misconduct from law enforcement agencies and the public. In
certain cases, the Division will begin an investigation (preliminary inquiry) into an officer upon the Commission’s receipt of a
sufficient complaint, report or other evidence that an officer is involved in an incident that results in injury or death; an officer
commits a misdemeanor or felony; an officer uses excessive force in violation of M.G.L. c. 6E, § 14; an officer observes another
officer use excessive force in violation of M.G.L. c. 6E, § 14 and does not intervene or report the incident; or the head of the officer’s
appointing agency recommends that the Commission take disciplinary action in the form of retraining, suspending or revoking an
officer’s certification. If an officer engages in other categories of prohibited conduct, the Division may, but is not required to,
conduct a preliminary inquiry.
The Division, in connection with a preliminary inquiry, may compel the attendance of witnesses and the production of materials
pursuant to subpoenas. It may also administer oaths and require testimony under oath. As a result of a preliminary inquiry, the
Commission may determine that public disciplinary proceedings are appropriate. As a result of the proceedings, the Commission
may decertify, suspend or order an officer to undergo retraining.
OPERATIONS
The Division of Standards welcomed four new staff members in 2024, bringing the total staff to 16. The Division’s staff includes a
director; a deputy director; four enforcement counsel; five compliance agents; a senior intake coordinator; three intake coordina-
tors and a paralegal. In 2024, the Division established the Intake Coordinator Team, which successfully oversaw the rollout of the
standards area of the LEA portal and completed several complex projects to enhance the data in the Commission's public officer
disciplinary records database.
In addition to investigating police misconduct, the Division may also audit all law enforcement agency records related to
complaints, investigations and reports alleging officer misconduct or unprofessionalism. Under POST’s statute, the Division
maintains a database that documents an officer’s complaint history, allegations of untruthfulness, failure to complete training
requirements and discipline records, including records concerning officer decertification, suspension and termination. If the
Division detects a pattern of misconduct in an officer’s behavior based on information contained in its database, the Division may
initiate a preliminary inquiry into that officer, which could result in disciplinary action by the Commission.
In 2024, the Division presented 152 disciplinary cases to the Commission, up from 109 in 2023. It concluded disciplinary proceed-
ings for 35 individuals, conducted numerous hearings and pre-hearing conferences and managed hundreds of new complaints.
DATABASE/REPORTING REQUIREMENTS
The Division also supports the Division of Certification in creating and maintaining a separate database containing various
information concerning law enforcement officers, including officers’ dates of certification and recertification; training records;
arrest, conviction and disciplinary records; and any other information relevant to POST’s mission.
The Commission’s statute requires that the Commission maintain a separate publicly accessible database of officers who are
subject to retraining, suspension or decertification as a result of Commission action.
PAGE 12 | MASSACHUSETTS POST COMMISSION ANNUAL REPORT 2024
CURRENT CASELOAD FOR CALENDAR YEAR 2024:
The addition of new staff allowed the Division to substantially increase its caseload. In 2024, the Division brought 80 cases for a
potential preliminary inquiry for consideration to the Commission. This is a significant increase from the 2023 caseload (61) and
2022 caseload (12).
Under the Commission’s regulations, 555 CMR 1.03, proceedings and records related to preliminary inquiries by the Division,
including any internal review to determine whether there is sufficient credible evidence to initiate a preliminary inquiry, are kept
strictly confidential pursuant to M.G.L. c. 6E, § 8(c)(2) and M.G.L. c. 4, § 7 (26).
The Division submitted 34 preliminary inquiry reports to the Commission in 2024. It concluded disciplinary proceedings for 35
individuals, issuing 30 final decertification orders (up from eight in 2023), four disciplinary suspensions (up from two in 2023), and
closed one case without discipline after a public hearing. The Division also conducted four hearings and 22 pre-hearings, a
threefold increase over 2023. In 2024, the Division handled 80 preliminary inquiries.
Complaint Data Received by POST
During 2024, the Division received approximately 12 reports from law enforcement agencies and approximately 30 complaints from
the public each week.

PAGE 19 | MASSACHUSETTS POST COMMISSION ANNUAL REPORT 2024
FUTURE GOALS
In addition to continuing to fulfill its statutory mandate, the Division intends to focus in 2025 on several important goals. The
Division will continue to investigate officer misconduct by conducting preliminary inquiries. When those preliminary inquiries
produce sufficient evidence to justify discipline against an officer, the Division’s attorneys (supported by the Division’s investigative
and other non-legal colleagues) will advocate for police accountability through public disciplinary proceedings before the
Commission.
The Division also intends to take several steps to increase the transparency of officer disciplinary records. The Division will
continue to review all newly filed complaints for potential follow-up and/or further investigation. The Division will also ensure that
law enforcement agencies are consistently reporting complaints received by the agency, as well as the results of internal affairs
investigations, as required by the Commission’s statute and regulations. A key step in this effort will involve developing a nascent
auditing function. Once developed, the Division will be able to exercise its power to audit agency records and thereby validate the
extent to which agencies are properly submitting required information to the Commission. The Division anticipates developing and
publishing new guidance, policies and protocols to assist agencies in fulfilling these obligations.
In addition to conducting preliminary inquiry hearings, Division personnel will assist the executive director and the Commission in
addressing officers whose provisional certifications require further attention under 555 CMR 7.10, which outlines possible actions
following decisions declining to grant full recertification.
PAGE 20 | MASSACHUSETTS POST COMMISSION ANNUAL REPORT 2024
LEGAL DIVISION
The Legal Division supports the Commission by developing regulations, policies and procedural protocols on certification,
disciplinary matters, use of force and law enforcement transparency. The Division manages the Commission’s adjudicatory process
while also handling public records requests. The Division’s work includes litigation, contracting, human resources and efforts to
ensure compliance with laws on public meetings, ethics and data privacy. Additionally, it provides legal training and presentations.
In 2024, the Division expanded by hiring three attorneys; a senior legal advisor; two legal fellows; a paralegal; and four interns to
manage increasing workloads. It collaborates with other divisions, the MPTC and other stakeholders in its various endeavors.
EXTERNAL POLICY DEVELOPMENT
In 2024, the Commission, with the assistance of the Legal Division, promulgated 555 CMR 12.00, governing the maintenance,
reporting and audits of law enforcement records. Additionally, the Division drafted revised recertification regulations addressing
matters such as examinations, interviews, character and fitness and in-service training and secured initial Commissioner approval
of certain parts, with due regard for public comment. The Division further drafted law enforcement agency certification standards
concerning uses of force, reporting of uses of force and an officer code of conduct, and secured initial Commissioner approval of
certain parts, after reaching out to at least 90 agencies, and organizational and individual stakeholders.
The Division also continued to analyze ways to ensure that officers are physically and psychologically fit for duty, giving due
attention to the issue of officer wellness. To obtain more information and input on these subjects, the Division organized an expert
panel and conducted surveys on officer health and wellness.
DISCIPLINARY AND ADJUDICATORY PROCESSES
The Legal Division has enhanced the Commission’s effectiveness by designing and developing its adjudicatory system. The system
now includes implementing motion practice procedures; issuing interlocutory orders; conducting pre-hearing conferences; holding
live and virtual hearings; using advanced technologies in proceedings; rendering substantive determinations; and giving public notice
of events and decisions in proceedings. Hearing officers, who are retired Massachusetts judges, hold proceedings consistent with
prior policy that the Legal Division helped the Commission develop. The Division also facilitated the inclusion of Commission decisions
in the Social Law Library’s searchable database.
In 2024, the Legal Division assisted the Division of Police Certification, the executive director, the hearing officers and the
commissioners in developing numerous decisions in officers’ cases, well over double what was produced the prior year. In total, the
Division handled 26 proceedings, a nearly threefold increase over 2023.
INFORMATION-SHARING AND PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT
The Division significantly enhanced the Commission’s public engagement in 2024. It managed a 56% increase in public records
requests. The Division also delivered dozens of presentations, including approximately 30 to the Commission and its Certification
Policy Subcommittee alone.

REGULATIONS
555 CMR 12.00: Maintenance, Reporting and Audits of Law Enforcement Records and Information as of December 6, 2024
FUTURE GOALS
In 2025, the Legal Division will continue to collaborate with other divisions and stakeholders on initiatives to develop outward-facing
regulations, standards and plans related to the following key areas: agency certification in at least eight prescribed areas; auditing
agencies; officer recertification; evaluations of officer physical fitness, behavioral health and wellness; officer sexual misconduct;
racial profiling; enforcement of anti-retaliation provisions; and gender equity in law enforcement. The Division is also exploring ways to
provide more information and direction to crime victims and trauma sufferers.
PAGE 22 | MASSACHUSETTS POST COMMISSION ANNUAL REPORT 2024
FINANCE AND ADMINISTRATION
The Finance and Administration (F&A) Division, consisting of four team members, manages all aspects of accounting, budgeting,
financial reporting, payroll and human resources administration. In addition, the Division is responsible for maintaining the
Commission’s Internal Control Plan, administrative policies and procedures and overseeing contracting and procurement.
In addition to the $8.5 million appropriated to the Commission for FY24 (per Chapter 28 of the Acts of 2023), the Commission
carried forward $1.3 million in unspent funds from FY23. As a result, the total amount available to the Commission in FY24 was $9.8
million. The intended purpose of the $1.3 million was to provide the Commission with some flexibility as it continued to mature to
full operation. However, the Commission did not need this additional funding and subsequently reverted it to the General Fund.
FY24 ACTUAL EXPENDITURES AND FY25 ESTIMATED COSTS:
FY24 ACTIVITY FY25 ACTIVITY
Beginning Balance $9,778,534 $8,747,477
Expenditures ($7,658,771) ($8,181,289)*
Ending Balance $2,119,762 $566,188
*Represents projected expenditures for FY25, including expenses incurred as of December 31, 2024. Actual expenditures for the first half of FY25 were $3,392,706.

2024, the Commission employed 49 staff members, including 12 new 2024 hires, along with nine statutorily appointed commis-
sioners and three hearing officers.
The second largest expense was in Information Technology (IT), with $1.9 million spent. Of that amount, 67% ($1.3 million) went
to the Salesforce IT solution. This spending focused on one-time applications, enhancements and recurring maintenance costs
as part of a two-phase development plan. Phase I established the core infrastructure, while Phase II implemented applications
and enhancements.

OPERATIONS
In partnership with the Legal Division, the F&A Division successfully completed the Commission’s first Internal Control Certification
in 2024. The Comptroller introduced a new process requiring state agencies to attest to having written internal controls, training
and monitoring integrated into daily operations. The Legal and F&A Divisions successfully participated in interviews with the
Comptroller's Statewide Risk Management team as part of this process. As part of its commitment to maintaining a proper system
of internal controls, the F&A Division developed 40 official policies and procedures on topics ranging from invoice management to
employee hiring. In collaboration with the Legal Division, the F&A Division formalized the Commission’s employee training program
and published guidelines for office personnel, including general office protocols and emergency procedures.
In 2024, the F&A Division also partnered with the Information Technology Division to procure additional audio-visual equipment for
the Ellison Conference Room, as well as a technology integration system with the Department of Criminal Justice Information
Services (CJIS). Moreover, the F&A Division collaborated with the Communications Division to procure website design services for a
major relaunch of the Commission’s website.
FUTURE GOALS
The Division will continue to work with the Information Technology Division in building its recent catalog of over 450 state-owned
assets. The next phase of this inventory project will be to assign valuations and develop a comprehensive inventory process.
The Division also will continue work on the development of the FY26 budget, which will include provisioning for the Commission’s
eventual auditing of law enforcement agencies.
PAGE 26 | MASSACHUSETTS POST COMMISSION ANNUAL REPORT 2024
INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY
The Information Technology (IT) Division supports both internal and external business processes of the Commission and provides
infrastructure, connectivity, hardware and software to the Commission and its staff. The IT Division also provides data manage-
ment and security to support the integrity and efficiency of the Commission’s operations and its oversight of officer certifications.
OPERATIONS
The IT Division added several new staff members in 2024, including a programmer analyst and a data analyst. The additional staff
helped the Division efficiently perform critical tasks throughout the year, ranging from IT support requests to officer disciplinary
records releases.
The IT Division worked closely with the F&A Division to outfit the office with useful technology. The Divisions worked together to
add enhanced audio and visual capabilities to the Ellison Conference Room to allow for better in-person and virtual meetings. The
Divisions collaborated on additional enhancements, including double monitors at workstations, video doorbells to improve office
security and an upgraded phone system.
In 2024, the IT Division helped expand the functionality of the permanent database solution, Salesforce. Thanks to the hard work
of the IT and other divisions, the Commission launched the standards area of the LEA portal in March 2024 to allow law
enforcement agencies to report complaints and incidents directly through the portal. Various law enforcement agencies assisted
the Divisions in the design and testing phase to ensure the portal was functional and user friendly. Since the March 2024 launch,
agencies have submitted almost 1,400 complaints through the portal. The IT Division has also increased portal functionality to
allow staff to better track public complaints. During 2024, the IT Division began building a tool in Salesforce to help process
investigations and track all pertinent dates and data for adjudicatory matters brought before the Commission.
A crucial part of the IT Division’s operation is coordinating updated releases of the Officer Disciplinary Records Database with help
from the Standards Division. Together, the Divisions created an enhanced process and workflow to ensure correct and up-to-date
data. The Divisions issued nine releases in 2024, which the Communications Division posted to the Commission’s website. By the
end of 2024, the Commission published a total of 8,200 allegations, a nearly twofold increase from the 4,641 allegations published
in 2023. Additionally, the IT Division migrated, updated and published most records submitted after the historical disciplinary
records were submitted (January 31, 2023) and before the LEA portal opened (March 2024) (known as “the 2023 Catch-Up
Project”). The initial releases of disciplinary records in 2023 contained sustained records that were closed as of January 31, 2023.
As part of the 2023 Catch-Up Project, the IT Division worked with law enforcement agencies to publish complaints submitted and
closed after January 31, 2023 to the database.
The IT Division also worked with the Communications Division and a state vendor to develop and launch the Commission’s new
website. Additionally, the IT Division updated the online public complaint form to enable user feedback and allow for larger image
and video uploads.
In an effort to further transparency, the IT Division also started to review the internal process for generating data needed to fulfill
public records requests.
PAGE 27 | MASSACHUSETTS POST COMMISSION ANNUAL REPORT 2024
FUTURE GOALS
The IT Division continues to update and reconcile officer disciplinary records. Looking toward 2025, the Division will work to
enhance officer disciplinary records reporting by launching a business intelligence tool that will allow the public to better search
records and perform analytics. This tool is expected to provide useful insight on complaint data, including the most common type
of complaint, complaint outcomes, the number of complaints by agency and county, details on officer employment history and
other similar analytics.
The IT Division has planned technology integration for officer court appearances through the CJIS database. Other goals of the IT
Division are enhanced data sharing with the MPTC and the National Decertification Index, and better document management and
workflow systems in 2025.
The Division will continue work in 2025 to streamline the process for gathering data for public records requests. Additional plans
include adding third-party tools to help process data as well as research into how AI tools might allow the public to search data on
the website and upcoming business intelligence portals more efficiently.
The Division will welcome an IT specialist in February 2025 and a data manager later in 2025. This staff will help grow the
Salesforce system, handle internal and external IT support, and assist with projects and manage new technology to allow the
Commission to streamline its internal operations and meet reporting requirements.
PAGE 28 | MASSACHUSETTS POST COMMISSION ANNUAL REPORT 2024
COMMUNICATIONS AND COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT
The Communications Division, led by a director of communications and a communications and media relations manager, handles
media relations, community outreach and information dissemination to law enforcement, the public and the media. The Division
utilizes various channels, including the Commission's newly redesigned website, which acts as the Commission's primary digital
presence. The Commission’s website features an archive of Commission meetings, regulations, advisories, officer disciplinary
records, certification status updates and other relevant information for the public and law enforcement community.
The Communications team helps support one of the most important goals of police reform: enhancing public confidence in policing.
The Division is committed to engaging with the public, advocacy groups, the media and the law enforcement community to
understand and address stakeholders’ concerns and to help such stakeholders better understand the Commission’s mission,
regulations, advisories, accomplishments and activities.
OPERATIONS
In 2024, the Division promoted its digital communications coordinator to communications and media relations manager. Together,
the director and the communications and media relations manager worked on numerous initiatives to increase awareness and
education of the Commission’s work.
An integral part of the Division’s day-to-day operations is responding to the media and building trusted relationships with state and
national reporters. In 2024, the Division responded to nearly 200 media inquiries. The Commission received more than 6,500
mentions across print, digital, broadcast and social media, reaching approximately 2.23 billion users. The media’s focus was largely
on the Commission’s operations, regulations and policies governing the certification of officers and officer disciplinary records and
certification statuses. Publications that featured the most stories about the Commission included WBZ News Radio, NECN, NBC 10
and MassLive.
In August 2024, the Commission launched a new and improved website, www.mapostcommission.gov, thanks to the efforts of the
Communications Division and input from other divisions. The new website offers a modern design, user-friendly features and
increased functionality. It allows visitors to easily access information about the officer certification process, historical disciplinary
records, officer status lists and more. The Division prioritized building an optimized search function on the website, which allows
users to easily find desired information and resources. The website’s new functionality also allows for real-time updates, supports
the use of high-resolution graphics and photos and more. The Division filled the site with important information, including public
meetings and hearing notices, Commission decisions and orders and officer status lists.
Since its launch, the new website has experienced a substantial increase in usage compared to the Commission’s previous website.
Over a five-month period, the new website recorded 217,000 page views and over 35,000 active users per month, a significant
improvement from the prior year's metrics of 100,000 page views annually and an average of 8,000 monthly active users.
The Division maintains content on POST’s YouTube channel as a way for the public to view recordings of the Commission’s public
meetings, hearings and trainings. The channel has seen a significant uptick in engagement since its launch in 2023. The Division
added nearly 40 videos to the channel in 2024, which the public watched 18,288 times, a 192% increase from 2023, for a total of
2,600 hours of viewing, a 274% increase. The channel saw an increase of 124 subscribers in 2024, a 121% increase from 2023. The
channel currently has approximately 200 subscribers. The Division plans to continue to add pertinent and engaging video content in
2025 to further grow this base.

FUTURE GOALS
In 2025, the Division will focus on furthering education and awareness of the Commission’s ongoing work, publicizing new
regulations and guidance, creating updated training materials and communicating upcoming changes to the certification process.
The Division will make new resource materials available in early spring 2025 so that law enforcement agencies better understand
the new certification process well in advance of the July 1, 2025 deadline.
The Division will also continue to update law enforcement agencies on new processes and regulations, such as the auditing of law
enforcement agencies. Agencies’ knowledge and awareness of POST’s activities is key to POST’s mission. The Division will therefore
work to ensure that both law enforcement communities and the public are informed about the Commission’s work and ongoing
initiatives and resources.
The Division will continue to educate the public by conducting outreaching and presenting to stakeholder groups. The Division will
also continue to ensure that the law enforcement communities and the public can easily access POST’s resources. The Division will
continue to engage with local and statewide groups to make sure such groups are able to express their views regarding various
aspects of policing and understand the tools available to them via POST’s website.
In 2025, the Division intends to focus on continuing to enhance the content on the Commission’s website, including by adding a
new section to the website concerning victim resources, and further utilizing informational video content.

MESSAGE FROM COMMISSION CHAIR
2024: A Year of Milestones
My fellow commissioners join me in commending POST Staff for their accomplishments this year. Our report describes POST’s
accomplishments in Calendar Year 2024 and summarizes activities anticipated in Calendar Year 2025. Our report also provides
statutory reporting data for Fiscal Year 2024 (July 1, 2023 – June 30, 2024).
POST’s mission is to improve policing and enhance public confidence in law enforcement. In 2024, we continued making significant
progress in fulfilling our mission while also meeting key obligations and deadlines set forth in the statute. We certified and
recertified thousands of officers, initiated or resolved dozens of disciplinary cases, promulgated auditing regulations, expanded
staff capacity, and we made significant technological enhancements, which included launching a new website.
POST receives complaints from the public and incident reports from law enforcement agencies on a regular basis. Our staff
reviews each of those reports as part of our commitment to answering every member of the public who submits a complaint. We
rely on law enforcement agencies to investigate many of those complaints, and we collaborate with those agencies to bring cases
to the Commission and/or publish the relevant disciplinary information.
In 2024, we recertified 5,951 officers with last names Q–Z and certified 2,193 police academy graduates. To prepare for the second
round of recertification (officers with last names A–H in July 2025, previously recertified in 2022), the Commission formed a
Certification Policy Subcommittee. Between February and December 2024, the Subcommittee met eight times to review public
comments, consider recertification modifications, and explore approaches to assess officers’ character, physical fitness and
behavioral health.
Looking ahead to 2025, we anticipate that the number of cases brought before the Commission will increase. We will continue to
advance policies and standards related to law enforcement agency certification, standardized use of force reporting and more. To
support our increasing workload, we anticipate that POST will continue to grow, much as it did in 2024 when it increased from 37 to
49 staff members. To that end, the budget request for Fiscal Year 2026 includes funding for an additional seven employees.
We remain committed to fulfilling the mission of police reform, strengthening policing in Massachusetts and fostering public trust
in law enforcement.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
During its third full year of operations, the Commission achieved important milestones required by POST’s statute (Chapter 253 of
the Acts of 2020, also referred to as Police Reform). Major accomplishments in 2024 include:
LEA Portal Expands to Include Complaint and Incident Reporting
• POST soft-launched the Law Enforcement Agency (LEA) Portal for complaint and incident reporting in January 2024 to select
law enforcement agencies. The Information and Technology Division conducted five virtual training sessions in February 2024
for 250 users and issued training materials via web and social media before launching the portal to all agencies in March
2024. POST continues to develop portal functionality to make the interactions via the portal more efficient and to capture
additional information, including officer commendation letters.
Certification Developments
• POST convened a new Certification Policy Subcommittee in February 2024 to address certification policy for 2025 and beyond.
The Subcommittee focused on officer health and wellness and held a physical fitness panel event in October 2024. The
Subcommittee ultimately adopted a policy aligning officer certification expiration dates with officer birth dates and proposed
reviewing in-service training requirements annually, rather than triennially.
• Additionally, the Certification Division opened the LEA portal in May 2024 to aid in the processing of 5,951 officers with last
names Q-Z for recertification. The MPTC completed the third and final Bridge Academy, which enabled the Commission to
certify an additional 1,400 officers.
Development of Key Regulations
• The Commission held public hearings and reviewed public comments on draft regulations and policies. The Commission
promulgated 555 CMR 12.00: Maintenance, Reporting, and Auditing of Law Enforcement Records and discussed drafts of 555
CMR 13.00: Law Enforcement Agency Certification Standards.
New Website
• In August 2024, POST launched its new website, www.mapostcommission.gov, which resulted in a substantial increase in
public engagement. In 2025, POST plans to deploy a business intelligence tool to enhance the Commission’s public data
reporting and analytics, as contemplated by POST’s statute.

PROVISIONS OF THE POLICE REFORM ACT OF 2020
Chapter 253 of the Acts of 2020 (also referred to as Police Reform) established the POST Commission. Police Reform charged the
Commission with creating a mandatory certification process for police officers and law enforcement agencies, along with the
following goals:
1. CERTIFY NEW AND EXISTING Police Reform outlines certain requirements for certifying new officers and
OFFICERS EVERY THREE YEARS. recertifying existing officers. Police Reform initially certified all active officers and
required new officers to be certified according to certain criteria. Police Reform also
required that all officers be recertified every three years. To distribute the certifica-
tion workload, Police Reform set expiration dates for certification based on officers'
last names. The Commission recertified officers with last names A-H on July 1, 2022;
officers with last names I-P on July 1, 2023; and officers with last names Q-Z on July 1,
2024. The coming year will bring changes to the recertification process, as POST will
recertify officers with last names A-H for the second time on July 1, 2025.
2. I N VESTIGATE ALLEGATIONS POST’s mission includes establishing and conducting an adjudicatory process for

within two business days and provide POST final reports and disciplinary
dispositions once the agency has completed its investigation. When investigating
misconduct, POST staff analyze the information provided by agencies to identify
patterns and situations that may warrant referral to prosecuting agencies.

to follow best practices and dictate minimum standards for agencies with the
overall goal of improving policing in the Commonwealth. In 2025, the Commission
will establish certification standards for all law enforcement agencies.

DIVISION REPORTS

DIVISION OF CERTIFICATION
The Division of Certification establishes uniform policies Officers with last names A through H June 30, 2022
and standards for law enforcement officer certification.
Officers with last names I through P June 30, 2023
Division staff also collaborate with the MPTC to ensure
Officers with last names Q through Z June 30, 2024
officers comply with training requirements.
As noted, officers covered by POST’s statute must renew The Commission requires officers’ agencies to assist the
their certification every three years. Officers who were Commission in verifying certain requirements set by POST’s
active on July 1, 2021 were automatically certified under statute and to submit certain information necessary for
POST’s statute. POST’s statute also provided that those recertifying officers. POST’s statute also required that the
initial certifications would expire as follows: Commission certify all new officers who attended and
graduated from a police academy before December 1, 2021.
THE CERTIFICATION STANDARDS FOR ALL OFFICERS INCLUDE:
(i) Attained the age of 21;
(ii) Successful completion of a high school education or equivalent, as determined by the Commission;
(iii) Successful completion of the basic training program approved by the MPTC;
(iv) Successful completion of a physical and psychological fitness evaluation approved by the Commission;
(v) Successful completion of a state and national background check, including but not limited to fingerprinting and a full
employment history. If the applicant was previously employed in law enforcement in any state or United
States territory or by the federal government, the applicant’s full employment record, including complaints and discipline,
will be evaluated in the background check;
(vi) Passage of an examination approved by the Commission;
(vii) Possession of current first aid and cardiopulmonary resuscitation certificates or the equivalent, as determined by
the Commission;
(viii) Successful completion of an oral interview administered by the Commission; and
(ix) Being of good moral character and fit for employment in law enforcement, as determined by the Commission.
The Division of Certification, in consultation with the Division of Standards, also creates and maintains a database of records
for each certified officer. The Division regularly publishes a monthly searchable officer status database on the Commission’s
website with the help of the Communications Division.
PAGE 8 | MASSACHUSETTS POST COMMISSION ANNUAL REPORT 2024

OPERATIONS
The Division of Certification currently has nine employees: a director; senior certification advisor; certification manager; four senior
certification specialists; and two data analysts.
The Division processes officer information utilizing the LEA portal, a web-based platform that debuted in 2023. During the 2024
recertification cycle, the Division used the portal to process the recertification of officers with last names Q-Z. The Division
provided a recertification packet and supporting documentation to law enforcement agencies on April 1, 2024.
In July 2024, the Division processed recertification applications and notified law enforcement agencies of its decision via email. The
Division processed 5,951 certification and recertification applications in 2024, bringing the total number of certified officers to
22,270. After processing these applications, the Division sent a report to each law enforcement agency detailing the results.
Authorized users can access recertification data via the portal at any time.
This year, the Division implemented automated information processing through the LEA portal, creating certification documents,
templates and online forms to streamline the communication of officer status changes to POST. The Division also updated officer
history tracking to ensure compliance with 555 CMR 8.00: Databases and Dissemination of Information.
CONCLUSION OF THE BRIDGE ACADEMY
Police Reform required standardization of police training. Officers that never attended a full-time police academy, but were active,
had policing experience and/or had attended reserve training or were working part time, had the opportunity to attend a Bridge
Academy (approximately 200 hours) to meet the standard set by Police Reform.
The final group of officers who qualified to attend the Bridge Academy were part-time or reserve officers with last names Q-Z. The
deadline for officers to attend the Bridge Academy passed on June 30, 2024. Going forward, officers who missed their opportunity to
attend a Bridge Academy will be required to attend a full police academy to be certified.
COMPLIANCE WITH TRAINING REQUIREMENTS
To confirm officer compliance with training requirements such as In-Service Training, the Division regularly queries MPTC
information. Technology and data sharing with the MPTC has streamlined this process.
In November 2023, the Division debuted the School Resource Officer (SRO) certification application on the Commission’s website for
law enforcement agencies seeking to certify an SRO. SROs must be certified law enforcement officers before they can be issued
the additional SRO certification. As of December 2024, POST has issued 503 SRO certifications.
PAGE 9 | MASSACHUSETTS POST COMMISSION ANNUAL REPORT 2024

CERTIFICATION POLICY SUBCOMMITTEE
An officer’s certification is valid for three years. In 2024, the Commission began considering changes to the 2025 recertification
process, given that many officers previously certified (officers with last names A-H) are due for recertification on July 1, 2025.
The Commission created a Certification Policy Subcommittee to consider and advise on certain certification policy areas, like
whether an officer applying for recertification continues to satisfy the certification requirements set by POST’s statute. The
Subcommittee, comprised of Commissioners Larry Calderone, Hanya Bluestone and Marsha Kazarosian, held its first meeting in
February 2024. The Subcommittee considered the certification processes implemented thus far; the timing for the next round of
certification; statutory certification standards; and recertification policy questions. The Subcommittee requested, received and
considered public comments.
The Subcommittee held eight meetings from February 2024 to December 2024, examining ongoing certification requirements,
including physical and psychological fitness evaluations; oral interviews; assessments of good moral character and in-service
training. The Subcommittee examined these requirements while exploring policy questions on the frequency of these verifications.
The Subcommittee largely focused on ongoing certification requirements rather than those that only need to be verified once
during initial certification. Requirements that only need initial verification include being at least 21, possessing a high school
diploma or equivalent and completing a basic training program. The Subcommittee considered research on maintaining physical
and psychological fitness, drawing on other jurisdictions' approaches and recommended strategies. The Subcommittee also
discussed proposed changes to the 555 CMR 7.00: Recertification regulations to improve the process for officers seeking recertifi-
cation, starting with the July 1, 2025 group.
The Subcommittee adopted a policy that the full Commission approved, aligning officers' certification expiration with their birth
month by extending subsequent certification periods to three years plus their birth date. The Subcommittee also recommended
evaluating annual in-service training requirements separately from the three-year certification cycle.
FUTURE GOALS
In 2025, the Commission will begin the law enforcement agency certification process. In addition to policies and standards for
officers, the Division is required to establish minimum certification standards for all law enforcement agencies that include use
of force and reporting; officer code of conduct; officer response procedures; criminal investigation procedures; juvenile
operations; internal affairs and officer complaint investigation procedures; detainee transportation and collection and preserva-
tion of evidence.
The Division also plans to establish a reporting system so that the public may access certain information concerning any given
officer, including an officer’s certification status and publicly available disciplinary information. The Division also plans to collect
and add letters of commendation to the Commission’s public database, as outlined in 555 CMR 8.00: Databases and
Dissemination of Information.
The Division plans to hire a deputy director of certification and a data analyst manager in 2025, bringing the Division to 11 staff
members.

DIVISION OF STANDARDS
The Division of Police Standards investigates allegations of police misconduct, makes disciplinary recommendations to the
Commission and conducts adjudicatory hearings on behalf of the Commission.
The Division receives complaints regarding allegations of officer misconduct from law enforcement agencies and the public. In
certain cases, the Division will begin an investigation (preliminary inquiry) into an officer upon the Commission’s receipt of a
sufficient complaint, report or other evidence that an officer is involved in an incident that results in injury or death; an officer
commits a misdemeanor or felony; an officer uses excessive force in violation of M.G.L. c. 6E, § 14; an officer observes another
officer use excessive force in violation of M.G.L. c. 6E, § 14 and does not intervene or report the incident; or the head of the officer’s
appointing agency recommends that the Commission take disciplinary action in the form of retraining, suspending or revoking an
officer’s certification. If an officer engages in other categories of prohibited conduct, the Division may, but is not required to,
conduct a preliminary inquiry.
The Division, in connection with a preliminary inquiry, may compel the attendance of witnesses and the production of materials
pursuant to subpoenas. It may also administer oaths and require testimony under oath. As a result of a preliminary inquiry, the
Commission may determine that public disciplinary proceedings are appropriate. As a result of the proceedings, the Commission
may decertify, suspend or order an officer to undergo retraining.
OPERATIONS
The Division of Standards welcomed four new staff members in 2024, bringing the total staff to 16. The Division’s staff includes a
director; a deputy director; four enforcement counsel; five compliance agents; a senior intake coordinator; three intake coordina-
tors and a paralegal. In 2024, the Division established the Intake Coordinator Team, which successfully oversaw the rollout of the
standards area of the LEA portal and completed several complex projects to enhance the data in the Commission's public officer
disciplinary records database.
In addition to investigating police misconduct, the Division may also audit all law enforcement agency records related to
complaints, investigations and reports alleging officer misconduct or unprofessionalism. Under POST’s statute, the Division
maintains a database that documents an officer’s complaint history, allegations of untruthfulness, failure to complete training
requirements and discipline records, including records concerning officer decertification, suspension and termination. If the
Division detects a pattern of misconduct in an officer’s behavior based on information contained in its database, the Division may
initiate a preliminary inquiry into that officer, which could result in disciplinary action by the Commission.
In 2024, the Division presented 152 disciplinary cases to the Commission, up from 109 in 2023. It concluded disciplinary proceed-
ings for 35 individuals, conducted numerous hearings and pre-hearing conferences and managed hundreds of new complaints.
DATABASE/REPORTING REQUIREMENTS
The Division also supports the Division of Certification in creating and maintaining a separate database containing various
information concerning law enforcement officers, including officers’ dates of certification and recertification; training records;
arrest, conviction and disciplinary records; and any other information relevant to POST’s mission.
The Commission’s statute requires that the Commission maintain a separate publicly accessible database of officers who are
subject to retraining, suspension or decertification as a result of Commission action.
PAGE 12 | MASSACHUSETTS POST COMMISSION ANNUAL REPORT 2024

CURRENT CASELOAD FOR CALENDAR YEAR 2024:
The addition of new staff allowed the Division to substantially increase its caseload. In 2024, the Division brought 80 cases for a
potential preliminary inquiry for consideration to the Commission. This is a significant increase from the 2023 caseload (61) and
2022 caseload (12).
Under the Commission’s regulations, 555 CMR 1.03, proceedings and records related to preliminary inquiries by the Division,
including any internal review to determine whether there is sufficient credible evidence to initiate a preliminary inquiry, are kept
strictly confidential pursuant to M.G.L. c. 6E, § 8(c)(2) and M.G.L. c. 4, § 7 (26).
The Division submitted 34 preliminary inquiry reports to the Commission in 2024. It concluded disciplinary proceedings for 35
individuals, issuing 30 final decertification orders (up from eight in 2023), four disciplinary suspensions (up from two in 2023), and
closed one case without discipline after a public hearing. The Division also conducted four hearings and 22 pre-hearings, a
threefold increase over 2023. In 2024, the Division handled 80 preliminary inquiries.
Complaint Data Received by POST
During 2024, the Division received approximately 12 reports from law enforcement agencies and approximately 30 complaints from
the public each week.

PAGE 19 | MASSACHUSETTS POST COMMISSION ANNUAL REPORT 2024

FUTURE GOALS
In addition to continuing to fulfill its statutory mandate, the Division intends to focus in 2025 on several important goals. The
Division will continue to investigate officer misconduct by conducting preliminary inquiries. When those preliminary inquiries
produce sufficient evidence to justify discipline against an officer, the Division’s attorneys (supported by the Division’s investigative
and other non-legal colleagues) will advocate for police accountability through public disciplinary proceedings before the
Commission.
The Division also intends to take several steps to increase the transparency of officer disciplinary records. The Division will
continue to review all newly filed complaints for potential follow-up and/or further investigation. The Division will also ensure that
law enforcement agencies are consistently reporting complaints received by the agency, as well as the results of internal affairs
investigations, as required by the Commission’s statute and regulations. A key step in this effort will involve developing a nascent
auditing function. Once developed, the Division will be able to exercise its power to audit agency records and thereby validate the
extent to which agencies are properly submitting required information to the Commission. The Division anticipates developing and
publishing new guidance, policies and protocols to assist agencies in fulfilling these obligations.
In addition to conducting preliminary inquiry hearings, Division personnel will assist the executive director and the Commission in
addressing officers whose provisional certifications require further attention under 555 CMR 7.10, which outlines possible actions
following decisions declining to grant full recertification.
PAGE 20 | MASSACHUSETTS POST COMMISSION ANNUAL REPORT 2024

LEGAL DIVISION
The Legal Division supports the Commission by developing regulations, policies and procedural protocols on certification,
disciplinary matters, use of force and law enforcement transparency. The Division manages the Commission’s adjudicatory process
while also handling public records requests. The Division’s work includes litigation, contracting, human resources and efforts to
ensure compliance with laws on public meetings, ethics and data privacy. Additionally, it provides legal training and presentations.
In 2024, the Division expanded by hiring three attorneys; a senior legal advisor; two legal fellows; a paralegal; and four interns to
manage increasing workloads. It collaborates with other divisions, the MPTC and other stakeholders in its various endeavors.
EXTERNAL POLICY DEVELOPMENT
In 2024, the Commission, with the assistance of the Legal Division, promulgated 555 CMR 12.00, governing the maintenance,
reporting and audits of law enforcement records. Additionally, the Division drafted revised recertification regulations addressing
matters such as examinations, interviews, character and fitness and in-service training and secured initial Commissioner approval
of certain parts, with due regard for public comment. The Division further drafted law enforcement agency certification standards
concerning uses of force, reporting of uses of force and an officer code of conduct, and secured initial Commissioner approval of
certain parts, after reaching out to at least 90 agencies, and organizational and individual stakeholders.
The Division also continued to analyze ways to ensure that officers are physically and psychologically fit for duty, giving due
attention to the issue of officer wellness. To obtain more information and input on these subjects, the Division organized an expert
panel and conducted surveys on officer health and wellness.
DISCIPLINARY AND ADJUDICATORY PROCESSES
The Legal Division has enhanced the Commission’s effectiveness by designing and developing its adjudicatory system. The system
now includes implementing motion practice procedures; issuing interlocutory orders; conducting pre-hearing conferences; holding
live and virtual hearings; using advanced technologies in proceedings; rendering substantive determinations; and giving public notice
of events and decisions in proceedings. Hearing officers, who are retired Massachusetts judges, hold proceedings consistent with
prior policy that the Legal Division helped the Commission develop. The Division also facilitated the inclusion of Commission decisions
in the Social Law Library’s searchable database.
In 2024, the Legal Division assisted the Division of Police Certification, the executive director, the hearing officers and the
commissioners in developing numerous decisions in officers’ cases, well over double what was produced the prior year. In total, the
Division handled 26 proceedings, a nearly threefold increase over 2023.
INFORMATION-SHARING AND PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT
The Division significantly enhanced the Commission’s public engagement in 2024. It managed a 56% increase in public records
requests. The Division also delivered dozens of presentations, including approximately 30 to the Commission and its Certification
Policy Subcommittee alone.

FUTURE GOALS
In 2025, the Legal Division will continue to collaborate with other divisions and stakeholders on initiatives to develop outward-facing
regulations, standards and plans related to the following key areas: agency certification in at least eight prescribed areas; auditing
agencies; officer recertification; evaluations of officer physical fitness, behavioral health and wellness; officer sexual misconduct;
racial profiling; enforcement of anti-retaliation provisions; and gender equity in law enforcement. The Division is also exploring ways to
provide more information and direction to crime victims and trauma sufferers.

FINANCE AND ADMINISTRATION
The Finance and Administration (F&A) Division, consisting of four team members, manages all aspects of accounting, budgeting,
financial reporting, payroll and human resources administration. In addition, the Division is responsible for maintaining the
Commission’s Internal Control Plan, administrative policies and procedures and overseeing contracting and procurement.
In addition to the $8.5 million appropriated to the Commission for FY24 (per Chapter 28 of the Acts of 2023), the Commission
carried forward $1.3 million in unspent funds from FY23. As a result, the total amount available to the Commission in FY24 was $9.8
million. The intended purpose of the $1.3 million was to provide the Commission with some flexibility as it continued to mature to
full operation. However, the Commission did not need this additional funding and subsequently reverted it to the General Fund.
FY24 ACTUAL EXPENDITURES AND FY25 ESTIMATED COSTS:
FY24 ACTIVITY FY25 ACTIVITY
Beginning Balance $9,778,534 $8,747,477
Expenditures ($7,658,771) ($8,181,289)*
Ending Balance $2,119,762 $566,188
*Represents projected expenditures for FY25, including expenses incurred as of December 31, 2024. Actual expenditures for the first half of FY25 were $3,392,706.

2024, the Commission employed 49 staff members, including 12 new 2024 hires, along with nine statutorily appointed commis-
sioners and three hearing officers.
The second largest expense was in Information Technology (IT), with $1.9 million spent. Of that amount, 67% ($1.3 million) went
to the Salesforce IT solution. This spending focused on one-time applications, enhancements and recurring maintenance costs
as part of a two-phase development plan. Phase I established the core infrastructure, while Phase II implemented applications
and enhancements.

OPERATIONS
In partnership with the Legal Division, the F&A Division successfully completed the Commission’s first Internal Control Certification
in 2024. The Comptroller introduced a new process requiring state agencies to attest to having written internal controls, training
and monitoring integrated into daily operations. The Legal and F&A Divisions successfully participated in interviews with the
Comptroller's Statewide Risk Management team as part of this process. As part of its commitment to maintaining a proper system
of internal controls, the F&A Division developed 40 official policies and procedures on topics ranging from invoice management to
employee hiring. In collaboration with the Legal Division, the F&A Division formalized the Commission’s employee training program
and published guidelines for office personnel, including general office protocols and emergency procedures.
In 2024, the F&A Division also partnered with the Information Technology Division to procure additional audio-visual equipment for
the Ellison Conference Room, as well as a technology integration system with the Department of Criminal Justice Information
Services (CJIS). Moreover, the F&A Division collaborated with the Communications Division to procure website design services for a
major relaunch of the Commission’s website.
FUTURE GOALS
The Division will continue to work with the Information Technology Division in building its recent catalog of over 450 state-owned
assets. The next phase of this inventory project will be to assign valuations and develop a comprehensive inventory process.
The Division also will continue work on the development of the FY26 budget, which will include provisioning for the Commission’s
eventual auditing of law enforcement agencies.
PAGE 26 | MASSACHUSETTS POST COMMISSION ANNUAL REPORT 2024

INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY
The Information Technology (IT) Division supports both internal and external business processes of the Commission and provides
infrastructure, connectivity, hardware and software to the Commission and its staff. The IT Division also provides data manage-
ment and security to support the integrity and efficiency of the Commission’s operations and its oversight of officer certifications.
OPERATIONS
The IT Division added several new staff members in 2024, including a programmer analyst and a data analyst. The additional staff
helped the Division efficiently perform critical tasks throughout the year, ranging from IT support requests to officer disciplinary
records releases.
The IT Division worked closely with the F&A Division to outfit the office with useful technology. The Divisions worked together to
add enhanced audio and visual capabilities to the Ellison Conference Room to allow for better in-person and virtual meetings. The
Divisions collaborated on additional enhancements, including double monitors at workstations, video doorbells to improve office
security and an upgraded phone system.
In 2024, the IT Division helped expand the functionality of the permanent database solution, Salesforce. Thanks to the hard work
of the IT and other divisions, the Commission launched the standards area of the LEA portal in March 2024 to allow law
enforcement agencies to report complaints and incidents directly through the portal. Various law enforcement agencies assisted
the Divisions in the design and testing phase to ensure the portal was functional and user friendly. Since the March 2024 launch,
agencies have submitted almost 1,400 complaints through the portal. The IT Division has also increased portal functionality to
allow staff to better track public complaints. During 2024, the IT Division began building a tool in Salesforce to help process
investigations and track all pertinent dates and data for adjudicatory matters brought before the Commission.
A crucial part of the IT Division’s operation is coordinating updated releases of the Officer Disciplinary Records Database with help
from the Standards Division. Together, the Divisions created an enhanced process and workflow to ensure correct and up-to-date
data. The Divisions issued nine releases in 2024, which the Communications Division posted to the Commission’s website. By the
end of 2024, the Commission published a total of 8,200 allegations, a nearly twofold increase from the 4,641 allegations published
in 2023. Additionally, the IT Division migrated, updated and published most records submitted after the historical disciplinary
records were submitted (January 31, 2023) and before the LEA portal opened (March 2024) (known as “the 2023 Catch-Up
Project”). The initial releases of disciplinary records in 2023 contained sustained records that were closed as of January 31, 2023.
As part of the 2023 Catch-Up Project, the IT Division worked with law enforcement agencies to publish complaints submitted and
closed after January 31, 2023 to the database.
The IT Division also worked with the Communications Division and a state vendor to develop and launch the Commission’s new
website. Additionally, the IT Division updated the online public complaint form to enable user feedback and allow for larger image
and video uploads.
In an effort to further transparency, the IT Division also started to review the internal process for generating data needed to fulfill
public records requests.
PAGE 27 | MASSACHUSETTS POST COMMISSION ANNUAL REPORT 2024

FUTURE GOALS
The IT Division continues to update and reconcile officer disciplinary records. Looking toward 2025, the Division will work to
enhance officer disciplinary records reporting by launching a business intelligence tool that will allow the public to better search
records and perform analytics. This tool is expected to provide useful insight on complaint data, including the most common type
of complaint, complaint outcomes, the number of complaints by agency and county, details on officer employment history and
other similar analytics.
The IT Division has planned technology integration for officer court appearances through the CJIS database. Other goals of the IT
Division are enhanced data sharing with the MPTC and the National Decertification Index, and better document management and
workflow systems in 2025.
The Division will continue work in 2025 to streamline the process for gathering data for public records requests. Additional plans
include adding third-party tools to help process data as well as research into how AI tools might allow the public to search data on
the website and upcoming business intelligence portals more efficiently.
The Division will welcome an IT specialist in February 2025 and a data manager later in 2025. This staff will help grow the
Salesforce system, handle internal and external IT support, and assist with projects and manage new technology to allow the
Commission to streamline its internal operations and meet reporting requirements.

COMMUNICATIONS AND COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT
The Communications Division, led by a director of communications and a communications and media relations manager, handles
media relations, community outreach and information dissemination to law enforcement, the public and the media. The Division
utilizes various channels, including the Commission's newly redesigned website, which acts as the Commission's primary digital
presence. The Commission’s website features an archive of Commission meetings, regulations, advisories, officer disciplinary
records, certification status updates and other relevant information for the public and law enforcement community.
The Communications team helps support one of the most important goals of police reform: enhancing public confidence in policing.
The Division is committed to engaging with the public, advocacy groups, the media and the law enforcement community to
understand and address stakeholders’ concerns and to help such stakeholders better understand the Commission’s mission,
regulations, advisories, accomplishments and activities.
OPERATIONS
In 2024, the Division promoted its digital communications coordinator to communications and media relations manager. Together,
the director and the communications and media relations manager worked on numerous initiatives to increase awareness and
education of the Commission’s work.
An integral part of the Division’s day-to-day operations is responding to the media and building trusted relationships with state and
national reporters. In 2024, the Division responded to nearly 200 media inquiries. The Commission received more than 6,500
mentions across print, digital, broadcast and social media, reaching approximately 2.23 billion users. The media’s focus was largely
on the Commission’s operations, regulations and policies governing the certification of officers and officer disciplinary records and
certification statuses. Publications that featured the most stories about the Commission included WBZ News Radio, NECN, NBC 10
and MassLive.
In August 2024, the Commission launched a new and improved website, www.mapostcommission.gov, thanks to the efforts of the
Communications Division and input from other divisions. The new website offers a modern design, user-friendly features and
increased functionality. It allows visitors to easily access information about the officer certification process, historical disciplinary
records, officer status lists and more. The Division prioritized building an optimized search function on the website, which allows
users to easily find desired information and resources. The website’s new functionality also allows for real-time updates, supports
the use of high-resolution graphics and photos and more. The Division filled the site with important information, including public
meetings and hearing notices, Commission decisions and orders and officer status lists.
Since its launch, the new website has experienced a substantial increase in usage compared to the Commission’s previous website.
Over a five-month period, the new website recorded 217,000 page views and over 35,000 active users per month, a significant
improvement from the prior year's metrics of 100,000 page views annually and an average of 8,000 monthly active users.
The Division maintains content on POST’s YouTube channel as a way for the public to view recordings of the Commission’s public
meetings, hearings and trainings. The channel has seen a significant uptick in engagement since its launch in 2023. The Division
added nearly 40 videos to the channel in 2024, which the public watched 18,288 times, a 192% increase from 2023, for a total of
2,600 hours of viewing, a 274% increase. The channel saw an increase of 124 subscribers in 2024, a 121% increase from 2023. The
channel currently has approximately 200 subscribers. The Division plans to continue to add pertinent and engaging video content in
2025 to further grow this base.

FUTURE GOALS
In 2025, the Division will focus on furthering education and awareness of the Commission’s ongoing work, publicizing new
regulations and guidance, creating updated training materials and communicating upcoming changes to the certification process.
The Division will make new resource materials available in early spring 2025 so that law enforcement agencies better understand
the new certification process well in advance of the July 1, 2025 deadline.
The Division will also continue to update law enforcement agencies on new processes and regulations, such as the auditing of law
enforcement agencies. Agencies’ knowledge and awareness of POST’s activities is key to POST’s mission. The Division will therefore
work to ensure that both law enforcement communities and the public are informed about the Commission’s work and ongoing
initiatives and resources.
The Division will continue to educate the public by conducting outreaching and presenting to stakeholder groups. The Division will
also continue to ensure that the law enforcement communities and the public can easily access POST’s resources. The Division will
continue to engage with local and statewide groups to make sure such groups are able to express their views regarding various
aspects of policing and understand the tools available to them via POST’s website.
In 2025, the Division intends to focus on continuing to enhance the content on the Commission’s website, including by adding a
new section to the website concerning victim resources, and further utilizing informational video content.
