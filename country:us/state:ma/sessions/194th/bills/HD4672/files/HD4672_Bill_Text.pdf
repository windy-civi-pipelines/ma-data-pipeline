Executive Summary
In 1989, the Toxics Use Reduction Act (TURA) (Chapter 21I of the Massachusetts General Laws) was enacted, to protect
public health and the environment by promoting reduction in the use of toxic chemicals. TURA established reporting and
planning requirements that encourage facilities to use toxic chemicals (hereinafter also referred to as chemicals, toxics, or
toxic substances) only when necessary and to waste as little as possible in the production process. TURA has been
successful. Massachusetts manufacturers and other businesses subject to TURA have dramatically reduced their reliance
on toxic chemicals making Massachusetts a national leader in toxics use reduction. Through toxics use reduction,
Massachusetts businesses have saved money while reducing pollution released to the environment, chemical transportation
risks, workplace hazards, and toxics in products and waste.
Four hundred thirty (430) facilities reported using 128 different chemicals in 2023. In total (including data submitted as
trade secret data – as defined on page 4), from 1990 to 2023 (with exception of transfers off-site, which is from 1991), the
following reductions were observed:
• Chemical Use - from 1.2 billion to 564 million pounds
• Byproduct Generation - from 127 to 63 million pounds
• Shipped in Product - from 433 to 238 million pounds
• On-Site Releases - from 21 to 1.9 million pounds
• Transfers Off-Site - from 46 to 32 million pounds
As shown below, between 2007 and 2023 when adjusted for the reported 54% increase in production, 2007 Core Group
(as defined on page 4) facilities reduced:
• toxic chemical use by 69% (Styrolution is explained on page 9)
• toxic byproducts by 52%
• toxics shipped in product by 54%
• on-site releases of toxics to the environment by 83%
• transfers of toxics off-site for further waste management by 28%.

This report includes the following six sections:
Section I: Introduction.
Section II: Key TURA Terms.
Section III: 2023 Toxics Use Reduction Progress analyzes changes in reported chemical use and byproduct that can
be attributed to the adoption of toxics use reduction by TURA filers, and associated reductions in
pollution.
Section IV: 2023 Chemical Data summarizes the reported information on chemical use in calendar year 2023
including detailed information on the top twenty chemicals used, generated as byproduct, shipped in
product, released on-site as air or water pollution onsite, and shipped off-site for treatment and disposal.
Section V: 2023 Chemicals of Particular Concern presents current and historical information on particularly toxic
chemicals, on chemicals that promote asthma, and on carcinogens.
Section VI: 2023 Significant Industrial Sectors describes the relative contributions of different industrial sectors to
chemical use, waste, and release.
Section VII: 2023 Major TURA Facilities presents the top 20 facilities for use, byproduct generation, shipped in
product, released to the environment, and shipped offsite for treatment and disposal.
This 2023 Toxics Use Reduction Information Release contains chemical information useful to the public, government, and
industry. However, because the data in this report is collected only from facilities within certain industrial sectors that have ten
or more full-time employees, and use certain chemicals above established reporting thresholds, this report does not provide a
complete picture of the use and release of all toxic chemicals in Massachusetts.
Downloadable data extracts, for reporting years 1990 through 2023, can be found at MassDEP Toxics Use Reduction Act
(TURA) Data & Results | Mass.gov. The data extracts include all reported TURA data, except for trade secret data, in an Excel
format.

I. Introduction
The annual TURA information release is required under MGL Chapter 21I, Section 3(H): “The department annually
shall compile, analyze and summarize the reports required by section 10, to the extent available, and shall submit a
report to the council on the agency's findings regarding progress in toxics use reduction and emissions reduction in the
commonwealth.” This report describes toxic chemical use in Massachusetts in 2023 and progress in toxics use
reduction (TUR) under the Toxics Use Reduction Act (TURA). TURA was enacted in 1989 to reduce the risks to the
public, workers, and the environment from exposure to toxic chemicals. Rather than taking the then traditional
“command and control” approach to pollution control and worker health and safety, TURA created a process to
encourage Massachusetts facilities to reduce the quantity of toxics used and wasted in their production processes.
TURA requires Large Quantity Toxics Users (LQTUs, hereinafter referred to as filers) to submit annual reports to the
Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection (MassDEP). These reports detail the quantity of the listed
chemicals the facilities used, shipped in or as product, generated as byproduct (waste -- neither shipped in product nor
converted to another chemical during the production process), release to the environment as pollution, and shipped
off-site for waste treatment and disposal. Facilities are filers if they meet the following criteria:
• the facilities fall within Manufacturing Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) codes (20-39 inclusive) and those
in SIC codes 10-14, 40, 44-51, 72, 73, 75 and 76, or the corresponding NAICS codes,
• have ten or more full-time employee equivalents, and
• use listed toxic substances at or above reporting thresholds.
Filers are also required to pay an annual fee based on the number of chemicals used and the number of workers
employed and must develop biennial TUR plans. TUR Plans identify techniques that the facility could adopt to
reduce the use and waste of toxic chemicals in their production processes and evaluate which of these TUR
techniques would save the facility money if implemented. Although facilities are not required to implement
identified TUR techniques, many do. The plans are not submitted to MassDEP for review and approval. Instead,
they must be approved by a MassDEP-certified toxics use reduction planner (TURP); however, MassDEP audits
several of these plans annually. After several toxics use reduction planning efforts, facilities have the option of
developing reduction plans for energy use, water use, solid waste disposal or use of other chemicals instead of the
traditional TUR plan.
TURA also promotes toxics use reduction through two agencies that provide toxics use reduction education and
assistance: The Office of Technical Assistance (OTA) provides free, confidential, technical assistance to facilities
seeking to reduce the use of toxics. The Toxics Use Reduction Institute (TURI) located at UMass Lowell provides
toxics use reduction education, training, and library services; supports research on cleaner materials and processes;
provides toxics use reduction grants for businesses, industries, and communities; and operates a laboratory for testing
non-toxic or less-toxic cleaning alternatives.
The work of MassDEP, OTA, and TURI is supported through fees paid by the filers and coordinated by the Toxics
Use Reduction Administrative Council (Council). The Council is a governing body consisting of the Secretaries of
Energy and Environmental Affairs, Economic Development, and Public Safety, the Commissioners of MassDEP and
the Department of Public Health, and the Director of Labor and Workforce Development, and chaired by the Secretary
of Energy and Environmental Affairs.

II. Key TURA Terms
TURA – Massachusetts Toxics Use Reduction Act of 1989 (MGL c. 21I).
TRI – federal EPA Toxics Release Inventory.
TRADE SECRET DATA– the information identified as confidential by TURA filers and not determined to be otherwise by the Commissioner of MassDEP. To protect
confidentiality claims by TURA filers, all trade secret data in this information release are presented in aggregated form. Aggregated data do not include the names and amounts of
chemicals subject to claims of confidentiality.
2007 CORE GROUP -- – includes all industry categories and chemicals that were subject to TURA reporting in 2007 and remained subject to reporting in the current reporting year
at the same reporting threshold. The 2007 Core Group is used to measure progress from 2007, the first reporting year since the 2006 TURA Amendments became effective. The
2007 Core Group does not include trade secret quantities.
2000 CORE GROUP -- – includes all industry categories and chemicals that were subject to TURA reporting in 2000 and remained subject to reporting in the current reporting year
at the same reporting threshold. The 2000 Core Group is used to measure progress from 2000 and does not include trade secret quantities.
The terms and definitions below have been arranged in order of inputs and outputs. Chemicals that are used by facilities are manufactured, processed, or otherwise used. As a result
of using these chemicals, a facility has outputs that can include a product that is created for sale, or a waste (“byproduct” as defined by TURA). The calculation of use and waste of
chemicals is known as “mass balance”. Generally, the inputs equal the outputs, but there are some circumstances in which there is an imbalance between inputs and outputs. These
are most often the result of 1) chemicals being recycled on-site; 2) the product being held in inventory; 3) chemicals being consumed or transformed into another chemical during the
production process; or 4) the chemical is a metal in a compound, and as a result use is calculated differently than byproduct. For metal compounds, use is calculated as the total
amount of the compound while byproduct is calculated as only the amount of the parent metal in the compound.
Inputs Outputs
TOTAL USE – the total quantity in pounds of TURA chemicals reported as PRODUCT – a product, a family of products, an intermediate product,

III. 2023 Toxics Use Reduction Progress
To protect the environment, public, and workers from the adverse effects of toxic chemicals, TURA
established processes that encourage facilities to implement TUR techniques that result in:
1) the use of toxic chemicals only when necessary, and
2) the smallest possible amount of waste generated.
The TURA program has been a resounding success. TURA’s initial goal of a 50% reduction in the quantity
of toxic chemicals generated as byproduct was met in the first decade of the program, and the TURA
program has continued to make progress in toxics use reduction in the ensuing years. This section of the
report describes the trends in chemical use by filers.
Trends in the Numbers of Filers and Reported Chemical Use, Byproduct, On-site Releases, and
Transfers Off-Site for Treatment or Disposal
As shown in Figures 1 and 2 below, the number of different TURA-listed chemicals used in the
Commonwealth at reported levels, the number of facilities using those chemicals, and the total amount of
those chemicals used, generated as byproduct, released to the environment, and shipped off-site for
treatment and disposal has declined in the thirty-three years since 1990.
As shown in Figure 1, 128 of the over 1,500 TURA listed substances were reported in 2023. The number of
filers rose from 686 in 1990 to 728 in 1991 and 1992, gradually declined, and then rose again to 713 in
2001, largely due to the promulgation of a lower reporting threshold for persistent bioaccumulative toxic
(PBT) chemicals (see Section IV, 2023 TURA Chemical Data). The number of filers has decreased from
454 in 2022 to 430 in 2023. Regulated facilities submit one report for each reportable substance. The
number of individual substance reports submitted has followed a similar trend, decreasing from a high of
2,666 in 1993, to 1,467 in 2023, consistent with the decline in the number of TURA filers.
These reported amounts are influenced by changes in regulatory requirements. For example, the number of
individual substances reported reached a high of 202 in 1996 due to an expansion in the chemical list, and
the number of TURA filers increased to a high of 713 in 2001, due to a drop in the reporting threshold for
certain chemicals. The number of chemical reports dropped by approximately 25% in 2007 when the
TURA reporting threshold was raised for certain manufactured and processed chemicals to match the EPA
TRI threshold. Individual chemical reports have since declined as Massachusetts businesses reported using
fewer chemicals.
Filers Entering and Leaving the TURA Reporting Universe
From 2022 to 2023, 31 facilities left, and 11 facilities entered the TURA reporting universe. The reasons
for 31 facilities not reporting in 2023 were:
• 10 closed
• 18 reduced use below the reporting threshold
• 1 reduced staffing below the FTE threshold
• 2 are under enforcement for failure to report
As shown in Figure 2, chemical use decreased from 1.2 billion pounds in 1990 to 564 million pounds in
2023. Byproduct generation decreased from 127 million pounds in 1990 to 63 million pounds in 2023.

Measuring Progress in Toxics Use Reduction: Adjusting the Reported Data for Consistent Year to Year
Comparisons:
While the raw reported data presents an overall picture of toxic chemical use and waste in the Commonwealth, it
cannot be used to track progress in toxics use reduction. Because the types of facilities and the list of chemicals and
chemical reporting thresholds change over time, progress in toxics use reduction is best measured by using a
consistent set of chemicals and industries – a core group – subject to reporting. Without the use of a core group,
changes in chemical use, byproducts, releases and shipments for treatment and disposal could be due to changes in
the reporting requirements.
In past iterations of this report, two core groups were discussed: 2000 Core Group and 2007 Core Group. Although
information and progress towards chemical reductions are still significant for the 2000 Core group, the following
discussion will focus on the 2007 Core Group because it currently covers 96% of the total 397 million pounds of
toxic chemicals reported in 2023 (excluding trade secret data). The “2007 Core Group” is made up of chemicals and
industrial categories that were subject to reporting in 2007 and that remain subject to reporting, at the same reporting
thresholds in 2023. The 2007 Core Group covered 100% of the reported data in 2007. Discussion on the “2000
Core Group” Progress is presented in Appendix A.
Raw reported data also need to be adjusted to account for changes in production levels. Because chemical use and
byproduct generation generally increase as more products are produced, it is possible for a facility to report
increases in use and byproduct while simultaneously implementing toxics use reduction. Filers are required to
report the ratio of their production levels in the reporting year to their production levels in the prior year. The
reported production ratios are used to normalize the data to eliminate the effects of changes in chemical use and
waste that are due solely to changes in the amount of product produced. The following example illustrates how data
are adjusted to reflect changes in production.
ADJUSTING RAW DATA FOR YEAR-TO-YEAR CHANGES IN PRODUCTION
• In year 1, a facility produces 1,000 machine parts, and generates 100 lbs. of byproduct.
• In year 2, the facility produces 10% fewer machine parts (900). Therefore, the production
ratio is 0.90. However, the facility only generates 80 lbs. of byproduct.
• The production adjusted byproduct for year 2 is 80 lbs/0.90 = 89 lbs.
• The production adjusted percent change from year 1 to year 2 is [100-89]/100 = 0.11, or an
11% reduction, while its actual byproduct reduction is 20%.
Progress in Toxics Use Reduction: 2007 Core Group
The 2007 Core Group includes all industry categories and chemicals that were subject to TURA reporting in 2007
and remained subject to reporting in 2023 at the same reporting threshold. The 2007 Core Group is used to measure
progress from 2007, the first reporting year after the 2006 TURA Amendments became effective. (The 2007 Core
Group excludes trade secret chemicals and chemicals designated as higher hazard substances (HHS) that were filed
under the lower 1,000-pound threshold after 2007. It also excludes N-Propyl Bromide, which was first listed in 2010
and designated as a HHS in 2016, and chemicals added through EPA TRI after 2007, such as Nonylphenol
Ethoxylates.) Table 1 and Figures 3 and 4 below summarize TURA data from 2007 to 2023, excluding trade secret
data.
2007 Core Group Progress: Adjusting for Production
Table 1 below summarizes TURA data from 2007 to 2023, showing reported and production adjusted quantities. For
the 2007 Core Group, the activity index shows an increase in production of 54 percent from 2007 to 2023. As shown
below in Table 1 and Figure 3, when adjusted for production, as of 2023, the 2007 Core Group facilities have reduced:
• toxic chemical use by 69%
• toxic byproducts by 52%
• toxics shipped in product by 54%
• on-site releases of toxics to the environment by 83%
• transfers of toxics off-site for further waste management by 28%.

Trade Secret
Under certain circumstances facilities have the right to claim that the amount of chemical used and generated as
byproduct is a trade secret. Provided that the regulatory standards for making such a claim are met and the
Commissioner has not determined that the information is not a trade secret, MassDEP may not share that
information. In 2023, eight facilities made trade secret claims on a combined total of:
• 167 million pounds of chemical use
• 4 million pounds of byproduct generation
• 39 million pounds shipped in product.
Chemical Use by Use Category
TURA requires that facilities report chemical use in one of three chemical use categories: manufactured, processed,
and otherwise used, identified by the Federal Toxics Release Inventory (TRI) program. Figure 5 below shows the
proportion of 2023 chemical use for the three categories:
• Chemicals manufactured accounted for 14% of total chemical use.
• Chemicals processed accounted for 70% of total chemical use.
• Chemicals otherwise used accounted for 16% of total chemical use.

Top 20 Chemicals
In 2023, filers reported using 128 out of the over 1,500 TURA-listed substances in amounts above the reporting
threshold. The data was analyzed by chemical to identify the top 20 chemicals in each of the following amounts:
used, generated as byproduct, shipped in product, released on-site as pollution, and shipped off-site for treatment or
disposal.
Chemical Use
As shown in Table 3 below, the top 20 chemicals used in 2023 accounted for 84% (333 million pounds) of the total
use reported (trade secret data was excluded to protect confidentiality claims). The top four chemicals, Sodium
Hydroxide (14% of total use, 149 facilities, 55 million pounds), Methanol (12% of total use, 25 facilities, 49 million
pounds), Hydrochloric Acid (11% of total use, 38 facilities, 42 million pounds), and Sodium Hypochlorite (10% of
total use, 32 facilities, 38 million pounds), and accounted for almost half of the total reported use (excluding trade
secret data) in the state.
Tables 4 and 5 show the top 20 chemicals for the other reporting categories. As with use, the top 20 chemicals
represent a significant proportion of the total amount reported (Table 2). The top 20 chemicals comprised:
• 87% of the total reported byproducts (including trade secret data)
• 90% of the total reported shipped in product (excluding trade secret data)
• 94% of the total on-site releases (including trade secret data)
• 91% of the total off-site transfers (including trade secret data).
Hydrochloric Acid was the second top chemical for on-site releases, accounting for 14% of the statewide total of on-
site releases (270,000 pounds). Ninety-seven (97) percent of hydrochloric acid releases were from municipal waste
combustors.
The Nitrate Compounds chemical category was the top chemical for transfers offsite, accounting for 17% of the
statewide total transfers off-site (almost 5.5 million pounds). Nitrate compounds were primarily coincidentally
manufactured during neutralization of nitric acid in wastewater treatment and were discharged to Publicly Owned
Wastewater Treatment Plants. Ninety-six (96) percent of total transfers off-site of lead, the fourth chemical on the
list, was attributed to five municipal waste combustors that transferred lead in ash to off-site lined landfills.

V. 2023 Chemicals of Particular Interest
Certain toxic chemicals are of particular concern because of their higher potential to harm the environment or public
health. These include:
• Chemicals classified as persistent bioaccumulative toxic (PBT) chemicals by the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) under the Toxics Release Inventory (TRI) Program
• Chemicals designated as Higher Hazard by the TURA Administrative Council
• Chemicals known to promote asthma (Asthmagens)
• Carcinogens
Trends in reported data for each of these groups of substances are discussed below.
Persistent Bioaccumulative Toxic (PBT) Chemicals
PBTs are highly toxic, remain in the environment for long periods of time, are not readily destroyed, and build up or
accumulate in body tissue. As a result, relatively small releases of PBT chemicals can pose health and
environmental threats and, therefore, the use and release of these chemicals, even in relatively small amounts,
warrants public reporting as well as toxics use reduction efforts. Because of these concerns, the threshold for PBTs
was lowered by USEPA from 25,000 pounds if the substance is manufactured or processed, and 10,000 pounds if
the substance is otherwise used, to between 0.1 grams and 100 pounds, depending on the chemical, for all uses. The
threshold was lowered for all PBTs, as of reporting year 2000, except for lead and lead compounds (starting
reporting year 2001).
Table 6 below shows the 2023 reported data and the number of filers for each PBT (excluding trade secret data).
Nine PBTs are reported in Massachusetts. Five of these (dioxin, polycyclic aromatic compounds, benzoperylene,
mercury and mercury compounds) are chiefly associated with combustion at resource recovery facilities, power
plants, and the manufacture of concrete and asphalt paving.
Table 7 below shows each PBT’s chemical use since the year before it was designated as a PBT. The chemical use
increased from zero to hundreds of pounds when the PBT designation occurred. The pounds of these combustion
related chemicals increased again in 2003 when the municipal waste combustors were required to report. Despite
being used primarily to produce power, facilities did eliminate some of these chemicals when they switched from
coal and oil to natural gas, and the majority showed that they were using less of the chemical or generating less
byproduct per unit of product since the substance was designated as a PBT. However, reporting dropped
substantially in 2007 when amendments to the Act exempted facilities that burned fuel for their own use from
reporting on chemicals in the fuel or coincidentally manufactured during combustion.
The use of lead and lead compounds stems from a combination of combustion, waste management, paving asphalt
manufacture, and traditional manufacturing. Lowering the reporting threshold to 100 pounds in 2001 resulted in an
increase in the number of facilities reporting lead from 15 in reporting year 2000, to 152 in 2001, and an increase in
the number of facilities reporting lead compounds from 33 in 2000, to 129 in 2001. However, in 2023 the number
of lead and lead compounds filers had decreased to 62 and 41, respectively.

Higher Hazard Substances (HHS)
Other higher hazard chemicals, beyond PBTs covered above, are also reported under TURA. The 2006 amendments
to TURA directed the Council to categorize the TURA list of chemicals into higher or lower hazard substances, or to
leave them uncategorized and lower the reporting threshold for higher hazard substances (HHS) to 1,000 pounds for
all uses. Table 8 below shows the pounds of each HHS reported and the number of facilities reporting it from the
year before it was designated as a HHS to 2023.
The data showed a similar trend for trichloroethylene and tetrachloroethylene as that seen with PBTs - an initial
increase in the number of facilities reporting since these chemicals were designated as HHS in 2008 and 2009. The
increases, respectively, were from 9 in 2007 to 27 in 2008 reporting trichloroethylene, and 4 in 2008 to 23 in 2009
reporting tetrachloroethylene. However, in 2023 the number of trichloroethylene and tetrachloroethylene filers
decreased to 6 and 2, respectively.
Table 9 below shows the fourteen HHS chemicals reported in 2023, including the number of filers, byproduct
generation, shipped in product, on-site releases, and transfers off-site.

*Note: When hexavalent chromium was designated high hazard, the existing chromium compounds category was broken into two categories: hexavalent chromium and non-hexavalent chromium. As
a result, there is no data for hexavalent chromium prior to 2012.

Asthmagens
In 2009, the Lowell Center for Sustainable Production (LCSP) published Asthma-Related Chemicals in Massachusetts:
an Analysis of Toxics Use Reduction Data (available on TURI’s website www.turi.org). The purpose of this project
was to understand the extent to which chemicals that can cause the initial onset of asthma or trigger subsequent asthma
attacks are being used by Massachusetts industries who report under the TURA program (using 1990 to 2005 data).
The report identified 335 chemicals that can cause or exacerbate asthma where 68 are reportable under TURA and of
which 41 have been reported at some point during the program’s history.
The TURA program has begun working to better understand the uses of these chemicals in relation to potential
exposures and toxics use reduction opportunities. Table 10 below summarizes 2023 data on some of the chemicals
identified in the LCSP report that were reported under TURA. In 2023, 16 chemicals identified as asthmagens by the
Association of Occupational and Environmental Clinics (AOEC) were reported under TURA. In 2023, Sulfuric Acid
was again reported as having the largest usage while Formaldehyde was again reported as having the largest amount of
on-site releases.

Carcinogens
Several TURA chemicals are identified as Group 1 carcinogens (i.e., carcinogenic to humans) by the International
Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC). In 2023, eight IARC Group 1 carcinogens were reported under TURA (see
Table 11). The largest amount of use was reported for Formaldehyde. Formaldehyde was also reported as having the
largest amount of releases and these releases were reported by the most facilities. Releases were primarily air releases;
however, there were also releases to water and land.

VI. 2023 Significant Industrial Sectors
Under TURA, facilities in the Manufacturing Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) codes 20-39 inclusive and those
in SIC codes 10-14, 40, 44-51, 72, 73, 75 and 76, or the corresponding NAICS code must report their chemical use if
they meet or exceed certain thresholds. Figures 6 through 9 present, by sector, the 2023 numbers of facilities reporting,
reported amount of use, byproduct, and releases on-site by industrial sector.
The charts demonstrate that the chemical manufacturing sector dominates chemical use in the Commonwealth. This
sector had the greatest percentage of filers at 19% (Figure 6). The chemical manufacturing sector also had the greatest
percentage of chemical use at 60% (Figure 7), the largest percentage of byproduct at 46% (Figure 8), and the largest
percentage of on-site releases at 22%, with the paper manufacturing and waste management and remediation services
sectors at 17% and 12%, respectively (Figure 9). The chemical manufacturing sector is a diverse group of industries
and includes facilities that “manufacture” chemicals according to the TURA definition as well as facilities that
“process” chemicals to formulate adhesives, paints, pharmaceuticals, and plastic materials and resins. The chemical
manufacturing sector is broken into further sectors in Figure 7.
Chemical distributors at (Figure 7) 22% were the second largest contributor to use but had virtually no impact on
byproduct and releases. Waste management and remediation services, paper manufacturing, and fabricated metal
processors were other sectors with substantial contributions to byproduct and releases. The paper manufacturing sector,
which accounted for 3% of total statewide use (Figure 7), accounted for 14% of total byproduct generated (Figure 8).
Likewise, waste management and remediation services, which accounted for 4% of total statewide use (Figure 7),
accounted for 12% of total on-site releases (Figure 9).

VII. 2023 Major TURA Facilities
Tables 12 through 14 show the 20 facilities that report the highest quantities of reported chemical used, generated as
byproduct, shipped in or as product, released on-site, and transferred off-site.
• Table 12 lists the 20 facilities that reported the largest total quantity of TURA chemicals used. These 20
facilities used 426 million pounds, or 75% of total statewide use.
• Table 13 lists the 20 facilities that generated the largest reported quantity of byproduct generated and shipped
in product. These facilities generated 37 million pounds of byproduct or 59% of the statewide total. The 20
facilities with the largest quantity shipped in product, shipped 212 million pounds in product, or 89% of the
statewide total.
• Table 14 lists the 20 facilities that reported the largest quantity of on-site releases and the 20 facilities that had
the largest quantity of transfers off-site. These facilities released 1.1 million pounds, or 59% of total releases
statewide. Four of the Top 20 on-site releases were municipal waste combustors (MWCs), which reported over
252,000 pounds of Hydrochloric Acid, that was coincidentally manufactured during combustion. The 20
facilities with the largest reported quantity of transfers off-site transferred 23 million pounds, or 71% of the
total statewide transfers off-site.

Appendix A - 2000 Core Group Progress
The “2000 Core Group” includes all industry categories and chemicals that were subject to TURA reporting in 2000
and remained subject to reporting in 2023 at the same reporting threshold. The 2000 Core Group is used to measure
progress from 2000. The 2000 Core Group currently covers 86% of the total 397 million pounds of toxic chemicals
reported in 2023 (excluding trade secret data).
Progress in Toxics Use Reduction: 2000 Core Group
The 2000 Core Group includes all industry categories and chemicals that were subject to TURA reporting in 2000 and
remained subject to reporting in 2023 at the same reporting threshold. The 2000 Core Group is used to measure
progress from 2000 and provides a longer history of TURA chemical use, byproduct, and releases than the 2007 Core
Group. Table A-1 and Figures A-1 and A-2 below summarize 2000 Core Group TURA data from 2000 to 2023,
excluding trade secret data. In addition to the filers excluded from the 2007 Core Group, the 2000 Core Group excludes
reports discontinued when the TURA reporting threshold was lowered for certain manufactured and processed
chemicals to match the EPA TRI threshold for lead and lead compounds reports, due to the lowered 2001 PBT
thresholds.
2000 Core Group Progress: Adjusting for Production
Table A-1 below summarizes TURA data from 2000 to 2023, showing reported and production adjusted quantities. For
the 2000 Core Group, the activity index shows an increase in production of 51 percent from 2000 to 2023. As shown
below in Table A-1 and Figure A-1, when adjusted for production, as of 2023, the 2000 Core Group facilities have
reduced:
• toxic chemical use by 78%
• toxic byproducts by 73%
• toxics shipped in product by 65%
• on-site releases of toxics to the environment by 91%
• transfers of toxics off-site for further waste management by 57%.
2000 Core Group Progress without Adjusting for Production
The actual quantities reported by the 2000 Core Group over the period 2000 to 2023 are shown in Figure A-2. These
quantities have not been adjusted for changes in production. From 2000 to 2023, Core Group facilities:
• reduced toxic chemical use by 67% (from 1,038 million to 342 million pounds between 2000 and 2023)
• reduced toxic byproducts by 59% (from 116 million to 48 million pounds between 2000 and 2023)
• reduced toxics shipped in product by 47% (from 359 million to 191 million pounds between 2000 and
2023)
• reduced on-site releases of toxics to the environment by 87% (from 11 million to 1.4 million pounds
between 2000 and 2023)
• reduced transfers of toxics off-site for further waste management by 34% (from 27 to 18 million pounds
between 2000 and 2023).
