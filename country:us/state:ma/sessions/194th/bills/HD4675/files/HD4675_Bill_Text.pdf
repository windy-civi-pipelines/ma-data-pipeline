Massachusetts Child Fatality Review
Annual Report
Fiscal Year 2024
About the Child Fatality Review Program
The Massachusetts Child Fatality Review (CFR) program works to decrease the incidence of
preventable child fatalities and near fatalities. The program comprises 11 local teams—one in
each of the Commonwealth’s judicial districts—and a state team with 16 seats. All CFR teams
are multidisciplinary, comprised of state agency representatives, health experts, service
providers and law enforcement. Following the death of a child under the age of 18, local teams
conduct a review of that child’s birth, death, medical, social service, and police records to better
understand the circumstances surrounding the death. Following a review, the local teams submit
findings, in the form of a problem statement or recommendation, to the state team. The state
team reviews the findings, contextualizes them with epidemiological data, and consults experts
to identify opportunities to improve programs, policies, regulations, and practice that address
the findings. Those opportunities are shared in the form of recommendations in an annual report
to the governor and legislature pursuant to M.G.L. Chapter 38 § 2A. For team membership, see
Appendix B. State Team and Local Team Membership.

Preface
The loss of a child is devastating to a family and can have a profound impact on communities. Since
2001, the Massachusetts Child Fatality Review (CFR) program has worked to learn from these
tragedies to protect the health and safety of children in the future.
This Fiscal Year 2024 (FY24) Annual Report of the state CFR team describes program findings and
activities from July 1, 2023 through June 30, 2024 and is released in compliance with the program’s
authorizing statute (M.G.L. Chapter 38 § 2A). This report and the activities of the state team would
not be possible without collaboration between the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner (OCME),
the Office of the Child Advocate (OCA), and the Department of Public Health (DPH). Through this
collaboration, the CFR program is developing more timely reports with deeper explorations of the
causes and prevention of child fatalities.
This report is dedicated to the children with autism spectrum disorder who drowned while the
report was being researched, and to caregivers everywhere. If our society is to thrive, our caregivers
must be given the tools, resources, and services they need to raise healthy children who survive
well into adulthood.

Executive Summary
Massachusetts continues to be a national leader in safeguarding the health and wellbeing of
children, as evidenced by its low infant and child fatality rates. However, a troubling increase in
child fatalities began in 2020, both nationally and in Massachusetts. This increase disrupts a two-
decade decline in child fatality rates. In 2022, the overall child death rate in Massachusetts was
29.5 deaths per 100,000 population, which equates to 403 deaths of children aged zero to 17 years.
While this figure remains substantially lower than the 648 child deaths recorded in 2000 and 501 in
2010, it is higher than the 390 children who died in 2020 and 397 in 2021. This is a concerning
reversal of progress.
The leading causes of child deaths in 2022 were:
• congenital malformations, • cancer, and
• unintentional injuries,1 • complications from pregnancy
• short gestation/low birthweight
Despite the low rate of infant and child fatalities in Massachusetts, substantial inequities exist.
Boys, children of color, and children and infants living in urban centers are all at higher risk of
fatality.2 These inequities are not rooted in biological or genetic differences between races and
ethnicities, nor are they inherent to other aspects of a child’s or infant’s race or ethnicity. Rather,
they are linked to social determinants of health, including factors like socioeconomic status and
access to health care.3
Findings from local CFR team reviews and media reports indicated that in addition to the inequities
the state team had identified in prior years, children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) may also
be at higher risk of fatality. Further research on the topic indicated that compared to their
neurotypical peers, children with ASD face a 160-fold increased risk of drowning.4 Drowning is
the leading cause of death for children with ASD, and these drowning events frequently occur in the
context of wandering or elopement, a behavior seen more frequently in children with ASD.5
Preventing wandering or elopement may decrease childhood death of children with ASD and
reduce their increased risk of fatality. Methods for preventing wandering and drowning deaths for
1 Injuries are bodily harm – fatal or nonfatal - that can be caused by fires, motor vehicle crashes, drowning, sharp objects,
firearms, being struck by an object, tripping and falling, pedestrian and bicyclist injuries, and more. Injuries can be
unintentional (sometimes called “accidental”) or intentional, such as suicide and self-harm or homicide and assault
related (Injury Surveillance Program (n.d.). Massachusetts Department of Public Health. https://www.mass.gov/injury-
surveillance-program).

children with ASD include caregiver awareness, therapeutic interventions, home modifications,
emergency preparedness, emergency response, education, and life skills. Caregivers access these
methods through a complex array of educational policy, therapeutic and healthcare provider
practices, insurance policies and social services. While there are many resources and services
available to support wandering and drowning prevention in Massachusetts, they are time
consuming to navigate, expensive to access, lack standardization, and are inconsistently available
across the state. For caregivers who must provide 24/7 vigilance over their children with wandering
behaviors, the ASD support system is insufficient.

The recommendations in this report for legislators, agencies, community leaders, and caregivers
aim to increase the ease of service navigation and improve access for families. Implementing these
recommendations involves several state secretariates, including the Executive Office of Health and
Human Services, The Executive Office of Labor and Workforce Development, The Executive Office
of Education, and the Executive Office of Public Safety and Security. In particular, the Department
of Early Education and Care (EEC), the Department of Developmental Services (DDS), the
Department of Public Health (DPH), the Department of Higher Education, the Department of
Elementary and Secondary Education (DESE) and the MA Autism Commission can play critical
roles in creating systems that support caregivers and prevent drowning among children with ASD
who have wandered. Some recommendations may require legislative or regulatory changes,
infrastructure development, time and resources. And by improving the coordination,
standardization, and accessibility of services for children with ASD, we can ultimately reduce
fatality rates and improve the wellbeing for children with ASD and their families. To that end, this
report also contains succinct fact sheets and resource lists for caregivers and providers (see
Appendices D, G, and H).

Recommendations
Raising Caregiver Awareness
Collect ASD diagnosis as part of child fatality review criteria in all cases
Identify or create and promote a centralized hub of educational resources, material goods, service
providers, and funding opportunities for caregivers and providers of children with ASD.
Develop and disseminate a standardized tool for asking caregivers about elopement risk with
provider education about wandering behavior, associated risks, and prevention.
Conduct an elopement screening and provide caregiver education, including emergency
preparedness, during provider interactions.
Home Modification Access
Establish a pilot program for home safety modifications.
Provide insurance coverage for prevention methods such as home modifications, elopement risk
screenings, swim lessons, and tracking devices.
Educational and Therapeutic Support
Create a centralized intake for Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) therapies.
License and regulate Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) Centers.
Create a strategy for growing the workforce that supports children with ASD, including but not
limited to:
• Board Certified Behavior Analysts
• Registered Behavior Technicians, and
• Aquatics Professionals
Create strategies for meeting DESE’s Comprehensive Health and Physical Education objective for
children to have the “ability to apply strategies for staying safe…around water” that are adapted to
the specific needs of children with ASD.
Identify and/or develop model curriculum for the personal safety standards and provide guidance
for adapting the curriculum to students with special needs.
Increase funding for adaptive swim lessons.
Emergency Preparedness & Response
Conduct an assessment to determine the extent to which first responder training regarding children
with autism has spread across the commonwealth, the availability of radio tracking devices and
reverse 9-1-1, and create a strategy to improve access as necessary.
Develop and promote in-service training on public safety risks, including elopement of people with
ASD for first responders.
Encourage parents to maintain a packet of information that is easy to access in a moment of crisis,
and or proactively speak with local first responders. The packet should include information about
the child’s key interests, points of concern near the home, and consideration for how best to
approach the child when they are located.
Create and promote a standardized practice in first responder agencies to identify and maintain
information about children with ASD.
Care Coordination
Expand access to respite care for caregivers of children with ASD.

Introduction
This report presents the latest available data on child and infant deaths, covering the calendar year
2022. Massachusetts continues to experience low rates of infant and child fatalities compared to
other U.S. states, highlighting the robust public health infrastructure of the Commonwealth.
However, child fatality rates have increased both nationally and in Massachusetts since 2020,
interrupting a two-decade decreasing trend.6 In 2022, the overall child and infant (ages zero to 17
years) death rate was 29.5 deaths per 100,000 population7 (n= 403 deaths). This is a slight increase
from 2021 (29.1 per 100,000, n=397) and 2020 (28.1 per 100,000, n=390).
Fifty-six percent of all deaths among children (ages zero to 17 years) were infants (ages < one year).
The infant fatality rate decreased in 2022 (325.3 per 100,000) compared to 2021 (331.0 per
100,000). Child (ages one to 17 years) death rates increased in 2022 (13.6 per 100,000) compared
to 2021 (12.9 per 100,000).
Causes of Death
In 2022, for all ages between zero to 17 years, the top five causes of death were congenital
malformations (n = 49), unintentional injuries (n = 37), short gestation/low birthweight (n = 29),
cancer (n = 20), and pregnancy complications (n = 19). Nationally, the top three causes of death
were pregnancy complications, unintentional injuries, and congenital malformations followed by
homicide and suicide as the fourth and fifth leading causes of death for those between the ages
zero to 17 years.8
Compared with the 2021 top causes of deaths in Massachusetts, in 2022 there was an increase in
deaths due to pregnancy complications (15 deaths in 2021 and 19 deaths in 2022) and a slight
increase in unintentional injuries (34 deaths in 2021 and 37 deaths in 2022). There was a decrease
in deaths from cancer (31 deaths in 2021 and 20 deaths in 2022) and Sudden Unexpected Infant
Deaths (26 deaths in 2021 and 17 deaths in 2022).

Infants
The top five causes of death for infants (ages <1 year) were congenital malformations (n = 36), short
gestation/low birthweight (n = 29), pregnancy complications (n=19), Sudden Unexpected Infant
Death (SUID) (n = 17), and bacterial sepsis (n = 11). A notable difference between infant fatality
trends from 2021 to 2022 is the increase in bacterial sepsis cases in infants (two cases in 2021 and
11 cases in 2022). Bacterial sepsis ranks among the top five causes of infant death in
Massachusetts, whereas it was the seventh leading cause of infant death nationally in 2022.
Compared to top causes of infant death nationally, Massachusetts has fewer infant unintentional
injuries and infant homicides. Additionally, compared with the U.S., the state has a lower infant
death rate (MA: 325 deaths per 100,000 births; U.S.: 566 deaths per 100,000 births).9
Ages One to Four
For one- to four-year-olds, the top causes of death were unintentional injuries (n = 8), congenital
malformations (n = 4), other infections (n = 4), ill-defined conditions (n = 3), and injuries of
undetermined intent (n = 3). Massachusetts aligns with national trends for this age group in the top
two causes of death, where unintentional injury and congenital malformations were also the
leading causes of death.10 Massachusetts has fewer homicides in this age group compared to
nationally, where it was the third leading cause of death.
Ages Five to Nine
For five- to nine-year-olds, the top causes were cancer (n = 9), congenital malformations (n = 6),
unintentional injuries (n = 6), COVID-19 (n = 2), in situ neoplasms (n = 2) and influenza & pneumonia
(n = 2). At the national level and in Massachusetts unintentional injuries, cancer, congenital
malformations, and influenza & pneumonia are among the top five leading causes of death for this
age group. Similar to other age groups, Massachusetts had fewer deaths involving homicide
compared to nationally for five- to nine-year-olds.11
Ages Ten to Fourteen
For ten- to 14-year-olds, the top causes were cancer (n = 5), unintentional injuries (n = 5), epilepsy
and recurrent seizures (n = 4), heart disease (n = 4), COVID-19 (n = 2), and obesity (n = 2).
Unintentional injury and cancer were leading causes of child death for this group in Massachusetts
and nationally, with fewer deaths involving homicides and suicides occurring in Massachusetts.12
Ages Fifteen to Seventeen
Among 15- to 17-year-olds, the top causes of death were unintentional injuries (n = 18), suicide (n =
13), heart disease (n = 6), homicide (n = 6), and cancer (n = 4). This age group is most similar to the
national top causes of death for adolescents, with unintentional injuries, homicides, suicides,
cancer, and heart disease all being leading causes.13

Inequities
Geographic
In 2022, the infant death rate was highest in Hampden County with 500.9 deaths per 100,000
population followed by Essex with 463.0, Plymouth with 387.9, and Worcester County with 381.6.
From 2021 to 2022 Essex, Middlesex, and Worcester counties saw an increase in the infant death
rate while Bristol, Hampden, Norfolk, and Suffolk counties saw a decrease (See Table 2).

In 2022, the child death rate (ages one to 17) was highest in Hampden County at 23.5 deaths per
100,000 population. Child death rates increased in Hampden, Plymouth, Suffolk, and Worcester
counties and decreased in Essex, Middlesex, and Norfolk counties from 2021 to 2022 (See Table 3).
The remaining counties had child death rates that were unstable due to small numbers in either
2021 or 2022.
14 All rates are per 100,000 population.
15 Rates calculated for small populations are often unstable because a small change in the number of cases can lead to
large percentage changes in the rate.

Birth Sex
In 2022, the death rate per 100,000 births for male infants was 367.2 and 278.0 for females.
Between 2021 and 2022 the infant death rate decreased slightly for both males and female infants
from 289.9 deaths per 100,000 births for females and from 370.0 deaths per 100,000 births for
males in 2021 (see Table 4).
In 2022, the death rate per 100,000 population between the ages of 1-17 was 16.6 for males and
10.5 for females. From 2021-2022 females saw an increase in death rate per 100,000 between the
ages of five- to nine-years-old while males saw an increase in deaths among all age groups besides
infants and ten- to 14-years-old (see Table 4).

Race and Ethnicity
In 2022, the infant death rate per 100,000 population for Black, non-Hispanic/non-Latinx infants
was 688.1, for Hispanic infants the rate was 393.4, and for White, non-Hispanic/non-Latinx infants
the rate was 279.7. Between 2021 and 2022 the infant death rate increased for Hispanic and White,
non-Hispanic/non-Latinx infants and decreased for Black, non-Hispanic/non-Latinx Infants.
Despite the decrease in Black, non-Hispanic/non-Latinx infant mortality rate, it is still the highest
among racial demographic groups.

Other Characteristics
Geography, sex, race, and ethnicity alone do not reflect the only inequities seen in childhood
fatalities. While exploring local team findings and discussing the leading causes of child fatalities,
the state CFR team began considering developmental disability, and specifically if Autism
Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is associated with an increased risk for fatality. A 2022 study confirmed
that indeed, nationally, ASD is associated with an increased risk of fatality in children.16 Further, a
2017 study of National Vital Statistics data from 2010 to 2016 reported that drowning was the
leading cause of death for children with ASD.17 While ASD is not a life-limiting diagnosis, specific
behaviors sometimes seen in children with ASD can contribute to an increased risk of unintentional
fatality.18

suicidality and self-injurious behaviors (Weng et al). While the focus of this report is unintentional fatality, other
mechanisms of injury are important to understanding the scope of mortality and injury risk children and persons with ASD
face.

2022-2023 school year.22 This is a nearly six-fold increase in the number of Massachusetts children
with ASD receiving special education. The higher rates of children diagnosed with ASD is most likely
due to increased awareness of ASD, and improved access to diagnostics.23 The increase in
Massachusetts mimics national trends, though Massachusetts has slightly higher rates of
diagnosis than the national average.24,25 This is likely because of our robust Early and Periodic

20 Researchers and advocates have begun to distinguish “profound autism” as a subcategory of persons with ASD who
are non-verbal or minimally verbal or have an IQ under 50. This report does not distinguish between children with ASD
and children with profound ASD, as research suggests that verbal children with ASD also wander at disproportionate
rates compared to the general pediatric population (Rice et al, 2016). While some interventions mentioned here may
seem more fitting to a child with or without a profound autism designation, it is important to acknowledge every child’s
experience of ASD differs and supports for their unique behavioral or cognitive abilities should be tailored to their needs.

Massachusetts), including the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP), and EPSDT uptake by
most private insurers. EPSDT requires that children enrolled in MassHealth receive regular
screenings at key developmental stages, including for ASD. Pediatric providers are increasingly
detecting and diagnosing ASD and ASD-like behaviors.26
This report delves into the concerning behavior of wandering in children with ASD and associated
risks for fatality, and the barriers to receiving services. While these barriers may present unique and
complex challenges for families, it is important to remember and acknowledge the many benefits
and joys that accompany raising and working with children with ASD.

motor vehicles.30 These interactions can be fatal. A 2012 study of media-reported wandering cases
of children with ASD from 2011 to 2016 found that 49% of fatal wandering events originated from
the home and 71% of fatal outcomes were the result of drowning.31 The same report found the age
group with the greatest number of reported wandering events, and greatest number of fatal
wandering events, was between the ages of five and nine.
Not only do children with ASD wander at greater proportion to the general pediatric population, but
they also may have less awareness of environmental dangers that they encounter while
unsupervised.32 Researchers have observed an affinity for water in children with ASD, and many
service providers and educators encourage water play for children with ASD as a stimulating and
soothing activity. In a 2015 study of activity enjoyment, children with ASD had a much higher
enjoyment score for water activities compared to their neurotypical peers.33 While aquatic play can
be a fruitful source of stimulation, relaxation and enrichment, it may also mean that in an instance
of wandering, children with ASD may seek out or be drawn to water environments.
This report provides a detailed characterization of unintentional fatality prevention best practices,
harm reduction strategies, programs available to caregivers and providers, and areas for improved
coordination across the state for the reduction of child fatalities related to wandering in the context
of ASD. Not all children with ASD exhibit wandering behavior, and not all children that wander have
ASD.34 However, this is a risky behavior that affects one quarter to one half of children with ASD—
theoretically at least 7,000 to 14,000 Massachusetts children—and must be addressed to reduce
the inequitable risk of fatality faced by children with ASD.
Prevention & Harm Reduction
Fatality prevention requires a multi-tiered approach, including understanding and addressing the
root causes of wandering, creating barriers to wandering, and preparing for the riskiest scenarios.
Layers of prevention work together to ensure that if one intervention fails, another is in place to
reduce the harm to the child. The first step to prevention is recognizing the behavior and
understanding the risk it causes.
Understanding why a child is exhibiting wandering behavior and addressing that root cause is a
critical aspect of preventing the behavior. However, this usually takes time, effort, and access to

34 Children with other Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities (IDD) diagnoses may also exhibit wandering behavior
(Rice et al, 2016). Additionally, children with diagnoses of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and/or epilepsy
may be at a higher risk of drowning (Pardej et al 2024, Franklin et al, 2017).

skilled professionals. While understanding and addressing the cause of the behavior, other
prevention measures must be put in place.
Home modifications, such as locks, fencing, and window guards can prevent the child from leaving
when installed and used appropriately. And still, tenacious children can sometimes find a way to
leave their safe environment, even with those precautions in place. Once a wandering episode
occurs, finding the child quickly reduces their chances of encountering a dangerous environment. If
a child encounters water while eloping, water safety skills such as swimming or floating can
increase the time that rescuers have to find them.

These prevention strategies function best in tandem, and the interventions laid out must be
considered in the context of the caregiver and child’s unique circumstances and needs. Of note,
caregivers must cope with the very real fear of knowing the risks associated with wandering.
Caregivers of children of all abilities who have experienced wandering episodes may be stressed
and fearful for their child’s safety should it happen again. A 2018 study confirmed that parents of
children with ASD who wander alter their behavior to keep their children safe, like limiting outings in
public or not leaving their child under family or friend’s supervision.35 Coordinating a child’s care,
remaining constantly vigilant for wandering, and engaging in the routine tasks of caregiving can
understandably lead to burnout. Minimizing the risk of wandering can be both tiring and isolating.
Further, these stressors and barriers to treatment are exacerbated for caregivers with language and
socioeconomic inequities. A 2023 review found interactional factors, such as

language/communication barriers, a lack of trust in professionals, and limited training in cultural
responsiveness, hindered support for diverse families of youth with ASD.36 Ensuring access to
services and support for language and socioeconomically diverse children with ASD and their
caregivers is necessary to improve outcomes equitably.
Raising Caregiver Awareness
Caregivers to children with ASD must be informed of the increased likelihood of wandering and
educated that this behavior may change over the course of the child’s life. It is essential that
caregivers understand how common wandering behavior is in children with an ASD diagnosis, and
the outsized fatality risk that wandering poses for children with ASD.37 A 2018 study found only a
third of parents of children with ASD reported any formal counseling about elopement.38
While some providers conduct a risk assessment during diagnosis or subsequent appointments,
standardized screening tools would ensure the risk of wandering and affinity for water is discussed
with all caregivers of children with ASD or wandering behavior.39
Providers, from pediatricians to special education teachers to therapists, should be well-versed in
and ready to ask about wandering behavior, associated risks, and prevention opportunities with
caregivers, starting when the child is around two years old, regardless of an autism diagnosis. See
Appendix E for ways providers can support families in accessing prevention tools and
understanding risk.
Home Modifications
A 2017 study found that 52% of children with ASD who fatally wandered were initially at home, and
other places children visit like school or other structured programming can provide constant
supervision that is not possible at home.40 It is essential to install physical barriers at home as soon
as possible once wandering tendencies are identified or if parents are concerned about the danger
of wandering depending on the environmental hazards nearby. These may be temporary, until
longer-term treatments become effective, or permanent depending on a child’s wandering
behavior. In the general population, home modifications are shown to reduce injuries by as much

as 26% within the home.41 For people with ASD, home modifications are effective for preventing
wandering behavior.42
Home modifications depend on the child’s preferred routes of wandering, areas of high risk, and
the family’s needs. Some examples are listed below in Figure 2. Caregivers should be encouraged
to use a combination of these barriers, depending on their home and their child’s needs and
behavior. Additionally, usage plays an important factor in the effectiveness of each modification. If
a deadbolt is not locked, or if caregivers experience alarm fatigue43, then these will not be effective
in a wandering episode.44

The child’s caregiver is usually responsible for seeking out and negotiating the installation of any
home modifications. Caregivers bear the responsibility of navigating the multitude of home
modification products on the market and weighing the safety risk of wandering against other risks
such as efficient egress in the event of an emergency. Caregivers may also face financial barriers,
particularly for expensive products like fencing and enclosed beds.45 Finally, caregivers may not
have the skills or tools needed to install the products, time to complete the task, or permissions to
make modifications. Home modifications that alter the home, like window guards and additional
door locks may be prohibited by the terms of a lease and expensive additions like fencing are at the
discretion of a landlord.

45 Enclosed or safety beds are specially designed to prevent elopement in individuals with autism by providing a secure
and enclosed sleeping environment. Despite being secure, safety beds are designed to be comfortable and non-
restrictive. They allow for free movement within the bed while still preventing the individual from leaving it (Huang, 2023)

There is no statewide program that can support residents in identifying and addressing injury risks
and preventing wandering from the home. The MassSAVE program helps homeowners identify and
address energy efficiency and weatherization solutions and offers a promising model for providing
subsidized home modifications. Through contractors, MassSAVE provides homeowners and
landlords with no-cost home energy assessments. Homeowners are provided with simple energy-
saving modifications during the assessment; they also receive education on energy saving
practices and become eligible to receive certain no-cost energy-saving products, rebates towards
the purchase of energy-efficient appliances, and loans towards more expensive energy-saving
home modifications, like window replacements.47
A comparable program aimed at addressing in-home wandering risks could greatly reduce the risk
of negative outcomes associated with wandering and ease the burden on caregivers. Such a
program would engage trained specialists to conduct assessments for home modifications,
coordinate and subsidize construction or installation services by third-party contractors, and follow
up with residents to ensure that modifications were performed correctly. Various small-scale pilot
programs that have provided home modifications for safety found a range of improvements in

health outcomes: improved sleep and mental health, fewer falls, and lower health care usage and
costs.48
Another example program with a more targeted scope comes from the Aging Services Access
Points (ASAPs) model, where home-based service providers like occupational and physical
therapists can recommend home modifications to local or regional ASAPs. ASAPs are then able to
offer free or discounted home modification service procurement and installation.49 This model
could inform the structure of a separate program for the provision of home modification products to
households with a child with ASD through Autism Resource Centers, as recommended by in-home
providers like registered behavior technicians (RBTs), Board Certified Behavior Analysts (BCBAs),
and others. For more information about Autism Resource Centers, see the Service Coverage and
Care Coordination section (page 32).
Educational & Therapeutic Support
Wandering behavior can be addressed by Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) and other therapeutic
treatments and reinforced at home, school, and other programming. Children under the age of
three who have an ASD diagnosis or who have noted developmental deficits consistent with ASD
can receive Early Intervention (EI) services, which are overseen by the Department of Public Health
and free for all Massachusetts families. Children with ASD or ASD-like behaviors enrolled in EI are
eligible for Early and Intensive Behavioral Intervention (EIBI) services, which is a form of Applied
Behavior Analysis (ABA, see below for more information).50 In FY23, 1,578 children under three
years old received EIBI services through Early Intervention.
Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) provides functional analysis to understand the underlying cause,
also called the function, of specific behaviors, including wandering.51 ABA is the primary evidence-
based method for treating ASD and requires intensive assessment, program development, program
implementation, and continued observation on behalf of Board Certified Behavior Analysts
(BCBAs), registered behavior technicians (RBTs), the child’s caregivers, and the child. ABA and
alternative therapies can curb wandering by enhancing a child’s ability to communicate. Expressing
needs and wants, walking safely in unconfined spaces, waiting for desired objects or activities, and
other skills targeted through therapy can reduce the root function of wandering or curtail the desire
to wander before the behavior emerges.
From ages three to five, a child with ASD living in Massachusetts may qualify for Early Childhood
Special Education (ECSE), a category of special education.52 By law, ECSE must be free,
developmentally appropriate, and available to any child with a disability that needs specially
designed instruction to participate in age appropriate typical activities. This is the first point where

the child’s caregivers and the schools may collaborate to develop an Individualized Education
Program (IEP), if the child meets eligibility criteria.53 After age five, children with ASD will transition
to kindergarten and be re-evaluated for special education needs.
IEPs serve to ensure a child with a disability has the supports to make progress towards knowledge
and skill acquisition, and nurture healthy social relationships. The child’s IEP can address safety
skills, including risk of wandering if the child exhibits this behavior. While wandering is not a
behavior directly addressed on the IEP form, caregivers and educators who identify this behavior
can advocate for wandering prevention as part of an annual goal, behavior intervention planning,
accommodations (if the child will require greater supervision or changes to the physical
environment), and/or safety planning.
Additionally, wandering can be included in an Individualized Healthcare Plan (IHCP, also called an
IHP), which is developed with the school nurse. An IHCP provides a tailored approach to managing
and supporting the specific health and medical needs of a child, including wandering. ICHPs can
be standalone guidance or can be added as an appendix or as additional recommendations to an
IEP. Including an IHCP in the IEP helps to ensure coordination between medical and educational
supports, as well as provide legal assurance that the child's health needs will be managed
alongside educational goals.
The IEP may only address elopement risk in the school setting and will not identify risks or set goals
for the home and community, however. It is therefore important to ensure that IEP goals targeting
wandering consider how to generalize that skill in other settings, and to also seek out supplemental
therapies outside of the school setting, as needed.
ECSE and special education are both important avenues for learning and skill acquisition, but
children with ASD may also require in-home or center-based services outside of the classroom.
Caregivers may choose to or need to pursue other options or a combination of services including
Developmental, Individual-based, Relationship (DIR, also called DIRFloortime) therapy, sensory
integration therapy, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), occupational therapy, and speech therapy.54

ABA Provider Landscape
It is unknown how many center- and home-based ABA programs exist in Massachusetts, how many
children with ASD are receiving ABA services, and how many are on waitlists to receive such
services. MassHealth covered ABA treatment for 8,536 unique youth at 203 ABA organizations in
the 2023 calendar year.55 However, the number of children receiving ABA therapy through private
insurance or out-of-pocket expenses is unknown. The Behavior Analyst Certification Board reported
that 3,560 Board Certified Behavior Analysts were employed in Massachusetts in 2023, however, it
is unknown how many children they treated, in what setting, and for how many hours.56
The number of ABA providers has expanded with the steadily increasing number of children
diagnosed with ASD and seeking treatment in recent decades.57 And while more ABA providers
mean more children have access to ABA therapy, there has been a growing concern among some
specialists, families, advocates, and self-advocates about the quality and safety mechanisms in
place at ABA centers. Currently, center-based ABA facilities are not licensed by the state of
Massachusetts, unlike most other out-of-home child-serving facilities like childcare and
residential schools.58 This means there are no standards set statewide for ABA centers, including
safety protocols, Criminal Offender Record Information (CORI) background checks, and staffing
ratios. While many centers do have such protocols in place, these are not required, not
standardized, and not externally monitored. While Board Certified Behavior Analysts who develop
treatment plans and work with children with ASD are licensed, the license applies to the individual
provider only, and not to the other providers like behavioral therapists who work closely with the
client, or the centers themselves. More state oversight would ensure the safety and wellbeing of
children served by the centers, and standards of quality in the services provided. Currently, the
Department of Early Education and Care (EEC) is assessing the regulations required for oversight
and licensure of center-based ABA programs.59 EEC is working in collaboration with MassHealth
and the Executive Office of Health and Human Services (EOHHS) to assess options for oversight
and licensure of center based ABA programs for children, including needed regulatory authority,
governance, and staffing capacity.
Community & Water Safety
Children with ASD should not be limited from interacting with water, but rather these interactions
should be enhanced with safety measures, including community safety education and early and
adaptive swim lessons.60 Educators and providers can help a child with ASD cultivate an

understanding of potential dangers and safety in their environment. The Department of Elementary
and Secondary Education’s 2023 Comprehensive Health and Physical Education Framework
upholds personal and community safety as two essential pillars of health education.61 The
framework names the following safety objectives:
• Apply strategies for staying safe in a variety of situations (e.g., on the playground, during
physical education, around water, when using wheeled recreation, as a pedestrian, around
cooking elements or fire, on the bus, when online, around weapons or in situations of gun
violence) and determine when to report unsafe situations to an adult
• Recognize aspects of the environment (e.g., whether or not crosswalks are clearly marked,
presence of sidewalks, access to healthy foods, access to green space, levels of violence in
a community) that can positively or negatively impact safety
School districts have the discretion to determine how standards are implemented at the local level,
including what curriculum and materials they will use, and how they will ensure that instruction is
differentiated to ensure access for students with disabilities. At this time, there are no standardized
curricula or materials related to community safety for general or special education in
Massachusetts.
Children with ASD have varying abilities to conceptualize safety depending on their developmental
age, so safety education will look different for every child. There are tools educators can use to
adapt safety education for children with ASD.62 For some, this may include similar accommodation
to those listed on the child’s IEP, such as extended time for lessons to ensure comprehension. For
others, this may mean developing novel accessible lessons around safety. This can include using
different tools, like video narratives, visual cue cards, and social stories, which describe a skill or
concept in a supportive way that centers the child.63 Many of these exist for water safety and can be
tailored to the child’s preferences, environment, and abilities.
Children with ASD may need accommodations to learn ways to navigate their environment safely.
Some skills can be built around enhancing the emergency response to wandering. Behavior
analysts can work with children with ASD to respond to a stranger who they may come across when
lost, whether this is verbal communication or holding up an identification bracelet. Providers can
also work on skills related to asking for help, which a child may need if they are lost. Other lessons
on situational awareness and community safety are necessarily a focus of ABA or other therapies,
which are behavior-, skill-, or relationship-oriented.
A promising example of the way to purvey safety education for children with ASD comes from the
Safe Routes to School Program.64 The majority of public schools in Massachusetts utilize the

materials and lessons provided by Safe Routes to School for road safety and awareness education.
Safe Routes to School provides information on crossing the street, remaining on the sidewalk,
navigating a parking lot, and bike safety in age-appropriate, interactive lessons.65 While the program
does not provide specific lesson plans for children in special education or an IEP, their All Abilities
Guide emphasizes the ways to adapt lessons for children of all abilities and backgrounds.
Safety objectives in DESE’s Comprehensive Health and Physical Education include the “ability to
apply strategies for staying safe…around water …” As such, all schools in Massachusetts should
provide education on water safety, and those lessons should be adapted for children with ASD.
Some special education schools, like the New England Center for Children, incorporate swim
lessons into their curriculum, which can seamlessly tie together situational awareness education
with the essential ability to swim.66
Adaptive Swimming Lessons
Adaptive swimming lessons should be thought of as the last line of defense against drowning. Once
a child enters a body of water unsupervised, the risk of fatality substantially increases, even with
the ability to swim. Currents, aquatic plants, waves, steep drop off, other hazards, and stamina can
make this scenario fatal. Still, the ability to swim can prolong the window of time first responders
have to find the child or allow a child to return to land.
Teaching children with ASD to swim can come with unique considerations. Swimming lessons often
need to be adapted for a child with ASD. This may include one-on-one instruction to lower the
visual and aural stimulus of a group class, extending the number of lessons to accommodate the
child’s learning pace, and preceding sessions to sensitize the child to the pool, swimsuit, instructor,
and water. Adaptive swimming lessons require more space and specialized instructors compared
to typical swim lessons. Adaptive swimming lessons also require greater financial and time
investments and are almost always an out-of-pocket expense for families. They must also be
consistent, and the child given ample opportunity to use their swimming skills, so that the skill is
not lost once it is gained.
There is a shortage of adaptive lessons in general across the state. Access inequity, particularly for
children in Western and Central Massachusetts, means that caregivers shoulder the extra burden
of finding class availability, providing extended transport to and from lessons, and lack of choice if a
class is not fitting their child’s needs. Furthermore, without a centralized repository of available
adaptive swim lessons, caregivers must find these on their own through individual searches or
informal resource sharing with other parents, without cost comparisons and program
characteristics. See Appendix H for a list of adaptive swim lessons by region.
Caregivers may reduce the financial burden of swimming lessons by applying for a grant of up to
$2,000 through the Flutie Foundation. Swimming lessons may also be billed as a medical service if
provided by a specialist such as an occupational therapist. Of note, non-profit organizations like
Wonderfund provide financial assistance for swimming lessons for children receiving DCF services.
65 Caregivers of children with ASD are also entitled to disability placards, which can make navigating parking safer. See
more information for applying for a disability placard in Appendix D.

This is an example of supporting organizations providing unique wraparound services that can both
broaden the interests and enrichment opportunities for children, as well as provide important life-
saving skills. As child-serving agencies consider how the information in this report affects the
children they serve, looking at funding and resourcing options to expand adaptive swim lesson
access for children and their families could follow the model set forth by DCF, where broadening
partnerships can expand access to wraparound services without increasing agency spending or
workforce.
Emergency Preparedness & Response
Preparation and planning are key to any successful emergency response. The same goes for
responding to the elopement of a child with autism. The following provides strategies that
caregivers can proactively implement to prepare emergency responders for an elopement, and best
practices for local emergency response teams.
Emergency Preparedness for Caregivers
Caregivers can take additional steps to reduce the harm of a wandering event should it occur. Two
key steps in emergency preparedness include considering the use of tracking and monitoring
devices and preparing for the involvement of first responders. These measures can enhance the
safety and swift recovery of the child if wandering occurs.
Tracking & Monitoring Devices
Tracking and monitoring devices can alert a caregiver as soon as a child has wandered and expedite
locating the child who has wandered. Several options for tracking and monitoring devices are
available at different price points, with different functionality, battery life, and wearability. There are
two primary methods of tracking and monitoring, one using radio signals and the other using Global
Positioning System (GPS) technology, which is typically dependent on cellular coverage.
Radio signal tracking bracelets can be used to pinpoint a missing child. This technology does not
require frequent charging, can be worn as a bracelet or anklet, can penetrate underground, in water
and tunnels, and does not require a satellite signal. However, typically only first responders have
the technology to pick up the radio signal. Therefore, this method must be coordinated through a
participating agency. The uptake of radio tracking technology varies across municipalities, although
all Sherriff’s Departments in Massachusetts are equipped with the tracking technology.
Determining whether and which radio signal device a department uses can be a time-consuming
endeavor for caregivers searching for a suitable tracking device for their child. These devices can be
accessed for free for children enrolled in services with the Department of Developmental Services
(DDS), or the non-profit organization the Flutie Foundation or may be subsidized through one’s local
law enforcement agency depending on their policies.
GPS devices provide monitoring abilities directly to the caregiver. These may not be as effective
depending on service coverage and charging needs. These can be worn as a bracelet or anklet,
sewn into the child’s shoes or clothes, or carried in a backpack. GPS devices may also work both as
a tracking mechanism and as a geo fence. In the case of a geofence, the caregiver sets a proximity
requirement to the device (e.g. the boundary of their yard or apartment complex), and the caregiver
receives an alert if the device leaves that proximity requirement. These are useful if a parent would

Caregivers considering a tracking device for their child should think about the nuances of these
different devices for their child’s individualized needs and the risks in their environment. A child’s
sensory sensitivities should also be considered, though DDS and most ABA providers have
protocols to gradually build tolerance to a bracelet or anklet monitoring device. If a child does not
tolerate a wearable device, other products exist to tag clothing and backpacks, or caregivers can
utilize built-in tracking technology for tablets and other communication devices.
In 2015, H.B. 956: An Act Concerning the Safety of Autistic and Alzheimer Individuals was proposed
to provide insurance coverage for radio tracking devices through MassHealth on a voluntary basis
for families of children with disabilities and elderly persons with dementia. The legislation failed in
part due to privacy concerns for tracking vulnerable populations. As the public’s understanding of
tracking technology--found in smartphones and tablets that many now use on a regular basis--has
evolved, there may be less pushback for a similar bill now, especially given how lifesaving these
devices can be. Other states like Florida have successfully covered tracking devices as durable
medical equipment, specifically as assistive technology under the Community and Home-Based
Services Medicaid waiver.68
Providing Information to First Responders
The final step caregivers can take to enhance first responders’ speed and efficacy is to proactively
provide information about the child to first responders near where they live, work, learn, play, or
pray. This includes providing a photo and description of the child, their preferred methods of
communication, interests, and any history of wandering. Caregivers can also note nearby
environmental hazards of concern, including natural and seasonal bodies of water, public and
private pools, railroad tracks, and dangerous intersections. This information can help first
responders speedily identify the areas of highest concern first, identify the missing child easily, and
safely interact with the child, who may be dysregulated. For examples of the forms used to provide
this information to law enforcement, see Appendix D.
If a family is not comfortable interacting with first responders prior to an emergency, an alternative
is the File of Life, which prompts caregivers to put all relevant information in one file or on a magnet
to succinctly relay to first responders in an emergency.69 File of Life information is stored by the
caregiver, and the caregiver has the choice to share this information with first responders in an
emergency. These physical files can be saved at home, in a car, at school, and anywhere else the
child goes. It is important to update the file of life regularly, especially if there is a change in the
child’s behavior, physical health, or interests.
First Response Training & Best Practices
The next section addresses the ways first response agencies, including law enforcement, fire, and
Emergency Medical Services (EMS), can adapt their practices to actively engage with families
effectively.

Response Preparation
In the emergency response to wandering, law enforcement, fire, and emergency medical services
play a vital role in searching for a missing child. Before a child with ASD wanders, there are steps
departments can take to ensure the most effective response. First, local law enforcement can
partner with a radio signal tracking device organization to be able to quickly locate missing children
wearing a tracking device. If the department has not implemented the radio tracking technology,
they can collaborate with neighboring jurisdictions and the Sherriff’s Department or familiarize
themselves with the nearest department with tracking capability.
Second, police can proactively engage families to voluntarily provide information about a child
before the child ever goes missing. Taking proactive steps to gather helpful information from
caregivers and families before an incident can improve responses and increase responder and
child safety. Many, but not all, local law enforcement departments advertise proactive programs for
families to voluntarily provide relevant information about a child with ASD who may wander. This
information can increase the efficacy of response, decrease the length of response, and keep
children and officers safe during interactions. Additionally, this introduction allows local law
enforcement agencies an opportunity to provide consistent information to caregivers about what
relevant information to share during an emergency call, how to contact the law enforcement
agency for a wandering event, and what to expect in the event of a response. See Appendix F for a
template form and additional resources.
Finally, first responders should acknowledge that language and cultural barriers, personal history,
and stigma may impede a caregiver’s willingness to activate an emergency response. However,
when a child is missing, it is imperative to not delay initiating an emergency response. First
responders can increase community engagement, particularly with historically underserved and
stigmatized communities, to improve outcomes for children who have wandered.
Response Best Practices
Once first responders are alerted to a missing child with ASD, there are specific and necessary
actions that should be taken immediately. Knowing that drowning poses the greatest fatality risk to
children with ASD, first responders should prioritize searching nearby bodies of water and station
responders at them.70 While most searches may begin within the home or nearby attractions,
drowning has such a high associated risk for children with ASD that bodies of water must be the
priority. These can be identified through satellite images on apps like Google Earth, and through
conversations with caregivers.
Ideally, the child is known to law enforcement due to prior coordination with caregivers, and the
child is trackable via a device. If not, then responding officers should get a detailed description and
photo of the child and rely on caregivers to identify relevant interests. For example, if a child has an
interest in trains, then nearby train tracks should be an important search area. Caregivers can also
provide important information for keeping the child and responders safe if the child is dysregulated
when found.

Spectrum.

Per M.G.L Chapter 6 § Section 116I, Massachusetts police cadets are required to receive training on
working with people with ASD. This training is essential, but specific training on wandering response
for children with ASD, as well as continuing education for established officers, can ensure the most
effective and consistent responses across the state. In 2023, Bill H.2351 An Act relative to police
interactions with persons on the autism spectrum would have required mandatory in-services on
working with people with ASD for law enforcement agencies. This bill was not passed by the
legislature.71
Other first responders, including firefighters and emergency medical technicians, can also benefit
from additional in-service trainings on working with people, and specifically children, with ASD.
Groups like the Autism Law Enforcement Coalition (ALEC) offer voluntary in-service trainings for
interested emergency response departments.72 These organizations support officers and retired
officers with lived experience as parents of children with ASD in providing peer-to-peer, in-depth,
and personal trainings on these best practices and other ways to remain safe and keep people with
ASD safe in different emergency situations.

CommonHealth
Mass CommonHealth is a MassHealth supplemental program available to individuals with
disabilities—including people with ASD—regardless of income or assets. Coverage is purchased via
a sliding-scale monthly premium that is based on total household income and can be purchased in
addition to private insurance if a person is ineligible for MassHealth.74
For people who have private insurance coverage through their employer, MassHealth
CommonHealth will pay for any medically necessary Medicaid-covered services that the employer

CommonHealth enrollment also opens up access to MassHealth Children's Behavioral Health
Initiative (CBHI), which pays for an enhanced continuum of home- and community-
based behavioral health services for children under 21.
Children’s Autism Waiver
The DDS Children’s Autism Waiver Program can alleviate some of the burden of care coordination
for caregivers. The Autism Waiver Program is available to children birth up to age ten with a
confirmed ASD diagnosis whose family is eligible for MassHealth Standard and can engage in
intensive in-home services. This program also provides related support services including family
training, respite, and free home modification. After three years of intensive programming, children
enrolled in the Autism Waiver Program are then eligible for step-down services, with associated
funds, provided they remain eligible.75
By September 2025, the Autism Waiver Program must be running at capacity for 565 children and
their families. An open enrollment period begins annually in October and applicants are randomly
selected for eligibility screening and potential enrollment. While the Autism Waiver program is
highly effective in assisting families with accessing intensive services, due to the limited number of
spots and strict income eligibility criteria, this program is not a feasible option for many families in
Massachusetts.
DESE/DDS Program
For children over six, the DESE/DDS program is available to coordinate wraparound in-home
services with the goal of preventing out-of-home placement. Supports include coordinating in-
home therapy and skills training and the support of a family navigator. A minimum of 55% of the
family’s budget must be spent on services, like in-home therapy, and up to 45% of funding can be
used to purchase ancillary goods and services. This does not include home modification. The
funding provided is based on the level of need based on a standardized assessment. 76 In FY24, the
DESE/DDS Program served 845 students. Children who leave a residential school and return home

are prioritized for this program.77 So, while this program is another important support in the social
services network for children with ASD, the program’s scope is children whose behaviors and needs
put them at-risk for out-of-home placement.
Autism Support Centers
Caregivers are responsible for the process of coordinating care and transitioning services as a child
grows up or their needs change. There are piecemeal systems to support caregivers in this process,
but more centralized service coordination could help alleviate this burden.
DDS maintains seven Autism Support Centers accessible to all residents across the state to
improve service access and educate and support caregivers and families of children with ASD. The
Autism Support Centers also offer culturally competent and language-diverse options to improve
access equity. The services they offer include:
• Information and Referral
• Family Clinics
• Support Groups
• Access to the latest information on autism
• Family Trainings
• Parent Networking and Mentoring, and
• Social/recreational events, among other activities
The Autism Support Centers are an invaluable resource for families and caregivers, though
caregivers may not be aware they exist, and services vary by center. Some Autism Support Centers
may directly provide home modification products and subsidization of radio tracking devices. All of
the Support Centers are able to provide information about ABA and other nearby therapeutic
options, referrals to providers, and familial support while navigating the care coordination process.
Model Programs for Care Coordination
The first and most substantial care coordination phase occurs after an initial ASD diagnosis, when
caregivers face a multitude of decisions outlined above, including enrolling in therapies, applying
for supplemental insurance, handling care reimbursement, and researching alternative or non-
therapeutic services like swim lessons. Healthcare providers, Autism Resource Centers, and parent
support groups can all help find and access services, but more centralized coordination would
benefit all families in receiving consistent and high-quality support.
A few promising models exist for supporting caregivers in a time of overwhelming care coordination.
First, the Massachusetts Child Psychiatry Access Program (MCPAP) connects primary care
providers with behavioral health consultation teams to increase behavioral health care access in

the home. Out-of-home placements have unique considerations in their ability to provide 24/7 supervision and other
safeguards that are typically not possible for caregivers. However, residential school day programs or full-time
placement are important resources to consider in the services available to children with ASD and their caregivers.

part through effective referrals and care coordination.78 In translating this approach to ASD
services, primary care providers and developmental health specialists could refer families directly
to a centralized program structured like MCPAP after diagnosis. These teams could function in a
similar manner as MCPAP to consult with the family or caregiver before referring them to the
appropriate services in their network. This would also create an opportunity for consistent care
connection for caregivers to receive information about CommonHealth insurance, Autism
Resource Centers, DDS waiver programs, EIBI, and more.
A second model for care coordination comes from the William James College INTERFACE Referral
Service, which coordinates mental health care for individuals experiencing suicidality in
participating municipalities.79 Individuals make a single short call, and the INTERFACE staff then
call programs to assess availability and access, before providing this list back to the individual
seeking care. Implementing a similar process for coordinating the initial care for a child with ASD
would alleviate some of the difficulties caregivers face when negotiating long waitlists and differing
insurance coverage.
These are not the only examples of care coordination. Other strong models include the
Massachusetts Behavioral Health Helpline and Children’s Trust by Find Help.80 Implementing a
centralized program for care coordination after diagnosis would alleviate the primary responsibility
on Autism Support Centers and allow them to offer greater support at later phases of a child’s ASD
journey. This includes navigating the end of EIBI services and the transition to ABA services, special
education, the possible transition to out-of-home placement, the transition from child and youth to
adult services, and provision of home modification tools.
Conclusion & Recommendations
The rates of child fatalities are increasing while rates of infant mortality are decreasing in
Massachusetts. The worrying trend in child fatalities after the age of one increasing must be
carefully monitored, especially for areas of inequity including geographic location, age, sex, race
and ethnicity, and for vulnerable populations like new arrival status and children with
developmental disorders, like Autism Spectrum Disorder.
Autism Spectrum Disorder presents unique risks for fatality before the age of 18, especially in the
context of wandering behavior and drowning. Understanding the risk for fatality for children with
ASD, coupled with the increase in the number of children diagnosed with ASD in Massachusetts,
means that the safety and fatality prevention for this vulnerable population should be continually
assessed.

By implementing comprehensive prevention strategies, improving awareness and education for
caregivers and first responders, and enhancing service delivery across the state, Massachusetts
can better protect and support our children with ASD. These efforts will require coordinated action
and sustained commitment from all stakeholders, including state agencies, healthcare providers,
educators, and families.
Understanding why a child is exhibiting wandering behavior and changing the root behavior will be
the most effective strategies for keeping a child safe. However, this may not always be possible or
realistic, and harm reduction tools like home modification can prevent the child from leaving, even
if that is their desire. If a child does leave a safe area, being able to find them quickly and accurately
will reduce their chances of encountering a dangerous environment. Finally, if a child wanders, is
not found, and encounters water, being able to get out of the water or stay afloat will increase the
time that rescuers have to find them.
While some agencies have developed and translated documents on wandering, water safety, and
other ASD-specific risks that could be shared for greater access for vulnerable populations,
information is not centralized, irregularly updated, not shared across agencies or organizations,
and may have conflicting guidance.
Navigating all this information and processes while caring for a child with ASD can be exhausting as
well as isolating. The state team believes that implementing the following recommendations will
reduce caregiver burden, improve the quality of services provided in Massachusetts, and ultimately
prevent child fatalities:
Recommendations
Raising Caregiver Awareness
Collect ASD diagnosis as part of child fatality review criteria in all cases
Identify or create and promote a centralized hub of educational resources, material goods, service
providers, and funding opportunities for caregivers and providers of children with ASD.
Develop and disseminate a standardized tool for asking caregivers about elopement risk with
provider education about wandering behavior, associated risks, and prevention.
Conduct an elopement screening and provide caregiver education, including emergency
preparedness, during provider interactions.
Home Modification Access
Establish a pilot program for home safety modifications.
Provide insurance coverage for prevention methods such as home modifications, elopement
screenings, swim lessons, and tracking devices.
Educational and Therapeutic Support
Create a centralized intake for Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) therapies.
License and regulate Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) Centers.
Create a strategy for growing the workforce that supports children with ASD, including but not
limited to:
• Board Certified Behavior Analysts
• Registered Behavior Technicians, and
• Aquatics Professionals
36

Create strategies for meeting DESE’s Comprehensive Health and Physical Education objective for
children to have the “ability to apply strategies for staying safe…around water” that are adapted to
the specific needs of children with ASD.
Identify and/or develop model curriculum for the personal safety standards and provide guidance
for adapting the curriculum to students with special needs.
Increase funding for adaptive swim lessons.
Emergency Preparedness & Response
Conduct an assessment to determine the extent to which first responder training regarding children
with autism has spread across the commonwealth, the availability of radio tracking devices and
reverse 9-1-1, and create a strategy to improve access as necessary.
Develop and promote in-service training on public safety risks, including elopement of people with
ASD for first responders.
Encourage parents to maintain a packet of information that is easy to access in a moment of crisis,
and or proactively speak with local first responders. The packet should include information about
the child’s key interests, points of concern near the home, and consideration for how best to
approach the child when they are located.
Create and promote a standardized practice in first responder agencies to identify and maintain
information about children with ASD.
Care Coordination
Expand access to respite care for caregivers of children with ASD.
This report’s scope is narrow in addressing the increased risk of fatality that children with ASD face.
There are countless agencies, organizations, committees, groups, and families that work tirelessly
every day to nurture and provide for children with ASD, including but not limited to keeping them
safe. Caring for and working with children with ASD can sometimes be stressful, in part because of
the barriers to care that exist, but can also be joyful and rewarding. It is the aim of this report to help
more children and their families remain safe and make the process of accessing care less
burdensome.
The recommendations outlined in this report provide a roadmap for ensuring the safety and well-
being of children with ASD in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. These solutions delve into to
the root of service access barriers that affect children with ASD and their families. Improving
access to services, supporting caregivers, and standardizing practices across agencies will improve
outcomes not only in drowning deaths, but for children with ASD at large.

Appendix A. FY24 CFR Program Activities
State CFR Team
The state team met a total of four times in FY24, including two joint in-person meetings with the
local team leaders. The meetings focused on providing resources and workflow guidelines for the
local teams, determining team priorities, and directing the development of the ASD & Unintentional
Fatality research project. The joint in-person meetings allowed for collaboration and information
exchange between state team members and local team leaders, and perspective-sharing on topics
of interest.
Local CFR Teams
In FY24, eight of the 11 local teams met a total of 21 times and reviewed 84 fatalities. The
Berkshires District Attorney’s Office successfully held the first local CFR team meeting for their
district in over three years. Both Worcester and Hampden local teams did not meet in FY24 but
have engaged in technical assistance meetings to prepare for meetings in FY25. The Bristol local
team did not meet in FY24. Local team meetings resulted in 40 prevention recommendations and
five continuous quality improvement recommendations. The state Team is currently analyzing
those recommendations with the support of subject matter experts to generate recommendations
for the legislature and other audiences.
Technical assistance
In FY24 the CFR program hired two administrative roles. Johnny Rezendez joined in July 2023 as the
CFR Epidemiologist, and Meg Crowley joined in December 2023 as the full-time CFR Coordinator.
The CFR Epidemiologist supported both the local and state CFR teams in FY24 by providing
epidemiological data relevant to specific regions and demographic groups and overall
epidemiologic statistics for child fatalities in Massachusetts. The CFR Coordinator provided
technical assistance to the local teams for application of the Local Team Guidelines, utilizing
subject matter experts, meeting facilitation and organization, and relationship building through
collaborative sessions open to all local team leadership. The CFR coordinator offered technical
assistance to all teams, including the teams that were not meeting in FY23 and FY24. Of the teams
that were not regularly meeting, the CFR Coordinator provided technical assistance to the
Berkshires, Hampden, and Worcester local team leadership. The CFR Coordinator also organized
the first of standing quarterly local team collaborative sessions, where local team leadership can
share strategies and support one another’s reviews.

Wandering and Drowning in Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder – Provider Fact Sheet
The following provides succinct talking points, resources, and additional references to support therapeutic,
health care, and social services providers in discussing and addressing the risk of wandering with caregivers
of children with ASD.
ASD & Wandering
- Wandering, also called elopement or bolting, is more common in children with Autism Spectrum
Disorder (ASD) compared to their neurotypical counterparts after the age of four.1,2,3
- Once a child with ASD leaves a supervised space, they are at risk for contact with dangerous
environments, including bodies of water and busy roads.4 These interactions can be fatal.4,5,6
Wandering & Drowning
- Risk of Drowning Death: Nationally, ASD is associated with an increased risk of unintentional injury
fatality in children.5 Drowning is the leading cause of death in children ages 1 to 17 with ASD.6,7
- Wandering and Drowning: A 2017 study of media-reported wandering cases of children with ASD
from 2011 to 2016 found that 71% of fatal outcomes were the result of drowning.8 While aquatic
play can be a fruitful source of stimulation, relaxation and enrichment, it may also mean that in
instances of wandering, children with ASD may seek out or be drawn to water environments.
- Mechanism of Wandering and Death: 49% of fatal wandering events originated from the home.8 The
age group with the greatest number of reported wandering events, and greatest number of fatal
wandering events, was between the ages of five and nine.5,7,8
