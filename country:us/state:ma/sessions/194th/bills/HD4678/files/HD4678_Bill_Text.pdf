Dear Sirs,
Pursuant to Item 0800-0000 of section 2 of Chapter 140 of the Acts of 2024 (FY25 GAA), the
following provisions thereof are addressed in the POST Commission’s 2024 Annual Report:
“. . . provided, that not later than March 14, 2025, the commission
shall submit a report to the house and senate committees on ways and
means that shall include, but not be limited to: (i) the commission's
current caseload for fiscal year 2025; (ii) the number of complaints
concerning police officer conduct received by the commission; (iii)
patterns of unprofessional police conduct identified by the
commission; and (iv) the number of police officers suspended by the
commission and the reason for said suspension . . .”
Please note that only provision (iii) is not specifically addressed in the annual report, as
sufficient data is not yet available. Nevertheless, POST will report on patterns of
unprofessional police conduct as soon as data becomes available and is properly analyzed.
Each of the remaining three provisions are assigned to the relevant page numbers of the report,
as follows: Page 13 for provision (i); Page 13 for provision (ii); and, Pages 18-19 for provision
(iv).
The aforementioned annual report was electronically filed per M.G.L. ch. 6, § 222.
Respectfully,
Eric Rebello-Pradas
