Executive Summary
The Fiscal Year 2024 Massachusetts Budget Act (Act) included the provided $15 million in operating funds
for Regional Transit Authorities (RTAs) available as grants for means-tested, discounted, or fare-free pilot
programs. Based on the requirements of the Act, the Massachusetts Department of Transportation
(MassDOT) Rail & Transit Division (RTD) conducted a competitive application process to distribute the
available funding to RTAs. A joint proposal from fourteen of the fifteen RTAs was selected for award, as
was a second application from CCRTA. Known as the Try Transit 2.0 program, the joint proposal from the
fourteen RTAs met the grant requirements by demonstrating increased ridership by removing economic
barriers for low-income individuals to use public transit. Furthermore, the pilot outlined in the joint
proposal enabled the RTAs to attract new low-income customers and demonstrate how transit may work
for them. CCRTA’s proposal stressed the need to provide free transit to older adults (defined as people
over the age of 60) and people with disabilities.
In FY23, the Massachusetts’s RTAs participated in a separate fare free pilot program during the 2022
Holiday Season, while three RTAs operated with permanent fare free service. Unlike the FY23 Try Transit
fare free pilot program which operated for about one month over the November/December holiday
period, Try Transit 2.0 supported the RTAs operation of fare free pilot programs at any time during the
FY24 fiscal year. Furthermore, under Try Transit 2.0, RTAs had the flexibility to determine the duration of
fare free pilots, with some programs lasting a month, and others lasting for a several month period. In
some cases, FY24 Try Transit 2.0 funding was even used to support the continuation of pilot programs
into FY25, though the primary focus of this report is on the impacts of the program funding during FY24
only, since the data for continuing operations is not yet available.
Fare free transportation may increase ridership and promote equity by providing additional benefits to
low-income individuals, youth and students, secure easier access to school and to jobs, eliminate the
need to purchases a pass or find cash for a fare, streamline the boarding process, and assist in the
reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and congestion. Fare free service can reduce conflicts between
passengers and operators since drivers would no longer be required to enforce fare payment policy. In
2024, administrators of multiple RTAs attributed a reduction of passenger/driver conflict to the
introduction and expansion of fare free service. Total ridership across all modes of service (i.e., fixed
route, demand response, demand taxi, and commuter bus) increased from FY23 to FY24 among all RTAs.
While total ridership increased during this time period, only six RTAs exceeded pre-pandemic FY19
ridership. Each RTA also reported fixed route ridership in FY24 that exceeded FY23 figures, thus showing a
positive correlation between fare free service and transit ridership. Fixed route ridership is below FY19
figures for all but five RTAs. Three of these five RTAs (FRTA, MeVa, and WRTA) have offered fare free fixed
route service prior to the launch of the FY23 and FY24 Try Transit programs, thus showing not only a
positive correlation between fare free service and ridership but also a positive correlation between
ridership and the duration of fare free pilot programs.
In FY25, an additional $30 million of fare free funding was provided by the legislature. Thirteen of the
fifteen RTAs have applied to continue providing fare free service in the new fiscal year. The continuation
of fare free service among most RTAs will allow for more data collection and an even more robust analysis
on the impacts of the provision of fare free transit. Such future analyses would provide better
understanding of the long-term impact of fare free service and post the COVID era downturn.

Introduction
Under Section 1596-2406 of the Fiscal Year 2024 Massachusetts Budget Act, Chapter 28 of the Acts of
2023, MassDOT RTD was directed to award up to $15 million in operating funds to RTAs on grants for
fare-free pilot programs. The Act requires that MassDOT shall oversee the distribution of said grants and
shall establish grant criteria including, but not limited to, the prioritization of:
a) Opportunities for increased ridership.
b) Increased service accessibility to low-income individuals.
The Act further requires that said grants be distributed in a geographically equitable manner and that
MassDOT RTD submit a report to the joint committee on transportation and the house and senate
committees on ways and means including, but not limited to:

Section 2:
1. the grant criteria used by MassDOT RTD,

Section 3:
2. a list of grant applicants,

Section 4:
3. a list of successful grant applicants,

Section 5:
4. summaries of successful proposals,

Section 6:
5. ridership and fare data for such pilot programs, and

Section 7:
6. details on the mechanisms being utilized to track ridership and fare data for said pilot
programs.
In compliance with the requirements of the Act, MassDOT RTD submitted a status report on the grant
program, detailing the grant process (requirements b1 – b4). At the time of submittal, there was no data
on ridership and fares available in order to meet requirements b5 and b6. As such, MassDOT RTD submits
this final report to address the remaining requirements.
Background
In Massachusetts, there are fifteen RTAs outside of the Greater Boston Area (Figure 1). Each RTA is locally
governed by an Advisory Board and provides a combination of fixed route and demand response transit
services to their member communities. Demand response service is inclusive of the complementary
paratransit services that are mandated by the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), requiring that
comparable service be provided to eligible persons within ¾ mile of a fixed route. Some RTAs opt to
provide additional modes of service, including demand taxi and commuter bus. All these services, while
managed by the RTA’s administrative staff, are provided through contracted operators. In FY2024, a total
of 26,994,459 UPT were provided by RTAs, across all modes of service. This includes a total of 24,842,385
fixed route UPT, 1,753,689 demand response UPT, 397,827 demand taxi UTP, and 558 commuter bus
UPT.

Figure 1: Map of RTA service areas in Massachusetts, including the Massachusetts Bay Transportation
Authority (MBTA)
Although they have similar goals, the RTAs serve diverse areas throughout Massachusetts, including rural
areas, suburbs, colleges and universities, Gateway Cities, small urbanized areas, and areas where
ridership is strongly affected by seasonal tourism. While some RTAs are predominantly defined by their
seasonal tourism or college and university services, all RTAs also provide essential workforce and
commuter trips, as well as medical and shopping trips for those without access to a car including elderly
and disabled riders. RTAs are flexible and innovative in meeting the needs of their customers.
The RTAs are funded through five main sources of revenue: directly generated revenue, farebox revenue
local assessments, state funding, and Federal funding (Figure 2). Directly generated revenue is inclusive of
own-source revenues generated from advertising, parking, and/or rental agreements. Local assessments
consist of local contributions for service from the RTA’s member communities and are based on the “loss”
(operating cost minus revenue) attributable to the service provided for each town or city. The
Commonwealth provides the RTAs with state operating funds in the form of State Contract Assistance
(SCA), which is passed through MassDOT. SCA is distributed by MassDOT RTD among the RTAs using a
long-standing allocation formula based on ridership. Any new funding received from the state over the
prior fiscal year is allocated based on a second formula that incorporates ridership, population, and
service area. Federal funding is also distributed based on formula but distributed nationally through
either the Section 5307 program for urbanized areas or the Section 5311 program for rural areas. All
7
funding apportioned by the Federal Government to an urbanized area (UZA) or a rural area is then
subject to additional split agreements negotiated by the agencies operating within each defined region.
Lastly, farebox revenue is generated through the collection of fares from riders. Each RTA has their own
advisory board approved fare policy that dictates the fare structure for each individual system.

Successful Grant Applicants
RTD recommended that both the Try Transit 2.0 grant and CCRTA’s separate proposal be selected for
awards as proposed (Table 2). Both proposals met the grant requirements by demonstrating the
proposed pilot could result in increased ridership by removing barriers for low-income individuals to use
public transit and by reducing logistical hurdles to both the public and the transit agencies that administer
the service. The proposals also prioritize low-income individuals, as the majority of current or potential
RTA riders are riding out of necessity. Furthermore, the pilot will enable the RTAs to attract new low-
income customers and demonstrate how transit may work for them. For the Try Transit 2.0 application,
given the differences among the RTAs for program length, timing and scope, each RTA is receiving the
following award amounts:
RTA Award Amount
BAT $1,395,187
BRTA $179,041
CATA $89,156
FRTA $15,000
GATRA $97,673

RTA Fare Free Profiles
BAT
BAT used its FY24 Try Transit 2.0 grant to run free service starting on December 1, 2023. Pending
additional grant funding, they plan on extending fare free services until September 30, 2025, though they
are not planning on operating indefinite fare free service at this time. Under BAT’s program, all fixed
route and paratransit services (though not microtransit) are free seven days a week.
BRTA
BRTA has used their FY24 Try Transit 2.0 grant to run fare free service on all fixed route and paratransit
for five weeks around the holidays (November 24-December 31) and for a nine-week summer season
(June 1-July 31), in honor of their fiftieth anniversary. During this period, BRTA also had to reconfigure
routes and reduce service on two routes due to a lack of operators with commercial driver’s licenses.
10
While BRTA considered its pilot program to be successful, and has applied for FY25 Try Transit funding, it
currently does not plan on operating fare free service indefinitely.
CATA
CATA used its FY24 Try Transit 2.0 grant to provide fare free service from November 24-December 31,

Section 8:
2023. While fares all fixed route and paratransit routes were waived, CATA still charged for the CATA on-
demand microtransit services. CATA is open to waiving fares as long as it remains grant funded but is
unlikely to go fare free indefinitely without a set source of income.
CCRTA
CCRTA applied separately from the other fourteen RTAs for the FY24 Fare Free funding in order to expand
its existing program offering free fares specifically to older adults. CCRTA began offering fare free services
on its fixed routes to Older Adults (defined as 60 or older) on Wednesday in June of 2017. In February of
2024, they expanded this program to provide free service every day on fixed route services for older
adults and people with disabilities. They have also provided free fares for the general public every Friday
since 2021, which will continue until December 2024.
FRTA
FRTA has been offering fare free fixed route services since March 2020. Using money from the FY24 Try
Transit 2.0 grant, they added free demand-response services for older adults (defined as 60 and older)
between November 20, 2023, and December 31, 2023. During this time period, FRTA continued to charge
for its microtransit service, known as FRTA Access, that is open to the general public. They do not plan to
operate fare free demand response service indefinitely at this time.
GATRA
In FY24, GATRA offered fare free fixed route and ADA required paratransit services from November 24,
2023, to December 31, 2023, under the Try Transit 2.0 grant. Microtransit services were not free during
this time. GATRA will also be using FY24 Try Transit 2.0 funding to operate fare free service fixed route
and ADA required paratransit service from November 29, 2024-December 31, 2024.
LRTA
In FY24, LRTA offered free services on all fixed route and paratransit from December 1, 2023, to
December 31, 2023, and again from July 1-July 31, 2024, under the Try Transit 2.0 grant. LRTA is exploring
piloting longer-term fare free service if grant funding remains available.
MART
In FY24, MART provided free fare services on all fixed route and paratransit starting on January 1, 2024,
under the Try Transit 2.0 grant. While they had originally planned to conclude the program in June 2024,
they applied for and received additional grant funding that allowed them to continue the program
indefinitely. As a part of establishing the fare free program, MART reached out to several non-
governmental organizations, nonprofits and municipalities, as well as a complete comprehensive
operation analysis to streamline their services. This report only covers fare free service within FY24.
MeVa
MeVa has offered fare free services on all fixed route and paratransit services since March 2022. While
they originally used COVID Relief funding, MeVa now funds their fare free services using MassDOT grant
money, most recently from the Try Transit 2.0 grant. Alongside cutting fares in 2022, they improved
11
services by decreasing headways in Lawrence and Haverhill, extending hours and rebranding busses and
facilities. MeVa separately commissioned a firm to do a study on the effects of fare free in the area and
conducted extensive public outreach; this study was not funded by MassDOT.
MWRTA
In FY24, MWRTA offered free fare fixed route and paratransit services from January 2024 to August 31,
2024, under the Try Transit 2.0 grant. While they had initially planned on waiving fares only through
March, additional funding allowed them to continue the pilot through August. They plan on continuing
the program for all of FY25, though not indefinitely. MWRTA also piloted waiving fares on their
microtransit service, Catch Connect, for the summer of 2024. During FY24, MWRTA required riders to use
free cards distributed by drivers to receive free fares. This was intended to facilitate an easier transition
back to paying fares but plans on cutting this requirement during FY25. During the free fare period,
MWRTA also increased frequency of service and added evening service. MWRTA’s Catch Connect service
was also expanded to now serve the Town of Hunsdon on weekdays.
NRTA
NRTA used funding from the FY24 Try Transit 2.0 grant to offer fare free fixed route and paratransit
services from April to August 2024. As a result of the increased ridership associated with fare free service,
NRTA added additional paratransit vehicles. NRTA is considering offering fare free service indefinitely if
grant funding remains available.
PVTA
In FY24, PVTA offered fare free fixed route and paratransit services for the holiday season (November 24-
December 31, 2023) and for the months of June, July and August 2024 under the Try Transit 2.0 grant.
From January to May 2024, PVTA offered free fares on weekends for all riders and free fares for students
18 and under after 3 pm. For June, July and August, all fixed route and paratransit (except the intercity
B79 route) was once again fare free. PVTA is not currently planning on offering free fares indefinitely and
sees it more as a ridership tool in a backdrop where fares are collected. At the time of the pilot, PVTA also
added service to several routes.
SRTA
SRTA offered fare free fixed route and paratransit service from January 1-June 30, 2024, under the Try
Transit 2.0 grant. SRTA is opened to the possibility of providing fare free service indefinitely if grant
funding remains available. In January of 2024, SRTA also added Sunday service, while ridership increases
also necessitated additional vehicles on routes serving schools.
VTA
In FY24, VTA offered free fares on all fixed route and paratransit from November 24, 2023, to March, 31
2024 under the Try Transit 2.0 grant. VTA also continues to explore fare systems like fare capping and
transitioning away from cash in the future but is hesitant to make fares free for all riders who may have
the means to pay.
WRTA
WRTA has been offering fare free services since July 1, 2023, and utilized the Try Transit 2.0 to continue
to support these services. While their original pilot is slated to end on June 30, 2025, they’re hoping to go
fare free indefinitely, especially in light of their recent customer satisfaction survey which indicated that
riders on a fixed income placed high importance on the program.
12
Data Collection
Quantitative data on fares and ridership was extrapolated from the monthly Service Data Reports
submitted by the RTAs as required by the FY24-FY25 State Contract Assistance (SCA) Performance MOUs.
From each RTA’s report, raw monthly totals for the metrics of UPT, fare revenue generated, and FRR were
collected by mode of service. ADA paratransit data is collected under the “Demand Response” mode,
which is also inclusive of any demand responsive services provided “beyond” the requirements of the
ADA and of microtransit services. Some RTAs that provided additional paratransit services during this time
period chose to continue to collect fares for these services, a decision that varied RTA to RTA and was
dependent on the type of service provided. As a result, ridership and fare data were analyzed for fixed
route or systemwide only for this report.
In addition, each RTA was required to submit a one-time progress report that provided a qualitative
assessment of the pilot program. Using a short eleven (11) question survey, information was collected on
any operational improvements or challenges observed by RTA staff during the pilot, customer feedback
received, and sample advertising materials. See Appendix – RTA Try Transit 2.0 Public Relations & Social
Media Examples for examples of RTA advertising and public relations in advance of and during the Try
Transit program.
RTAs collect ridership data through several methodologies. At the most basic level, ridership counts are
collected manually by bus drivers through a hand-held unit. More sophisticated data collection methods
use either electronic fareboxes or automatic passenger counters (APCs), or a combination thereof, to
measure ridership, which is usually then calibrated by manual counts. When collecting fares, electronic
fareboxes record boardings when a passenger taps their smart card or, when paying in cash, the bus
operator presses a button to indicate a boarding. APCs automatically record passenger boardings and
alightings using a variety of techniques, such as an infrared beam or pressure sensitive mats.
Data Analysis
Unlike the FY23 Try Transit fare free pilot program which generally ran from November 25, 2022, to
December 31, 2022, the FY24 Try Transit program allowed RTAs to use funding for pilots conducted
throughout FY24, and in some cases the duration of the FY24 Try Transit 2.0 pilots continued into FY25.
This report only includes data collected before or during FY24, since FY25 data is not yet available. Each
RTA’s FY24 Try Transit 2.0 program is a little bit different from the next, with some RTAs opting for short
six weeklong pilot programs between Thanksgiving and New Year’s Eve, while others opted for six-month
long programs in the winter or summer of 2024. A few RTAs chose to split up their fare free pilot
program. BRTA, for example, offered fare free service approximately five weeks in late November and
December of 2023 and then a second two-month offering in June and July of 2024. CCRTA, which applied
for funding separately, expanded existing fare free service, which had previously been targeted towards
older adults, to include people with disabilities. Because data is submitted to RTD on a monthly basis, and
is not disaggregated into weeks or days, the analysis presented in this report focuses on annual and
monthly data. Additionally, the analysis focuses on the statewide impact of the pilot program. Individual
analyses of each RTA’s performance during the pilot can be provided upon request.
The various fare free pilot programs can be broken into five broad categories. As each RTA set the
parameters of their own pilot programs, the programs are not perfect matches for the categories
provided. The categories are as follows:
• Long Term/Permanent Fare Free Service: This category includes RTAs that have been providing
fully fare free fixed route service prior to receiving FY24 funding through Try Transit 2.0. FRTA and
13
WRTA began offering systemwide fixed route fare free service in March 2020 at the start of the
COVID 19 pandemic. MeVa began offering system wide fixed route service in March 2022, though
a City of Lawrance, MA funded program began providing fare free service on three routes-based
routes beginning on September 9, 2019. These RTAs intend to maintain fare free service once
FY24 pilot funding is depleted through other funding sources, as long as these funding sources
are available. In the case of some of these RTA (FRTA), FY24 Try Transit 2.0 funding was used only
to provide fare free funding to demand response service that typically changes fares.
• Medium Term, Fare Free Service: This category describes RTAs that offered extensive fixed route
fare free service using FY24 Try Transit 2.0 funding. In some cases, these fare free programs will
be using FY24 Try Transit funding to pay for fare free fixed route service into FY25. Unlike the
“Long Term/Permanent Fare Free” grouping, these RTAs were not providing fare free fixed route
service (apart from during the height of the COVID 19 Pandemic and during the FY23 Try Transit
Program) prior to receiving FY24 funding. RTAs included in this category are BAT, MART, MWRTA,
and SRTA. Please note that MWRTA still required riders to tap their fare payment card to ride for
free, even though fare cards were not charged. Fare payment cards were available upon request
on all MWRTA fixed route vehicles. Riders who did not want to use a fare card were required to
pay the full fare using cash.
• Short Term/Holiday Season Fare Free Service: This mainly focused on providing fixed route fare
free service using FY24 Try Transit 2.0 service around the holiday season, thus operating fare free
pilot programs strongly reminiscent of the FY23 Try Transit Fare Free pilot program. BRTA, CATA,
GATRA, and LRTA operated such fare free service. Please note that BRTA provided a second one-
month fare free pilot program in June, while LRTA ran a second fare free pilot program in July
(within FY25 but funding with FY24 money). GATRA will also be using FY24 funding to operate a
fare free pilot program between November 29, 2024, and December 31, 2024, within FY25.
• Demographic Focused Fare Free Service: RTAs in this category focused on providing fare free
service to certain groups of people rather than across the board fare free service. This grouping
would include CCRTA fare free pilot program starting in February of 2024, which focused on
providing fare free fixed route service to seniors (over the age of 60) and peoples with disabilities
on fixed route service on all days of operation. Fare free service was extended to all fixed route
passengers on Fridays. Please note that prior to February of 2024, CCRTA was offering free fixed
route service only to seniors on Wednesdays and to the general public on Fridays. PVTA’s fare
free pilot program focused on offering fare free service to students after 3PM, as well as fare free
service to the public during the months of December and June, and on weekends during the
months of January, February, March, April, and May.
• Seasonal Fare Free Service: The populations of Martha’s Vineyard and Nantucket vary based on
the season, increasing in the summer and decreasing in the winter. NRTA began its FY24 Fare
Free Pilot at the start of FY24 Q3 (April 1st) and continued the pilot through the end of FY25 Q1
(September 30th), with interest in continuing the pilot further depending on available funding.
NRTA’s fare free pilot program corresponds with the busy season on Nantucket. VTA began its
FY24 Fare Free Pilot on November 24, 2023. This fare free pilot continued until the end of FY24
Q3 (March 31st), thus VTA concentrated its pilot program on the Island’s off season.
Fixed Route Ridership
All RTAs experienced an increase in total annual fixed route ridership (UPT) in FY24 when compared with
total fixed route ridership in FY20, FY21, FY22, and FY23 (Figure 3). Only five of the fifteen RTAs recorded
14
total annual FY24 fixed route ridership that exceeded FY19 total annual fixed route ridership (Figure 4).
FY19 was both the last full fiscal year prior to the COVID-19 pandemic and the last full fiscal year prior to
the adoption of system wide fare free fixed route service by some RTAs. Fare free service in FY19 was
limited to CCRTA and PVTA offering fare free service to seniors (defined as people 60 years old or older)
on Wednesday or Tuesday respectively.
Three of the five RTAs that have seen fixed route ridership exceed FY19 levels, FRTA, MeVa, and WRTA,
offered system wide fare free service since at least March 2022. Annual total fixed route ridership
increased for FRTA, MeVa, and WRTA by 1.19%, 45.47%, and 51.53%, respectively, from FY19 to FY24.
From FY23 to FY24 FRTA, MeVa, and WRTA’s annual total fixed route ridership has increased respectively
by 38.84%, 58.94%, and 16.02%. The fact that three RTAs that have been operating fare free continuously
since at least FY22 have all exceeded FY19 ridership indicates the effectiveness fare free service has in
generating ridership over a multiyear period of time.
The two remaining RTAs that recorded more fixed route UPT in FY24 than in FY19 are BRTA and SRTA.
BRTA has been categorized as offering “Short Term/Holiday Season” in FY24, with fare free fixed route
service being provided from late November 2023 through the end of December 2023, and again from the
start of June 2024 through the end of July 2024. BRTA’s total annual fixed route ridership increased by

Section 9:
8.39% from FY19 through FY24. From FY23 through FY24, BRTA’s total annual ridership increased by

Section 10:
10.95%. Based on its approach to Fare Free fixed route service in FY24, SRTA falls into the “Medium
Term” category. SRTA started its fixed route fare free pilot program at the start of January 2024 and plans
to continue fare free service indefinitely, provided funds are made available. SRTA’s total annual fixed
route ridership increased by 2.02% from FY19 through FY24, while SRTA’s total annual fixed route
ridership increased by 19.01% from FY23 through FY24.

Total fixed route UPT across all RTAs has been increasing since the pandemic era low in FY21. In FY24, a
total of 24,842385 fixed route UPT were made across all RTAs, or an 18.87% increase from FY23. Total
UPT across all RTAs is 6.78% below FY19 totals (Figure 5).

To understand ridership, RTAs were broken into the five groups described above. Average annual
ridership for each group was then taken by calculating the total annual ridership for each RTA in each
respective cohort and then divided each groups total by the number of RTAs in each group.
Among the five groups, the RTAs that make up the “Long Term/Permanent Fare Free Service” group had
an average percent fixed route ridership increase of 29.61% from FY23 to FY24. The average percent
change of UPT among the RTAs that make up the “Medium Term, Fare Free Service” was an increase of

Section 34:
25.75% from FY23 to FY24. Among the RTAs that make up the “Short Term/Holiday Season Fare Free
Service,” average percent change in annual fixed route ridership increased by 16.36% from FY23 to FY24,
while among the RTAs included in the “Demographic Focused Fare Free Service,” average percent change
in annual fixed route ridership increased by 7.36% during this time period. Lastly, among the RTAs in the
“Seasonal Fare Free Service,” average percent change in annual fixed route ridership increased by 15.69%
from FY23 to FY24 (Figure 6).

Figure 6: Average Percent Change in Annual Fixed Route Ridership by Group, FY23 to FY24
The RTAs that make up the “Long Term/Permanent Fare Free Service” group saw an average percent
increase in annual fixed route ridership by 47.90% from FY19 to FY24. Average percent change in annual
fixed route ridership among the RTAs that form the “Medium Term, Fare Free Service” decreased by

Section 48:
8.03% from FY19 to FY24. Among the RTAs that make up the “Short Term/Holiday Season Fare Free
Service,” average percent change in annual fixed route ridership decreased by 26.22% from FY19 to FY24,
while average percent change in annual fixed route ridership among the RTAs included in the
“Demographic focused Fare Free Service” decreased by 25.34% during the same period. Lastly, average
percent change in annual fixed route ridership among the RTAs in the “Seasonal Fare Free Service”
decreased by 17.47% (Figure 7). Though the change in average precent ridership between FY23 and FY24
indicates that the elimination of fixed route transit fares led to some degree of ridership increase, the
change between FY19 and FY24 demonstrates a positive correlation between the duration of fare free
transit and ridership change. The “Long Term” cohort is the only grouping that’s FY24 average ridership
17
exceeded that of FY19. Though the “Medium Term” FY24 average ridership was still below the FY19
average ridership, but far closer pre-pandemic recovery than the remaining three groups.

Long Term Medium Term Short Term Demographic Focused Seasonal
Figure 7: Average Percent Fixed Route Ridership by Group, FY19 to FY24
The FY24 total monthly fixed route ridership of all RTAs exceeded those of FY23 (Figure 8). In general, the
ebb and flow of ridership during this period is impacted by a number of seasonal factors, particularly for
systems whose ridership has a high tourist and/or student base. December is typically a low ridership
month, for example, while January reported the lowest total ridership in both FY23 and FY24. In FY23 and
FY24, the month with the most total fixed route ridership was May. The month of December is an
interesting point of comparison since in FY23, fourteen of the fifteen RTAs operated fare free systemwide
fixed route service (CCRTA operated fare free fixed route for seniors on Wednesday and for the public on
Fridays and Saturdays). In December of FY24 only ten of the fifteen RTAs operated system wide fare free
fixed route service, yet the total fixed route UPT increased by 14.56% from FY23. Fixed Route fare free
ridership increased by 45.77% between December FY22, when only three RTAs operated systemwide
fixed route fare free service, and December FY24. Thus, the introduction of fare free fixed route service
across most RTAs in December of FY23, and again in December FY24, has likely contributed to this
increase. In December FY24, the total fixed route UPT is 4.75% above December FY20 totals (December
FY20 being just prior to the start of the COVID 19 pandemic) and 3.28% below the total fixed route UPT in
FY19 (Figure 9).

Figure 10: Total Annual “Long Term” Ridership from FY19 to FY24
It is worth noting that all four RTAs in “Medium Term, Fare Free Service” cohort provided fare free fixed
route service in the second half of FY24. BAT provided fare free service for the month of December and
thus was the only RTA in this cohort that provided fare free fixed route service in the first half of FY24.
Since the bulk of the “Medium Term, Fare Free Service” was provided between January 2024 and June
2024, it is thus worth exploring how total fixed route ridership for the second half of FY24 compares with
Q3 and Q4 of FY23 and pre-COVID Q3 and Q4 FY19 figures.
Ridership recovery within the medium-term group was stronger in the second half of FY24 when fixed
route services was free, further indicating that the introduction of fare free service corresponded with an
increase in ridership. During the second half of FY24, when fixed route ridership across “Medium Term”
RTAs was fare free, total fixed route ridership was up 42.70% from the second half of FY23, when none of
the RTAs in this cohort were providing fare free service. This was an increase from 2,404,028 fixed route
UPT during the second half of FY23 to 3,430,566 fixed route UPT during the second half of FY24 Total
fixed route ridership also increased by 9.68% between the second half of FY19 and FY24, an increased
from 3,127,925 UPT (Figure 11). Total fixed route ridership increased by a mere 25.74% between the
entirety of FY23 and FY24, from 4,702,511 fixed route UPT to 5,912,899 fixed route UPT. This smaller
percent increase in fixed route ridership, when comparing the entirety of FY23 and FY24 indicates that
the introduction of fare free fixed route service in the second half of FY24, was a driving factor behind the
increase. Total fixed route ridership across the entirety of FY24 is still 8.03% below total fixed route
ridership for the entirety of FY19, when a total of 6,429,174 UPT were made, thus indicating that the
introduction of fare free service has at least helped ridership during the second half of FY24 recover from
the pandemic. (Figure 12)

As was the case with most RTAs in FY23, in FY24 the four RTAs (BRTA, CATA, GATRA, and LRTA) included
in the “Short Term/Holiday Season Fare Free Service” group concentrated much of their collective efforts
on operating fare free fixed route service during the month of December. Please note that BRTA also
operated fare free fixed route service at the end of November 2023 (FY24) as well as in June and July of
21
2024; CATA operated fare free fixed route service at the end of November 2023 (FY24); GATRA operated
fare free fixed route at the end of November, 2023 (FY24) and plans to use FY24 Try Transit funding to
operate fare free fixed route service from November 29, 2024-December 31, 2024.
In FY24, total fixed route annual ridership among the four RTAs included in the “Short Term” group
equaled 2,052,646 an increase of 16.36% from this cohort’s total FY23 ridership of 1,764,035. Total
annual ridership increased by 23.55% from FY22, when a total of 1,661,431 fixed route UPT were made
among the RTAs in the “Short Term” group. From FY19, when total annual fixed route UPT equaled
2,782,120, total FY24 fixed route ridership decreased by 26.22%.
The FY24 fixed route total ridership among the “Short Term” RTAs for the month of December equaled
174,391. This marks a 13.73% increase from December of FY23, when the total equaled 153,339. All four
of these RTAs operated fare free fixed route service in December of FY23. Fixed route Ridership in
December of FY24 increased by 25.89% from December of FY22, when no RTA in the “Short Term” Group
was offering fare free fixed route service. Though such an increase could be in part due to the post
pandemic economic recovery, this also indicates a positive correlation between fare free service and
ridership. December of FY22 fixed route ridership equaled 1,38,521. December FY24 fixed route ridership
is 15.52% below December of FY19, when a total of 206,427 fixed route UPT were made (Figure 13).

Figure 13: “Short Term” Percent Total Ridership Change between Full and December FY24 vs Full and

December and January tend to be low ridership months across many RTAs, with the total fixed route UPT
within the “Short Term” group declining from 174,391 in December of FY24 by 3.84% to 167,694 in
January of FY24, after all Holiday Season fare free pilot programs in the short-term group ended. In FY22,
when no fare free service was being offered by any of the RTAs in the “Short Term” cohort, the number
of total fixed route unlike passenger trips declined by 18.21% between December and January. The total
fixed route UPT increased by 6.89% between December and January of FY19. Ultimately, though it would
be interesting to know if temporary fare free service has a positive effect on ridership once fares are
22
reinstituted, the data within the “Short Term” group is inconclusive. The larger drop in ridership between
December and January FY22, for example, may be related to changes in the COVID infection rate that was
prevalent in the winter of calendar year 2021/2022, and thus it is impossible to conclude that the smaller
decline between December of FY24 and January of FY24 was the result of holiday season fare free pilot
programs.
CCRTA and PVTA presented a slightly different approach to fare free funding than the RTAs that make up
the “Long Term,” “Medium Term,” and “Short Term” Groups. CCRTA and PVTA focused on providing fare
free service for certain demographic groups. CCRTA was focused on maximizing it’s fare free efforts on
providing free service to seniors and people with disability across fixed route service on all days of
operation. CCRTA began providing fare free service for older adults (defined as people over the age of 60)
in June 2017. Aside from a brief period of system wide fixed route service to people of all ages during the
height of the COVID 19 Pandemic (from March 2020-July, 2020), CCRTA has not offered long periods
programs of fixed route service but has instead focused on the fare free service to older adults on
Wednesdays, and at then at start of FY2022, fare free fixed route service to the general public on Fridays.
Through the FY23 Try Transit Program, CCRTA also provided fixed route fare free service to the general
public on Saturdays from November 25, 2022, through December 31, 2022. CCRTA applied to FY24 Try
Transit Funding separately from the other fourteen RTAs, and on February 1, 2024, began a program of
providing Fare Free fixed route service to older adults and people with disabilities (people with disabilities
were previously excluded from the previous fare free service for older adults’ program) every day that
service operates. The fixed route fare free Friday’s program, that is opened to the general public, was
extended through the end of the 2024 calendar year. CCRTA’s long term goal is to end the fare free Friday
program to the general public at the end of the December 2024 but continue providing fare free fixed
route service for seniors and people with disabilities, during all days of operations, indefinitely.
From FY23 to FY24, total ridership increased by 5.67%, from 556,199 fixed route UPT in total for FY23, to
587,716 fixed route UPT in total at the end of FY24. A total of 233,778 unlinked fixed route passenger
trips between February and June of FY24, when CCRTA’s fare free program for older adults was extend to
people with disabilities and to all days of operation. This marks a 15.13% increase from the same time
period during FY23, when a total of 203,047 fixed route UPT were made.
While total annual CCRTA fixed route ridership in FY24 is 2.88% below FY23 annual fixed route ridership,
the total ridership between February and June in FY24 exceeds ridership during that same period in FY19
by 9.91%. FY19 fixed route ridership between February and June totaled 212,695 UPT (Figure 14).
In December of FY23, when fare free fixed route Friday and Saturday service was provided to the general
public (in addition to fare free fixed route Wednesday service to older adults), a total of 36,124 fixed
route UPT were recorded. This was 15.28% above December FY19 ridership when no fare free service to
the general public was offered. In December FY24, fare free service to the general public was only
provided on Friday, and the total fixed route ridership for the month equaled 32,245, as 10.74%
reduction from December of FY23 (Figure 15).

Like CCRTA, PVTAs approach to fare free transit was focused on providing free service to older adults
(defined over 60) as well as to students, at certain days of the week and certain times of the day. Unlike
CCRTA, PVTA also used FY23 and FY24 Try Transit funding to provide some system wide fixed route fare
free service over the course of several weeks. PVTAs fare free approach thus resembles a combination of
demographic approach of CCRTA and the holiday and summer fare free approach of the “Short Term”
group.
24
Since July of FY19, PVTA has offered fare free services to older adults on Tuesdays across all fixed route
service except the B79 Amherst-Worcester route. Originally a two-year pilot, this program was extended
starting July 1, 2021. As part of the FY23 Try Transit fare free pilot program, PVTA provided fare free fixed
route service for the month of December. FY24 Try Transit funding contributed to fare free fixed route
service across the PVTA network (excluding Route B79) to all riders from November 24, 2023-December
31, 2023, and again from June 1, 2024-August 31, 2024. PVTAs FY24 Try Transit pilot program also
included an expansion of its demographical to fare free service. From January 1, 2024, to May 31, 2024,
students 18 years old and under, with valid student ideas, could ride all fixed route service (excluding
route B79) after 3PM. All fixed route weekend service (excluding route B79) was also free during this time
period.
A total of 7,420,128 fixed route UPT were made, across the PVTA system, this marks an increase of 7.49%
from FY23, when a total of 6,902,789 fixed route UPT were made, but a 26.68% decrease from FY19
when a total of 10,120,238 UPT were made. A total of 3,099,617 fixed route UPT were made between
during and between January and May of FY24, a 2.09% increase from the same time period in FY23, when
a total of 3,036,109 fixed route UPT were recorded. The total number of UPT made during the January-
May time period in FY24 is 29.76% down from the same time period in FY19, when a total of a total of
4,350,806 UPT were recorded (Figure 16).

of those fiscal years. PVTA did not offer fare free fixed route service during December FY22 (apart for fare
free service for older adults on Tuesday) when a total of 467,902 fixed route unlinked passenger trips
were recorded, thus ridership increased by 44.69% from December FY22 to December FY24. From
December FY19, when a total of 814,699 fixed route passenger trips were recorded to December FY24,
fixed route ridership declined by 16.90% (Figure 17).

The final category is the “Seasonal Fare Free Service” group which consists of NRTA and VTA. NRTA and
VTA respectively serve the islands of Nantucket and Martha’s Vineyard. Both islands are only accessible
by boat or airplane and the only way a resident or visitor can bring a car to these islands is by transporting
it on a ferry. Martha’s Vineyard and Nantucket are both seasonal destinations, the populations of both
islands’ balloons during the summer months and declines during the long off season which makes up the
bulk of the year.
NRTA chose to concentrate its FY24 fare free service in the Spring and Summer, when the FY24 Try
Transit fare free pilot program was scheduled to run from April through September. VTA concentrated it’s
fare free service during the winter of FY24, when seasonal residents and tourist are away and the
majority of the people on Martha’s Vineyard are full time residents. By concentrating its fare free pilot
program to the winter, VTA’s administration hopes fare free service would provide to relief to year-round
residents who tend to be less affluent than seasonal residents and visitors. VTA’s FY24 pilot program ran
from November 24, 2023 (in FY24) through March 31, 2024.
In FY24, NRTA recorded 282,031 fixed route UPT, up 16.62% from FY23 when 241,842 fixed route UPT
were recorded but down 4.41% from FY19, when 295,056 UPT were recorded. Comparing the fourth
quarter of FY24, when 102,189 fixed route UPT were recorded and when NRTA was providing fare free
service, ridership was up 78.43% from the 57,272 fixed route UPT made during Q4 of FY23, when no fare
free fixed route service was offered. Q4 FY24 fixed route ridership also exceeded Q4 FY19 fixed route
ridership figures by 64.19%. Fixed route ridership in Q4 FY19 equaled 62,239 UPT (Figure 19).

Figure 19: NRTA Percent Change in Ridership from FY19 and FY23 to FY24
In FY24, VTA’s total fixed route ridership equaled 1,038,650 UPT, an increase of 15.44% from FY23, when
a total of 899,699 fixed route UPT was recoded. From December through March in FY24, during VTA’s
fare free pilot program, a total of 139,754 UPT were recorded. This is an increase of 29.91% increase from
the same period in FY23, when a total of 107,574 UPT were recorded and the FY23 Try Transit fare free
pilot program was limited to just the month of December.
27
While fixed route ridership decreased from 1,305,195 UPT, or 20.42% between FY19 and FY24, ridership
was up by 24.60% during the December through March period in FY24 compared to that same period in
FY19, when a total of 112,165 UPT was recoded (Figure 20). Comparing April of FY24, after VTA’s fare free
pilot program ended, ridership was up 16.33%, an increase from 42,463 fixed route UPT in FY23 to 49,397
fixed route UPT in FY24. April FY24’s ridership is 24.60% above April FY19 ridership of 44,318 fixed route
UPT.
This indicates that fare free service might, at least temporarily, boost ridership after pilot programs ends.
That said, by June of FY24, ridership was 9.20% below FY23 numbers, a decrease of 154,556 fixed route
UPT in June of FY23 to 140,338 fixed route UPT in June of FY24. June of FY24 recorded 18.57% fewer
fixed route UPT than June of FY19, when 172,349% fixed route UPT were recorded (Figure 21). It is
difficult to determine if the fare free pilot program had lingering effects that boosted ridership in April of
FY24 and subsided by June, or if other factors contributed. This is especially difficult given the seasonal
nature of VTA ridership.

Fixed Route Fare Revenues
Due to the expansion fare free fixed route service, it is unsurprising that fixed route fare revenue
decreased between FY23 and FY24, despite the increase in fixed route ridership. Total annual fixed route
fare revenue across all fifteen RTAs decreased by 11.60% from $13,019,834 in FY23 to $11,509,510 in
FY24. Please note that no fare revenue from FY19 was available. No fare revenue was collected among
the three RTA’s that comprise of the “Long Term/Permanent Fare Free” in either FY24 or FY23. The
reporting of such fare revenue is often due to the purchasing of annual or multi-ride fare media bulk by
private/public agencies and then provided to employees or students.
The four RTAs that make up the “Medium Term” group (BAT, MART, MWRTA, and SRTA), generated a
combined total fixed route revenue of $2,339,164, or a 40.58% decrease from the $3,936,880 of fixed
route revenue recorded in FY23. During the third and fourth quarter of FY24, all RTAs in this cohort were
operating fare free fixed route service, while all the RTAs in this cohort excluding BAT, were still collecting
some fixed route fare revenue. A total of $208,719 of fare revenue was collected in FY24, a 95.78%
reduction from FY23 (Figure 22).

Total annual fixed route fare revenue among the RTAs included in the “Short Term” cohort increased by

Section 140:
15.47% from FY23 to FY24, from $1,831,076 in FY23 to FY24 $2,114,282. Since RTAs in the “Short Term”
cohort primarily were only fare free for one or two months during FY24, the change in fare revenue could
be related to overall increase in ridership from FY23. Total fixed route fare revenue across both RTA’s in
the “Demographic Focused” group decreased by 1.33%, from $5,018,089 in FY23 to $5,018,089 in FY24.
Individually, CCRTA’s fixed route fare revenue increased by 0.36%, from $362,581 in FY23 to $363,871 in
FY24. Though CCRTA began to offered fare free fixed route service to seniors and people with disabilities
across all days of service in February of FY24, as well as continued to provide fare free fixed route transit
on Fridays, it did not have a month-long fare free fixed route pilot program that was opened to the
general public in FY24. CCRTA was also the only RTA to not conducted a month-long fare free fixed pilot
program in FY23 that was opened to the general public. PVTA did operate fare free fixed route service
that opened to all riders in December of FY23 and in late November, December, as well as June of FY24.
PVTA also provided fare free fixed route service to students 18 years or younger beginning in the second
half of FY24. In FY23 fixed route revenue decreased from $4,587,725.10 in FY23 to $4,655,508 in FY24, a
reduction of 1.46%.
Total annual fixed route fare revenue among both RTAs included in the “Seasonal Focused” cohort
equaled $2,104,467.80 in FY24, a 5.79% reduction from FY23, when total fixed route revenue equaled
$2,233,789. Individually, NRTA’s total FY24 fixed route fare revenue equaled $356,672.80, this is a 34.35%
decrease from FY23, when NRTA’s total fixed route fare revenue equaled $543,328. Please note that
NRTA concentrated its FY24 Try Transit fare free pilot program in the spring and summer when ridership
is typically high compared to the winter off season (though FY24 Try Transit funding was used to continue
funding the pilot program into FY25, we only have data through the end of FY24). VTA’s FY24 fixed route
fare revenue increased to $1,747,795 in FY24, up 3.39% from $2,233,789 in FY23. VTA’s concentrated it’s
fare free pilot program during the winter off season.

Fixed Route Farebox Recovery Ratio
FRR is calculated by dividing total fixed route fare revenue by total operating expenses. In FY23 total fixed
route FRR across all RTAs in FY24 was 6.18%. In FY23, total combined fixed route fare revenue across all
fifteen RTAs equaled $13,019,834.05 while total fixed route operating expenses across all fifteen RTAs
equaled $168,639,729. Total fixed route fare box recovery ratio across all RTAs in FY23 was equal to

Section 141:
7.72% (Figure 23).
No RTAs in the “Long Term” group recorded fixed route FRR in FY23 and FY24 since these RTAs did not
collect fixed route fare revenue in those fiscal years. Among the RTAs in the “Medium Term group,” total
fixed route fare box recovery ratio dropped from 9.10% in FY23 to 4.88% in FY24. Among the RTAs in the
“Short Term” group, FRR increased from 7.46% in FY23 to 7.93% in FY24. Fixed route FRR decreased from

Section 142:
10.33% in FY23 to 9.02% in FY24 among the RTAs included in the “Demographic Focused.” PVTA’s fixed
route FY23 FRR was 11.55% and declined to 10.37% in FY24. PVTA’s fixed route FRR declined from 23.27%
in FY23 to 19.92% in FY24. NRTA’s FRR decreased from 20.74% in FY23 to 10.24% in FY24. VTA’s FY24 Try
Transit Pilot program was concentrated during the winter Martha’s Vineyard off season. Fixed route FRR
increased from 24.22% in FY23 to 24.69% in FY24.

Demand Response Services
In addition to offering fixed route bus services, every RTA offers demand response service, meaning a
type of public transportation that uses flexible routing to take passengers where they need to go. The
label demand response covers different types of service, but generally encompasses not only Federally
required ADA paratransit, but also demographic restricted services offered by groups like COAs and
premium services like microtransit. RTAs incorporated different components of the greater demand-
response umbrella into their fare free pilots, making the undifferentiated data particularly difficult to
analyze. According to federal law, during the times that fixed route services were fare free, all ADA
paratransit also had to be free. For this reason, the fare policies of other demand response programs
differ depending on the RTA. MeVa, SRTA and NRTA collected no demand response revenue at all during
31
the times that their fixed route services were free. PVTA, MART, MWRTA, LRTA and BAT continued to
collect demand response revenue during these periods, indicating that they still charged for other
demand response services like Dial-A-Ride provided by councils on aging. CATA, FRTA, GATRA and WRTA
continued to charge for microtransit during this time.
Microtransit is a premium demand response service that operates like a Transportation Network
Company (TNC), flexibly taking riders from the general public anywhere within a given area. Like all
demand-response transit, microtransit can be expensive to operate, and most RTAs offering microtransit
are worried that cutting fares on this service will encourage an increase in ridership the program is ill
equipped to accommodate. MWRTA however piloted offering free rides on its Catch Connect
Microtransit from June-August 2024.
Because of these many components of demand response services with different approaches to offering
fares, fewer conclusions can be drawn about the exact effects of fare free policies on demand response
ridership, revenue, and farebox recovery. For the purposes of this report, RTAs have been divided into the
same groups to the ones used in the fixed route section: namely, “short term”, “medium term”, “long
term”, “seasonal” and “demographic focused.” These groupings are useful primarily in order to visualize
the effects of various approaches and are not intended to elicit comparison between RTAs, especially as
there are differences within groups in the organization of demand response fare structures.
For each of these RTAs, the demand response UPT in 2024 in the months where fares were free was
compared to those same months from FY 2022 and FY2023. All four RTAs saw growth in this period,
though, as the chart shows below, the change in ridership for all was much higher between FY22, when
none of these RTAs had any kind of fare free policies, and FY 2024 as compared to FY23, when all four of
these RTAs offered free fares in December as a part of the Try Transit holiday drive, and FY24 (Figure 24).
This suggests that riders may have been more aware of the program the second time around, but that a
new fare free policy will not constantly attract new riders.

While these programs did increase demand-response ridership compared to the same months in FY23
and FY24, they also drastically decreased the FRR compared to previous years. As mentioned earlier, one
of the greatest concerns surrounding fare free programs is the necessity of providing free demand
response paratransit, whose costs go up as ridership goes up. Given the rise in ridership due to the effect
of free fares, operating expenses can be expected to rise more drastically than fixed route services,
without a corresponding rise in revenue, the FRR can be expected to go down.

Farebox recovery ratio dramatically decreased both between FY22 (prior to the introduction of most fare
free service) and FY23 compared to FY24 (Figure 25). FRR themselves differ between RTAs and fluctuate
from year to year according to specific factors, including the fact that two of these RTAs offer premium
microtransit services. While fare revenue and operating expenses for demand response services
conceivably covers COA vehicles and microtransit, none of these four RTAs offered free fares on these
additional services, other than required ADA paratransit. Given that these programs were thus continuing
to collect revenue and did not see fare free related ridership increases, they are unlikely to so drastically
affect the FRR. Instead, this drop from year to year is likely due to free ADA paratransit’s rising operating
costs and lost revenue, one of the major fears of those opponents of fare free transit.
Unlike the “short term” group, whose fare free pilots for only a short time, the “medium term” group
took advantage of the increased funding for fare free programs to pursue pilots for several months. Every
one of the medium-term RTAs added fare free pilots in FY24 in months that had not been fare free in
previous years. For that reason, this report can compare the average change in UPT between those
months in FY24 and FY23 to see an approximate effect of fare free policies on demand response
ridership.

Figure 26: “Medium Term” Demand Response Ridership Change FY23 to FY24
Each of these RTAs saw an increase in ridership from FY23 to FY24 (Figure 26). While each of the RTAs
within the medium-term group were fare free from January to June of 2024 (BAT was fare free in
December as well), they differed in their categorization of which demand response services would be
free. SRTA, for example, gathered little to no demand response revenue for the months their fixed routes
were free in FY24, suggesting that both ADA paratransit and more premium services are all free. This
could help account for their large gain in the ridership from the year before.
MWRTA also stands out because of its microtransit, Catch Connect, a service not shared by the other
groups. For the summer of 2024 (only June represented here), they piloted making Catch Connect free
for riders. MWRTA was also long in rolling back their pandemic era free fares, which stretched into FY23,
so that a year-to-year comparison of those same months may be less revealing. (When compared to the
first two quarters of FY24 rather than the last two of FY23, the fare free months (last two quarters of FY24
are found to have 7% greater ridership). MWRTA also operated its program using a “Catch Card”, where
riders could only get free fares if in possession of a card from the driver in order to facilitate the
resumption of fares.

BAT MART MWRTA SRTA
Figure 27: “Medium Term” Demand Response FRR Change from FY23 to FY24
Each of the RTAs in the “Medium Term” cohort saw different kinds of changes to their farebox recovery
rates as a result of going fare free. SRTA’s farebox recovery rate, for example, decreased as a result of
going completely fare free on all demand response. MWRTA also had a significant drop in farebox
recovery rate, but differences in weather conditions could account for this change (Figure 27).
All of the RTAs in the “long term” grouping have had free fixed route fares continuously since the at least
FY22. They differ, however, in their approach to demand response service. MeVa has chosen to make all
demand response services free, while FRTA and WRTA continue to collect fares on premium demand
response services. Both WRTA and FRTA also have microtransit programs which they continue to charge
fares. FRTA ran a pilot in FY24 in the month of December to experiment making specifically its Demand
Response (but not FRTA Access) program free, but ultimately decided this was unsustainable.

Figure 28: “Long Term” Demand Response Ridership Percent Change FY19-FY24
All three of these RTAs have exceeded their ridership numbers in FY19 (Figure 28). Another potential
factor for FRTA’s rise could be the launch of its microtransit program FRTA Access during the pandemic,
which has expanded throughout its service area since 2019 and encouraged greater usage of demand
response offerings compared to fixed route.
The last four RTAs are more difficult to compare, given both the lack of data from before 2021 and the
many different approaches represented, whose effects cannot be understood as clearly as with fixed
route services. Both PVTA and CCRTA have offered different versions of their current program for several
years. PVTA has offered fare free services for seniors on Tuesdays since 2019, but only in FY24 did they
implement a fully fare free program for the summer months. In both FY23 and 24 they also participated
in the December Try Transit program done by many RTAs. CCRTA has offered fare free services on
Wednesdays for seniors and on Fridays for the general public since July 2022, but only in January 2024
did they expand to offer free service for seniors every day, while keeping fare free services for the general
public on Fridays (Figure 29).

While ADA paratransit services would have been free for the target communities during the set time,
both of these RTAs also offer other Demand Response transit. CCRTA’s rise in Demand Response ridership
since July 2024 could be attributed to the increased rollout of its SmartDART microtransit program. While
CCRTA did not offer SmartDART in every town on the cape until FY25, the program still existed in FY24 in
select towns and could account for some of the rise in ridership. These kinds of factors make it hard to
pinpoint the exact effects of free fares on demand response transit for these two RTAs.

Figure 30: “Seasonal Focused” Demand Response Ridership Percent Change from FY23 to FY24

This difficulty of comparison stands as well for the two island RTAs, VTA and NRTA. Not only did their fare
free pilots operate at different times of the year, but they had different approaches to which demand
response services to offer for free. While VTA offered free service in the winter months, when it already
typically has fewer customers (many of whom may have already been passengers, since they likely live on
the island year-round), NRTA ran its pilot during the summer months, during the tourist season.
NRTA also offered fare free demand response transit, which might be expected to drive ridership even
more. For this reason, while both programs saw growth from FY23 to FY24, VTA grew by 4% and NRTA by
57% (Figure 30). Both NRTA and VTA targeted their programs at specific customers, making it hard to see
from the numbers alone the effect of fare free in achieving the programs goals. Both RTAs saw their FRR
for demand response decline during the fare free periods compared to the year before, but because
NRTA’s Demand Response service was entirely free they had a 100% drop. VTA’s 67% drop, however, is
indicative of some of the financial effects of providing free paratransit, as seen with some of the “Short
Term” and “Medium Term” groups (Figure 31).

RTA Observations & Customer Feedback
At the close of FY24, every program mentioned a positive change in ridership (as demonstrated
quantitatively above). Most RTAs also reported positive customer feedback about the program, either in
comments on social media, word of mouth or formal studies. Customers appreciated increased flexibility
and the ability to take transit more often than they might have otherwise. For several RTAs, the fare free
pilot helped attract brand new riders who had never taken transit before, some of whom stayed after the
pilot ended. NRTA, for example, reported that it was able to attract many new riders in their summer
season and succeeded in their goals of mitigating congestion and clearing up parking on the island.
Similarly, PVTA, MeVa, VTA and WRTA had success targeting underprivileged populations including low
income and unhoused residents. In a customer survey conducted by WRTA, nearly half of their ridership
responded that they would not ride or not ride at the same levels were fares to be reinstated. MeVa also
38
found that many more trips have been for leisure and shopping than previously, suggesting that riders
who pay fares may cut down on necessary trips.
Alongside benefits to customers, many RTAs cited operational benefits of fare free transit. BAT, CATA and
MeVa all mentioned the operational efficiently from not needing to hire an armed car or count money,
which reduces staff hours and stress. MeVa has also saved money by going fare free rather than updating
their fare collection system, which was due to be replaced. Many RTAs also mention better results on
metrics like on time performance and dwell time during their fare free pilots, as they don’t need to wait
for staff to collect fares (this report does not analyze these results quantitatively due to differences in
data collection between the RTAs). Some RTAs also reported that the introduction of fare free service has
reduced conflict for operators, which in the case of MeVa has helped in driver recruitment.
Some RTAs, however, have mentioned operational downsides associated with their fare free pilots.
CCRTA, PVTA and FRTA, whose pilots applied only to specific populations, all reported some confusion
from customers over which groups could take advantage of the program over any given time, especially
as this changed over the course of the pilot. The short-term nature of some of these pilots has also made
messaging more difficult. A few RTAs have also been worried about capacity issues, especially in the
domain of demand response, as fare free service drives up ridership. NRTA, for example, had to provide
extra trip and in some cases an extra paratransit vehicle during their pilot, while other RTAs such as CATA
have expressed concerns about overwhelming their paratransit programs. MeVa mentioned that fare free
service has led to people making shorter overall trips as riding the bus has replaced walking, so that they
may be making more stops than when they provided fares.
Some RTAs contribute increases in ridership to factors that are irrelevant to the Try Transit 2.0 program.
VTA, for example, increased some service, especially during evening hours. Furthermore, a relatively mild
winter could have impacted its ridership figures during its pilot program. Likewise, BAT has also improved
service and is now running with half hour headways every weekday between 6 AM and 9 PM and is
operating Sunday morning service while LRTA improved service by removing COVID era combined routes
and reducing headways on five routes from one hour to thirty minutes. GATRA, at least impart,
contributes its increase in ridership to the introduction of Sunday service. GATRA did not apply for FY25
Try Transit funding.
Conclusion
Ridership across all fifteen RTAs increased in FY24 compared to FY23. Though several factors could have
contributed to this overall increase of ridership, such as continued recovery from the COVID 19 pandemic
or improved service among RTAs, the expansion of fare free service was likely a contributing, if not, in
some cases, the driving factor. Unlike in FY23, when most RTAs only offered fare free service for relatively
short 5-week pilot programs between Thanksgiving and New Years, FY24 saw five (5) additional RTAs
(BAT, MART, MWRTA, NRTA, and SRTA) begin to offer months long semi-permanent pilot programs more
in line with the fare free service that has been offered by FRTA and WRTA since 2020 and MeVa since

Section 223:
2022.
This report has demonstrated that while a positive correlation between fare free service and ridership
likely exists, regardless of the duration of a fare free pilot program, such a correlation is strongest when
fare free service is offered over a long period of time. This is evident by the fact that the three RTAs that
have continuously offered fare free fixed route service since prior to the start of the first Try Transit
program in FY23, have now exceeded FY19 pre pandemic ridership. This is further evident by the fact that
the combined total fixed route ridership among the four (4) RTAs included in the “medium term” cohort
39
(BAT, MART, MWRTA, and SRTA) are just 8.03% below FY19 fixed route ridership totals, while the RTAs
included in the “short term” group (BRTA, CATA, GATRA, LRTA) remain 26.22% below FY19 total fixed
route ridership. This report also demonstrates a negative correlation between the expansion of fare free
service and FRR and that such a negative correlation was strongest among the RTAs that offered more
extensive fare free service such as the RTAs in the “medium term” group. RTAs in the “short term” group
saw an increased in fixed route FRR from FY23 to FY24.
Due to the fact that the FY24 Try Transit pilot program was structured very differently than the FY23 Try
Transit pilot program, and the fact that changes in ridership between FY23 and FY24 are still at least
somewhat influenced by pandemic recovery, it is thus important that a FY25 report continue the analysis
conducted in this document, and expand the analysis to included additional metrics (e.g., ridership per
hour or per mile, dwell and/or travel times) that will likely be impacted by continued fare free service. In
FY25, thirteen out of the fifteen RTAs operating fare free service will be plenty of room to consider
factors not addressed in this report, but none the less essential in understanding the long-term
implications of operating fare free service across the Commonwealth.

Appendix – RTA Try Transit 2.0 Public Relations & Social Media Examples
To advertise the Try Transit program, the RTAs deployed public relations materials, press releases and
marketing techniques. This appendix includes several examples, including bus social media posts (Figure
32, Figure 52 – Figure 54), flyers (Figure 33 – Figure 41, Figure 43 – Figure 51, Figure 55 – 62), webpage
advertisements (Figure 42). Other examples not covered by this appendix include radio ads and press
releases. The materials used a consistent message to riders to “Try Transit” for the holiday season.

Executive Summary
The Fiscal Year 2024 Massachusetts Budget Act (Act) included the provided $15 million in operating funds
for Regional Transit Authorities (RTAs) available as grants for means-tested, discounted, or fare-free pilot
programs. Based on the requirements of the Act, the Massachusetts Department of Transportation
(MassDOT) Rail & Transit Division (RTD) conducted a competitive application process to distribute the
available funding to RTAs. A joint proposal from fourteen of the fifteen RTAs was selected for award, as
was a second application from CCRTA. Known as the Try Transit 2.0 program, the joint proposal from the
fourteen RTAs met the grant requirements by demonstrating increased ridership by removing economic
barriers for low-income individuals to use public transit. Furthermore, the pilot outlined in the joint
proposal enabled the RTAs to attract new low-income customers and demonstrate how transit may work
for them. CCRTA’s proposal stressed the need to provide free transit to older adults (defined as people
over the age of 60) and people with disabilities.
In FY23, the Massachusetts’s RTAs participated in a separate fare free pilot program during the 2022
Holiday Season, while three RTAs operated with permanent fare free service. Unlike the FY23 Try Transit
fare free pilot program which operated for about one month over the November/December holiday
period, Try Transit 2.0 supported the RTAs operation of fare free pilot programs at any time during the
FY24 fiscal year. Furthermore, under Try Transit 2.0, RTAs had the flexibility to determine the duration of
fare free pilots, with some programs lasting a month, and others lasting for a several month period. In
some cases, FY24 Try Transit 2.0 funding was even used to support the continuation of pilot programs
into FY25, though the primary focus of this report is on the impacts of the program funding during FY24
only, since the data for continuing operations is not yet available.
Fare free transportation may increase ridership and promote equity by providing additional benefits to
low-income individuals, youth and students, secure easier access to school and to jobs, eliminate the
need to purchases a pass or find cash for a fare, streamline the boarding process, and assist in the
reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and congestion. Fare free service can reduce conflicts between
passengers and operators since drivers would no longer be required to enforce fare payment policy. In
2024, administrators of multiple RTAs attributed a reduction of passenger/driver conflict to the
introduction and expansion of fare free service. Total ridership across all modes of service (i.e., fixed
route, demand response, demand taxi, and commuter bus) increased from FY23 to FY24 among all RTAs.
While total ridership increased during this time period, only six RTAs exceeded pre-pandemic FY19
ridership. Each RTA also reported fixed route ridership in FY24 that exceeded FY23 figures, thus showing a
positive correlation between fare free service and transit ridership. Fixed route ridership is below FY19
figures for all but five RTAs. Three of these five RTAs (FRTA, MeVa, and WRTA) have offered fare free fixed
route service prior to the launch of the FY23 and FY24 Try Transit programs, thus showing not only a
positive correlation between fare free service and ridership but also a positive correlation between
ridership and the duration of fare free pilot programs.
In FY25, an additional $30 million of fare free funding was provided by the legislature. Thirteen of the
fifteen RTAs have applied to continue providing fare free service in the new fiscal year. The continuation
of fare free service among most RTAs will allow for more data collection and an even more robust analysis
on the impacts of the provision of fare free transit. Such future analyses would provide better
understanding of the long-term impact of fare free service and post the COVID era downturn.

Introduction
Under Section 1596-2406 of the Fiscal Year 2024 Massachusetts Budget Act, Chapter 28 of the Acts of
2023, MassDOT RTD was directed to award up to $15 million in operating funds to RTAs on grants for
fare-free pilot programs. The Act requires that MassDOT shall oversee the distribution of said grants and
shall establish grant criteria including, but not limited to, the prioritization of:
a) Opportunities for increased ridership.
b) Increased service accessibility to low-income individuals.
The Act further requires that said grants be distributed in a geographically equitable manner and that
MassDOT RTD submit a report to the joint committee on transportation and the house and senate
committees on ways and means including, but not limited to:
1. the grant criteria used by MassDOT RTD,
2. a list of grant applicants,
3. a list of successful grant applicants,
4. summaries of successful proposals,
5. ridership and fare data for such pilot programs, and
6. details on the mechanisms being utilized to track ridership and fare data for said pilot
programs.
In compliance with the requirements of the Act, MassDOT RTD submitted a status report on the grant
program, detailing the grant process (requirements b1 – b4). At the time of submittal, there was no data
on ridership and fares available in order to meet requirements b5 and b6. As such, MassDOT RTD submits
this final report to address the remaining requirements.
Background
In Massachusetts, there are fifteen RTAs outside of the Greater Boston Area (Figure 1). Each RTA is locally
governed by an Advisory Board and provides a combination of fixed route and demand response transit
services to their member communities. Demand response service is inclusive of the complementary
paratransit services that are mandated by the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), requiring that
comparable service be provided to eligible persons within ¾ mile of a fixed route. Some RTAs opt to
provide additional modes of service, including demand taxi and commuter bus. All these services, while
managed by the RTA’s administrative staff, are provided through contracted operators. In FY2024, a total
of 26,994,459 UPT were provided by RTAs, across all modes of service. This includes a total of 24,842,385
fixed route UPT, 1,753,689 demand response UPT, 397,827 demand taxi UTP, and 558 commuter bus
UPT.

Figure 1: Map of RTA service areas in Massachusetts, including the Massachusetts Bay Transportation
Authority (MBTA)
Although they have similar goals, the RTAs serve diverse areas throughout Massachusetts, including rural
areas, suburbs, colleges and universities, Gateway Cities, small urbanized areas, and areas where
ridership is strongly affected by seasonal tourism. While some RTAs are predominantly defined by their
seasonal tourism or college and university services, all RTAs also provide essential workforce and
commuter trips, as well as medical and shopping trips for those without access to a car including elderly
and disabled riders. RTAs are flexible and innovative in meeting the needs of their customers.
The RTAs are funded through five main sources of revenue: directly generated revenue, farebox revenue
local assessments, state funding, and Federal funding (Figure 2). Directly generated revenue is inclusive of
own-source revenues generated from advertising, parking, and/or rental agreements. Local assessments
consist of local contributions for service from the RTA’s member communities and are based on the “loss”
(operating cost minus revenue) attributable to the service provided for each town or city. The
Commonwealth provides the RTAs with state operating funds in the form of State Contract Assistance
(SCA), which is passed through MassDOT. SCA is distributed by MassDOT RTD among the RTAs using a
long-standing allocation formula based on ridership. Any new funding received from the state over the
prior fiscal year is allocated based on a second formula that incorporates ridership, population, and
service area. Federal funding is also distributed based on formula but distributed nationally through
either the Section 5307 program for urbanized areas or the Section 5311 program for rural areas. All
7

funding apportioned by the Federal Government to an urbanized area (UZA) or a rural area is then
subject to additional split agreements negotiated by the agencies operating within each defined region.
Lastly, farebox revenue is generated through the collection of fares from riders. Each RTA has their own
advisory board approved fare policy that dictates the fare structure for each individual system.

Successful Grant Applicants
RTD recommended that both the Try Transit 2.0 grant and CCRTA’s separate proposal be selected for
awards as proposed (Table 2). Both proposals met the grant requirements by demonstrating the
proposed pilot could result in increased ridership by removing barriers for low-income individuals to use
public transit and by reducing logistical hurdles to both the public and the transit agencies that administer
the service. The proposals also prioritize low-income individuals, as the majority of current or potential
RTA riders are riding out of necessity. Furthermore, the pilot will enable the RTAs to attract new low-
income customers and demonstrate how transit may work for them. For the Try Transit 2.0 application,
given the differences among the RTAs for program length, timing and scope, each RTA is receiving the
following award amounts:

BAT $1,395,187
BRTA $179,041

RTA Fare Free Profiles
BAT
BAT used its FY24 Try Transit 2.0 grant to run free service starting on December 1, 2023. Pending
additional grant funding, they plan on extending fare free services until September 30, 2025, though they
are not planning on operating indefinite fare free service at this time. Under BAT’s program, all fixed
route and paratransit services (though not microtransit) are free seven days a week.
BRTA
BRTA has used their FY24 Try Transit 2.0 grant to run fare free service on all fixed route and paratransit
for five weeks around the holidays (November 24-December 31) and for a nine-week summer season
(June 1-July 31), in honor of their fiftieth anniversary. During this period, BRTA also had to reconfigure
routes and reduce service on two routes due to a lack of operators with commercial driver’s licenses.
10

While BRTA considered its pilot program to be successful, and has applied for FY25 Try Transit funding, it
currently does not plan on operating fare free service indefinitely.
CATA
CATA used its FY24 Try Transit 2.0 grant to provide fare free service from November 24-December 31,
2023. While fares all fixed route and paratransit routes were waived, CATA still charged for the CATA on-
demand microtransit services. CATA is open to waiving fares as long as it remains grant funded but is
unlikely to go fare free indefinitely without a set source of income.
CCRTA
CCRTA applied separately from the other fourteen RTAs for the FY24 Fare Free funding in order to expand
its existing program offering free fares specifically to older adults. CCRTA began offering fare free services
on its fixed routes to Older Adults (defined as 60 or older) on Wednesday in June of 2017. In February of
2024, they expanded this program to provide free service every day on fixed route services for older
adults and people with disabilities. They have also provided free fares for the general public every Friday
since 2021, which will continue until December 2024.
FRTA
FRTA has been offering fare free fixed route services since March 2020. Using money from the FY24 Try
Transit 2.0 grant, they added free demand-response services for older adults (defined as 60 and older)
between November 20, 2023, and December 31, 2023. During this time period, FRTA continued to charge
for its microtransit service, known as FRTA Access, that is open to the general public. They do not plan to
operate fare free demand response service indefinitely at this time.
GATRA
In FY24, GATRA offered fare free fixed route and ADA required paratransit services from November 24,
2023, to December 31, 2023, under the Try Transit 2.0 grant. Microtransit services were not free during
this time. GATRA will also be using FY24 Try Transit 2.0 funding to operate fare free service fixed route
and ADA required paratransit service from November 29, 2024-December 31, 2024.
LRTA
In FY24, LRTA offered free services on all fixed route and paratransit from December 1, 2023, to
December 31, 2023, and again from July 1-July 31, 2024, under the Try Transit 2.0 grant. LRTA is exploring
piloting longer-term fare free service if grant funding remains available.
MART
In FY24, MART provided free fare services on all fixed route and paratransit starting on January 1, 2024,
under the Try Transit 2.0 grant. While they had originally planned to conclude the program in June 2024,
they applied for and received additional grant funding that allowed them to continue the program
indefinitely. As a part of establishing the fare free program, MART reached out to several non-
governmental organizations, nonprofits and municipalities, as well as a complete comprehensive
operation analysis to streamline their services. This report only covers fare free service within FY24.
MeVa
MeVa has offered fare free services on all fixed route and paratransit services since March 2022. While
they originally used COVID Relief funding, MeVa now funds their fare free services using MassDOT grant
money, most recently from the Try Transit 2.0 grant. Alongside cutting fares in 2022, they improved
11

services by decreasing headways in Lawrence and Haverhill, extending hours and rebranding busses and
facilities. MeVa separately commissioned a firm to do a study on the effects of fare free in the area and
conducted extensive public outreach; this study was not funded by MassDOT.
MWRTA
In FY24, MWRTA offered free fare fixed route and paratransit services from January 2024 to August 31,
2024, under the Try Transit 2.0 grant. While they had initially planned on waiving fares only through
March, additional funding allowed them to continue the pilot through August. They plan on continuing
the program for all of FY25, though not indefinitely. MWRTA also piloted waiving fares on their
microtransit service, Catch Connect, for the summer of 2024. During FY24, MWRTA required riders to use
free cards distributed by drivers to receive free fares. This was intended to facilitate an easier transition
back to paying fares but plans on cutting this requirement during FY25. During the free fare period,
MWRTA also increased frequency of service and added evening service. MWRTA’s Catch Connect service
was also expanded to now serve the Town of Hunsdon on weekdays.
NRTA
NRTA used funding from the FY24 Try Transit 2.0 grant to offer fare free fixed route and paratransit
services from April to August 2024. As a result of the increased ridership associated with fare free service,
NRTA added additional paratransit vehicles. NRTA is considering offering fare free service indefinitely if
grant funding remains available.
PVTA
In FY24, PVTA offered fare free fixed route and paratransit services for the holiday season (November 24-
December 31, 2023) and for the months of June, July and August 2024 under the Try Transit 2.0 grant.
From January to May 2024, PVTA offered free fares on weekends for all riders and free fares for students
18 and under after 3 pm. For June, July and August, all fixed route and paratransit (except the intercity
B79 route) was once again fare free. PVTA is not currently planning on offering free fares indefinitely and
sees it more as a ridership tool in a backdrop where fares are collected. At the time of the pilot, PVTA also
added service to several routes.
SRTA
SRTA offered fare free fixed route and paratransit service from January 1-June 30, 2024, under the Try
Transit 2.0 grant. SRTA is opened to the possibility of providing fare free service indefinitely if grant
funding remains available. In January of 2024, SRTA also added Sunday service, while ridership increases
also necessitated additional vehicles on routes serving schools.
VTA
In FY24, VTA offered free fares on all fixed route and paratransit from November 24, 2023, to March, 31
2024 under the Try Transit 2.0 grant. VTA also continues to explore fare systems like fare capping and
transitioning away from cash in the future but is hesitant to make fares free for all riders who may have
the means to pay.
WRTA
WRTA has been offering fare free services since July 1, 2023, and utilized the Try Transit 2.0 to continue
to support these services. While their original pilot is slated to end on June 30, 2025, they’re hoping to go
fare free indefinitely, especially in light of their recent customer satisfaction survey which indicated that
riders on a fixed income placed high importance on the program.
12

Data Collection
Quantitative data on fares and ridership was extrapolated from the monthly Service Data Reports
submitted by the RTAs as required by the FY24-FY25 State Contract Assistance (SCA) Performance MOUs.
From each RTA’s report, raw monthly totals for the metrics of UPT, fare revenue generated, and FRR were
collected by mode of service. ADA paratransit data is collected under the “Demand Response” mode,
which is also inclusive of any demand responsive services provided “beyond” the requirements of the
ADA and of microtransit services. Some RTAs that provided additional paratransit services during this time
period chose to continue to collect fares for these services, a decision that varied RTA to RTA and was
dependent on the type of service provided. As a result, ridership and fare data were analyzed for fixed
route or systemwide only for this report.
In addition, each RTA was required to submit a one-time progress report that provided a qualitative
assessment of the pilot program. Using a short eleven (11) question survey, information was collected on
any operational improvements or challenges observed by RTA staff during the pilot, customer feedback
received, and sample advertising materials. See Appendix – RTA Try Transit 2.0 Public Relations & Social
Media Examples for examples of RTA advertising and public relations in advance of and during the Try
Transit program.
RTAs collect ridership data through several methodologies. At the most basic level, ridership counts are
collected manually by bus drivers through a hand-held unit. More sophisticated data collection methods
use either electronic fareboxes or automatic passenger counters (APCs), or a combination thereof, to
measure ridership, which is usually then calibrated by manual counts. When collecting fares, electronic
fareboxes record boardings when a passenger taps their smart card or, when paying in cash, the bus
operator presses a button to indicate a boarding. APCs automatically record passenger boardings and
alightings using a variety of techniques, such as an infrared beam or pressure sensitive mats.
Data Analysis
Unlike the FY23 Try Transit fare free pilot program which generally ran from November 25, 2022, to
December 31, 2022, the FY24 Try Transit program allowed RTAs to use funding for pilots conducted
throughout FY24, and in some cases the duration of the FY24 Try Transit 2.0 pilots continued into FY25.
This report only includes data collected before or during FY24, since FY25 data is not yet available. Each
RTA’s FY24 Try Transit 2.0 program is a little bit different from the next, with some RTAs opting for short
six weeklong pilot programs between Thanksgiving and New Year’s Eve, while others opted for six-month
long programs in the winter or summer of 2024. A few RTAs chose to split up their fare free pilot
program. BRTA, for example, offered fare free service approximately five weeks in late November and
December of 2023 and then a second two-month offering in June and July of 2024. CCRTA, which applied
for funding separately, expanded existing fare free service, which had previously been targeted towards
older adults, to include people with disabilities. Because data is submitted to RTD on a monthly basis, and
is not disaggregated into weeks or days, the analysis presented in this report focuses on annual and
monthly data. Additionally, the analysis focuses on the statewide impact of the pilot program. Individual
analyses of each RTA’s performance during the pilot can be provided upon request.
The various fare free pilot programs can be broken into five broad categories. As each RTA set the
parameters of their own pilot programs, the programs are not perfect matches for the categories
provided. The categories are as follows:
• Long Term/Permanent Fare Free Service: This category includes RTAs that have been providing
fully fare free fixed route service prior to receiving FY24 funding through Try Transit 2.0. FRTA and
13

WRTA began offering systemwide fixed route fare free service in March 2020 at the start of the
COVID 19 pandemic. MeVa began offering system wide fixed route service in March 2022, though
a City of Lawrance, MA funded program began providing fare free service on three routes-based
routes beginning on September 9, 2019. These RTAs intend to maintain fare free service once
FY24 pilot funding is depleted through other funding sources, as long as these funding sources
are available. In the case of some of these RTA (FRTA), FY24 Try Transit 2.0 funding was used only
to provide fare free funding to demand response service that typically changes fares.
• Medium Term, Fare Free Service: This category describes RTAs that offered extensive fixed route
fare free service using FY24 Try Transit 2.0 funding. In some cases, these fare free programs will
be using FY24 Try Transit funding to pay for fare free fixed route service into FY25. Unlike the
“Long Term/Permanent Fare Free” grouping, these RTAs were not providing fare free fixed route
service (apart from during the height of the COVID 19 Pandemic and during the FY23 Try Transit
Program) prior to receiving FY24 funding. RTAs included in this category are BAT, MART, MWRTA,
and SRTA. Please note that MWRTA still required riders to tap their fare payment card to ride for
free, even though fare cards were not charged. Fare payment cards were available upon request
on all MWRTA fixed route vehicles. Riders who did not want to use a fare card were required to
pay the full fare using cash.
• Short Term/Holiday Season Fare Free Service: This mainly focused on providing fixed route fare
free service using FY24 Try Transit 2.0 service around the holiday season, thus operating fare free
pilot programs strongly reminiscent of the FY23 Try Transit Fare Free pilot program. BRTA, CATA,
GATRA, and LRTA operated such fare free service. Please note that BRTA provided a second one-
month fare free pilot program in June, while LRTA ran a second fare free pilot program in July
(within FY25 but funding with FY24 money). GATRA will also be using FY24 funding to operate a
fare free pilot program between November 29, 2024, and December 31, 2024, within FY25.
• Demographic Focused Fare Free Service: RTAs in this category focused on providing fare free
service to certain groups of people rather than across the board fare free service. This grouping
would include CCRTA fare free pilot program starting in February of 2024, which focused on
providing fare free fixed route service to seniors (over the age of 60) and peoples with disabilities
on fixed route service on all days of operation. Fare free service was extended to all fixed route
passengers on Fridays. Please note that prior to February of 2024, CCRTA was offering free fixed
route service only to seniors on Wednesdays and to the general public on Fridays. PVTA’s fare
free pilot program focused on offering fare free service to students after 3PM, as well as fare free
service to the public during the months of December and June, and on weekends during the
months of January, February, March, April, and May.
• Seasonal Fare Free Service: The populations of Martha’s Vineyard and Nantucket vary based on
the season, increasing in the summer and decreasing in the winter. NRTA began its FY24 Fare
Free Pilot at the start of FY24 Q3 (April 1st) and continued the pilot through the end of FY25 Q1
(September 30th), with interest in continuing the pilot further depending on available funding.
NRTA’s fare free pilot program corresponds with the busy season on Nantucket. VTA began its
FY24 Fare Free Pilot on November 24, 2023. This fare free pilot continued until the end of FY24
Q3 (March 31st), thus VTA concentrated its pilot program on the Island’s off season.
Fixed Route Ridership
All RTAs experienced an increase in total annual fixed route ridership (UPT) in FY24 when compared with
total fixed route ridership in FY20, FY21, FY22, and FY23 (Figure 3). Only five of the fifteen RTAs recorded
14

total annual FY24 fixed route ridership that exceeded FY19 total annual fixed route ridership (Figure 4).
FY19 was both the last full fiscal year prior to the COVID-19 pandemic and the last full fiscal year prior to
the adoption of system wide fare free fixed route service by some RTAs. Fare free service in FY19 was
limited to CCRTA and PVTA offering fare free service to seniors (defined as people 60 years old or older)
on Wednesday or Tuesday respectively.
Three of the five RTAs that have seen fixed route ridership exceed FY19 levels, FRTA, MeVa, and WRTA,
offered system wide fare free service since at least March 2022. Annual total fixed route ridership
increased for FRTA, MeVa, and WRTA by 1.19%, 45.47%, and 51.53%, respectively, from FY19 to FY24.
From FY23 to FY24 FRTA, MeVa, and WRTA’s annual total fixed route ridership has increased respectively
by 38.84%, 58.94%, and 16.02%. The fact that three RTAs that have been operating fare free continuously
since at least FY22 have all exceeded FY19 ridership indicates the effectiveness fare free service has in
generating ridership over a multiyear period of time.
The two remaining RTAs that recorded more fixed route UPT in FY24 than in FY19 are BRTA and SRTA.
BRTA has been categorized as offering “Short Term/Holiday Season” in FY24, with fare free fixed route
service being provided from late November 2023 through the end of December 2023, and again from the
start of June 2024 through the end of July 2024. BRTA’s total annual fixed route ridership increased by
8.39% from FY19 through FY24. From FY23 through FY24, BRTA’s total annual ridership increased by
10.95%. Based on its approach to Fare Free fixed route service in FY24, SRTA falls into the “Medium
Term” category. SRTA started its fixed route fare free pilot program at the start of January 2024 and plans
to continue fare free service indefinitely, provided funds are made available. SRTA’s total annual fixed
route ridership increased by 2.02% from FY19 through FY24, while SRTA’s total annual fixed route
ridership increased by 19.01% from FY23 through FY24.

Total fixed route UPT across all RTAs has been increasing since the pandemic era low in FY21. In FY24, a
total of 24,842385 fixed route UPT were made across all RTAs, or an 18.87% increase from FY23. Total
UPT across all RTAs is 6.78% below FY19 totals (Figure 5).

To understand ridership, RTAs were broken into the five groups described above. Average annual
ridership for each group was then taken by calculating the total annual ridership for each RTA in each
respective cohort and then divided each groups total by the number of RTAs in each group.
Among the five groups, the RTAs that make up the “Long Term/Permanent Fare Free Service” group had
an average percent fixed route ridership increase of 29.61% from FY23 to FY24. The average percent
change of UPT among the RTAs that make up the “Medium Term, Fare Free Service” was an increase of
25.75% from FY23 to FY24. Among the RTAs that make up the “Short Term/Holiday Season Fare Free
Service,” average percent change in annual fixed route ridership increased by 16.36% from FY23 to FY24,
while among the RTAs included in the “Demographic Focused Fare Free Service,” average percent change
in annual fixed route ridership increased by 7.36% during this time period. Lastly, among the RTAs in the
“Seasonal Fare Free Service,” average percent change in annual fixed route ridership increased by 15.69%
from FY23 to FY24 (Figure 6).

The RTAs that make up the “Long Term/Permanent Fare Free Service” group saw an average percent
increase in annual fixed route ridership by 47.90% from FY19 to FY24. Average percent change in annual
fixed route ridership among the RTAs that form the “Medium Term, Fare Free Service” decreased by
8.03% from FY19 to FY24. Among the RTAs that make up the “Short Term/Holiday Season Fare Free
Service,” average percent change in annual fixed route ridership decreased by 26.22% from FY19 to FY24,
while average percent change in annual fixed route ridership among the RTAs included in the
“Demographic focused Fare Free Service” decreased by 25.34% during the same period. Lastly, average
percent change in annual fixed route ridership among the RTAs in the “Seasonal Fare Free Service”
decreased by 17.47% (Figure 7). Though the change in average precent ridership between FY23 and FY24
indicates that the elimination of fixed route transit fares led to some degree of ridership increase, the
change between FY19 and FY24 demonstrates a positive correlation between the duration of fare free
transit and ridership change. The “Long Term” cohort is the only grouping that’s FY24 average ridership
17

exceeded that of FY19. Though the “Medium Term” FY24 average ridership was still below the FY19
average ridership, but far closer pre-pandemic recovery than the remaining three groups.

Figure 7: Average Percent Fixed Route Ridership by Group, FY19 to FY24
The FY24 total monthly fixed route ridership of all RTAs exceeded those of FY23 (Figure 8). In general, the
ebb and flow of ridership during this period is impacted by a number of seasonal factors, particularly for
systems whose ridership has a high tourist and/or student base. December is typically a low ridership
month, for example, while January reported the lowest total ridership in both FY23 and FY24. In FY23 and
FY24, the month with the most total fixed route ridership was May. The month of December is an
interesting point of comparison since in FY23, fourteen of the fifteen RTAs operated fare free systemwide
fixed route service (CCRTA operated fare free fixed route for seniors on Wednesday and for the public on
Fridays and Saturdays). In December of FY24 only ten of the fifteen RTAs operated system wide fare free
fixed route service, yet the total fixed route UPT increased by 14.56% from FY23. Fixed Route fare free
ridership increased by 45.77% between December FY22, when only three RTAs operated systemwide
fixed route fare free service, and December FY24. Thus, the introduction of fare free fixed route service
across most RTAs in December of FY23, and again in December FY24, has likely contributed to this
increase. In December FY24, the total fixed route UPT is 4.75% above December FY20 totals (December
FY20 being just prior to the start of the COVID 19 pandemic) and 3.28% below the total fixed route UPT in
FY19 (Figure 9).

Reviewing each cohort, the “Long Term/Permanent Fare Free Service” had the largest increase in average
percent annual fixed route ridership between FY23 and FY24 of the five groups, a 29.61% change. In
terms of total annual ridership, 7,548,325 UPT were made in FY24, up from 5,824,080 in FY23 and
5,103,721 in FY19 (Figure 10).

Figure 10: Total Annual “Long Term” Ridership from FY19 to FY24
It is worth noting that all four RTAs in “Medium Term, Fare Free Service” cohort provided fare free fixed
route service in the second half of FY24. BAT provided fare free service for the month of December and
thus was the only RTA in this cohort that provided fare free fixed route service in the first half of FY24.
Since the bulk of the “Medium Term, Fare Free Service” was provided between January 2024 and June
2024, it is thus worth exploring how total fixed route ridership for the second half of FY24 compares with
Q3 and Q4 of FY23 and pre-COVID Q3 and Q4 FY19 figures.
Ridership recovery within the medium-term group was stronger in the second half of FY24 when fixed
route services was free, further indicating that the introduction of fare free service corresponded with an
increase in ridership. During the second half of FY24, when fixed route ridership across “Medium Term”
RTAs was fare free, total fixed route ridership was up 42.70% from the second half of FY23, when none of
the RTAs in this cohort were providing fare free service. This was an increase from 2,404,028 fixed route
UPT during the second half of FY23 to 3,430,566 fixed route UPT during the second half of FY24 Total
fixed route ridership also increased by 9.68% between the second half of FY19 and FY24, an increased
from 3,127,925 UPT (Figure 11). Total fixed route ridership increased by a mere 25.74% between the
entirety of FY23 and FY24, from 4,702,511 fixed route UPT to 5,912,899 fixed route UPT. This smaller
percent increase in fixed route ridership, when comparing the entirety of FY23 and FY24 indicates that
the introduction of fare free fixed route service in the second half of FY24, was a driving factor behind the
increase. Total fixed route ridership across the entirety of FY24 is still 8.03% below total fixed route
ridership for the entirety of FY19, when a total of 6,429,174 UPT were made, thus indicating that the
introduction of fare free service has at least helped ridership during the second half of FY24 recover from
the pandemic. (Figure 12)

As was the case with most RTAs in FY23, in FY24 the four RTAs (BRTA, CATA, GATRA, and LRTA) included
in the “Short Term/Holiday Season Fare Free Service” group concentrated much of their collective efforts
on operating fare free fixed route service during the month of December. Please note that BRTA also
operated fare free fixed route service at the end of November 2023 (FY24) as well as in June and July of
21

2024; CATA operated fare free fixed route service at the end of November 2023 (FY24); GATRA operated
fare free fixed route at the end of November, 2023 (FY24) and plans to use FY24 Try Transit funding to
operate fare free fixed route service from November 29, 2024-December 31, 2024.
In FY24, total fixed route annual ridership among the four RTAs included in the “Short Term” group
equaled 2,052,646 an increase of 16.36% from this cohort’s total FY23 ridership of 1,764,035. Total
annual ridership increased by 23.55% from FY22, when a total of 1,661,431 fixed route UPT were made
among the RTAs in the “Short Term” group. From FY19, when total annual fixed route UPT equaled
2,782,120, total FY24 fixed route ridership decreased by 26.22%.
The FY24 fixed route total ridership among the “Short Term” RTAs for the month of December equaled
174,391. This marks a 13.73% increase from December of FY23, when the total equaled 153,339. All four
of these RTAs operated fare free fixed route service in December of FY23. Fixed route Ridership in
December of FY24 increased by 25.89% from December of FY22, when no RTA in the “Short Term” Group
was offering fare free fixed route service. Though such an increase could be in part due to the post
pandemic economic recovery, this also indicates a positive correlation between fare free service and
ridership. December of FY22 fixed route ridership equaled 1,38,521. December FY24 fixed route ridership
is 15.52% below December of FY19, when a total of 206,427 fixed route UPT were made (Figure 13).

December and January tend to be low ridership months across many RTAs, with the total fixed route UPT
within the “Short Term” group declining from 174,391 in December of FY24 by 3.84% to 167,694 in
January of FY24, after all Holiday Season fare free pilot programs in the short-term group ended. In FY22,
when no fare free service was being offered by any of the RTAs in the “Short Term” cohort, the number
of total fixed route unlike passenger trips declined by 18.21% between December and January. The total
fixed route UPT increased by 6.89% between December and January of FY19. Ultimately, though it would
be interesting to know if temporary fare free service has a positive effect on ridership once fares are
22

reinstituted, the data within the “Short Term” group is inconclusive. The larger drop in ridership between
December and January FY22, for example, may be related to changes in the COVID infection rate that was
prevalent in the winter of calendar year 2021/2022, and thus it is impossible to conclude that the smaller
decline between December of FY24 and January of FY24 was the result of holiday season fare free pilot
programs.
CCRTA and PVTA presented a slightly different approach to fare free funding than the RTAs that make up
the “Long Term,” “Medium Term,” and “Short Term” Groups. CCRTA and PVTA focused on providing fare
free service for certain demographic groups. CCRTA was focused on maximizing it’s fare free efforts on
providing free service to seniors and people with disability across fixed route service on all days of
operation. CCRTA began providing fare free service for older adults (defined as people over the age of 60)
in June 2017. Aside from a brief period of system wide fixed route service to people of all ages during the
height of the COVID 19 Pandemic (from March 2020-July, 2020), CCRTA has not offered long periods
programs of fixed route service but has instead focused on the fare free service to older adults on
Wednesdays, and at then at start of FY2022, fare free fixed route service to the general public on Fridays.
Through the FY23 Try Transit Program, CCRTA also provided fixed route fare free service to the general
public on Saturdays from November 25, 2022, through December 31, 2022. CCRTA applied to FY24 Try
Transit Funding separately from the other fourteen RTAs, and on February 1, 2024, began a program of
providing Fare Free fixed route service to older adults and people with disabilities (people with disabilities
were previously excluded from the previous fare free service for older adults’ program) every day that
service operates. The fixed route fare free Friday’s program, that is opened to the general public, was
extended through the end of the 2024 calendar year. CCRTA’s long term goal is to end the fare free Friday
program to the general public at the end of the December 2024 but continue providing fare free fixed
route service for seniors and people with disabilities, during all days of operations, indefinitely.
From FY23 to FY24, total ridership increased by 5.67%, from 556,199 fixed route UPT in total for FY23, to
587,716 fixed route UPT in total at the end of FY24. A total of 233,778 unlinked fixed route passenger
trips between February and June of FY24, when CCRTA’s fare free program for older adults was extend to
people with disabilities and to all days of operation. This marks a 15.13% increase from the same time
period during FY23, when a total of 203,047 fixed route UPT were made.
While total annual CCRTA fixed route ridership in FY24 is 2.88% below FY23 annual fixed route ridership,
the total ridership between February and June in FY24 exceeds ridership during that same period in FY19
by 9.91%. FY19 fixed route ridership between February and June totaled 212,695 UPT (Figure 14).
In December of FY23, when fare free fixed route Friday and Saturday service was provided to the general
public (in addition to fare free fixed route Wednesday service to older adults), a total of 36,124 fixed
route UPT were recorded. This was 15.28% above December FY19 ridership when no fare free service to
the general public was offered. In December FY24, fare free service to the general public was only
provided on Friday, and the total fixed route ridership for the month equaled 32,245, as 10.74%
reduction from December of FY23 (Figure 15).

Like CCRTA, PVTAs approach to fare free transit was focused on providing free service to older adults
(defined over 60) as well as to students, at certain days of the week and certain times of the day. Unlike
CCRTA, PVTA also used FY23 and FY24 Try Transit funding to provide some system wide fixed route fare
free service over the course of several weeks. PVTAs fare free approach thus resembles a combination of
demographic approach of CCRTA and the holiday and summer fare free approach of the “Short Term”
group.

Since July of FY19, PVTA has offered fare free services to older adults on Tuesdays across all fixed route
service except the B79 Amherst-Worcester route. Originally a two-year pilot, this program was extended
starting July 1, 2021. As part of the FY23 Try Transit fare free pilot program, PVTA provided fare free fixed
route service for the month of December. FY24 Try Transit funding contributed to fare free fixed route
service across the PVTA network (excluding Route B79) to all riders from November 24, 2023-December
31, 2023, and again from June 1, 2024-August 31, 2024. PVTAs FY24 Try Transit pilot program also
included an expansion of its demographical to fare free service. From January 1, 2024, to May 31, 2024,
students 18 years old and under, with valid student ideas, could ride all fixed route service (excluding
route B79) after 3PM. All fixed route weekend service (excluding route B79) was also free during this time
period.
A total of 7,420,128 fixed route UPT were made, across the PVTA system, this marks an increase of 7.49%
from FY23, when a total of 6,902,789 fixed route UPT were made, but a 26.68% decrease from FY19
when a total of 10,120,238 UPT were made. A total of 3,099,617 fixed route UPT were made between
during and between January and May of FY24, a 2.09% increase from the same time period in FY23, when
a total of 3,036,109 fixed route UPT were recorded. The total number of UPT made during the January-
May time period in FY24 is 29.76% down from the same time period in FY19, when a total of a total of
4,350,806 UPT were recorded (Figure 16).

trips were recorded, please note that fixed route service was free during the month of December for both
of those fiscal years. PVTA did not offer fare free fixed route service during December FY22 (apart for fare
free service for older adults on Tuesday) when a total of 467,902 fixed route unlinked passenger trips
were recorded, thus ridership increased by 44.69% from December FY22 to December FY24. From

The final category is the “Seasonal Fare Free Service” group which consists of NRTA and VTA. NRTA and
VTA respectively serve the islands of Nantucket and Martha’s Vineyard. Both islands are only accessible
by boat or airplane and the only way a resident or visitor can bring a car to these islands is by transporting
it on a ferry. Martha’s Vineyard and Nantucket are both seasonal destinations, the populations of both
islands’ balloons during the summer months and declines during the long off season which makes up the
bulk of the year.
NRTA chose to concentrate its FY24 fare free service in the Spring and Summer, when the FY24 Try
Transit fare free pilot program was scheduled to run from April through September. VTA concentrated it’s
fare free service during the winter of FY24, when seasonal residents and tourist are away and the
majority of the people on Martha’s Vineyard are full time residents. By concentrating its fare free pilot
program to the winter, VTA’s administration hopes fare free service would provide to relief to year-round
residents who tend to be less affluent than seasonal residents and visitors. VTA’s FY24 pilot program ran
from November 24, 2023 (in FY24) through March 31, 2024.
In FY24, NRTA recorded 282,031 fixed route UPT, up 16.62% from FY23 when 241,842 fixed route UPT
were recorded but down 4.41% from FY19, when 295,056 UPT were recorded. Comparing the fourth
quarter of FY24, when 102,189 fixed route UPT were recorded and when NRTA was providing fare free
service, ridership was up 78.43% from the 57,272 fixed route UPT made during Q4 of FY23, when no fare
free fixed route service was offered. Q4 FY24 fixed route ridership also exceeded Q4 FY19 fixed route
ridership figures by 64.19%. Fixed route ridership in Q4 FY19 equaled 62,239 UPT (Figure 19).

In FY24, VTA’s total fixed route ridership equaled 1,038,650 UPT, an increase of 15.44% from FY23, when
a total of 899,699 fixed route UPT was recoded. From December through March in FY24, during VTA’s
fare free pilot program, a total of 139,754 UPT were recorded. This is an increase of 29.91% increase from
the same period in FY23, when a total of 107,574 UPT were recorded and the FY23 Try Transit fare free
pilot program was limited to just the month of December.
27

While fixed route ridership decreased from 1,305,195 UPT, or 20.42% between FY19 and FY24, ridership
was up by 24.60% during the December through March period in FY24 compared to that same period in
FY19, when a total of 112,165 UPT was recoded (Figure 20). Comparing April of FY24, after VTA’s fare free
pilot program ended, ridership was up 16.33%, an increase from 42,463 fixed route UPT in FY23 to 49,397
fixed route UPT in FY24. April FY24’s ridership is 24.60% above April FY19 ridership of 44,318 fixed route
UPT.
This indicates that fare free service might, at least temporarily, boost ridership after pilot programs ends.
That said, by June of FY24, ridership was 9.20% below FY23 numbers, a decrease of 154,556 fixed route
UPT in June of FY23 to 140,338 fixed route UPT in June of FY24. June of FY24 recorded 18.57% fewer
fixed route UPT than June of FY19, when 172,349% fixed route UPT were recorded (Figure 21). It is
difficult to determine if the fare free pilot program had lingering effects that boosted ridership in April of
FY24 and subsided by June, or if other factors contributed. This is especially difficult given the seasonal
nature of VTA ridership.

Fixed Route Fare Revenues
Due to the expansion fare free fixed route service, it is unsurprising that fixed route fare revenue
decreased between FY23 and FY24, despite the increase in fixed route ridership. Total annual fixed route
fare revenue across all fifteen RTAs decreased by 11.60% from $13,019,834 in FY23 to $11,509,510 in
FY24. Please note that no fare revenue from FY19 was available. No fare revenue was collected among
the three RTA’s that comprise of the “Long Term/Permanent Fare Free” in either FY24 or FY23. The
reporting of such fare revenue is often due to the purchasing of annual or multi-ride fare media bulk by
private/public agencies and then provided to employees or students.
The four RTAs that make up the “Medium Term” group (BAT, MART, MWRTA, and SRTA), generated a
combined total fixed route revenue of $2,339,164, or a 40.58% decrease from the $3,936,880 of fixed
route revenue recorded in FY23. During the third and fourth quarter of FY24, all RTAs in this cohort were
operating fare free fixed route service, while all the RTAs in this cohort excluding BAT, were still collecting
some fixed route fare revenue. A total of $208,719 of fare revenue was collected in FY24, a 95.78%
reduction from FY23 (Figure 22).

Figure 22: Percent Change in “Medium Term” Fare Revenue from FY23 to FY24
Total annual fixed route fare revenue among the RTAs included in the “Short Term” cohort increased by
15.47% from FY23 to FY24, from $1,831,076 in FY23 to FY24 $2,114,282. Since RTAs in the “Short Term”
cohort primarily were only fare free for one or two months during FY24, the change in fare revenue could
be related to overall increase in ridership from FY23. Total fixed route fare revenue across both RTA’s in
the “Demographic Focused” group decreased by 1.33%, from $5,018,089 in FY23 to $5,018,089 in FY24.
Individually, CCRTA’s fixed route fare revenue increased by 0.36%, from $362,581 in FY23 to $363,871 in
FY24. Though CCRTA began to offered fare free fixed route service to seniors and people with disabilities
across all days of service in February of FY24, as well as continued to provide fare free fixed route transit
on Fridays, it did not have a month-long fare free fixed route pilot program that was opened to the
general public in FY24. CCRTA was also the only RTA to not conducted a month-long fare free fixed pilot
program in FY23 that was opened to the general public. PVTA did operate fare free fixed route service
that opened to all riders in December of FY23 and in late November, December, as well as June of FY24.
PVTA also provided fare free fixed route service to students 18 years or younger beginning in the second
half of FY24. In FY23 fixed route revenue decreased from $4,587,725.10 in FY23 to $4,655,508 in FY24, a
reduction of 1.46%.
Total annual fixed route fare revenue among both RTAs included in the “Seasonal Focused” cohort
equaled $2,104,467.80 in FY24, a 5.79% reduction from FY23, when total fixed route revenue equaled
$2,233,789. Individually, NRTA’s total FY24 fixed route fare revenue equaled $356,672.80, this is a 34.35%
decrease from FY23, when NRTA’s total fixed route fare revenue equaled $543,328. Please note that
NRTA concentrated its FY24 Try Transit fare free pilot program in the spring and summer when ridership
is typically high compared to the winter off season (though FY24 Try Transit funding was used to continue
funding the pilot program into FY25, we only have data through the end of FY24). VTA’s FY24 fixed route
fare revenue increased to $1,747,795 in FY24, up 3.39% from $2,233,789 in FY23. VTA’s concentrated it’s
fare free pilot program during the winter off season.

Fixed Route Farebox Recovery Ratio
FRR is calculated by dividing total fixed route fare revenue by total operating expenses. In FY23 total fixed
route FRR across all RTAs in FY24 was 6.18%. In FY23, total combined fixed route fare revenue across all
fifteen RTAs equaled $13,019,834.05 while total fixed route operating expenses across all fifteen RTAs
equaled $168,639,729. Total fixed route fare box recovery ratio across all RTAs in FY23 was equal to
7.72% (Figure 23).
No RTAs in the “Long Term” group recorded fixed route FRR in FY23 and FY24 since these RTAs did not
collect fixed route fare revenue in those fiscal years. Among the RTAs in the “Medium Term group,” total
fixed route fare box recovery ratio dropped from 9.10% in FY23 to 4.88% in FY24. Among the RTAs in the
“Short Term” group, FRR increased from 7.46% in FY23 to 7.93% in FY24. Fixed route FRR decreased from
10.33% in FY23 to 9.02% in FY24 among the RTAs included in the “Demographic Focused.” PVTA’s fixed
route FY23 FRR was 11.55% and declined to 10.37% in FY24. PVTA’s fixed route FRR declined from 23.27%
in FY23 to 19.92% in FY24. NRTA’s FRR decreased from 20.74% in FY23 to 10.24% in FY24. VTA’s FY24 Try
Transit Pilot program was concentrated during the winter Martha’s Vineyard off season. Fixed route FRR
increased from 24.22% in FY23 to 24.69% in FY24.

Demand Response Services
In addition to offering fixed route bus services, every RTA offers demand response service, meaning a
type of public transportation that uses flexible routing to take passengers where they need to go. The
label demand response covers different types of service, but generally encompasses not only Federally
required ADA paratransit, but also demographic restricted services offered by groups like COAs and
premium services like microtransit. RTAs incorporated different components of the greater demand-
response umbrella into their fare free pilots, making the undifferentiated data particularly difficult to
analyze. According to federal law, during the times that fixed route services were fare free, all ADA
paratransit also had to be free. For this reason, the fare policies of other demand response programs
differ depending on the RTA. MeVa, SRTA and NRTA collected no demand response revenue at all during
31

the times that their fixed route services were free. PVTA, MART, MWRTA, LRTA and BAT continued to
collect demand response revenue during these periods, indicating that they still charged for other
demand response services like Dial-A-Ride provided by councils on aging. CATA, FRTA, GATRA and WRTA
continued to charge for microtransit during this time.
Microtransit is a premium demand response service that operates like a Transportation Network
Company (TNC), flexibly taking riders from the general public anywhere within a given area. Like all
demand-response transit, microtransit can be expensive to operate, and most RTAs offering microtransit
are worried that cutting fares on this service will encourage an increase in ridership the program is ill
equipped to accommodate. MWRTA however piloted offering free rides on its Catch Connect
Microtransit from June-August 2024.
Because of these many components of demand response services with different approaches to offering
fares, fewer conclusions can be drawn about the exact effects of fare free policies on demand response
ridership, revenue, and farebox recovery. For the purposes of this report, RTAs have been divided into the
same groups to the ones used in the fixed route section: namely, “short term”, “medium term”, “long
term”, “seasonal” and “demographic focused.” These groupings are useful primarily in order to visualize
the effects of various approaches and are not intended to elicit comparison between RTAs, especially as
there are differences within groups in the organization of demand response fare structures.
For each of these RTAs, the demand response UPT in 2024 in the months where fares were free was
compared to those same months from FY 2022 and FY2023. All four RTAs saw growth in this period,
though, as the chart shows below, the change in ridership for all was much higher between FY22, when
none of these RTAs had any kind of fare free policies, and FY 2024 as compared to FY23, when all four of
these RTAs offered free fares in December as a part of the Try Transit holiday drive, and FY24 (Figure 24).
This suggests that riders may have been more aware of the program the second time around, but that a
new fare free policy will not constantly attract new riders.

While these programs did increase demand-response ridership compared to the same months in FY23
and FY24, they also drastically decreased the FRR compared to previous years. As mentioned earlier, one
of the greatest concerns surrounding fare free programs is the necessity of providing free demand
response paratransit, whose costs go up as ridership goes up. Given the rise in ridership due to the effect
of free fares, operating expenses can be expected to rise more drastically than fixed route services,
without a corresponding rise in revenue, the FRR can be expected to go down.

Figure 25: “Short Term” Demand Response FRR Percent Change FY22 and FY23 to FY24
Farebox recovery ratio dramatically decreased both between FY22 (prior to the introduction of most fare
free service) and FY23 compared to FY24 (Figure 25). FRR themselves differ between RTAs and fluctuate
from year to year according to specific factors, including the fact that two of these RTAs offer premium
microtransit services. While fare revenue and operating expenses for demand response services
conceivably covers COA vehicles and microtransit, none of these four RTAs offered free fares on these
additional services, other than required ADA paratransit. Given that these programs were thus continuing
to collect revenue and did not see fare free related ridership increases, they are unlikely to so drastically
affect the FRR. Instead, this drop from year to year is likely due to free ADA paratransit’s rising operating
costs and lost revenue, one of the major fears of those opponents of fare free transit.
Unlike the “short term” group, whose fare free pilots for only a short time, the “medium term” group
took advantage of the increased funding for fare free programs to pursue pilots for several months. Every
one of the medium-term RTAs added fare free pilots in FY24 in months that had not been fare free in
previous years. For that reason, this report can compare the average change in UPT between those
months in FY24 and FY23 to see an approximate effect of fare free policies on demand response
ridership.

Figure 26: “Medium Term” Demand Response Ridership Change FY23 to FY24
Each of these RTAs saw an increase in ridership from FY23 to FY24 (Figure 26). While each of the RTAs
within the medium-term group were fare free from January to June of 2024 (BAT was fare free in
December as well), they differed in their categorization of which demand response services would be
free. SRTA, for example, gathered little to no demand response revenue for the months their fixed routes
were free in FY24, suggesting that both ADA paratransit and more premium services are all free. This
could help account for their large gain in the ridership from the year before.
MWRTA also stands out because of its microtransit, Catch Connect, a service not shared by the other
groups. For the summer of 2024 (only June represented here), they piloted making Catch Connect free
for riders. MWRTA was also long in rolling back their pandemic era free fares, which stretched into FY23,
so that a year-to-year comparison of those same months may be less revealing. (When compared to the
first two quarters of FY24 rather than the last two of FY23, the fare free months (last two quarters of FY24
are found to have 7% greater ridership). MWRTA also operated its program using a “Catch Card”, where
riders could only get free fares if in possession of a card from the driver in order to facilitate the
resumption of fares.

BAT MART MWRTA SRTA
Figure 27: “Medium Term” Demand Response FRR Change from FY23 to FY24
Each of the RTAs in the “Medium Term” cohort saw different kinds of changes to their farebox recovery
rates as a result of going fare free. SRTA’s farebox recovery rate, for example, decreased as a result of
going completely fare free on all demand response. MWRTA also had a significant drop in farebox
recovery rate, but differences in weather conditions could account for this change (Figure 27).
All of the RTAs in the “long term” grouping have had free fixed route fares continuously since the at least
FY22. They differ, however, in their approach to demand response service. MeVa has chosen to make all
demand response services free, while FRTA and WRTA continue to collect fares on premium demand
response services. Both WRTA and FRTA also have microtransit programs which they continue to charge
fares. FRTA ran a pilot in FY24 in the month of December to experiment making specifically its Demand
Response (but not FRTA Access) program free, but ultimately decided this was unsustainable.

Figure 28: “Long Term” Demand Response Ridership Percent Change FY19-FY24
All three of these RTAs have exceeded their ridership numbers in FY19 (Figure 28). Another potential
factor for FRTA’s rise could be the launch of its microtransit program FRTA Access during the pandemic,
which has expanded throughout its service area since 2019 and encouraged greater usage of demand
response offerings compared to fixed route.
The last four RTAs are more difficult to compare, given both the lack of data from before 2021 and the
many different approaches represented, whose effects cannot be understood as clearly as with fixed
route services. Both PVTA and CCRTA have offered different versions of their current program for several
years. PVTA has offered fare free services for seniors on Tuesdays since 2019, but only in FY24 did they
implement a fully fare free program for the summer months. In both FY23 and 24 they also participated
in the December Try Transit program done by many RTAs. CCRTA has offered fare free services on
Wednesdays for seniors and on Fridays for the general public since July 2022, but only in January 2024
did they expand to offer free service for seniors every day, while keeping fare free services for the general
public on Fridays (Figure 29).

While ADA paratransit services would have been free for the target communities during the set time,
both of these RTAs also offer other Demand Response transit. CCRTA’s rise in Demand Response ridership
since July 2024 could be attributed to the increased rollout of its SmartDART microtransit program. While
CCRTA did not offer SmartDART in every town on the cape until FY25, the program still existed in FY24 in
select towns and could account for some of the rise in ridership. These kinds of factors make it hard to
pinpoint the exact effects of free fares on demand response transit for these two RTAs.

This difficulty of comparison stands as well for the two island RTAs, VTA and NRTA. Not only did their fare
free pilots operate at different times of the year, but they had different approaches to which demand
response services to offer for free. While VTA offered free service in the winter months, when it already
typically has fewer customers (many of whom may have already been passengers, since they likely live on
the island year-round), NRTA ran its pilot during the summer months, during the tourist season.
NRTA also offered fare free demand response transit, which might be expected to drive ridership even
more. For this reason, while both programs saw growth from FY23 to FY24, VTA grew by 4% and NRTA by
57% (Figure 30). Both NRTA and VTA targeted their programs at specific customers, making it hard to see
from the numbers alone the effect of fare free in achieving the programs goals. Both RTAs saw their FRR
for demand response decline during the fare free periods compared to the year before, but because
NRTA’s Demand Response service was entirely free they had a 100% drop. VTA’s 67% drop, however, is
indicative of some of the financial effects of providing free paratransit, as seen with some of the “Short
Term” and “Medium Term” groups (Figure 31).

RTA Observations & Customer Feedback
At the close of FY24, every program mentioned a positive change in ridership (as demonstrated
quantitatively above). Most RTAs also reported positive customer feedback about the program, either in
comments on social media, word of mouth or formal studies. Customers appreciated increased flexibility
and the ability to take transit more often than they might have otherwise. For several RTAs, the fare free
pilot helped attract brand new riders who had never taken transit before, some of whom stayed after the
pilot ended. NRTA, for example, reported that it was able to attract many new riders in their summer
season and succeeded in their goals of mitigating congestion and clearing up parking on the island.
Similarly, PVTA, MeVa, VTA and WRTA had success targeting underprivileged populations including low
income and unhoused residents. In a customer survey conducted by WRTA, nearly half of their ridership
responded that they would not ride or not ride at the same levels were fares to be reinstated. MeVa also
38

found that many more trips have been for leisure and shopping than previously, suggesting that riders
who pay fares may cut down on necessary trips.
Alongside benefits to customers, many RTAs cited operational benefits of fare free transit. BAT, CATA and
MeVa all mentioned the operational efficiently from not needing to hire an armed car or count money,
which reduces staff hours and stress. MeVa has also saved money by going fare free rather than updating
their fare collection system, which was due to be replaced. Many RTAs also mention better results on
metrics like on time performance and dwell time during their fare free pilots, as they don’t need to wait
for staff to collect fares (this report does not analyze these results quantitatively due to differences in
data collection between the RTAs). Some RTAs also reported that the introduction of fare free service has
reduced conflict for operators, which in the case of MeVa has helped in driver recruitment.
Some RTAs, however, have mentioned operational downsides associated with their fare free pilots.
CCRTA, PVTA and FRTA, whose pilots applied only to specific populations, all reported some confusion
from customers over which groups could take advantage of the program over any given time, especially
as this changed over the course of the pilot. The short-term nature of some of these pilots has also made
messaging more difficult. A few RTAs have also been worried about capacity issues, especially in the
domain of demand response, as fare free service drives up ridership. NRTA, for example, had to provide
extra trip and in some cases an extra paratransit vehicle during their pilot, while other RTAs such as CATA
have expressed concerns about overwhelming their paratransit programs. MeVa mentioned that fare free
service has led to people making shorter overall trips as riding the bus has replaced walking, so that they
may be making more stops than when they provided fares.
Some RTAs contribute increases in ridership to factors that are irrelevant to the Try Transit 2.0 program.
VTA, for example, increased some service, especially during evening hours. Furthermore, a relatively mild
winter could have impacted its ridership figures during its pilot program. Likewise, BAT has also improved
service and is now running with half hour headways every weekday between 6 AM and 9 PM and is
operating Sunday morning service while LRTA improved service by removing COVID era combined routes
and reducing headways on five routes from one hour to thirty minutes. GATRA, at least impart,
contributes its increase in ridership to the introduction of Sunday service. GATRA did not apply for FY25
Try Transit funding.
Conclusion
Ridership across all fifteen RTAs increased in FY24 compared to FY23. Though several factors could have
contributed to this overall increase of ridership, such as continued recovery from the COVID 19 pandemic
or improved service among RTAs, the expansion of fare free service was likely a contributing, if not, in
some cases, the driving factor. Unlike in FY23, when most RTAs only offered fare free service for relatively
short 5-week pilot programs between Thanksgiving and New Years, FY24 saw five (5) additional RTAs
(BAT, MART, MWRTA, NRTA, and SRTA) begin to offer months long semi-permanent pilot programs more
in line with the fare free service that has been offered by FRTA and WRTA since 2020 and MeVa since
2022.
This report has demonstrated that while a positive correlation between fare free service and ridership
likely exists, regardless of the duration of a fare free pilot program, such a correlation is strongest when
fare free service is offered over a long period of time. This is evident by the fact that the three RTAs that
have continuously offered fare free fixed route service since prior to the start of the first Try Transit
program in FY23, have now exceeded FY19 pre pandemic ridership. This is further evident by the fact that
the combined total fixed route ridership among the four (4) RTAs included in the “medium term” cohort
39

(BAT, MART, MWRTA, and SRTA) are just 8.03% below FY19 fixed route ridership totals, while the RTAs
included in the “short term” group (BRTA, CATA, GATRA, LRTA) remain 26.22% below FY19 total fixed
route ridership. This report also demonstrates a negative correlation between the expansion of fare free
service and FRR and that such a negative correlation was strongest among the RTAs that offered more
extensive fare free service such as the RTAs in the “medium term” group. RTAs in the “short term” group
saw an increased in fixed route FRR from FY23 to FY24.
Due to the fact that the FY24 Try Transit pilot program was structured very differently than the FY23 Try
Transit pilot program, and the fact that changes in ridership between FY23 and FY24 are still at least
somewhat influenced by pandemic recovery, it is thus important that a FY25 report continue the analysis
conducted in this document, and expand the analysis to included additional metrics (e.g., ridership per
hour or per mile, dwell and/or travel times) that will likely be impacted by continued fare free service. In
FY25, thirteen out of the fifteen RTAs operating fare free service will be plenty of room to consider
factors not addressed in this report, but none the less essential in understanding the long-term
implications of operating fare free service across the Commonwealth.

Appendix – RTA Try Transit 2.0 Public Relations & Social Media Examples
To advertise the Try Transit program, the RTAs deployed public relations materials, press releases and
marketing techniques. This appendix includes several examples, including bus social media posts (Figure
32, Figure 52 – Figure 54), flyers (Figure 33 – Figure 41, Figure 43 – Figure 51, Figure 55 – 62), webpage
advertisements (Figure 42). Other examples not covered by this appendix include radio ads and press
releases. The materials used a consistent message to riders to “Try Transit” for the holiday season.
