Re: Office of the Inspector General’s 2024 Annual Report
Dear Governor Healey and Commonwealth Leaders:
As the Commonwealth’s Inspector General, I take great pride in presenting the Office of
the Inspector General’s (OIG) 2024 Annual Report.
The accompanying report, prepared pursuant to the statutory requirement of Section 12
of Chapter 12A of the Massachusetts General Laws, highlights the work completed in Calendar
Year 2024 by the nearly 90 professional staff members of the OIG. I am humbled to lead this
group of dedicated public servants who embody the ideals that the Ward Commission envisioned
when it recommended, several decades ago, that the Massachusetts Legislature create such an
independent government oversight entity. The OIG has grown and evolved significantly since its
establishment in 1980 and remains a leader and example for the rest of the country.
This year, my second full year as Inspector General, I had the opportunity to lend support
for the concept of an office of the inspector general in other jurisdictions. In May 2024, I testified
separately before the Rhode Island House Committee on Finance and the Boston City Council’s
Committee on Government Operations in support of the creation of an OIG. While I did not speak
to their respective specific proposals, I was emphatic that a true inspector general’s office must
have a clear mandate, independence, the ability to conduct confidential investigations without
fear or favor, and whistleblower protection.
We are fortunate in Massachusetts to have a strong foundation on which the Office of
the Inspector General rests. The Legislature, following the recommendation of the Ward
Commission, wisely crafted the OIG’s enabling statute. It outlines clear qualifications, authority
and powers for the office and ensures its independence with nonconcurrent terms between the
appointers and the appointee. The statute also requires an appointer to show cause to remove
an inspector general.
We are also fortunate that the Commonwealth’s leadership continues to support the
importance of the OIG through appropriate funding to carry out its mission. Sufficient funding is
simply necessary to be impactful. I have been privileged to have received budgetary support from
the Administration and the Legislature to modernize and revolutionize the Massachusetts OIG,
which are key tools to enable the OIG to execute its statutory mission.
This funding has made it possible to produce meaningful results. When my tenure began,
I prioritized technology upgrades to ensure the OIG had the tools to perform its best work. To
that end, over the past two and a half years, we have made significant investments in IT to ensure
our work is housed in the most appropriate environments to meet our data security obligations
and that our systems can support the advanced data work that we do. Additionally, we upgraded
our Learning Management System to transform and streamline the overall student experience
for our adult learners, who are often managing full-time workloads along with attending OIG
trainings and earning OIG certificates. Our new LMS provides a time savings for the over 2,000
municipal and state employees, business partners, and members of the public who take OIG
Academy courses. Perhaps just as important, the LMS provides an engaging, user-friendly
experience that enhances learning.
Finally, I am proud that after much collaboration the OIG has updated its organizational
mission and vision statements to better encompass the full breadth of the OIG’s statutory
responsibilities. The objectives and aspirations inherent in our new mission and vision statements
are reflected throughout the pages of this report and are built upon the principles of
engagement, education, and investigation. Notably, building cases is not the only way for the OIG
to approach its work considering that in the Commonwealth there are around 300,000 public
employees who spend approximately $120 billion annually. It therefore makes sense that some
of our work involves assisting public stakeholders through educational and outreach efforts.
I have assembled an exceptional team of attorneys, directors, managers, investigators,
analysts, communicators, instructors, data scientists, IT professionals, operations, and
administrative specialists who do this work because of their commitment and dedication to our
mission. Together, they answer the call every day to strive to make government work better
tomorrow than it did today on behalf of the people of the Commonwealth.
As you review this report, you will come to understand the positive return on investment
that a statewide inspector general’s office provides through its work.
Sincerely,
Jeffrey S. Shapiro, Esq., CIG

In many ways, 2024 was a watershed year for the
Massachuse�s Office of the Inspector General

Inspector General con�nued to travel around the Commonwealth, mee�ng with municipal leaders, agency heads, and
other stakeholders to iden�fy opportuni�es to make government work be�er. The OIG con�nued to conduct meaningful
inves�gatory and compliance work, and issued impac�ul reports and le�ers.
The OIG’s 2024 ini�a�ves involved a wide range of inves�ga�ons, program reviews, and outreach, including:

Star Store lease review
The OIG took an in-depth look at a 20-year agreement
that the Division of Capital Asset Management and
Maintenance (DCAMM) signed with a private developer
to lease the historic Star Store building in downtown
New Bedford for use by UMass Dartmouth’s College of
Visual and Performing Arts. DCAMM executed the lease
pursuant to a legisla�ve authoriza�on. The

expenses, and other outlays during the term of the lease.

InJune 2024, Inspector General Shapiro wrote to Senate
President Karen Spilka and House Speaker Ron Mariano
calling on legisla�ve leadership to appoint a receiver to
be�er manage the Cannabis Control Commission’s (CCC)
day-to-day func�ons. The Inspector General also urged
legislators to amend the CCC’s enabling statute, Chapter
94G of the Massachuse�s General Laws, to put the
agency in a be�er posi�on to effec�vely regulate the

recommenda�on was based on the OIG’s conclusion that
the CCC’s enabling statute is unclear, contradictory, and
provides li�le guidance on the authority and respec�ve
responsibili�es of the CCC’s chair, commissioners, and
execu�ve director. Since 2022, the commission has spent
over $160,000 in public funds on media�on services to
clarify its governance structure, which to date has failed
to bring about improvements in the commission’s
opera�ons.
Post-re�rement earnings cap
The OIG’s advocacy resulted in the Legislature’s crea�on
of a 13-member task force to inves�gate post-re�rement
earnings caps for public employees returning to work for
the Commonwealth or one of its subdivisions. The
current law surrounding the amount of publicly funded
earnings a post-re�ree can make in addi�on to their since it requires a complicated calcula�on to determine

number is specific to each re�ree and is almost OIG’s recommenda�ons that lawmakers simplify the
impossible for the Commonwealth to track and enforce formula for calcula�ng these limits and increase its
oversight of post-re�ree earnings.
OIG Academy Learning Management System
Hand-in-hand with its rigorous oversight of the
Commonwealth and its municipali�es, the Inspector
General undertook several ini�a�ves in 2024 to enhance
the office’s opera�ons. The OIG implemented a new
Learning Management System (LMS) for the OIG
Academy, which presents a user-friendly online interface
where Academy learners can easily access their live and
self-paced courses and all associated materials. The LMS
also simplifies course catalog naviga�on, registra�on,
payments, and course history.

municipal leaders to understand the challenges they face
that impact how they do their work. By connec�ng with
municipali�es, the OIG can learn where the pressure
points for municipali�es are, par�cularly in public
procurements, understand the effect of those pressure
points, and iden�fy possible solu�ons to help
government work be�er. The OIG also engages municipal
leaders in discussions on educa�on, best prac�ces for
public procurements, knowledge transfer, and business
con�nuity. Each of these areas directly relates to how
municipal governments operate most effec�vely.

state and municipal employees, and members of the

past year, the OIG has met with stakeholders at all levels
of government to learn, share best prac�ces, and
promote innova�ve thinking about how we approach
problem solving to make government work be�er.
Proac�ve approach to mandate
Over the past year, the OIG has dedicated greater
resources than ever to a proac�ve approach to be�er
ensure that oversight and best prac�ces reach further
and deeper across the state. The OIG is known for the
work it has historically done to inves�gate allega�ons of
fraud, waste, and abuse. The OIG depends upon
dedicated public employees and conscien�ous members
of the public to report concerns to the OIG. A proac�ve
approach enhances the OIG’s ability to combat waste
and abuse – risks that are not reported as frequently as
fraud. The OIG uses this approach to find and address
problems earlier so that educa�on and preven�on are
the story, not criminal prosecu�on or a scathing report.

Since his appointment in October 2022, Inspector General Shapiro has focused on op�mizing the OIG’s

the OIG’s divisions and personnel into three bureaus, each headed by a bureau chief directly repor�ng to
the Inspector General.
Under the new structure, the three bureau chiefs are empowered to make �mely, business-oriented
decisions on ma�ers ranging from internal opera�ons to program reviews and inves�ga�ons.

Legisla�ve Recommenda�ons 37
Cannabis Control Commission
In June 2024, Inspector General Shapiro wrote to Senate President
Karen Spilka and House Speaker Ron Mariano calling on legisla�ve
leadership to appoint a receiver to manage the Cannabis Control
Commission’s (CCC) day-to-day func�ons. The Inspector General also
urged legislators to amend the CCC’s enabling statute, Chapter 94G
of the Massachuse�s General Laws, to put the agency in a be�er
posi�on to effec�vely regulate the Commonwealth’s cannabis
industry.
The Inspector General’s recommenda�on was based on the OIG’s conclusion that the
CCC’s enabling statute is unclear, contradictory, and provides li�le guidance on the
authority and respec�ve responsibili�es of the CCC’s chair, commissioners, and execu�ve
director. Since May 2022, the CCC has spent more than $160,000 on media�on services
related to a dra� governance charter. By the end of 2024, the commissioners had yet to
approve the new charter. In the OIG’s view, the CCC’s large revenue stream – $322 million
in tax and non-tax revenue in Fiscal Year 2023 –
bolsters the need for ac�on to protect the
Commonwealth’s interests in this emerging industry.
“As I have said publicly and repeatedly,

MBTA Priva�za�on of Service Review
The “Act Providing for the Delivery of State Services in a
Fiscally Responsible Manner” – known as the “Taxpayer
Protec�on Act” (Act) – was signed into law in 1993. The Act
requires state agencies and applicable authori�es like the
MBTA to follow certain procedures before hiring a vendor to
perform services valued at $500,000 or more “which are
substan�ally similar to and in lieu of” services that the state
en�ty provides. Hiring a company to perform services
previously administered by public employees is commonly
referred to as “priva�za�on.”

Acknowledgments
In an interview with WCAI in Falmouth, I was asked to describe my job. My sincere answer was that I
have the best job in government. As the Commonwealth’s Inspector General, I have many ways to
effect change and make government work be�er tomorrow than it did today. These changes are real,
and they have meaningful impact. The OIG’s greatest assets are the dedicated professionals who I
have the honor to work with at the OIG. While my name is on the door and the cover of this report,
my colleagues’ �reless commitment to our mission and their impac�ul work make my job rewarding.
We truly make a difference through our work.
I am also grateful to the many local, county, state, and federal officials who have taken �me to meet
with me and share their thoughts and experience with “the government.” As a leader, it is important
for me to have a broad understanding of what is working and what is not working. Whether through a
scheduled mee�ng in their office or a quick conversa�on at a conference, their candor and perspec�ve
are invaluable to me. These conversa�ons make me a be�er Inspector General.
I’ve spent my en�re career in public service because I believe in government. I believe in public
educa�on, public libraries, public transporta�on, and public housing. While I don’t determine how
funds are spent, I do work to ensure that they are spent as the Legislature and the Administra�on
intended. In doing so, I hope to reaffirm or restore the people’s faith in government.

2. The RAFT program provides funds to assist low-income Massachuse�s residents facing evic�on and other
housing emergencies.

Section 23:
3. Construc�on projects typically involve three phases that run sequen�ally: planning, design, and construc�on.
However, under the construc�on management at-risk model, the awarding authority uses a two-phase selec�on
process and hires a construc�on manager early in the design process to later oversee construc�on. The
awarding authority and construc�on manager nego�ate a maximum price for the project during the design
phase. The method is “at risk” because the construc�on manager is responsible for any costs exceeding that
amount. There is a third model for public works projects called the design-build model. In the design build
model, design and construc�on are combined into a single stage. The awarding authority executes a contract
with a single en�ty – e.g., a design-build firm, joint venture, or contractor that subcontracts with a designer – to
design and construct the project. To use CM at-risk or design-build models on projects of $5 million or more, an
awarding authority (except for certain exempt agencies) must apply to the OIG for approval to proceed.

4. Funding for the Jabish Brook Middle School project was ul�mately not approved by Belchertown voters.

Section 25:
5. Sec�on 72(e) of Chapter 22C of the Massachuse�s General Laws previously required the DSPO to produce a
separate annual report of its ac�vi�es in the preceding calendar year. Sec�on 5 of Chapter 2 of the Acts of 2023,

of the OIG’s officewide annual report required under Sec�on 12 of Chapter 12A of the Massachuse�s General
Laws.

Section 26:
6. Enacted into law as Chapter 253 of the Acts of 2020, the police reform legisla�on amended Sec�on 3 of Chapter
22C of the Massachuse�s General Laws to give the governor the authority to go outside of the MSP in
appoin�ng a colonel. Prior law required the appointment to come from within the MSP’s ranks.

Section 30:
10. In 2016, the MSP had yet to install automated vehicle locator (AVL) technology in its cruisers as an internal
control to increase trooper accountability and as a measure to increase trooper safety. For the review of 2016
shi�s, the DSPO used radio affilia�on data generated from each trooper’s cruiser radio.

Section 31:
11. These findings are based on reasonable conclusions drawn from the data reviewed. They are not defini�ve
findings that a trooper was engaged in wrongdoing or was not working in any law enforcement capacity. Further
inves�ga�on would be needed to make those determina�ons.

Section 32:
12. The order specifically states, “[I]n order to maintain strict accountability, the OIC will conduct a roll call with all
assigned officers and physically observe each member assigned to the ini�a�ve at the beginning and end of each
mobiliza�on. At the conclusion of the mobiliza�on the OIC will hold a demobiliza�on briefing.” 20-DFS-076.

Section 33:
13. These shi�s typically involve four troopers working as a team, including the OIC.

Section 34:
14. MPAC was established in October 1996 through the combined efforts of the Massachuse�s Chiefs of Police
Associa�on, the Massachuse�s Police Accredita�on Coali�on, and the Execu�ve Office of Public Safety and
Security. Pursuant to Execu�ve Order 392, MPAC was ini�ally created as a state agency within the Execu�ve
Office of Public Safety and Security, mandated to oversee accredita�on for police organiza�ons throughout the
Commonwealth. In February 2004, MPAC transi�oned from a state agency to a private nonprofit organiza�on.

Section 35:
15. To earn MPAC cer�fica�on, a police agency must demonstrate compliance with 159 mandatory standards. To
earn MPAC accredita�on, a police agency must demonstrate compliance with 257 mandatory standards, as well
as certain op�onal standards. MPAC requires a police agency to achieve cer�fica�on before it will assess the
agency for accredita�on. The Standards, T�� M������������ P����� A������������ C���������, h�ps://www.

Section 38:
18. The Procurement and Logis�cs Department does not handle procurements related to large-scale construc�on
and infrastructure. Those projects are handled by the Capital Delivery Department.

Section 39:
19. Although the formal records system went into effect in July 2023, the MBTA reported that it made efforts to
collect and maintain previous procurements prior to this date.

Section 40:
20. Automated fare collec�on is the MBTA’s latest fare collec�on system and will ul�mately replace the current
Charlie Card and Charlie Ticket system. With AFC 2.0, riders can pay their transit fares with a contactless debit
card, credit card, phone, or watch (equipped with a mobile wallet) by tapping contactless payment fare boxes (or
“fare readers”) located throughout the MBTA system.

22. CRRC MA is formerly known as CNR MA Corpora�on. CNR MA Corpora�on and its predecessor en��es are
controlled by CRRC Corpora�on Limited (CRRC), a Chinese state-owned and publicly traded rolling stock
manufacturer. CRRC is the largest rolling stock manufacturer in the world in terms of revenue, opera�ng 46

Re: Office of the Inspector General’s 2024 Annual Report
Dear Governor Healey and Commonwealth Leaders:
As the Commonwealth’s Inspector General, I take great pride in presenting the Office of
the Inspector General’s (OIG) 2024 Annual Report.
The accompanying report, prepared pursuant to the statutory requirement of Section 12
of Chapter 12A of the Massachusetts General Laws, highlights the work completed in Calendar
Year 2024 by the nearly 90 professional staff members of the OIG. I am humbled to lead this
group of dedicated public servants who embody the ideals that the Ward Commission envisioned
when it recommended, several decades ago, that the Massachusetts Legislature create such an
independent government oversight entity. The OIG has grown and evolved significantly since its
establishment in 1980 and remains a leader and example for the rest of the country.
This year, my second full year as Inspector General, I had the opportunity to lend support
for the concept of an office of the inspector general in other jurisdictions. In May 2024, I testified
separately before the Rhode Island House Committee on Finance and the Boston City Council’s

Committee on Government Operations in support of the creation of an OIG. While I did not speak
to their respective specific proposals, I was emphatic that a true inspector general’s office must
have a clear mandate, independence, the ability to conduct confidential investigations without
fear or favor, and whistleblower protection.
We are fortunate in Massachusetts to have a strong foundation on which the Office of
the Inspector General rests. The Legislature, following the recommendation of the Ward
Commission, wisely crafted the OIG’s enabling statute. It outlines clear qualifications, authority
and powers for the office and ensures its independence with nonconcurrent terms between the
appointers and the appointee. The statute also requires an appointer to show cause to remove
an inspector general.
We are also fortunate that the Commonwealth’s leadership continues to support the
importance of the OIG through appropriate funding to carry out its mission. Sufficient funding is
simply necessary to be impactful. I have been privileged to have received budgetary support from
the Administration and the Legislature to modernize and revolutionize the Massachusetts OIG,
which are key tools to enable the OIG to execute its statutory mission.
This funding has made it possible to produce meaningful results. When my tenure began,
I prioritized technology upgrades to ensure the OIG had the tools to perform its best work. To
that end, over the past two and a half years, we have made significant investments in IT to ensure
our work is housed in the most appropriate environments to meet our data security obligations
and that our systems can support the advanced data work that we do. Additionally, we upgraded
our Learning Management System to transform and streamline the overall student experience
for our adult learners, who are often managing full-time workloads along with attending OIG
trainings and earning OIG certificates. Our new LMS provides a time savings for the over 2,000
municipal and state employees, business partners, and members of the public who take OIG
Academy courses. Perhaps just as important, the LMS provides an engaging, user-friendly
experience that enhances learning.
Finally, I am proud that after much collaboration the OIG has updated its organizational
mission and vision statements to better encompass the full breadth of the OIG’s statutory
responsibilities. The objectives and aspirations inherent in our new mission and vision statements
are reflected throughout the pages of this report and are built upon the principles of
engagement, education, and investigation. Notably, building cases is not the only way for the OIG
to approach its work considering that in the Commonwealth there are around 300,000 public
employees who spend approximately $120 billion annually. It therefore makes sense that some
of our work involves assisting public stakeholders through educational and outreach efforts.
I have assembled an exceptional team of attorneys, directors, managers, investigators,
analysts, communicators, instructors, data scientists, IT professionals, operations, and
administrative specialists who do this work because of their commitment and dedication to our
mission. Together, they answer the call every day to strive to make government work better
tomorrow than it did today on behalf of the people of the Commonwealth.

As you review this report, you will come to understand the positive return on investment
that a statewide inspector general’s office provides through its work.
Sincerely,
Jeffrey S. Shapiro, Esq., CIG
Inspector General

The OIG’s 2024 ini�a�ves involved a wide range of inves�ga�ons, program reviews, and outreach, including:

Star Store lease review
The OIG took an in-depth look at a 20-year agreement
that the Division of Capital Asset Management and
Maintenance (DCAMM) signed with a private developer
to lease the historic Star Store building in downtown
New Bedford for use by UMass Dartmouth’s College of
Visual and Performing Arts. DCAMM executed the lease
pursuant to a legisla�ve authoriza�on. The
Commonwealth spent $60 million in rent, opera�ng
expenses, and other outlays during the term of the lease.

InJune 2024, Inspector General Shapiro wrote to Senate
President Karen Spilka and House Speaker Ron Mariano
calling on legisla�ve leadership to appoint a receiver to
be�er manage the Cannabis Control Commission’s (CCC)
day-to-day func�ons. The Inspector General also urged
legislators to amend the CCC’s enabling statute, Chapter
94G of the Massachuse�s General Laws, to put the
agency in a be�er posi�on to effec�vely regulate the

recommenda�on was based on the OIG’s conclusion that
the CCC’s enabling statute is unclear, contradictory, and
provides li�le guidance on the authority and respec�ve
responsibili�es of the CCC’s chair, commissioners, and
execu�ve director. Since 2022, the commission has spent
over $160,000 in public funds on media�on services to
clarify its governance structure, which to date has failed
to bring about improvements in the commission’s
opera�ons.
Post-re�rement earnings cap
The OIG’s advocacy resulted in the Legislature’s crea�on
of a 13-member task force to inves�gate post-re�rement
earnings caps for public employees returning to work for
the Commonwealth or one of its subdivisions. The
current law surrounding the amount of publicly funded
earnings a post-re�ree can make in addi�on to their since it requires a complicated calcula�on to determine

number is specific to each re�ree and is almost OIG’s recommenda�ons that lawmakers simplify the
impossible for the Commonwealth to track and enforce formula for calcula�ng these limits and increase its
oversight of post-re�ree earnings.
OIG Academy Learning Management System
Hand-in-hand with its rigorous oversight of the
Commonwealth and its municipali�es, the Inspector
General undertook several ini�a�ves in 2024 to enhance
the office’s opera�ons. The OIG implemented a new
Learning Management System (LMS) for the OIG
Academy, which presents a user-friendly online interface
where Academy learners can easily access their live and
self-paced courses and all associated materials. The LMS
also simplifies course catalog naviga�on, registra�on,
payments, and course history.

municipal leaders to understand the challenges they face
that impact how they do their work. By connec�ng with
municipali�es, the OIG can learn where the pressure
points for municipali�es are, par�cularly in public
procurements, understand the effect of those pressure
points, and iden�fy possible solu�ons to help
government work be�er. The OIG also engages municipal
leaders in discussions on educa�on, best prac�ces for
public procurements, knowledge transfer, and business
con�nuity. Each of these areas directly relates to how
municipal governments operate most effec�vely.

past year, the OIG has met with stakeholders at all levels
of government to learn, share best prac�ces, and
promote innova�ve thinking about how we approach
problem solving to make government work be�er.
Proac�ve approach to mandate
Over the past year, the OIG has dedicated greater
resources than ever to a proac�ve approach to be�er
ensure that oversight and best prac�ces reach further
and deeper across the state. The OIG is known for the
work it has historically done to inves�gate allega�ons of
fraud, waste, and abuse. The OIG depends upon
dedicated public employees and conscien�ous members
of the public to report concerns to the OIG. A proac�ve
approach enhances the OIG’s ability to combat waste
and abuse – risks that are not reported as frequently as
fraud. The OIG uses this approach to find and address
problems earlier so that educa�on and preven�on are
the story, not criminal prosecu�on or a scathing report.

Legisla�ve Recommenda�ons 37

Cannabis Control Commission
In June 2024, Inspector General Shapiro wrote to Senate President
Karen Spilka and House Speaker Ron Mariano calling on legisla�ve
leadership to appoint a receiver to manage the Cannabis Control
Commission’s (CCC) day-to-day func�ons. The Inspector General also
urged legislators to amend the CCC’s enabling statute, Chapter 94G
of the Massachuse�s General Laws, to put the agency in a be�er
posi�on to effec�vely regulate the Commonwealth’s cannabis
industry.
The Inspector General’s recommenda�on was based on the OIG’s conclusion that the
CCC’s enabling statute is unclear, contradictory, and provides li�le guidance on the
authority and respec�ve responsibili�es of the CCC’s chair, commissioners, and execu�ve
director. Since May 2022, the CCC has spent more than $160,000 on media�on services
related to a dra� governance charter. By the end of 2024, the commissioners had yet to
approve the new charter. In the OIG’s view, the CCC’s large revenue stream – $322 million
in tax and non-tax revenue in Fiscal Year 2023 –
bolsters the need for ac�on to protect the
Commonwealth’s interests in this emerging industry.
“As I have said publicly and repeatedly,

The “Act Providing for the Delivery of State Services in a
Fiscally Responsible Manner” – known as the “Taxpayer

requires state agencies and applicable authori�es like the
MBTA to follow certain procedures before hiring a vendor to
perform services valued at $500,000 or more “which are
substan�ally similar to and in lieu of” services that the state

Acknowledgments
In an interview with WCAI in Falmouth, I was asked to describe my job. My sincere answer was that I
have the best job in government. As the Commonwealth’s Inspector General, I have many ways to
effect change and make government work be�er tomorrow than it did today. These changes are real,
and they have meaningful impact. The OIG’s greatest assets are the dedicated professionals who I
have the honor to work with at the OIG. While my name is on the door and the cover of this report,
my colleagues’ �reless commitment to our mission and their impac�ul work make my job rewarding.
We truly make a difference through our work.
I am also grateful to the many local, county, state, and federal officials who have taken �me to meet
with me and share their thoughts and experience with “the government.” As a leader, it is important
for me to have a broad understanding of what is working and what is not working. Whether through a
scheduled mee�ng in their office or a quick conversa�on at a conference, their candor and perspec�ve
are invaluable to me. These conversa�ons make me a be�er Inspector General.
I’ve spent my en�re career in public service because I believe in government. I believe in public
educa�on, public libraries, public transporta�on, and public housing. While I don’t determine how
funds are spent, I do work to ensure that they are spent as the Legislature and the Administra�on
intended. In doing so, I hope to reaffirm or restore the people’s faith in government.

1. EOHLC was known as the Department of Housing and Community Development (DHCD) at the �me of Jones’
employment.
2. The RAFT program provides funds to assist low-income Massachuse�s residents facing evic�on and other
housing emergencies.
3. Construc�on projects typically involve three phases that run sequen�ally: planning, design, and construc�on.
However, under the construc�on management at-risk model, the awarding authority uses a two-phase selec�on
process and hires a construc�on manager early in the design process to later oversee construc�on. The
awarding authority and construc�on manager nego�ate a maximum price for the project during the design
phase. The method is “at risk” because the construc�on manager is responsible for any costs exceeding that
amount. There is a third model for public works projects called the design-build model. In the design build
model, design and construc�on are combined into a single stage. The awarding authority executes a contract
with a single en�ty – e.g., a design-build firm, joint venture, or contractor that subcontracts with a designer – to
design and construct the project. To use CM at-risk or design-build models on projects of $5 million or more, an
awarding authority (except for certain exempt agencies) must apply to the OIG for approval to proceed.
4. Funding for the Jabish Brook Middle School project was ul�mately not approved by Belchertown voters.
5. Sec�on 72(e) of Chapter 22C of the Massachuse�s General Laws previously required the DSPO to produce a
separate annual report of its ac�vi�es in the preceding calendar year. Sec�on 5 of Chapter 2 of the Acts of 2023,
effec�ve March 29, 2023, amended Sec�on 72(e) by direc�ng that the DSPO annual report be included as part
of the OIG’s officewide annual report required under Sec�on 12 of Chapter 12A of the Massachuse�s General
Laws.
6. Enacted into law as Chapter 253 of the Acts of 2020, the police reform legisla�on amended Sec�on 3 of Chapter
22C of the Massachuse�s General Laws to give the governor the authority to go outside of the MSP in
appoin�ng a colonel. Prior law required the appointment to come from within the MSP’s ranks.

10. In 2016, the MSP had yet to install automated vehicle locator (AVL) technology in its cruisers as an internal
control to increase trooper accountability and as a measure to increase trooper safety. For the review of 2016
shi�s, the DSPO used radio affilia�on data generated from each trooper’s cruiser radio.
11. These findings are based on reasonable conclusions drawn from the data reviewed. They are not defini�ve
findings that a trooper was engaged in wrongdoing or was not working in any law enforcement capacity. Further
inves�ga�on would be needed to make those determina�ons.
12. The order specifically states, “[I]n order to maintain strict accountability, the OIC will conduct a roll call with all
assigned officers and physically observe each member assigned to the ini�a�ve at the beginning and end of each
mobiliza�on. At the conclusion of the mobiliza�on the OIC will hold a demobiliza�on briefing.” 20-DFS-076.
13. These shi�s typically involve four troopers working as a team, including the OIC.
14. MPAC was established in October 1996 through the combined efforts of the Massachuse�s Chiefs of Police
Associa�on, the Massachuse�s Police Accredita�on Coali�on, and the Execu�ve Office of Public Safety and
Security. Pursuant to Execu�ve Order 392, MPAC was ini�ally created as a state agency within the Execu�ve
Office of Public Safety and Security, mandated to oversee accredita�on for police organiza�ons throughout the
