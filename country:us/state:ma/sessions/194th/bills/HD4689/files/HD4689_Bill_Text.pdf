December, 2024
Dear Members of the General Court:
I am pleased to submit the FY2023 METCO Program Report to the Legislature pursuant
Chapter 126 of the Acts of 2022, line item 7010-0012.
The purpose of the state-funded METCO program is to expand educational opportunities,
increase diversity, and reduce racial isolation for students in urban and suburban
communities, by fostering the opportunity for children from Boston and Springfield to
attend public schools in neighboring communities in order for students to develop a
deeper understanding of one another in an integrated public-school setting. The METCO
program provides the opportunity for students in participating school districts to
experience the advantages of learning and working in a racially and ethnically diverse
setting. The statute that authorizes the METCO program is M.G.L, Chapter 76, Section 12A –
The Racial Imbalance Act.
The METCO program has historically enrolled approximately 3,200 students per school
calendar year. METCO, Inc. and participating METCO districts have continued to maintain
and enhance their programming around student enrollment, school culture, and
transportation in support of students, staff, and families. In FY2023, METCO, Inc., the
identified vendor of the Boston METCO program, created a pilot program for school
districts participating in the METCO program to develop a continuum of practice to assess
a district's progress in integration; to audit curriculum to ensure cultural representation;
and to implement restorative discipline practices to provide a culturally and linguistically
responsive education for all students, in line with their strategic multi-year Antiracism Road
Map.
Within this report you will find an overview of the METCO program, including a description
of the services provided by METCO, Inc.; a report on METCO student outcomes; school and
district grant expenditures; transportation services; and student demographics.
Sincerely,
Russell D. Johnston

Acting Commissioner of Elementary and Secondary Education

Transportation Services
MHQ contracted with two (2) vendors (First Student and Eastern Bus) to provide bus transportation for METCO students
traveling to and from 8 of the thirty-three receiving Boston METCO school districts.2 The remaining 25 Boston METCO districts
oversee their own transportation contracts.
METCO, Inc. provides contract and bid services in accordance with Chapter 30B, MGL and monitors the terms of the bid
specifications and contracts to assess quality performance of the vendor to each contracted school district. Bus vendors are
expected to supply quality service and are monitored for fiscal and operational compliance. METCO, Inc. meets and
communicates with respective bus company management personnel when necessary. The management services provided by
METCO, Inc. includes daily monitoring of service for both morning and afternoon commutes, working with school district
business managers and METCO Directors to review invoices (when requested) and address inquiries when they arise. It is
important to note that contracted districts receive monthly invoices for services performed and issue payment directly to the
vendors including deductions for penalties. The transportation manager at METCO, Inc. may be consulted when
requested/warranted to assist assessment of penalties to be deducted from invoices. METCO, Inc. provides planning and
routing for contracted districts as well as consultation with other METCO Directors. The Transportation Manager of METCO,
Inc. stays abreast of local, state, and national trends and concerns in the school bus industry in order to provide optimum
service to districts.
Like the majority of Boston METCO districts, the four receiving Springfield METCO districts oversee their own transportation
contracts and are responsible for monitoring student transportation service.3
