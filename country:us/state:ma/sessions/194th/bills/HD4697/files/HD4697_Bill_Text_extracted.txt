Executive Summary
Background
Th Massachusetts Department of Transportation (MassDOT) submits this report to
the Massachusetts State Legislature pursuant to the Massachusetts Budget Act of
2024 Chapter 28, Outside Section 99. The report provides a review of performance
data collected for the Fiscal Year 2024 term of the FY2024-25 Bilateral
Performance Management Memoranda of Understanding (MOUs) between the 15
Regional Transit Authorities (RTA) and MassDOT.
The Commonwealth provides the RTAs with State Contract Assistance (SCA) each
State Fiscal Year (SFY) based on an agreed-to distribution formula. RTAs primarily
use SCA to fund operating needs. The MassDOT Rail and Transit Division (RTD)
oversees and collaborates with its RTA partners to maximize investment and
enhance accountability and transparency. Through the bilateral MOU process and
resulting performance management program, MassDOT RTD and the RTAs ensure
that SCA advances the goals and targets established by each system. The MOUs
include performance metrics and targets for the legislatively defined categories of
ridership, customer service and satisfaction, asset management and financial
performance, as well as RTA established baselines and timelines for
implementation. The program encourages data-driven decision making and is a
valuable tool used to identify continued progress, best practices, and innovative
solutions to challenges facing the RTAs. The program is particularly relevant as the
RTAs work to build ridership in the post pandemic environment.
Performance Analysis & Reporting
The performance metrics collected and analyzed from each RTA include universal
industry measures: ridership, customer service and satisfaction, asset
management, and financial performance, as well as the additional key area of
safety performance (Table 1). Each agency’s SFY2024 performance data is
summarized in the Performance Metric Analysis, Asset Management Performance
Metric Analysis and Safety Performance Metric Analysis sections of this report.
These metrics are common key performance indicators that are frequently used
by transit professionals to determine the health and vitality of a transit system, are
trackable over time, and use data that is widely available to transit agencies and
operators.1 2 Supplementary data collected includes annually reported metrics on
external partnerships, fleet composition and system-specific metrics that highlight

Much of this report focuses on the performance measures identified in Table 1, as
they enable comparisons and analyses across RTAs to identify and share best
practices among peers, and pinpoint which strategies increase ridership, provide
operating efficiencies, and increase customer satisfaction and reliability.
The Ridership and Customer Service & Satisfaction data is summarized into
analysis tables that display the monthly raw data, the quarterly subtotals, and the
year-to-date (YTD) actuals. The Financial Performance data displays only the YTD
actuals. Due to accrual-based accounting methods, revenue and expense figures
can exhibit variability from month-to-month, and YTD actuals provide a
normalized representation of RTA performance.
The Asset Management and Safety data are aggregated based on each RTA’s
annual submittal to the National Transit Database (NTD), which includes the
target, the actual performance, and the resulting difference for each category as
defined by the Federal Transit Administration (FTA). This report also provides
graphical representations of average RTA performance. Text is included to
highlight the key takeaways on overall RTA performance. Comparative bar charts
have been added for selected metrics.
Key Performance Results and Takeaways on RTA Ridership
As discussed in previous RTA Performance Progress Reports to the Legislature,
although negatively impacted by the pandemic, RTA ridership has continued to
demonstrate steady upward recovery that continued through FY2024 (Figure 1).

fare free funding. Together, this investment resulted in new service and expansion
of existing services across the Commonwealth. Service expansion has focused
primarily on extending service hours later in the evenings and on weekends.
Of note, in FY2024, BRTA, FRTA, MeVa, SRTA and WRTA each exceeded pre-
pandemic (FY2019) ridership levels. Several RTAs came close to recovering to
FY2019 levels, and all fifteen RTAs saw year over year ridership growth compared to
FY2023.
Figure 2 displays the percent change in annual modal RTA ridership relative to the
pre-pandemic levels in FY2019. At its lowest point at the start of the pandemic, RTA
fixed route and demand response ridership dropped to -76.98% and -77.96% of
FY2019 ridership levels, respectively. At the close of FY2024, the percentage drop in
ridership for demand response had rebounded to -21.65%, and fixed route
ridership exceeded pre-pandemic ridership by 16.08%.

While the RTAs have not collectively exceeded pre-pandemic ridership, the trend
year over year has been a steady march upward. RTAs survived the worst of the
pandemic ridership erosion with most RTAs experiencing steady, consistent
ridership gains in SFY2024. The systems have taken advantage of significant
increases in Commonwealth funding to attract more riders and consistently
deliver quality service.
Key Performance Results and Takeaways on RTA Finances
RTA revenues were dramatically impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, and policy
decisions have been made by both RTAs and MassDOT to address those impacts.
Many RTAs implemented broad fare free pilot programs in SFY2024 as a result of
5
available state funding. This has had a direct and expected negative impact on
farebox recovery ratios (FRR) (Figure 5).

Offsetting the reduced fare revenue, SCA increased in the SFY2024 state budget,
which also included $15 million for fare free pilot programs. The RTAs also took
advantage of multiple grant programs in the state budget to implement new
services, and continued to pursue competitive federal grant dollars. In Federal
Fiscal Year (FFY)2024, CCRTA was awarded $14.6 million for the purchase of hybrid
buses and VTA was awarded $3.8 million for the purchase of battery electric buses
under the FTA’s discretionary competitive Low-No Emission Program. MassDOT was
also awarded $360,800 to test a statewide mobility program under FTA’s
discretionary competitive Innovative Coordinated Access and Mobility Program.
Conclusions
SFY2024 ridership metrics have continued to demonstrate a steady recovery from
pandemic induced ridership lows. This can be attributed to the demographics of
the RTAs’ customer base consisting of durable riders who rely on public transit
daily for essential trips to work, the grocery store, medical and educational
institutions, coupled with significant increases in the Commonwealth’s investment
in RTAs. In SFY2024, the Commonwealth provided a significant increase in state
contract assistance funding which RTAs maximized to expand and extend hours of
service to better meet the needs of their customers and attract additional “choice”
riders. The Commonwealth’s significant increase in fare free funding also enabled
6
the RTAs to expand the financial accessibility of transit services for all, catalyzing
improved ridership metrics.
Importantly, the RTAs have also proved themselves to be adaptable and reliable in
the face of changing norms and expectations around transit service. With hybrid
and remote work flattening traditional peak travel times, RTAs have adjusted by
extending service hours, especially on nights and weekends. The RTAs have also
continued to deploy more flexible transit services, such as varied vehicle sizes and
microtransit services to complement traditional fixed route and demand response
services.
In addition, the RTAs have continued to lead by example with efforts to
decarbonize their fleets, purchasing low or no emission vehicles to replace diesel
powered vehicles, upgrading their maintenance facilities to include electric
charging equipment, and adding solar heating and cooling. MassDOT RTD has
continued to support the RTAs on climate change goals through the Battery
Electric Bus Phase II Study, which will build upon the Phase I Study conducted in
2019 and assist each RTA in executing their carbon reduction implementation
strategies. Transitioning to zero emission vehicles is capital intensive and must be
tailored to each RTA’s geographical and operating characteristics to be
successful. The BEB Phase II Study will help each RTA execute strategies that that
best meet their unique needs, while supporting the Commonwealth’s climate
change goals.
Over the last five years, the RTAs have continued to demonstrate the importance
of steady, disciplined leadership and a willingness to maximize available
resources and think creatively about how to provide the best possible services to
their riders.

Legislative Directive
The Massachusetts Department of Transportation (MassDOT) is submitting this
report to the Massachusetts State Legislature in accordance with the
requirements of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts Fiscal Year 2024 Budget
Chapter 28 of the Acts of 2023, Outside Section 99. The Act states that:
The department may require each regional transit authority to provide data
on ridership, customer service and satisfaction, asset management and
financial performance, including farebox recovery, and shall compile any
such collected data into a report on the performance of regional transit
authorities and detail each authority’s progress towards meeting the
performance metrics established in each memorandum of understanding.
Since 2020, MassDOT and each of the 15 Regional Transit Authorities (RTA) have
negotiated and executed three two-year term bilateral Memoranda of
Understanding (MOU) for the periods of SFY2020-SFY2021, SFY2022-SFY2023, and
SFY2024-SFY2025. This report presents performance results for SFY2024, which is
governed by the terms of the SFY2024-SFY2025 MOU.
The bilateral MOUs are based on a system of performance metrics established by
MassDOT and incorporate Performance Targets most relevant to each RTA’s
system in the categories of Ridership, Customer Service and Satisfaction, Asset
Management, and Financial Performance, including Farebox Recovery. The MOUs
are not punitive and thus do not impose penalties for not meeting metrics and
targets. MassDOT and the RTAs have agreed to measure the MOU metrics against
RTA established baselines, including agreed upon timelines for implementation.
The Commonwealth provides the RTAs with state operating funds called State
Contract Assistance (SCA), which is passed through the MassDOT Rail & Transit
Division (RTD) each budget cycle. In addition to the distribution of SCA based on
an agreed-to allocation formula, RTD oversees and collaborates with its RTA
partners using innovative business processes to maximize investment and provide
the highest levels of accountability and impact. Through the bilateral MOU process
and resulting performance management program, RTD and the RTAs can ensure
that SCA is spent advancing the goals and targets established by each system.
The bilateral MOUs have encouraged data-driven decision making and agency
transparency to the public, which is particularly relevant as the RTAs continue to
grow public transit ridership and identify services that meet evolving rider
preferences. The MOUs have been valuable in identifying best practices and
innovative solutions to challenges facing the RTAs.

Memoranda of Understanding
Since 2020, MassDOT and each of the 15 RTAs have negotiated three two-year
term bilateral MOU for RTA performance management. These MOUs have covered
the SFY2020-SFY2021, SFY2022-SFY2023 and SFY2024-SFY2025 time periods. During
negotiations, the RTAs provided feedback for continuous improvement in the
performance management process including the need to reduce duplicative
reporting, increase standardization, and improve efficiencies in data collection. In
addition to alleviating RTA concerns, RTD has used the negotiation process to
enhance collaboration with the RTAs.
This report provides performance results for SFY2024 which is governed by the
terms of the SFY2024-2025 MOU. The final agreement included standardized
performance metric collection, the collection of transit safety data, financial
planning documentation, and agreed upon reporting deadlines to better allow for
RTAs to collect and review data prior to submission. Each MOU generally adheres
to the principles below:

Performance metrics in the four key areas of ridership, customer service &
satisfaction, asset management, and financial performance, as well as the
key area of safety (Table 3). Data collected includes, but is not limited to:
o a subset of metrics already reported annually to the National Transit
Database (NTD)10,
o each RTA’s Transit Asset Management (TAM) plan targets, and
o each RTA’s NTD Safety & Security reports, if applicable.

Annually reported metrics on external partnerships, fleet composition and
system-specific metrics that highlight key initiatives or system-identified
performance indicators (Table 4).

Mutually agreed upon baselines, interim milestones, and targets for each
performance metric.

consist of annual targets for SFY2024 and SFY2025.
6
Over the course of the two-year term, the RTAs provide quarterly reports to
MassDOT RTD containing monthly data on progress in meeting the performance
targets in their MOUs. Each quarterly report is required to be submitted 60 days
following the close of the quarter to allow each RTA adequate time for data
collection and review.
Performance Management Program
Based on the agreed upon terms in the MOUs, MassDOT RTD designed a
performance management program comprising quarterly data collection and
analysis of RTA submitted data. The program operates in three stages:

Section 42:
1. Data collection

Section 43:
2. Data analysis

Section 44:
3. Data reporting
Performance Data Collection
Each RTA was provided a reporting template designed to capture their system’s
identified performance metrics for each month of each quarter, as well as any
stretch performance metrics an RTA chose to include in the MOU. The template
included fields to enter raw data and then calculated ratios or averages to
produce the performance metrics.
Performance Data Analysis
For each quarter, the quarterly subtotal was calculated based on the raw monthly
data provided. Calculating the quarterly subtotals throughout the fiscal year
helps identify seasonal variations in the data. The raw monthly data is used to
calculate year-to-date (YTD) actual values, which is compared against the
identified target values by calculating the percent difference between the actual
and target value, as detailed in Table 5.

Performance Data Reporting
All analyses have been compiled into this progress report, which covers the data
collected for SFY2024, or year one, of the SFY2024-2025 bilaterally negotiated
MOUs. The performance management analysis and reporting process is
summarized in Figure 6.

For the Ridership and Customer Service & Satisfaction metric categories, the data
has been summarized to display the monthly raw data, the quarterly subtotals,
and the YTD actuals. For the Financial Performance metric category, the data has
been summarized to display only the YTD actual. Due to the accrual-based
accounting method used by all transit agencies that report data to NTD, all
expenses and income are reported in the month they are incurred or received. This
can result in variability from month-to-month, especially for systems that allow for
bulk purchase of fare media by partnering organizations. The YTD actual provides
a “normalized” representation of each RTA’s progress towards achieving the
financial metric targets. Monthly data and/or quarterly subtotals can be provided
upon request.
This report also includes a simple analysis of the Asset Management and Safety
metric categories, the data for which was collected in mid-November 2024, after
the RTAs submit their NTD reported TAM Plan asset inventory data. The asset
management and safety data are, respectively, discussed in greater detail in the
8
“Asset Management Data Collection & Reporting” and “Safety Data Collection &
Reporting” subsections.
Report Organization
This report organizes the agreed upon metrics into two main categories: (1) key
performance metrics and (2) annually reported metrics.
The key performance metrics are common performance indicators frequently
used by the transit industry to determine the health and vitality of a transit system.
These metrics are trackable over time and use
data that is widely available to transit agencies. 11 Table 6. Color coded formatting used
12 Use of these metrics allows for comparisons and for the performance metric analysis.
analyses to identify best practices and policies
across the RTAs, enhancing peer learning across
the Commonwealth. Trends can be better
understood, both individually and statewide, and
can point to which policies or initiatives helped
increase ridership, reduced costs, and/or
increased customer satisfaction. The Performance
Metric Analysis section is organized in tables by
metric and mode of operation (Fixed Route,
Demand Response, Demand Taxi and Commuter
Bus). Definitions of each metric are also provided,
as well as graphical representations of average
RTA performance in relation to the identified
targets. Summary text is also included to highlight
the key takeaways on overall RTA performance.
Color-coded formatting of the value comparisons
provides an easy reference for determining
whether an RTA has met an identified target
(Table 6).
On an individual basis, the annually reported metrics enable each RTA to tell their
story through specific goals and values. By comparing an RTA’s progress to a self-
identified target, each authority’s performance is directly tied to agency defined

goals and to customer satisfaction.13 14 Each agency’s annual reported metrics are
included in Appendix B – RTA Profiles. The additional performance metric data has
been organized in a similar manner to the universal performance metrics.
Asset Management Data Collection & Reporting
FTA requires that every agency develop a transit asset management (TAM) plan
for capital assets used to provide public transportation and submit an asset
inventory, performance targets, and a narrative report to NTD as part of the yearly
reporting process. The performance targets identified in the TAM plans are for the
following asset categories: rolling stock, equipment, and facilities (Table 6).15 Each
target looks at the percentage of each asset category that is not in state of good
repair (SGR). Lower performance percentages indicate a fleet or facility that has a
better SGR. All public transportation vehicles, be it revenue service rolling stock or
non-revenue equipment, are evaluated based on an established useful life
benchmark (ULB), or the expected lifecycle (age) for a particular vehicle.16
Facilities are evaluated using the Transit Economic Requirements Model (TERM)
scale. The TERM scale grades facility condition on a scale of 1.0 to 5.0, with 1.0
representing a facility that is “critically damaged or in need of immediate repair
[and/or is] well past useful life” and 5.0 representing a facility that has “no visible
defects [and/or is in] new or near new condition.”17
Asset Category FTA Established Performance Target
Rolling Stock % of revenue vehicles exceeding ULB
Equipment % of non-revenue vehicles exceeding ULB
Facilities % of facilities rated under 3.0 on the TERM scale
Table 6. FTA established performance target definitions by asset category.
Of the 15 RTAs, 14 are Tier 1 public transit providers under the TAM Plan Rule,
meaning that they are a recipient of federal funding and own or operate at least
one hundred and one (101) vehicles in revenue service.18 These 14 RTAs completed
individual TAM plans. FRTA is the only RTA recognized as a Tier 2 provider by the
TAM Plan Rule, meaning that FRTA operates less than 101 revenue vehicles19. FRTA
did not develop its own TAM plan, and instead, opted to be included in MassDOT’s

Group Plan. MassDOT’s Group Plan consists of FRTA and the Mashpee Wampanoag
Tribe, and therefore all targets in the three asset categories are inclusive of both
systems’ asset inventories. The Tribe does not submit the asset inventory data to
NTD until April of each year, so the performance measures included in this report
only include FRTA’s assets.
As required by the MOU, each RTA reports once per year if they met or did not
meet the targets identified in the respective TAM plans by providing a copy of the
Asset Inventory Module (AIM) reports as submitted to NTD. The data is aggregated
and included in the Asset Management Performance Metric Analysis section of
this report. The aggregated data includes the target for the fiscal year, the actual
performance, and the resulting difference for each asset class within the three
asset categories. In a similar manner to the Performance Metric Analysis, color-
coded formatting provides easy reference for determining whether an RTA has
met a TAM Plan identified target.
It is important to note the asset management data in this progress report is still
under review with NTD. NTD undergoes an extensive post-submission validation
process, resulting in many agencies receiving final approval on their submitted
reports as late as April or May of the following year. Therefore, the performance
data is subject to change before publication by NTD.
Safety Data Collection & Reporting
Under the FTA’s Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan (PTASP) Final Rule,
certain public transportation operators are required to develop a safety plan that
includes processes and procedures to implement a Safety Management System
(SMS) and safety performance targets.20 The rule applies to all agencies who are
recipients or sub-recipients of Section 5307 Urbanized Area Formula Program
funds, and does not apply to those who receive only Section 5310 Enhanced
Mobility of Seniors and Individuals with Disabilities Formula Program funds and/or

Section 45:
Section 5311 Rural Area Formula Program funds.21 For the RTAs, the PTASP rule
applies to 12 out of the 15 systems. Each agency uses the PTASP as a guide for
proactive safety policy and as a comprehensive approach to safety
management. The plans are reviewed, and updated if needed, on an annual basis.
Each PTASP must include safety performance measures for the categories of
fatalities, injuries, and safety events. Targets are developed for both the raw
number of instances of each category and as a rate per 1,000,000 vehicle revenue
miles (VRM). For the twelve Section 5037 recipient RTAs, safety data is reported to
20 Federal Transit Administration. “Public Transportation Agency Safety Plans.” (https://www.transit.dot.gov/PTASP)
21 Federal Transit Administration. “Public Transportation Agency Safety Plans.” (https://www.transit.dot.gov/PTASP)
11
the NTD through the Safety & Security (S&S) Module. Major events are reported to
the NTD no later than 30 days after the date of the event and are aggregated
based on a calendar year.22
As required by the MOU, each RTA provides MassDOT with any reports submitted to
FTA as part of the PTASP rule. As such, each of the twelve systems subject to this
rule submit a copy of their S&S reports. The data is collected on a calendar year,
then aggregated and included in the Safety Performance Metric Analysis section
of this progress report. The aggregated data includes the target for the calendar
year, the actual performance, and the resulting difference for each performance
measure category by mode. In a similar manner to the Performance Metric
Analysis, color-coded formatting provides easy reference for determining whether
an RTA has met a PTASP identified target.
For the three Section 5311 recipient RTAs that are not subject to the PTASP rule,
MassDOT required that an additional target for preventable accidents per 100,000
VRM be included in the MOU. This is a historically collected performance metric
that provides a simplified, but comprehensive, measure of safety events. This data
is reported through the same methodology as the performance data described in
the Performance Data Collection section, collected on a fiscal year, and is
aggregated and included in the Safety Performance Metric Analysis section of this
progress report. The aggregated data includes the baseline, the target for the
fiscal year, the actual performance, and the percent variation for each mode.
Again, color-coded formatting provides easy reference for determining whether
an RTA has met an identified target.

Figure 7. Systemwide annual totals from S SFY2024 displaying the rebound trend
in RTA ridership.
Two major changes for the RTAs in SFY2024 were the continued substantial
increase in the level of investment by the Commonwealth in RTA operations via
state contract assistance and a significant increase in fare free funding. Taken
together, these two initiatives resulted in RTAs across the Commonwealth
continuing to add new service and expand existing services, especially with
service hours later into the nights and on weekends.
Of note, in SFY2024, BRTA, FRTA, MeVa, SRTA and WRTA exceeded pre-pandemic
(FY2019) ridership levels in their systems. Several RTAs came close to recovering to
S SFY2023.

During the pandemic, the RTAs were vital for workers who needed transit service to
travel to and from essential workplaces. The RTAs provided these “durable” riders
with consistent, reliable service, and have built on that base to grow their ridership
year over year as they approach pre-pandemic ridership levels collectively. Every
15
type of RTA rider has benefited from increases in frequency and service hours,
allowing RTAs to attract more choice riders.
Financial Trends
RTA revenues were dramatically impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, and policy
decisions have been made by both RTAs and MassDOT to address those impacts.
It is also important to note that many RTAs implemented broad fare free pilot
programs in SFY2024 as a result of state funds being available. This has had a
direct and expected impact on farebox recovery ratios (FRR) (Figure 5).

SCA has increased in recent years, helping the RTAs offset lower fare revenue. The
SFY2024 state budget also included $15 million for fare free pilot programs. The
RTAs also took advantage of multiple federal grant programs in the state budget
to implement new, innovative services, and continued to pursue competitive
federal grant dollars. In FFY2024, the Cape Cod Regional Transit Authority (CCRTA)
was awarded $14.6 million for the purchase of hybrid buses and Vineyard Transit
Authority (VTA) was awarded $3.8 million for the purchase of battery electric
buses under the Federal Transit Administration’s (FTA) discretionary competitive
Low-No Emission Program. MassDOT was also awarded $360,800 to test a
statewide mobility program under FTA’s discretionary competitive Innovative
Coordinated Access and Mobility Program.

Conclusions
The demographics of the RTAs’ customer base generally consisting of durable
riders who rely on mass transit daily for essential trips to work, the grocery store,
medical and educational institutions. Coupled with an historic increase in the
Commonwealth’s investment in RTAs, SFY2024 ridership metrics have continued to
demonstrate a steady recovery trend from pandemic induced ridership lows. In
SFY2024, the Commonwealth provided a large increase in SCA funding which RTAs
effectively maximized to expand and extend hours of service to better meet the
needs of their customers and attract additional “choice” riders. The
Commonwealth’s sizeable increase in fare free funding also enabled the RTAs to
expand the financial accessibility of transit services for all, supporting improved
ridership metrics.
Importantly, the RTAs have also continued to prove themselves to be adaptable
and reliable in the face of changing norms and expectations around transit
service. With hybrid and remote work flattening traditional peak travel times, RTAs
have adjusted by extending service hours especially on nights and weekends. The
RTAs have also continued to deploy more flexible transit services, such as varied
vehicle sizes and microtransit services to complement traditional fixed route and
demand response services.
In addition, the RTAs have continued to lead by example with efforts to
decarbonize their fleets, purchasing low or no emission vehicles to replace diesel
powered vehicles, upgrading their maintenance facilities to include electric
charging equipment, and adding solar heating and cooling. MassDOT RTD has
continued to support the RTAs on climate change goals through the Battery
Electric Bus Phase II Study, which has built upon the Phase I Study conducted in
2019 and to assist each RTA in executing their carbon reduction implementation
strategies. Transitioning to zero emission vehicles is capital intensive and must be
tailored to each RTA’s geographical and operating characteristics to be
successful. The BEB Phase II Study has helped each RTA execute strategies that
that best meet their unique needs, while supporting the Commonwealth’s climate
change goals.
Over the last five years, the RTAs have continued to demonstrate the importance
of strong leadership and a willingness to maximize available resources and think
creatively about how to provide the best possible services to their riders.

Universal Performance Metric Analysis
Unlinked Passenger Trips (UPT)
Unlinked Passenger Trips (UPT): this metric represents the total passenger boardings across an agency’s operations, no matter how many vehicles the person may have used to travel from origin
to destination. UPT is critical to understanding ridership trends and travel demand. Because the target value for UPT is reported as an accumulation (accum.) over the fiscal year, the year-to-date
actual UPT values were compared against their respective target values. Those UPT values that were calculated to be less than 100% of the target value were formatted blue, and those UPT values
that were calculated to be more than 100% of the target value were formatted in green.

UPT / Vehicle Revenue Mile (VRM)
Unlinked Passenger Trips per Revenue Mile (UPT / VRM): This metric is a measure of productivity and is helpful to understand ridership activity on a per mile basis and is calculated by dividing the
total number of revenue miles (the total number of miles a vehicle is in revenue service) into the total UPT. Systems that operate longer mileage routes in less dense, rural environments typically
perform well on a per mile basis. The actual and target values were compared by calculating the % difference (variance) of the actual versus the milestone/target. The calculated values were
formatted blue for negative variance and green for positive variance.

Fixed route productivity in relation to vehicle revenue miles operated displays typical seasonal trends in ridership behavior. Average productivity increased in Q1 and the start of Q2, with the arrival
of college students on campus, but then decreased in the later part of Q2 and Q3, attributed to seasonal decreases in ridership due to colder months and inclement weather. Despite these trends,
thirteen of the fifteen RTAs exceeded their fixed route targets/ Demand response productivity is more elastic than fixed route, but also more relative as it is dependent on trip length.

UPT / Vehicle Revenue Hour (VRH)
Unlinked Passenger Trips per Revenue Hour (UPT / VRH): This metric is a measure of productivity and is helpful to understand how intense ridership activity is on a per unit of time basis, and is
calculated by dividing the total number of revenue hours (the total number of hours a vehicle is in revenue service) into the UPT. Systems that operate shorter mileage routes in more compact,
urban environments typically perform well on a per hour basis. The actual and target values were compared by calculating the % difference (variance) of the actual against the milestone/target
value, formatted blue for negative variance and green for positive variance.

Fixed route productivity in relation to vehicle revenue hours closely mirrored expected trends in overall seasonal ridership. Demand response productivity was, as in recent years, more elastic in its
variability than fixed route. The lack of predictable, consistent trip length in terms of both miles and hours is the main driving force behind this variability. Eleven of the fifteen RTAs met or exceeded
their fixed route UPT/VRH targets.

On-Time Performance (OTP)
On-time Performance: This metric is defined as the percentage of time that a transit vehicle arrives at a stop or other location within a prescribed time range of its schedule and helps to convey
how vehicles meet their scheduled time points on routes. OTP is a reliability and service quality measure that helps to assess the passenger’s day-to-day experience with a transit agency. The
actual and target OTP values were compared by calculating the percent difference (variance) between the two values. Blue values indicate on-time performance values that are lower than the
target value while green values indicate on-time performance value that are higher than the target value.

Q3. FRTA’s demand taxi service ended in January 2024 due grant expiration. FRTA contracted with a taxi operated and thus cannot track OTP.

Scheduled Trips Operated (STO)
Schedule Trips Operated: This metric is defined as the percentage of trips from the pre-determined system schedule that are completed by the operator. For fixed route, a scheduled trip is a single
trip that is identified for a certain route. Each route makes multiple trips per day, based on the schedule. For demand response, a scheduled trip is a trip that is booked by a qualifying customer and
is based on the specified pick-up and drop-off location. STO is a reliability and service quality measure that helps to assess the passenger’s day-to-day experience with a transit agency. The
actual and target STO values were compared by calculating the percent difference (variance) between the two values. Blue values indicate on-time performance values that are lower than the
target value while green values indicate on-time performance value that are higher than the target value.

For SFY2024, the average percentage of scheduled trips operated for fixed route service consistently exceeded the monthly targets. A majority of RTAs met their annual targets, and those that did
not missed their targets by an average of about 1%. Potential reasons for a trip to not run as scheduled include maintenance issues or inclement weather.

Farebox Recovery Ratio (FRR)
Farebox Recovery Ratio (FRR): This metric relays the proportion of operating expenses that are paid for by fare revenues and is a measure of cost effectiveness. Nearly all transit agencies’ farebox
recovery ratios are well under 100%, as other revenue streams in addition to fares are used to cover operations costs. The actual and target FRR values were compared by calculating the percent
difference (variance) between the two values. Blue values indicate farebox recovery ratios that are lower than the target value while green values indicate farebox recovery ratios that are
higher than the target value.

While farebox recovery ratio has been considered a consistent indicator of the financial health of a given system, it is important to note that SFY2024 was the first year of significant increases in
state funding to the RTAs to be used to offer expanded fare free service. The drop in FRR in October can be directly attributed to the start of pilot operations and the RTAs subsequently collecting
fewer fares. While not all RTAs will offer fare free service year-round or systemwide, the use of this metric to measure financial health is impacted by the expansion of fare free services.

Operating Expenses / Vehicle Revenue Mile (VRM)
Operating Expense per Vehicle Revenue Mile: This metric is a cost efficiency measure that gives context to operational efficiency on a per mile basis and is calculated by dividing the total number
of revenue miles (the total number of miles a vehicle is in revenue service) into the total operating cost for a given mode of operations for a specific agency. Systems that operate longer mileage
routes in less dense, rural environments typically perform well on a per mile basis. The actual and target values were compared by calculating the % difference (variance), formatted blue for
positive variance and green for negative variance.

Not all revenue streams are consistent; as with the farebox recovery ratios, large accruals in expenses can cause cost efficiency performance to fluctuate from month to month, and quarter to
quarter. Generally, fixed route costs per revenue mile were consistent outside of October’s spike. Demand response on the other hand varied more by month to month, but fully half of the year saw
demand response services run more efficiently than the targeted metric, despite the variability of trip length.

Operating Expense per Vehicle Revenue Hour: This metric is a cost efficiency measure and helps to understand operational efficiency on a per hour basis and is calculated by dividing the total
number of revenue hour (the total number of hours a vehicle is in revenue service) into the total operating cost for a given mode of operations for a specific agency. Systems that operate shorter
mileage routes in more compact, urban environments typically perform well on a per hour basis. The actual and target values were compared by calculating their % difference (variance),

Across both fixed route and demand response service, RTAs had difficulty meeting targets for operating expenses per vehicle revenue hour. With increased funding, RTAs began to run service with
extended hours on nights and weekends. New service can take months or sometimes years to fully realize its potential, and while the RTAs saw increased ridership generally, these specific service
additions and enhancements likely have not yet reached their full ridership potential.

Operating Expenses / Unlinked Passenger Trips (UPT)
Operating Expense per Unlinked Passenger Trip: This metric is a cost efficiency measure and helps to understand operational efficiency on a per passenger basis and is calculated by dividing the
total number of revenue hour (the total number of hours a vehicle is in revenue service) into the total operating cost for a given mode of operations for a specific agency. The actual and target
values were compared by calculating their % difference (variance), formatted blue for positive variance and green for negative variance.

Unlike the previous metric, increased ridership from new and expanded service resulted in more RTAs hitting their targets for operating expenses per unlinked passenger trip with 11 of 15 RTAs
meeting or exceeding their target. Fixed route was more impacted by seasonal ridership changes as RTAs kept service on the road despite lower ridership in the winter months, whereas demand
response once again showed its consistent variability from month to months.

Asset Management Performance Metric Analysis
Rolling Stock
Rolling Stock: Revenue transit vehicles such as buses, vans, cars, railcars,
locomotives, trolley cars and buses, and ferry boats.23 On average, RTA rolling stock
fleets consist of buses, cutaways, vans, and minivans. RTA rolling stock fleets are
generally in a state of good repair (SGR), despite RTA reported delays in vehicle
deliveries because of pandemic related supply shortages. With a few exceptions,
most of the reported rolling stock that is beyond useful life is under 30%. Lower
performance percentages are representative of a better SGR. Based on the SFY2024
performance, RTAs should prioritize capital replacement of cutaway, bus, and van
fleets.
Notes: FRTA’s targets are representative of the MassDOT Group TAM Plan, which includes FRTA
and the Mashpee Wampanoag Tribe. The Tribe does not submit asset data until April, so the
current performance is reflective of FRTA’s assets only.

support fleets consist of automobiles, trucks, and other rubber tile vehicles. With a
few exceptions, most of the reported automobile equipment that is beyond useful life
is over 30%. Trucks and other rubber tire vehicle equipment are slightly in a better
state of good repair (SGR), though nearly half of this equipment is beyond useful life
of over 30%. Support fleet SGR performance ranges between 0% and 100% beyond the
useful life benchmark. Lower performance percentages are representative of a
better SGR. Based on the SFY2024 performance, RTAs should prioritize capital
replacement of service automobiles.

Fatalities
Fatalities: A reportable event that occurs at a transit revenue facility, maintenance
facility, or rail yard, on transit right-of-way or infrastructure during a transit-related
maintenance activity; or involves a transit revenue vehicle that results in a fatality.36
Fatalities that occur because of illnesses, drug overdoses, or other natural causes
are not reportable.37 With two exceptions, RTAs’ CY2023 performance was on target
for fatalities.
Note: This metric is only reported by Section 5307 recipient RTAs. PVTA assigns targets and

Summary & Next Steps
This SFY2024 progress report provides a description of the system of performance
metrics bilaterally agreed to by MassDOT RTD and the RTAs and includes analysis of
individual performance results, as required by the Act. The data underscores the
individual characteristics of each RTA and demonstrates that the recovery from the
COVID-19 pandemic has impacted each in different ways. For the SFY2024-2025 MOU
period, RTD recognized that targeting a return to SFY2019 performance is not a
sustainable practice for all RTAs, and therefore required the use of a midpoint
baseline for target setting purposes. As shown in Figure 11, the RTAs on average
exceeded ridership targets for both modes. The demand response mode performed
quite well, likely due to microtransit or other flexible service offerings.

In addition to the use of a midpoint baseline, RTD required the RTAs to include a
recovery baseline of SFY2019 data used to monitor the RTAs gradual recovery from
the pandemic. Analysis of the recovery baselines show that ridership and overall
productivity, particularly for fixed route services, are still trending below SFY2019
performance (Figure 13). Farebox recovery also remains lower than FY2019,
attributable to fare free opportunities presented by several RTAs.

MassDOT RTD expects that the results of the performance management program will
continue to prove to be a valuable tool in identifying continued progress, best
practices, and innovative adaptations to challenges the RTAs face. The program
encourages data-driven decision making and agency transparency to the general
public, which is particularly relevant as the RTAs work to rebuild customers’
confidence in the safety, accessibility, and availability of riding public transit.
MassDOT RTD will continue to deliver this report annually with updated actual and
target values derived from the MOU process. Continuing to collect actual and target
values over time will allow for longitudinal analyses that highlight trends, best
practices, and successful innovative policies, as well as the impact of external
factors, including the COVID-19 pandemic. Detail on the annually collected metrics
and supplemental information on each RTA’s system can be found in Appendix B.

Appendix A – RTA Background Information
In Massachusetts, there are 15 RTAs outside of the Greater Boston Area (Figure 14).
Each RTA is locally governed by an Advisory Board and provides a combination of
fixed route and demand response transit services, including ADA paratransit, to their
member communities. Some RTAs opt to provide additional modes of service,
including demand taxi and commuter bus. These services, while managed by the
RTA’s administrative staff, are provided through contracted operators. In FY2024, the
RTAs supplied 26,986,142 in unlinked passenger trips across all modes.40
Figure 14: Map of the RTAs in Massachusetts, including the Massachusetts Bay
Transportation Authority (MBTA) bus system.
The RTAs are funded through five sources of revenue: farebox revenue, own-source
revenue (e.g., revenues generated from advertising, parking, etc.), local assessments,
and state and Federal funding. The Commonwealth provides the RTAs with operating
funds in the form of State Contract Assistance (SCA), which is passed through the
40 GrantsPlus+ Monthly Service Data Reports
2
Massachusetts Department of Transportation (MassDOT) (Figure 15). SCA is
distributed by MassDOT among the RTAs based on a long-standing allocation
formula. In FY2014, the Legislature forward funded the RTAs, meaning that SCA is
provided during the current fiscal year, rather than as a reimbursement for service
provided in the previous year. Beginning in FY2019, the RTAs were also allocated an
additional sum of operating funds to be used for a competitive discretionary grant
program. The competitive Discretionary Grant Program enabled the RTAs to test new
and innovative service models, such as to deploy microtransit pilots, marketing and
outreach campaigns, and gather data on local demand for evening and weekend
service through pilot programs. This allocation ended in FY2021. The FY2023 budget
included $2.5 million to be used on grants for means-tested, discounted or fare-free
pilot programs to be administered by the RTAs, and this funding was increased to $15
million in FY2024. In FY2025, the RTAs received an additional $10 million in SCA
funding, as well as $30 million for fare free programs, among other grant programs.

Figure 15: Total SCA allocation (in millions) for all RTAs (FY2007-FY2025).
Although they have similar service goals, the RTAs serve diverse areas throughout
Massachusetts, including many rural areas, much of suburban Boston, college towns
as well as suburban and urban colleges and universities, other large and small
urbanized areas, and areas where ridership is significantly affected by seasonal
tourism. While some RTAs are predominantly defined by their seasonal tourism
service or college and university service, many RTAs serve commuters, tourists,
students for a variety of trip purposes, which speaks to the flexibility they must
employ. RTA ridership began to decline in FY2017, mirroring national trends (Figure
16). This trend was exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, but the RTAs have made
significant, continued progress in recovering lost ridership in each of the last three
fiscal years.

The RTAs’ operating budgets are funded through four main sources of revenue:
directly generated revenue (farebox and own-source revenue), local assessments,
and state and Federal funding (Figure 17). Operating funds (SCA) provided by the
Commonwealth are typically used for payroll and administration.

Appendix B – RTA Profiles
Appendix B provides an overview of each regional transit authority and includes the
following:
SUMMARY PROFILES
The summary statistics for each RTA were extracted from the data submitted to
MassDOT by the RTAs over the course of FY2024, as well as the agencies’ websites.
These summaries provide a high-level overview of the RTAs’ history, administration,
recent operations, and jurisdictions served.
PERFORMANCE METRICS
For each RTA, a series of charts are included that provide an overview of all
performance metrics and targets for each RTA, as identified in the FY2024-FY2025
MOUs. The charts are the same values that were reported by metric in the
Performance Metrics section and are now grouped by RTA.
ASSET MANAGEMENT METRICS
For each RTA, the NTD reported asset management metrics have been summarized
by asset category. These are the same values that were reported by metric in the
Asset Management Performance Metrics section and are now grouped by RTA. The
performance reported should be viewed as draft, as the data is under review by NTD.
SAFETY PERFORMANCE METRICS
For each RTA, the NTD reported safety metrics have been summarized by event type
and rate. These are the same values that were reported by metric in the Safety
Performance Metrics section and are now grouped by RTA. This data is reported on a
calendar year, rather than a fiscal year.
ANNUALLY REPORTED PERFORMANCE METRICS
The Annually Reported Metrics reflect the unique measures that each RTA tracks and
finds relevant to their system. Since these metrics are specific to each RTA, this

Section 334:
section does not include comparative interpretation or analysis. Each RTA reports on
fleet composition based on fuel type, the number of external partnerships
established, and two metrics of choice. The first “choice” metric, defined as the CRTP
Choice Metric, is tied to a recommendation from each system’s Comprehensive
6
Regional Transit Plan, a regional planning document completed in 2020. The second
“choice” metric is the RTA’s choice, defined as the Free Choice Metric, and represents
a goal or value that is particularly important to both the system and its rider.

Executive Summary
Background
Th Massachusetts Department of Transportation (MassDOT) submits this report to
the Massachusetts State Legislature pursuant to the Massachusetts Budget Act of
2024 Chapter 28, Outside Section 99. The report provides a review of performance
data collected for the Fiscal Year 2024 term of the FY2024-25 Bilateral
Performance Management Memoranda of Understanding (MOUs) between the 15
Regional Transit Authorities (RTA) and MassDOT.
The Commonwealth provides the RTAs with State Contract Assistance (SCA) each
State Fiscal Year (SFY) based on an agreed-to distribution formula. RTAs primarily
use SCA to fund operating needs. The MassDOT Rail and Transit Division (RTD)
oversees and collaborates with its RTA partners to maximize investment and
enhance accountability and transparency. Through the bilateral MOU process and
resulting performance management program, MassDOT RTD and the RTAs ensure
that SCA advances the goals and targets established by each system. The MOUs
include performance metrics and targets for the legislatively defined categories of
ridership, customer service and satisfaction, asset management and financial
performance, as well as RTA established baselines and timelines for
implementation. The program encourages data-driven decision making and is a
valuable tool used to identify continued progress, best practices, and innovative
solutions to challenges facing the RTAs. The program is particularly relevant as the
RTAs work to build ridership in the post pandemic environment.
Performance Analysis & Reporting
The performance metrics collected and analyzed from each RTA include universal
industry measures: ridership, customer service and satisfaction, asset
management, and financial performance, as well as the additional key area of
safety performance (Table 1). Each agency’s SFY2024 performance data is
summarized in the Performance Metric Analysis, Asset Management Performance
Metric Analysis and Safety Performance Metric Analysis sections of this report.
These metrics are common key performance indicators that are frequently used
by transit professionals to determine the health and vitality of a transit system, are
trackable over time, and use data that is widely available to transit agencies and
operators.1 2 Supplementary data collected includes annually reported metrics on
external partnerships, fleet composition and system-specific metrics that highlight

Much of this report focuses on the performance measures identified in Table 1, as
they enable comparisons and analyses across RTAs to identify and share best
practices among peers, and pinpoint which strategies increase ridership, provide
operating efficiencies, and increase customer satisfaction and reliability.
The Ridership and Customer Service & Satisfaction data is summarized into
analysis tables that display the monthly raw data, the quarterly subtotals, and the
year-to-date (YTD) actuals. The Financial Performance data displays only the YTD
actuals. Due to accrual-based accounting methods, revenue and expense figures
can exhibit variability from month-to-month, and YTD actuals provide a
normalized representation of RTA performance.
The Asset Management and Safety data are aggregated based on each RTA’s
annual submittal to the National Transit Database (NTD), which includes the
target, the actual performance, and the resulting difference for each category as
defined by the Federal Transit Administration (FTA). This report also provides
graphical representations of average RTA performance. Text is included to
highlight the key takeaways on overall RTA performance. Comparative bar charts
have been added for selected metrics.
Key Performance Results and Takeaways on RTA Ridership
As discussed in previous RTA Performance Progress Reports to the Legislature,
although negatively impacted by the pandemic, RTA ridership has continued to
demonstrate steady upward recovery that continued through FY2024 (Figure 1).

fare free funding. Together, this investment resulted in new service and expansion
of existing services across the Commonwealth. Service expansion has focused
primarily on extending service hours later in the evenings and on weekends.
Of note, in FY2024, BRTA, FRTA, MeVa, SRTA and WRTA each exceeded pre-
pandemic (FY2019) ridership levels. Several RTAs came close to recovering to
FY2019 levels, and all fifteen RTAs saw year over year ridership growth compared to
FY2023.
Figure 2 displays the percent change in annual modal RTA ridership relative to the
pre-pandemic levels in FY2019. At its lowest point at the start of the pandemic, RTA
fixed route and demand response ridership dropped to -76.98% and -77.96% of
FY2019 ridership levels, respectively. At the close of FY2024, the percentage drop in
ridership for demand response had rebounded to -21.65%, and fixed route
ridership exceeded pre-pandemic ridership by 16.08%.

While the RTAs have not collectively exceeded pre-pandemic ridership, the trend
year over year has been a steady march upward. RTAs survived the worst of the
pandemic ridership erosion with most RTAs experiencing steady, consistent
ridership gains in SFY2024. The systems have taken advantage of significant
increases in Commonwealth funding to attract more riders and consistently
deliver quality service.
Key Performance Results and Takeaways on RTA Finances
RTA revenues were dramatically impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, and policy
decisions have been made by both RTAs and MassDOT to address those impacts.
Many RTAs implemented broad fare free pilot programs in SFY2024 as a result of
5

available state funding. This has had a direct and expected negative impact on
farebox recovery ratios (FRR) (Figure 5).

Offsetting the reduced fare revenue, SCA increased in the SFY2024 state budget,
which also included $15 million for fare free pilot programs. The RTAs also took
advantage of multiple grant programs in the state budget to implement new
services, and continued to pursue competitive federal grant dollars. In Federal
Fiscal Year (FFY)2024, CCRTA was awarded $14.6 million for the purchase of hybrid
buses and VTA was awarded $3.8 million for the purchase of battery electric buses
under the FTA’s discretionary competitive Low-No Emission Program. MassDOT was
also awarded $360,800 to test a statewide mobility program under FTA’s
discretionary competitive Innovative Coordinated Access and Mobility Program.
Conclusions
SFY2024 ridership metrics have continued to demonstrate a steady recovery from
pandemic induced ridership lows. This can be attributed to the demographics of
the RTAs’ customer base consisting of durable riders who rely on public transit
daily for essential trips to work, the grocery store, medical and educational
institutions, coupled with significant increases in the Commonwealth’s investment
in RTAs. In SFY2024, the Commonwealth provided a significant increase in state
contract assistance funding which RTAs maximized to expand and extend hours of
service to better meet the needs of their customers and attract additional “choice”
riders. The Commonwealth’s significant increase in fare free funding also enabled
6

the RTAs to expand the financial accessibility of transit services for all, catalyzing
improved ridership metrics.
Importantly, the RTAs have also proved themselves to be adaptable and reliable in
the face of changing norms and expectations around transit service. With hybrid
and remote work flattening traditional peak travel times, RTAs have adjusted by
extending service hours, especially on nights and weekends. The RTAs have also
continued to deploy more flexible transit services, such as varied vehicle sizes and
microtransit services to complement traditional fixed route and demand response
services.
In addition, the RTAs have continued to lead by example with efforts to
decarbonize their fleets, purchasing low or no emission vehicles to replace diesel
powered vehicles, upgrading their maintenance facilities to include electric
charging equipment, and adding solar heating and cooling. MassDOT RTD has
continued to support the RTAs on climate change goals through the Battery
Electric Bus Phase II Study, which will build upon the Phase I Study conducted in
2019 and assist each RTA in executing their carbon reduction implementation
strategies. Transitioning to zero emission vehicles is capital intensive and must be
tailored to each RTA’s geographical and operating characteristics to be
successful. The BEB Phase II Study will help each RTA execute strategies that that
best meet their unique needs, while supporting the Commonwealth’s climate
change goals.
Over the last five years, the RTAs have continued to demonstrate the importance
of steady, disciplined leadership and a willingness to maximize available
resources and think creatively about how to provide the best possible services to
their riders.

Legislative Directive
The Massachusetts Department of Transportation (MassDOT) is submitting this
report to the Massachusetts State Legislature in accordance with the
requirements of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts Fiscal Year 2024 Budget
Chapter 28 of the Acts of 2023, Outside Section 99. The Act states that:
The department may require each regional transit authority to provide data
on ridership, customer service and satisfaction, asset management and
financial performance, including farebox recovery, and shall compile any
such collected data into a report on the performance of regional transit
authorities and detail each authority’s progress towards meeting the
performance metrics established in each memorandum of understanding.
Since 2020, MassDOT and each of the 15 Regional Transit Authorities (RTA) have
negotiated and executed three two-year term bilateral Memoranda of
Understanding (MOU) for the periods of SFY2020-SFY2021, SFY2022-SFY2023, and
SFY2024-SFY2025. This report presents performance results for SFY2024, which is
governed by the terms of the SFY2024-SFY2025 MOU.
The bilateral MOUs are based on a system of performance metrics established by
MassDOT and incorporate Performance Targets most relevant to each RTA’s
system in the categories of Ridership, Customer Service and Satisfaction, Asset
Management, and Financial Performance, including Farebox Recovery. The MOUs
are not punitive and thus do not impose penalties for not meeting metrics and
targets. MassDOT and the RTAs have agreed to measure the MOU metrics against
RTA established baselines, including agreed upon timelines for implementation.
The Commonwealth provides the RTAs with state operating funds called State
Contract Assistance (SCA), which is passed through the MassDOT Rail & Transit
Division (RTD) each budget cycle. In addition to the distribution of SCA based on
an agreed-to allocation formula, RTD oversees and collaborates with its RTA
partners using innovative business processes to maximize investment and provide
the highest levels of accountability and impact. Through the bilateral MOU process
and resulting performance management program, RTD and the RTAs can ensure
that SCA is spent advancing the goals and targets established by each system.
The bilateral MOUs have encouraged data-driven decision making and agency
transparency to the public, which is particularly relevant as the RTAs continue to
grow public transit ridership and identify services that meet evolving rider
preferences. The MOUs have been valuable in identifying best practices and
innovative solutions to challenges facing the RTAs.

Memoranda of Understanding
Since 2020, MassDOT and each of the 15 RTAs have negotiated three two-year
term bilateral MOU for RTA performance management. These MOUs have covered
the SFY2020-SFY2021, SFY2022-SFY2023 and SFY2024-SFY2025 time periods. During
negotiations, the RTAs provided feedback for continuous improvement in the
performance management process including the need to reduce duplicative
reporting, increase standardization, and improve efficiencies in data collection. In
addition to alleviating RTA concerns, RTD has used the negotiation process to
enhance collaboration with the RTAs.
This report provides performance results for SFY2024 which is governed by the
terms of the SFY2024-2025 MOU. The final agreement included standardized
performance metric collection, the collection of transit safety data, financial
planning documentation, and agreed upon reporting deadlines to better allow for
RTAs to collect and review data prior to submission. Each MOU generally adheres
to the principles below:

Performance metrics in the four key areas of ridership, customer service &
satisfaction, asset management, and financial performance, as well as the
key area of safety (Table 3). Data collected includes, but is not limited to:
o a subset of metrics already reported annually to the National Transit
Database (NTD)10,
o each RTA’s Transit Asset Management (TAM) plan targets, and
o each RTA’s NTD Safety & Security reports, if applicable.

Annually reported metrics on external partnerships, fleet composition and
system-specific metrics that highlight key initiatives or system-identified
performance indicators (Table 4).

Mutually agreed upon baselines, interim milestones, and targets for each
performance metric.

10 As stated on the National Transit Database website [https://www.transit.dot.gov/ntd], the NTD is a “…repository of data about the
financial, operating and asset conditions of American transit systems. The NTD records the financial, operating, and asset
condition of transit systems helping to keep track of the industry and provide public information and statistics. The NTD is
designed to support local, state and regional planning efforts and help governments and other decision-makers make multi-year
comparisons and perform trend analyses.”

The target setting process for the SFY2024-SFY2025 MOU consisted of annual
targets in SFY2024 and SFY2025 for the financial and asset management
categories, and a two-year target (SFY2025) with an interim milestone (SFY2024)
for the ridership and customer service categories. Annually reported metrics
consist of annual targets for SFY2024 and SFY2025.
6

Over the course of the two-year term, the RTAs provide quarterly reports to
MassDOT RTD containing monthly data on progress in meeting the performance
targets in their MOUs. Each quarterly report is required to be submitted 60 days
following the close of the quarter to allow each RTA adequate time for data
collection and review.
Performance Management Program
Based on the agreed upon terms in the MOUs, MassDOT RTD designed a
performance management program comprising quarterly data collection and
analysis of RTA submitted data. The program operates in three stages:
1. Data collection
2. Data analysis
3. Data reporting
Performance Data Collection
Each RTA was provided a reporting template designed to capture their system’s
identified performance metrics for each month of each quarter, as well as any
stretch performance metrics an RTA chose to include in the MOU. The template
included fields to enter raw data and then calculated ratios or averages to
produce the performance metrics.
Performance Data Analysis
For each quarter, the quarterly subtotal was calculated based on the raw monthly
data provided. Calculating the quarterly subtotals throughout the fiscal year
helps identify seasonal variations in the data. The raw monthly data is used to
calculate year-to-date (YTD) actual values, which is compared against the
identified target values by calculating the percent difference between the actual
and target value, as detailed in Table 5.

Performance Data Reporting
All analyses have been compiled into this progress report, which covers the data
collected for SFY2024, or year one, of the SFY2024-2025 bilaterally negotiated
MOUs. The performance management analysis and reporting process is
summarized in Figure 6.

Figure 6. Performance target reporting and data analysis process.
For the Ridership and Customer Service & Satisfaction metric categories, the data
has been summarized to display the monthly raw data, the quarterly subtotals,
and the YTD actuals. For the Financial Performance metric category, the data has
been summarized to display only the YTD actual. Due to the accrual-based
accounting method used by all transit agencies that report data to NTD, all
expenses and income are reported in the month they are incurred or received. This
can result in variability from month-to-month, especially for systems that allow for
bulk purchase of fare media by partnering organizations. The YTD actual provides
a “normalized” representation of each RTA’s progress towards achieving the
financial metric targets. Monthly data and/or quarterly subtotals can be provided
upon request.
This report also includes a simple analysis of the Asset Management and Safety
metric categories, the data for which was collected in mid-November 2024, after
the RTAs submit their NTD reported TAM Plan asset inventory data. The asset
management and safety data are, respectively, discussed in greater detail in the
8

“Asset Management Data Collection & Reporting” and “Safety Data Collection &
Reporting” subsections.
Report Organization
This report organizes the agreed upon metrics into two main categories: (1) key
performance metrics and (2) annually reported metrics.
The key performance metrics are common performance indicators frequently
used by the transit industry to determine the health and vitality of a transit system.
These metrics are trackable over time and use
data that is widely available to transit agencies. 11 Table 6. Color coded formatting used
12 Use of these metrics allows for comparisons and for the performance metric analysis.
analyses to identify best practices and policies
across the RTAs, enhancing peer learning across
the Commonwealth. Trends can be better
understood, both individually and statewide, and
can point to which policies or initiatives helped
increase ridership, reduced costs, and/or
increased customer satisfaction. The Performance
Metric Analysis section is organized in tables by
metric and mode of operation (Fixed Route,
Demand Response, Demand Taxi and Commuter
Bus). Definitions of each metric are also provided,
as well as graphical representations of average
RTA performance in relation to the identified
targets. Summary text is also included to highlight
the key takeaways on overall RTA performance.
Color-coded formatting of the value comparisons
provides an easy reference for determining
whether an RTA has met an identified target
(Table 6).
On an individual basis, the annually reported metrics enable each RTA to tell their
story through specific goals and values. By comparing an RTA’s progress to a self-
identified target, each authority’s performance is directly tied to agency defined

goals and to customer satisfaction.13 14 Each agency’s annual reported metrics are
included in Appendix B – RTA Profiles. The additional performance metric data has
been organized in a similar manner to the universal performance metrics.
Asset Management Data Collection & Reporting
FTA requires that every agency develop a transit asset management (TAM) plan
for capital assets used to provide public transportation and submit an asset
inventory, performance targets, and a narrative report to NTD as part of the yearly
reporting process. The performance targets identified in the TAM plans are for the
following asset categories: rolling stock, equipment, and facilities (Table 6).15 Each
target looks at the percentage of each asset category that is not in state of good
repair (SGR). Lower performance percentages indicate a fleet or facility that has a
better SGR. All public transportation vehicles, be it revenue service rolling stock or
non-revenue equipment, are evaluated based on an established useful life
benchmark (ULB), or the expected lifecycle (age) for a particular vehicle.16
Facilities are evaluated using the Transit Economic Requirements Model (TERM)
scale. The TERM scale grades facility condition on a scale of 1.0 to 5.0, with 1.0
representing a facility that is “critically damaged or in need of immediate repair
[and/or is] well past useful life” and 5.0 representing a facility that has “no visible
defects [and/or is in] new or near new condition.”17
Asset Category FTA Established Performance Target
Rolling Stock % of revenue vehicles exceeding ULB
Equipment % of non-revenue vehicles exceeding ULB
Facilities % of facilities rated under 3.0 on the TERM scale
Table 6. FTA established performance target definitions by asset category.
Of the 15 RTAs, 14 are Tier 1 public transit providers under the TAM Plan Rule,
meaning that they are a recipient of federal funding and own or operate at least
one hundred and one (101) vehicles in revenue service.18 These 14 RTAs completed
individual TAM plans. FRTA is the only RTA recognized as a Tier 2 provider by the
TAM Plan Rule, meaning that FRTA operates less than 101 revenue vehicles19. FRTA
did not develop its own TAM plan, and instead, opted to be included in MassDOT’s

Group Plan. MassDOT’s Group Plan consists of FRTA and the Mashpee Wampanoag
Tribe, and therefore all targets in the three asset categories are inclusive of both
systems’ asset inventories. The Tribe does not submit the asset inventory data to
NTD until April of each year, so the performance measures included in this report
only include FRTA’s assets.
As required by the MOU, each RTA reports once per year if they met or did not
meet the targets identified in the respective TAM plans by providing a copy of the
Asset Inventory Module (AIM) reports as submitted to NTD. The data is aggregated
and included in the Asset Management Performance Metric Analysis section of
this report. The aggregated data includes the target for the fiscal year, the actual
performance, and the resulting difference for each asset class within the three
asset categories. In a similar manner to the Performance Metric Analysis, color-
coded formatting provides easy reference for determining whether an RTA has
met a TAM Plan identified target.
It is important to note the asset management data in this progress report is still
under review with NTD. NTD undergoes an extensive post-submission validation
process, resulting in many agencies receiving final approval on their submitted
reports as late as April or May of the following year. Therefore, the performance
data is subject to change before publication by NTD.
Safety Data Collection & Reporting
Under the FTA’s Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan (PTASP) Final Rule,
certain public transportation operators are required to develop a safety plan that
includes processes and procedures to implement a Safety Management System
(SMS) and safety performance targets.20 The rule applies to all agencies who are
recipients or sub-recipients of Section 5307 Urbanized Area Formula Program
funds, and does not apply to those who receive only Section 5310 Enhanced
Mobility of Seniors and Individuals with Disabilities Formula Program funds and/or
Section 5311 Rural Area Formula Program funds.21 For the RTAs, the PTASP rule
applies to 12 out of the 15 systems. Each agency uses the PTASP as a guide for
proactive safety policy and as a comprehensive approach to safety
management. The plans are reviewed, and updated if needed, on an annual basis.
Each PTASP must include safety performance measures for the categories of
fatalities, injuries, and safety events. Targets are developed for both the raw
number of instances of each category and as a rate per 1,000,000 vehicle revenue
miles (VRM). For the twelve Section 5037 recipient RTAs, safety data is reported to

11

the NTD through the Safety & Security (S&S) Module. Major events are reported to
the NTD no later than 30 days after the date of the event and are aggregated
based on a calendar year.22
As required by the MOU, each RTA provides MassDOT with any reports submitted to
FTA as part of the PTASP rule. As such, each of the twelve systems subject to this
rule submit a copy of their S&S reports. The data is collected on a calendar year,
then aggregated and included in the Safety Performance Metric Analysis section
of this progress report. The aggregated data includes the target for the calendar
year, the actual performance, and the resulting difference for each performance
measure category by mode. In a similar manner to the Performance Metric
Analysis, color-coded formatting provides easy reference for determining whether
an RTA has met a PTASP identified target.
For the three Section 5311 recipient RTAs that are not subject to the PTASP rule,
MassDOT required that an additional target for preventable accidents per 100,000
VRM be included in the MOU. This is a historically collected performance metric
that provides a simplified, but comprehensive, measure of safety events. This data
is reported through the same methodology as the performance data described in
the Performance Data Collection section, collected on a fiscal year, and is
aggregated and included in the Safety Performance Metric Analysis section of this
progress report. The aggregated data includes the baseline, the target for the
fiscal year, the actual performance, and the percent variation for each mode.
Again, color-coded formatting provides easy reference for determining whether
an RTA has met an identified target.

Ridership Trends
As discussed in previous RTA Performance Progress Reports to the Legislature,
although negatively impacted by the pandemic, RTA ridership has continued to
demonstrate a steady upward recovery that has continued through SFY2024

Figure 7. Systemwide annual totals from S SFY2024 displaying the rebound trend
in RTA ridership.
Two major changes for the RTAs in SFY2024 were the continued substantial
increase in the level of investment by the Commonwealth in RTA operations via
state contract assistance and a significant increase in fare free funding. Taken
together, these two initiatives resulted in RTAs across the Commonwealth
continuing to add new service and expand existing services, especially with
service hours later into the nights and on weekends.
Of note, in SFY2024, BRTA, FRTA, MeVa, SRTA and WRTA exceeded pre-pandemic
(FY2019) ridership levels in their systems. Several RTAs came close to recovering to
S SFY2023.

During the pandemic, the RTAs were vital for workers who needed transit service to
travel to and from essential workplaces. The RTAs provided these “durable” riders
with consistent, reliable service, and have built on that base to grow their ridership
year over year as they approach pre-pandemic ridership levels collectively. Every
15

type of RTA rider has benefited from increases in frequency and service hours,
allowing RTAs to attract more choice riders.
Financial Trends
RTA revenues were dramatically impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, and policy
decisions have been made by both RTAs and MassDOT to address those impacts.
It is also important to note that many RTAs implemented broad fare free pilot
programs in SFY2024 as a result of state funds being available. This has had a
direct and expected impact on farebox recovery ratios (FRR) (Figure 5).

SCA has increased in recent years, helping the RTAs offset lower fare revenue. The
SFY2024 state budget also included $15 million for fare free pilot programs. The
RTAs also took advantage of multiple federal grant programs in the state budget
to implement new, innovative services, and continued to pursue competitive
federal grant dollars. In FFY2024, the Cape Cod Regional Transit Authority (CCRTA)
was awarded $14.6 million for the purchase of hybrid buses and Vineyard Transit
Authority (VTA) was awarded $3.8 million for the purchase of battery electric
buses under the Federal Transit Administration’s (FTA) discretionary competitive
Low-No Emission Program. MassDOT was also awarded $360,800 to test a
statewide mobility program under FTA’s discretionary competitive Innovative
Coordinated Access and Mobility Program.

Conclusions
The demographics of the RTAs’ customer base generally consisting of durable
riders who rely on mass transit daily for essential trips to work, the grocery store,
medical and educational institutions. Coupled with an historic increase in the
Commonwealth’s investment in RTAs, SFY2024 ridership metrics have continued to
demonstrate a steady recovery trend from pandemic induced ridership lows. In
SFY2024, the Commonwealth provided a large increase in SCA funding which RTAs
effectively maximized to expand and extend hours of service to better meet the
needs of their customers and attract additional “choice” riders. The
Commonwealth’s sizeable increase in fare free funding also enabled the RTAs to
expand the financial accessibility of transit services for all, supporting improved
ridership metrics.
Importantly, the RTAs have also continued to prove themselves to be adaptable
and reliable in the face of changing norms and expectations around transit
service. With hybrid and remote work flattening traditional peak travel times, RTAs
have adjusted by extending service hours especially on nights and weekends. The
RTAs have also continued to deploy more flexible transit services, such as varied
vehicle sizes and microtransit services to complement traditional fixed route and
demand response services.
In addition, the RTAs have continued to lead by example with efforts to
decarbonize their fleets, purchasing low or no emission vehicles to replace diesel
powered vehicles, upgrading their maintenance facilities to include electric
charging equipment, and adding solar heating and cooling. MassDOT RTD has
continued to support the RTAs on climate change goals through the Battery
Electric Bus Phase II Study, which has built upon the Phase I Study conducted in
2019 and to assist each RTA in executing their carbon reduction implementation
strategies. Transitioning to zero emission vehicles is capital intensive and must be
tailored to each RTA’s geographical and operating characteristics to be
successful. The BEB Phase II Study has helped each RTA execute strategies that
that best meet their unique needs, while supporting the Commonwealth’s climate
change goals.
Over the last five years, the RTAs have continued to demonstrate the importance
of strong leadership and a willingness to maximize available resources and think
creatively about how to provide the best possible services to their riders.

Universal Performance Metric Analysis
Unlinked Passenger Trips (UPT)
Unlinked Passenger Trips (UPT): this metric represents the total passenger boardings across an agency’s operations, no matter how many vehicles the person may have used to travel from origin
to destination. UPT is critical to understanding ridership trends and travel demand. Because the target value for UPT is reported as an accumulation (accum.) over the fiscal year, the year-to-date
actual UPT values were compared against their respective target values. Those UPT values that were calculated to be less than 100% of the target value were formatted blue, and those UPT values
that were calculated to be more than 100% of the target value were formatted in green.

UPT / Vehicle Revenue Mile (VRM)
Unlinked Passenger Trips per Revenue Mile (UPT / VRM): This metric is a measure of productivity and is helpful to understand ridership activity on a per mile basis and is calculated by dividing the
total number of revenue miles (the total number of miles a vehicle is in revenue service) into the total UPT. Systems that operate longer mileage routes in less dense, rural environments typically
perform well on a per mile basis. The actual and target values were compared by calculating the % difference (variance) of the actual versus the milestone/target. The calculated values were
formatted blue for negative variance and green for positive variance.

Fixed route productivity in relation to vehicle revenue miles operated displays typical seasonal trends in ridership behavior. Average productivity increased in Q1 and the start of Q2, with the arrival
of college students on campus, but then decreased in the later part of Q2 and Q3, attributed to seasonal decreases in ridership due to colder months and inclement weather. Despite these trends,
thirteen of the fifteen RTAs exceeded their fixed route targets/ Demand response productivity is more elastic than fixed route, but also more relative as it is dependent on trip length.

UPT / Vehicle Revenue Hour (VRH)
Unlinked Passenger Trips per Revenue Hour (UPT / VRH): This metric is a measure of productivity and is helpful to understand how intense ridership activity is on a per unit of time basis, and is
calculated by dividing the total number of revenue hours (the total number of hours a vehicle is in revenue service) into the UPT. Systems that operate shorter mileage routes in more compact,
urban environments typically perform well on a per hour basis. The actual and target values were compared by calculating the % difference (variance) of the actual against the milestone/target
value, formatted blue for negative variance and green for positive variance.

Fixed route productivity in relation to vehicle revenue hours closely mirrored expected trends in overall seasonal ridership. Demand response productivity was, as in recent years, more elastic in its
variability than fixed route. The lack of predictable, consistent trip length in terms of both miles and hours is the main driving force behind this variability. Eleven of the fifteen RTAs met or exceeded
their fixed route UPT/VRH targets.

On-Time Performance (OTP)
On-time Performance: This metric is defined as the percentage of time that a transit vehicle arrives at a stop or other location within a prescribed time range of its schedule and helps to convey
how vehicles meet their scheduled time points on routes. OTP is a reliability and service quality measure that helps to assess the passenger’s day-to-day experience with a transit agency. The
actual and target OTP values were compared by calculating the percent difference (variance) between the two values. Blue values indicate on-time performance values that are lower than the
target value while green values indicate on-time performance value that are higher than the target value.

Scheduled Trips Operated (STO)
Schedule Trips Operated: This metric is defined as the percentage of trips from the pre-determined system schedule that are completed by the operator. For fixed route, a scheduled trip is a single
trip that is identified for a certain route. Each route makes multiple trips per day, based on the schedule. For demand response, a scheduled trip is a trip that is booked by a qualifying customer and
is based on the specified pick-up and drop-off location. STO is a reliability and service quality measure that helps to assess the passenger’s day-to-day experience with a transit agency. The
actual and target STO values were compared by calculating the percent difference (variance) between the two values. Blue values indicate on-time performance values that are lower than the
target value while green values indicate on-time performance value that are higher than the target value.

For SFY2024, the average percentage of scheduled trips operated for fixed route service consistently exceeded the monthly targets. A majority of RTAs met their annual targets, and those that did
not missed their targets by an average of about 1%. Potential reasons for a trip to not run as scheduled include maintenance issues or inclement weather.

Farebox Recovery Ratio (FRR)
Farebox Recovery Ratio (FRR): This metric relays the proportion of operating expenses that are paid for by fare revenues and is a measure of cost effectiveness. Nearly all transit agencies’ farebox
recovery ratios are well under 100%, as other revenue streams in addition to fares are used to cover operations costs. The actual and target FRR values were compared by calculating the percent
difference (variance) between the two values. Blue values indicate farebox recovery ratios that are lower than the target value while green values indicate farebox recovery ratios that are
higher than the target value.

While farebox recovery ratio has been considered a consistent indicator of the financial health of a given system, it is important to note that SFY2024 was the first year of significant increases in
state funding to the RTAs to be used to offer expanded fare free service. The drop in FRR in October can be directly attributed to the start of pilot operations and the RTAs subsequently collecting
fewer fares. While not all RTAs will offer fare free service year-round or systemwide, the use of this metric to measure financial health is impacted by the expansion of fare free services.

Operating Expenses / Vehicle Revenue Mile (VRM)
Operating Expense per Vehicle Revenue Mile: This metric is a cost efficiency measure that gives context to operational efficiency on a per mile basis and is calculated by dividing the total number
of revenue miles (the total number of miles a vehicle is in revenue service) into the total operating cost for a given mode of operations for a specific agency. Systems that operate longer mileage
routes in less dense, rural environments typically perform well on a per mile basis. The actual and target values were compared by calculating the % difference (variance), formatted blue for
positive variance and green for negative variance.

Not all revenue streams are consistent; as with the farebox recovery ratios, large accruals in expenses can cause cost efficiency performance to fluctuate from month to month, and quarter to
quarter. Generally, fixed route costs per revenue mile were consistent outside of October’s spike. Demand response on the other hand varied more by month to month, but fully half of the year saw
demand response services run more efficiently than the targeted metric, despite the variability of trip length.

Across both fixed route and demand response service, RTAs had difficulty meeting targets for operating expenses per vehicle revenue hour. With increased funding, RTAs began to run service with
extended hours on nights and weekends. New service can take months or sometimes years to fully realize its potential, and while the RTAs saw increased ridership generally, these specific service
additions and enhancements likely have not yet reached their full ridership potential.

Unlike the previous metric, increased ridership from new and expanded service resulted in more RTAs hitting their targets for operating expenses per unlinked passenger trip with 11 of 15 RTAs
meeting or exceeding their target. Fixed route was more impacted by seasonal ridership changes as RTAs kept service on the road despite lower ridership in the winter months, whereas demand
response once again showed its consistent variability from month to months.

Asset Management Performance Metric Analysis
Rolling Stock
Rolling Stock: Revenue transit vehicles such as buses, vans, cars, railcars,
locomotives, trolley cars and buses, and ferry boats.23 On average, RTA rolling stock
fleets consist of buses, cutaways, vans, and minivans. RTA rolling stock fleets are
generally in a state of good repair (SGR), despite RTA reported delays in vehicle
deliveries because of pandemic related supply shortages. With a few exceptions,
most of the reported rolling stock that is beyond useful life is under 30%. Lower
performance percentages are representative of a better SGR. Based on the SFY2024
performance, RTAs should prioritize capital replacement of cutaway, bus, and van
fleets.
Notes: FRTA’s targets are representative of the MassDOT Group TAM Plan, which includes FRTA
and the Mashpee Wampanoag Tribe. The Tribe does not submit asset data until April, so the
current performance is reflective of FRTA’s assets only.

support fleets consist of automobiles, trucks, and other rubber tile vehicles. With a
few exceptions, most of the reported automobile equipment that is beyond useful life
is over 30%. Trucks and other rubber tire vehicle equipment are slightly in a better
state of good repair (SGR), though nearly half of this equipment is beyond useful life
of over 30%. Support fleet SGR performance ranges between 0% and 100% beyond the
useful life benchmark. Lower performance percentages are representative of a
better SGR. Based on the SFY2024 performance, RTAs should prioritize capital
replacement of service automobiles.

Preventable Accidents per 100,000 Vehicle Revenue Miles (VRM)
Preventable Accidents / 100K VRM: The number of preventable accidents for every
100,000 revenue miles operated. A preventable accident is defined as an accident in
which the transit personnel did not do everything reasonably expected to prevent
the accident from occurring. RTAs’ FY2024 performance was well below the target for
preventable accidents.
Note: This metric is only reported by Section 5311 recipient RTAs.

Summary & Next Steps
This SFY2024 progress report provides a description of the system of performance
metrics bilaterally agreed to by MassDOT RTD and the RTAs and includes analysis of
individual performance results, as required by the Act. The data underscores the
individual characteristics of each RTA and demonstrates that the recovery from the
COVID-19 pandemic has impacted each in different ways. For the SFY2024-2025 MOU
period, RTD recognized that targeting a return to SFY2019 performance is not a
sustainable practice for all RTAs, and therefore required the use of a midpoint
baseline for target setting purposes. As shown in Figure 11, the RTAs on average
exceeded ridership targets for both modes. The demand response mode performed
quite well, likely due to microtransit or other flexible service offerings.

In addition to the use of a midpoint baseline, RTD required the RTAs to include a
recovery baseline of SFY2019 data used to monitor the RTAs gradual recovery from
the pandemic. Analysis of the recovery baselines show that ridership and overall
productivity, particularly for fixed route services, are still trending below SFY2019
performance (Figure 13). Farebox recovery also remains lower than FY2019,
attributable to fare free opportunities presented by several RTAs.

MassDOT RTD expects that the results of the performance management program will
continue to prove to be a valuable tool in identifying continued progress, best
practices, and innovative adaptations to challenges the RTAs face. The program
encourages data-driven decision making and agency transparency to the general
public, which is particularly relevant as the RTAs work to rebuild customers’
confidence in the safety, accessibility, and availability of riding public transit.
MassDOT RTD will continue to deliver this report annually with updated actual and
target values derived from the MOU process. Continuing to collect actual and target
values over time will allow for longitudinal analyses that highlight trends, best
practices, and successful innovative policies, as well as the impact of external
factors, including the COVID-19 pandemic. Detail on the annually collected metrics
and supplemental information on each RTA’s system can be found in Appendix B.

Appendix A – RTA Background Information
In Massachusetts, there are 15 RTAs outside of the Greater Boston Area (Figure 14).
Each RTA is locally governed by an Advisory Board and provides a combination of
fixed route and demand response transit services, including ADA paratransit, to their
member communities. Some RTAs opt to provide additional modes of service,
including demand taxi and commuter bus. These services, while managed by the
RTA’s administrative staff, are provided through contracted operators. In FY2024, the
RTAs supplied 26,986,142 in unlinked passenger trips across all modes.40
Figure 14: Map of the RTAs in Massachusetts, including the Massachusetts Bay
Transportation Authority (MBTA) bus system.
The RTAs are funded through five sources of revenue: farebox revenue, own-source
revenue (e.g., revenues generated from advertising, parking, etc.), local assessments,
and state and Federal funding. The Commonwealth provides the RTAs with operating
funds in the form of State Contract Assistance (SCA), which is passed through the
40 GrantsPlus+ Monthly Service Data Reports
2

Massachusetts Department of Transportation (MassDOT) (Figure 15). SCA is
distributed by MassDOT among the RTAs based on a long-standing allocation
formula. In FY2014, the Legislature forward funded the RTAs, meaning that SCA is
provided during the current fiscal year, rather than as a reimbursement for service
provided in the previous year. Beginning in FY2019, the RTAs were also allocated an
additional sum of operating funds to be used for a competitive discretionary grant
program. The competitive Discretionary Grant Program enabled the RTAs to test new
and innovative service models, such as to deploy microtransit pilots, marketing and
outreach campaigns, and gather data on local demand for evening and weekend
service through pilot programs. This allocation ended in FY2021. The FY2023 budget
included $2.5 million to be used on grants for means-tested, discounted or fare-free
pilot programs to be administered by the RTAs, and this funding was increased to $15
million in FY2024. In FY2025, the RTAs received an additional $10 million in SCA
funding, as well as $30 million for fare free programs, among other grant programs.

Although they have similar service goals, the RTAs serve diverse areas throughout
Massachusetts, including many rural areas, much of suburban Boston, college towns
as well as suburban and urban colleges and universities, other large and small
urbanized areas, and areas where ridership is significantly affected by seasonal
tourism. While some RTAs are predominantly defined by their seasonal tourism
service or college and university service, many RTAs serve commuters, tourists,
students for a variety of trip purposes, which speaks to the flexibility they must
employ. RTA ridership began to decline in FY2017, mirroring national trends (Figure
16). This trend was exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, but the RTAs have made
significant, continued progress in recovering lost ridership in each of the last three
fiscal years.

The RTAs’ operating budgets are funded through four main sources of revenue:
directly generated revenue (farebox and own-source revenue), local assessments,
and state and Federal funding (Figure 17). Operating funds (SCA) provided by the
Commonwealth are typically used for payroll and administration.

The RTAs’ capital programs are funded through two main sources: state and Federal
funds (Figure 18). Capital funds provided by the Commonwealth are primarily

Appendix B – RTA Profiles
Appendix B provides an overview of each regional transit authority and includes the
following:
SUMMARY PROFILES
The summary statistics for each RTA were extracted from the data submitted to
MassDOT by the RTAs over the course of FY2024, as well as the agencies’ websites.
These summaries provide a high-level overview of the RTAs’ history, administration,
recent operations, and jurisdictions served.
PERFORMANCE METRICS
For each RTA, a series of charts are included that provide an overview of all
performance metrics and targets for each RTA, as identified in the FY2024-FY2025
MOUs. The charts are the same values that were reported by metric in the
Performance Metrics section and are now grouped by RTA.
ASSET MANAGEMENT METRICS
For each RTA, the NTD reported asset management metrics have been summarized
by asset category. These are the same values that were reported by metric in the
Asset Management Performance Metrics section and are now grouped by RTA. The
performance reported should be viewed as draft, as the data is under review by NTD.
SAFETY PERFORMANCE METRICS
For each RTA, the NTD reported safety metrics have been summarized by event type
and rate. These are the same values that were reported by metric in the Safety
Performance Metrics section and are now grouped by RTA. This data is reported on a
calendar year, rather than a fiscal year.
ANNUALLY REPORTED PERFORMANCE METRICS
The Annually Reported Metrics reflect the unique measures that each RTA tracks and
finds relevant to their system. Since these metrics are specific to each RTA, this
section does not include comparative interpretation or analysis. Each RTA reports on
fleet composition based on fuel type, the number of external partnerships
established, and two metrics of choice. The first “choice” metric, defined as the CRTP
Choice Metric, is tied to a recommendation from each system’s Comprehensive
6

Regional Transit Plan, a regional planning document completed in 2020. The second
“choice” metric is the RTA’s choice, defined as the Free Choice Metric, and represents
a goal or value that is particularly important to both the system and its rider.
