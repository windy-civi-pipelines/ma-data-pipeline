THE COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS
WATER RESOURCES COMMISSION
100 CAMBRIDGE STREET, BOSTON MA 02114
Report of the Findings, Justifications and Decision
of the Water Resources Commission
Relating to the Approval of the
Lynnfield Center Water District’s
Request for an Interbasin Transfer
Pursuant to M.G.L. Chapter 21 Sections 8B through 8D
Decision
On March 13, 2025, in a vote unanimous of those present, the Water Resources Commission
(WRC) approved, with Conditions, the Lynnfield Center Water District’s request to obtain
supplemental water supply from the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority, which will
facilitate an interbasin transfer of 0.83 million gallons per day (MGD). This vote was taken after
review of the facts provided by the applicant, analysis of the associated data, and consideration
of public and agency comments received concerning this application.
Introduction
On October 23, 2024, the WRC received a request from the Lynnfield Center Water District
(LCWD) for approval of an action to increase the present rate of interbasin transfer under the
Interbasin Transfer Act (ITA) as part of a Single Environmental Impact Report (SEIR) and
supplemental filing submitted to the Massachusetts Environmental Policy Act (MEPA) Office. The
proposed project aims to connect LCWD to the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority
(MWRA) Water System through the Town of Wakefield. The Secretary’s Certificate on the
SEIR was issued on November 29, 2024. The WRC accepted LCWD’s application as complete at
its December 12, 2024 meeting.
LCWD is proposing to purchase an average day demand of 0.28 million gallons per day (MGD)
with a maximum day demand of 0.83 MGD of water from MWRA to supplement its existing
water supply sources which will provide redundancy and resiliency to its system as well as help
relieve stress on the Ipswich River and North Coastal Basin sources. The capacity of the
interconnection to be constructed is currently restricted to 0.36 MGD due to water system
infrastructure constraints in Wakefield. However, LCWD is actively working and negotiating
with Wakefield towards increasing the capacity to 0.83 MGD. The limiting factor for the
proposed maximum interbasin transfer volume of 0.83 MGD will be the agreement with MWRA
and the physical capacity of the Wakefield interconnection. LCWD has its sources and service area
in the Ipswich River and North Coastal Basins. This interconnection requires review under the
ITA because MWRA’s sources are located in the Chicopee River and Nashua River Basins.
A summary of the facts described in the application is as follows:
1. LCWD’s sources are located in the Ipswich River and North Coastal Basins (Figure 1).
Page 1 of 24

2. LCWD’s existing sources consist of four groundwater sources.
3. Two of LCWD’s sources are in the stressed Ipswich River Basin and several sources are
experiencing water quality issues due to the presence of PFAS, manganese, iron, and
nitrate. The Phillips Road tubular wellfield (Station 1) in the North Coastal Basin is
currently offline due to elevated levels of nitrate.
4. LCWD is applying for admission to the MWRA Waterworks System, which has its
sources in the Chicopee River and Nashua River Basins.
5. A MEPA environmental review, pursuant to M.G.L. c. 30, §§ 61-62I, was required for this
proposed action. The ITA application was submitted as part of the SEIR for this project
(EOEEA #16722) and supplemental filing with MEPA.
6. The Secretary’s Certificate on the SEIR was issued on November 29, 2024, stating that no
further MEPA review was needed.
7. Two required public hearings were held virtually via Zoom to take comment on this
application, for the donor basin on January 14, 2025 and for the receiving basin on
January 15, 2025. Written public comments were accepted until January 22, 2025.
Comments received at the receiving basin public hearing and in writing were in favor of the
project and requested a formal water conservation plan.
8. A Staff Recommendation to approve the request was presented to the WRC on February
13, 2025.
9. A public hearing on the Staff Recommendation was held virtually via Zoom on February
26, 2025. Written public comments were accepted until March 5, 2025 and none were
received.
Evaluation of the Proposed Interbasin Transfer
This interbasin transfer application was reviewed on its own merits and is applicable solely to
LCWD’s purchase of water supply from MWRA in the amount of 0.83 MGD. This Decision is
made based on facts contained in LCWD’s MEPA submissions and additional information
submitted at the WRC’s request during the MEPA process and during staff review. The
application was evaluated against the seven Criteria outlined in the ITA regulations (313 CMR
4.09), as well as the ITA Performance Standards and with consideration of comments received
from the agencies and through the public comment process.

Basis for the WRC Decision
This application was reviewed by Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs (EEA),
WRC staff at the Department of Conservation and Recreation’s (DCR) Office of Water
Resources, Department of Environmental Protection (MassDEP), and Department of Fish and
Game’s (DFG) Division of Fisheries and Wildlife (MassWildlife). This Decision was made after
an evaluation of LCWD’s application and compliance with the five applicable Criteria of the
ITA regulations and the ITA Performance Standards. The following sections describe in detail
compliance with the Criteria.
Criterion 1: Compliance with MEPA
An environmental review, pursuant to MEPA (M.G.L. Chapter 30, Sections 61 through 62I) and the
MEPA regulations, 301 CMR 11.00, was required for this proposed transfer. The ITA application
was submitted as part of the SEIR for this project (EOEEA #16722) and a supplemental filing with
MEPA. The SEIR and supplemental filing were submitted in October 2024. The Secretary’s
Certificate on the SEIR was issued on November 29, 2024 and stated that no further MEPA review
is required.
Criterion 2: Viable In-Basin Sources
LCWD was required to demonstrate that all reasonable efforts have been made to identify and
develop all viable sources in the receiving area (LCWD). Over several decades, LCWD has
evaluated multiple alternatives to develop supplemental water supply sources. Previous efforts to
explore potential additional water supply sources resulted in two formal supplemental supply
studies, the Ipswich River Basin Water Management Act (WMA) Study (2017 and 2018) and the
Supplemental Water Modeling Evaluation Report (2021). Following is a summary of all issues
considered relating to viability.
Alternatives Analysis
An alternatives analysis was performed to identify, evaluate, and select potential water supply
alternatives. The alternatives evaluated in the receiving basin include surface reservoir sources,
additional wells in district territory, and interconnections with non-MWRA neighboring systems
and with partial- or fully-MWRA supplied neighboring systems.
Alternative 1: Reservoir/Surface Water Source
In the mid-1970s, LCWD developed plans for a surface water reservoir and filtration plant. The
reservoir would have been located north of Glen Drive, flooding a large area of wetlands,
including what is now the Glen Drive wellfield (Station 4). Much of the land for the reservoir
was acquired by LCWD. However, the funding article for the reservoir and filtration plant was
voted down at District Meeting. Given the current stressed nature of the Ipswich River and its
basin tributaries, the incompatibility with the current groundwater source well fields and
production infrastructure, as well as the regulatory environment for permitting new surface water
impoundments, it has been determined that any new surface water source within LCWD’s
district boundaries is no longer feasible.
Alternative 2: Additional Wells in District Territory
In the 1970’s, LCWD explored possible sand and gravel well sites to expand supply, resulting in
the conclusion there were no additional sites for that type of well. Over the past few decades,
Page 4 of 24

LCWD has continued to look at the potential of adding new bedrock wells in its territory.
Previous investigations led to the construction of the Glen Drive wellfield (Station 4) in 1997 in
the Ipswich River Basin. The 2017 Ipswich Basin WMA Study stated that “In general, the
Ipswich River Basin has limited extents of medium and high-yielding aquifers…” and “… it
appears that the towns searching for new groundwater sources within the Ipswich Basin have not
been able to easily identify any feasible sources.” LCWD asserts this is the case within the
district boundaries located in the Ipswich River Basin. The 2017 report concluded that “Given
the physical and hydrogeological constraints of the Basin, increased groundwater withdrawal is
probably not the solution…” and “Studies predict climate change will further exacerbate
seasonal streamflow depletion by evapotranspiration in the Basin.” Therefore, new sources
within the Ipswich River Basin are not being considered by LCWD.
LCWD also previously experienced challenges with supply from existing wells in the North
Coastal Basin at Station 3 (Phillips Road wells) and assessed the possibility of additional wells in
this basin as well. As a result, in 2013 LCWD was formally permitted to construct new bedrock
wells for Station 3 in the North Coastal Basin. Based on the comprehensive testing associated
with production of those new and existing North Coastal Basin wells, and the area of LCWD’s
service territory within the basin, LCWD believes it has maximized withdrawals from these
sources. In the decade since the new wells went online for Station 3, LCWD has not been able to
achieve the expected volume. The wells pump as a single well field, with yield impacted when
another one of the well pumps comes on. Therefore, it is expected that even if more wells were
installed, they would impact the existing wells and not yield any additional capacity.
Based on the review of both the North Coastal Basin and Ipswich River Basin, LCWD does not
consider supplemental groundwater sources in its territory to be a viable alternative to address its
demand challenges and redundancy constraints.
MassDEP has noted that it would be extremely difficult to allocate any additional water volume,
ground or surface, in the Ipswich River Basin at this time. Long-standing concerns exist about
the allocation of any additional volumes in the Ipswich River Basin due to safe yield issues.
While the MassDEP WMA Program cannot speak to the availability of sources in the North
Coastal Basin for LCWD, there are limited high-yield aquifers in Lynnfield, and in LCWD
specifically, since the District is small and has limited area for well placement. The highest yield
aquifer is already the location of LCWD’s Phillips Road wells. Placing additional sources in the
North Coastal Basin would not provide LCWD with the redundancy it is seeking.
Alternative 3: Interconnection for Additional Water
In the 2021 Supplemental Water Report, LCWD evaluated multiple scenarios to purchase
supplemental water through an interconnection with adjacent water systems. In the supplemental
filing submitted to MEPA, a table was provided which summarized the feasibility of obtaining
water supplies from all communities located wholly or partially in the Ipswich River and North
Coastal Basins. The result of this analysis indicated that obtaining water supply from the other
in-basin communities is not feasible or is less feasible than the Wakefield interconnection as
proposed in the SEIR.
Page 5 of 24

LCWD has the following system interconnections which could possibly serve as point of a
permanent supply of alternative source water: North Reading, Peabody, Lynnfield Water District
(LWD) and Wakefield. Three of the four interconnections (LWD, Wakefield and Peabody) are
with systems fully or partially served by MWRA. This alternative is also known as “wheeling”
water from MWRA through an interconnected neighboring community. North Reading is the
only system not partially served by MWRA. A direct connection with MWRA was also
evaluated.
Interconnection with Lynnfield Water District
LWD (a separate entity and public water supply than Lynnfield Center Water District, LCWD)
sources all its drinking water from MWRA. Analysis indicated that wheeling water through
existing LWD interconnections would be a hydraulically viable option for LCWD. However,
preliminary cost estimates were much higher than other interconnection alternatives scenarios
considered and described in the 2021 Supplemental Water Report. Based on this, the LWD
interconnection alternative was not pursued further by LCWD.
Interconnection with Peabody
The City of Peabody sources its drinking water from two reservoirs and supplements its supply
with water from MWRA during periods of higher demand. Both of Peabody’s reservoirs are
located within the Ipswich River Basin, a stressed basin subject to withdrawal limits and
restrictions. Peabody receives water from MWRA through a meter located in Lynn. The water
from the meter located in Lynn would not be able to transport water from MWRA through
Peabody into LCWD without new booster pumping capabilities and significant system
reconfiguration. Peabody does not have excess capacity at its existing water treatment plant, and
therefore to provide local surface water to LCWD would need to expand the facility, which
would come at significant expense.
Interconnection with North Reading
North Reading receives water supply from the Town of Andover, the sources for which are
Haggetts Pond, Fish Brook, and the Merrimack River and are all in the Merrimack River Basin.
Transmission mains located in North Reading connect LCWD to Andover’s distribution system
and would potentially allow LCWD to “wheel” water from Andover through North Reading.
Based on coordinated discussions, Andover was interested in the prospect of selling drinking
water to LCWD, however, there was concern about supplying supplemental water during June
and July, when the systems historically have experienced increased demands. There is also the
potential need for significant transmission system reconfiguration. This option is not
recommended by LCWD for two reasons: the unreliability of Andover to provide water during
peak summer demands, and the extensive distribution upgrades that may be required.
Direct MWRA Interconnection
Possible routes for a connecting pipeline to MWRA include a route to Wakefield that is
approximately 17,500 feet or 3.3 miles long, and a route to Saugus that is approximately 10,000
feet or 1.9 miles long and includes construction of a new pipeline along Route 1. A direct
interconnection with MWRA is possible, but at a greater cost than the interconnection through
Wakefield.
Page 6 of 24

Interconnection with Wakefield
The Town of Wakefield sources the majority of its drinking water through three MWRA
connections. A hydraulic evaluation showed that no booster station is needed for Wakefield to
supply LCWD with water. Two supply scenarios that were evaluated both maintain LCWD’s
tank levels over an extended period of maximum day demand. The Wakefield interconnection to
wheel water from MWRA as a supplemental source for LCWD was identified as the preferred
approach in the 2021 Supplemental Water Report.
In conclusion, the basic requirement of the ITA is that an applicant shows that local water supply
sources are used to the maximum extent possible and that other sources cannot be reasonably
developed prior to the applicant obtaining permission to transfer water from out of basin. Given
the above-described conditions, the WRC determined that all reasonable efforts have been made
to identify and develop all viable sources in the receiving area of the proposed interbasin
transfer.
Criterion 3: Water Conservation
LCWD was required to demonstrate that all practical water conservation measures have been
implemented. The WRC water conservation performance standards are numbered below,
followed by a bulleted narrative of LCWD’s actions.
1) Water Conservation Program - A long-term water conservation program should be in place
for the receiving community, which, to the extent feasible, is customized based on the
specific water use patterns and supply constraints of the system.
a) Data Analysis - Determining where to focus water conservation efforts and resources
should begin with data collection, management, and analysis. To the extent feasible, the
system’s water conservation programs should be developed using relevant data analysis.
• According to the SEIR, LCWD supplies drinking water to approximately 70 percent
of the Town of Lynnfield residents, as well as four schools and all the Town’s
municipal facilities. The residential service population as reported in LCWD’s 2023
Annual Statistical Report (ASR) was 8,403. LCWD’s customers are primarily
residential, with approximately 2,692 residential service connections and 18
commercial/business accounts.
• The proponent demonstrated an understanding of its water use profile, acknowledging
that approximately 95% of LCWD’s total volume is used within the residential sector.
LCWD also acknowledges its municipal/institutional customers as the second-largest
water-using sector in the system. LCWD’s water conservation program is reflective
of this profile and targeted toward the residential sector, with additional efforts made
toward maximizing efficiency at public facilities through an ongoing water audit
program, as described below.
b) Water Conservation Plan Documentation - A water conservation/water efficiency plan
should outline the system’s water use profile, assessment of water savings potential,
conservation measures for applicable customer categories, water efficiency-related
policies, and measurable performance goals. While a formal water conservation plan is
not required, applicants should submit a summary of existing water conservation efforts
to help facilitate evaluation and guidance on the system’s water conservation program.
Page 7 of 24

• LCWD provided an updated Water Conservation Questionnaire that documents the
majority of its water conservation program. LCWD does not have a formal water
conservation plan beyond the information listed in the Questionnaire and its
Drought/Emergency Contingency Plans.
• The proponent provided descriptions and attachments in the SEIR and through
subsequent communications that adequately outlined a water conservation program
and plans for program enhancement.
• LCWD’s 2004 MassDEP WMA Permit for its Ipswich River Basin sources requires
the implementation of a water bank program if the authorized withdrawal volume of
0.29 MGD (on an average annual daily basis) is exceeded. At a minimum, this water
bank shall provide for conserving at least two gallons of water for every gallon of
water demand added to the system. The authorized volume of 0.29 MGD was
exceeded in 2023. MassDEP has no record of receiving documentation of such a
program.
• LCWD is encouraged to develop a formal written water conservation plan to most
effectively implement its water conservation program. As noted in its comment letter
dated January 14th, 2025, the Ipswich River Watershed Association and its partners at
the Greenscapes North Shore Coalition have offered to support the Lynnfield
community in implementing its water conservation goals.
• LCWD must implement a water bank program and provide documentation to
MassDEP.
c) Residential Water Use Efficiency - The scope of a residential water efficiency program
will be specific to circumstances in each community and should be informed by relevant
data analyses. Applicants must meet the residential performance standard of 65 gallons
per capita per day (gpcd). This is a system-wide average (including indoor and outdoor
use) that represents a minimum level of efficiency. If local environmental or operational
conditions warrant higher efficiency (e.g., during times of drought), applicants should
strive to achieve year-round residential water use of less than 65 gpcd by implementing
indoor and outdoor efficiency measures.
• LCWD’s average residential gpcd (rgpcd) from 2019-2023 is 62.6 and has been
trending down for the past four years, most recently reaching 56 in 2023.
• LCWD promotes water conservation and recommendations for residents through
regular bill stuffers, copies of which were provided for review.
• LCWD also maintains a customer portal using WaterSmart software, which 50% of
its customers are signed up to use. The WaterSmart portal allows customers to review
their current and historical usage, compares their use to average household use, and
provides suggestions on ways to reduce water use and the estimated percent of water
saving if water reduction actions are taken.
• LCWD contacts customers with high use to alert them to any issues and prevent long
term excessive water usage. LCWD is also in the process of updating water meters to
allow for reads at 15-minute intervals, further optimizing the use of the WaterSmart
portal and opportunities to alert customers to possible leaks.
• In 2019, LCWD joined the Greenscapes North Shore Coalition, which provides
benefits such as water quality/conservation workshops and education/outreach plans
for developers and residents.
Page 8 of 24

• LCWD has a bylaw requiring all automatic underground irrigation systems to be
equipped with a moisture-sensing device or mechanism that will automatically shut
off the system’s water flow during and following a period of precipitation.
• LCWD offers an ongoing rebate program for water-saving fixtures including toilets
and washing machines. However, details on applying for rebates are not listed on its
website, and water conservation information in general is limited on the site.
• In its comment letter on the SEIR, MassDEP WMA Program staff requested that an
outdoor water use restriction bylaw be passed by LCWD and enforced as a
requirement of MWRA admission. During the ITA review process, LCWD provided
information about its existing outdoor water use restriction bylaw and enforcement
actions.
• Additional information regarding rebates and links to additional resources such as the
state water conservation website (Massachusetts Water Conservation Toolkit) must
be added to LCWD’s website to more effectively reach customers not signed up for
the WaterSmart portal.
d) Non-Residential Water Use Efficiency - Water conservation measures for the non-
residential sector should incorporate the relevant components of residential water use
efficiency described above. In addition, all government and other public buildings under
the control of the applicant should have been constructed or retrofitted with water fixtures
meeting EPA’s WaterSense standards and/or the current MA plumbing code, or the
applicant should establish a timeline to transition to such fixtures. A program should be
in place that identifies, ranks, and conducts outreach to commercial, industrial, and
institutional customers based on water usage to determine areas where the greatest
potential for water savings exists. The program should include regular contact with the
highest users to promote water conservation, including the promotion of water reuse as
per 314 CMR 20.00: Reclaimed Water Permit Program and Standards, where appropriate.
Refer to the EPA’s WaterSense guidance for the commercial, industrial, and institutional
sector at EPA's WaterSense page for Commercial Buildings.
• LCWD has initiated a water audit program that will be conducted at all public
facilities to which it supplies water, with two schools receiving audits so far. Future
audits will be completed at the remaining schools in LCWD’s fiscal year 2025.
• Additional public facilities served by LCWD are largely limited to buildings currently
undergoing complete renovation (e.g. Town Hall and Public Safety), which will
include new, efficient plumbing and fixtures.
• LCWD must continue to actively monitor the ICI customers in its system for
excessive use and conduct outreach/provide assistance as necessary. LCWD should
also more proactively reach out to the top 10 users to direct them to resources that can
help facilities manage water use, such as EPA's WaterSense page for commercial and
institutional facilities.
2) Water Loss Control Program - A water loss control program should be in place and
actively implemented. Guidance on water loss control programs can be obtained from the
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), American Water Works Association
(AWWA), and the Water Research Foundation (WRF).
Page 9 of 24

• LCWD does not currently have a formal water loss control program but does have
most of the elements of such a program as detailed in the ITA Performance
Standards. LCWD has agreed to use the results of an M36 audit projected to be
completed by December 31, 2024, to further develop a water loss control program for
the subsequent year, with ranked action items and target completion dates.
• LCWD plans to continue conducting annual M36 audits with at least Level 1
validation as defined by the WRF Level 1 Water Audit Validation Guidance Manual
2nd edition or latest (i.e., a validator audit review, validator interview of auditor, and
validation documentation). The audit and data validation should focus on reducing
real and apparent losses and improving data validity scores to at least 71 (if below).
• LCWD dedicates funding each year for leak detection and repairs and utilizes
industry standard practices to estimate water loss from leaks.
• As of the submission of the SEIR, the most recent leak detection was performed in
2023 and the report from the survey was provided for review. Forty-eight miles of
water main were surveyed, resulting in the identification and repair of five leaks.
• A leak detection survey was also conducted in 2022, with 48 miles of water main
surveyed, resulting in the identification and repair of two leaks.
• The proponent will continue conducting annual leak detection surveys to reduce real
losses as leaks are identified and repaired.
• Average unaccounted-for water (UAW) for the LCWD system from 2019-2023 was
12.2%. However, UAW has been increasing over the last two years, most recently
reaching 21%.
• The proponent acknowledged the recent increase in UAW in the SEIR and provided
details on efforts to reduce UAW to 10% or less, which in addition to annual M36
audits and leak detection surveys, includes the following steps:
o The LCWD Board of Commissioners approved a bylaw in 2016 which
requires property owners to repair leaks or replace water services within 14
calendar days of being notified of the leak. A fine of $75 per day will be
incurred by the property owner until the leak is fixed.
o A long-term capital improvement program is in place, which was informed by
a distribution study completed in 2017.
o LCWD has the authority to issue penalties and/or fines for stealing water.
• LCWD must submit the 2024 M36 audit report once it is available.
• LCWD must continue to conduct annual M36 audits, leak detection surveys at least
every three years, implement water loss control activities as needed, and provide
documentation to the WRC annually for the first five years after approval, and upon
request thereafter.
• LCWD will use the results of its 2024 M36 audit to inform its water loss control
program and submit documentation of the program to WRC staff. The program will
be updated based on the results of future M36 audits. The proponent should refer to
the EPA, AWWA, and WRF for guidance on water loss control program
development. The program should include, at a minimum, the elements outlined in
Section III.A.2.a-h of the ITA Performance Standards.
Page 10 of 24

3) Metering
a) Full System Metering - The water supply system should be 100% metered.
• LCWD’s system is 100% metered, including public facilities.
b) Properly Size Meters - To handle required water flow rate and ensure a high level of
metering accuracy.
• LCWD has a longstanding distribution system meter maintenance program, consistent
with AWWA standards, which includes ensuring that meters are appropriately sized
and accurately measure the water volume used by consumers.
c) Metering Actual Use - Meter reading should be done in a manner that allows for
collection of actual data instead of use of estimated data.
• Meters are read monthly, and billing occurs quarterly. Information obtained from
metering and LCWD’s WaterSmart portal is evaluated internally by LCWD.
d) Meter Repair/Replacement Program - Implement a water meter repair/replacement
policy and program, including a budget for the calibration, repair, and replacement of all
sources of supply and distribution network water metering systems.
• LCWD consistently secures dedicated funding in its annual budget to calibrate,
repair, or replace meters as necessary.
• LCWD replaces 200 to 300 meters per year at a cost of $40,000. With approximately
2,800 customer accounts, this represents full replacement every 10-14 years.
• LCWD has hired a contractor to perform annual testing and calibration services of its
master meters, which was scheduled to begin in the 3rd or 4th quarter of 2024.
• LCWD must continue to implement its meter repair/replacement program, with
updates made to the program as needed per M36 audit results and its ongoing water
loss control program.
• LCWD must continue meter replacements at least at the current rate.
• Master meter calibration services will continue on an annual basis.
• LCWD must provide documentation of the above actions to the WRC annually for
the first five years after approval, and upon request thereafter.
4) Water Rates and Billing Practices
a) Full-Cost Pricing - Applicants should demonstrate that water system revenues, including
rates, fees, and other charges collectively reflect the full cost of water service including
operation, maintenance, capital needs, source protection, debt service, administration,
regulatory compliance, and water conservation – or establish a timeframe for
transitioning to full-cost pricing. At a minimum, applicants must demonstrate that total
revenue sources, including any from outside the water system, are sufficient to cover
these costs. Budgets used to establish costs should use a 10-year or longer planning
horizon.
• LCWD and its consultants provided descriptions and attachments in the SEIR and
subsequent communications that confirmed that LCWD’s revenues cover all costs of
the system, including operation, maintenance, capital needs, source protection, debt
service, administration, regulatory compliance, and water conservation. Revenue is
derived from a tax levy added to customer property taxes (35%) and a combination of
Page 11 of 24

water bills, antenna leases on its tanks, and service, repair, and connection permits
(65%). LCWD uses a 3 to 5-year planning horizon in its capital planning.
• It is recommended that the planning horizon is increased to at least 10 years to ensure
longer-term capital expenditures are reflected in rates to avoid the need for sudden
substantial increases.
b) Enterprise Fund or Equivalent Segregation of Utility Accounting - Municipal
suppliers other than independent districts should demonstrate the use of an enterprise
fund or equivalent mechanism to segregate water utility accounting from other municipal
government activities.
• LCWD is an independent district with a budget segregated from the Town of
Lynnfield. While a portion of its revenue is levied on customers through a property
tax line item, all proceeds from this line item go directly to LCWD and the levy is set
by the LCWD Board of Commissioners.
c) Conservation Pricing - The rate structure must encourage water conservation.
• LCWD uses the same two-tier volumetric pricing structure for all categories of use
except municipal. The tier 1 volume threshold of 24,000 gallons per quarter was
established by estimating the usage for a family of 4, including a “small factor for
some outdoor water use.” For a family of 4, this equates to an rgpcd of approximately
65. For the average household in Lynnfield (2.8 people), it equates to an rgpcd of
approximately 94. As a result, 75% of customers stay within the first tier, even during
the summer watering season.
• The per-unit charge in tier 1, when ranked against all pricing structures captured in
the most recent Tighe and Bond Water Rate Survey, ranged from the 93rd to the 99th
percentile. The second tier more than doubles this unit price.
• The only affordability assistance available to customers are 6-month payment plans.
• The volumetric charges component of the LCWD rate structure sends a very strong
conservation signal.
• With volumetric charges at the 99th percentile for households using as little as 35
rgpcd, this rate could present affordability challenges to some customers.
• It is recommended that LCWD explore expanding protections for customers facing
affordability challenges, such as implementing a lifeline rate for customers who
qualify based on income.
d) Monthly Billing - Applicants should bill customers monthly or establish a timeframe for
transitioning to monthly billing. At a minimum, customers must be billed quarterly, in
which case utilities should monitor usage monthly and utilize timely mechanisms to
notify customers when abnormal water use is detected.
• LCWD bills customers quarterly. LCWD is a small system with one administrative
staff and communicated that moving to monthly billing is not financially viable.
• LCWD reads meters monthly and contacts customers if data show unusually high use.
• Additionally, the WaterSmart customer portals can be used by customers to closely
track usage and set water use notifications. LCWD is in the process of upgrading
meters to deliver reads to the portals in 15-minute increments.
Page 12 of 24

• It is recommended that customer outreach is increased to maximize enrollment in
WaterSmart, which is currently used by approximately 50% of customers.
e) Billing Practices - Bills should be based on actual usage, be easily understandable to the
customer, indicate the rate structure clearly, and provide water use in gallons.
Additionally, bills or customer portals should help customers evaluate their usage trends.
• LCWD bills provide water use in gallons and clearly explain the billing tiers.
• LCWD also includes educational materials with bills, guiding customers toward
water conservation practices and habits.
• As mentioned above, 50% of LCWD customers have signed up for access to
WaterSmart portals which enable them to track and monitor their use.
5) Protection of Existing Sources in the Receiving Area
a) Local Drought Management Plan - Applicants should provide a local drought
management plan in accordance with Section 8 (Guidance for Communities) and any
other relevant section(s) of the state’s Drought Management Plan.
• LCWD revised its Drought Management Plan (DMP) in August 2024.
• LCWD’s revised DMP does not adequately define its “operational conditions
triggers.” These are critical triggers that should be source- and/or system- specific,
which are necessary to extend supplies during droughts. The proponent should refer
to Section 4 of the MA Local Public Water Supply Drought Management Plan
Guidance and revise its “operational conditions triggers” accordingly.
• The outdoor water use restrictions included in Table 5.1 of LCWD’s DMP do not
currently follow the state’s DMP restriction guidelines. The proponent should refer to
the 2023 Massachusetts DMP, Section 7.2.1, and revise the nonessential outdoor
water use restrictions accordingly.
• In addition to following the Massachusetts DMP’s outdoor water use restrictions for
droughts as declared by the Secretary of EEA for the Northeast Drought Region (in
which Lynnfield is located), LCWD should also update its DMP to incorporate
compliance with any water use restrictions as set forth by MWRA.
• LCWD must revise its DMP as described above and submit it for WRC review and
approval.
• It is recommended that LCWD work with the Town of Lynnfield to implement a
private well bylaw to regulate private well use during droughts.
b) Emergency Response Plan - An emergency response plan, as described in 310 CMR
22.04, should be in place. This plan should establish operating procedures for adequately
handling water supply emergencies, such as contamination of water supply sources or
seasonal/drought related shortages of water supply.
• LCWD provided documentation of an emergency response plan that was updated in
December 2023.
c) Local Surface Water Supply Plan - A written local surface water supply protection plan
should be in place for all surface water sources in the Receiving Area under the control of
the applicant in accordance with regulations outlined in 310 CMR 22.20 B and C.
• LCWD does not have any surface water supplies.
Page 13 of 24

d) Wellhead Protection Areas - Land in the receiving area located in Zones I, II, III or
Interim Wellhead Protection Areas (IWPA) of public drinking water wells must be
protected in accordance with regulations outlined in 310 CMR 22.21.
• LCWD provided a copy of the Lynnfield Zoning Bylaws, Section 9.0 – Special
Districts, which details the Special Groundwater Protection District that meets the
Massachusetts Wellhead Protection Regulations (310 CMR 22.21).
Notwithstanding the above assessment, the WRC recognizes that in certain cases, local
conditions may prevent a proponent from meeting or exceeding the “yardstick” that has been
described in the ITA performance standards, even after a substantial effort has been made. In
these cases, the proponent should explain why that standard cannot be met, demonstrate an
alternate method of meeting the intent of the standard, and document any efforts that have been
undertaken in order to comply with the standard.
Summary of Water Conservation Criterion
Based on the information evaluated in performance standards 1 through 5 above, the WRC finds
that the water conservation Criterion of the ITA will be met upon implementation of conditions.
Criterion 4: Forestry Management Program
This Criterion requires that a comprehensive forestry management program has been
implemented on any watershed lands with surface water sources serving the receiving area
(LCWD) and under the control of the receiving area. LCWD does not have any surface water
sources; therefore, this Criterion is not applicable to this proposal.
Criterion 5: Reasonable Instream Flow and Criterion 7: Cumulative Impacts
Criterion 5 requires that “reasonable instream flow in the river from which the water is
transferred is maintained.” In addition, per Criterion 7 the WRC must consider the “cumulative
impacts of all past, authorized or proposed transfers on streamflows, groundwater, lakes, ponds,
reservoirs or other impoundments in the Donor Basin and relevant sub-basins.”
The ITA regulations (313 CMR 4.09(3)(e)) direct the WRC to consider “the impact of the
proposed action to increase the Present Rate of Interbasin Transfer on the streamflow dependent
ecosystems and water uses and the potential to affect instream values” in making its decision to
approve or deny an interbasin transfer request.
Background
The first community that the WRC approved under the ITA for admission to MWRA was
Bedford in 1992. Since then, donor basin analyses and updates have been written for five
communities. Reference is made to the previous donor basin analyses found in WRC Decisions
for Stoughton (2002), Reading (2005, partial membership), Wilmington (2007), Reading (2007,
full membership), Ashland (2018), and Burlington (2020). Dedham-Westwood Water District,
admitted to MWRA in 2005, was not subject to the ITA per MWRA’s Enabling Act. Also

consulted in this donor basin analysis update for LCWD is the LCWD 2024 SEIR and other
resources and documents1.
LCWD is seeking approval for an interbasin transfer of 0.28 MGD average day demand and up
to 0.83 MGD maximum day demand from the MWRA Waterworks System. The sources that
supply the MWRA Waterworks System are the Quabbin Reservoir, Ware River, and Wachusett
Reservoir (Quabbin-Ware-Wachusett system). The Quabbin Reservoir and Ware River are in the
Chicopee River Basin, and the Wachusett Reservoir is in the Nashua River Basin. The MWRA
Waterworks System consists of aqueducts, tunnels, and other transmission facilities (refer to
Figure 2 below) and about 285 miles of pipe that distribute water to MWRA communities.
Figure 2: MWRA Waterworks System
The Quabbin-Ware-Wachusett system is operated to optimize both the quality and quantity of
water available to MWRA for water supply purposes and to meet statutory and regulatory
requirements for downstream releases and other legal obligations. Secondary operational
objectives include maintaining an adequate flood protection buffer.
Water can flow into each reservoir from inflows or transfers. Flow out of the reservoirs consists
of withdrawals for water supply, required controlled releases, voluntary controlled releases, and
uncontrolled overflows (“spills”) when the reservoirs are full. Refer to Figure 3 for a schematic
of reservoir inflows and outflows.
Water is discharged from the Quabbin Reservoir primarily through the Quabbin Aqueduct which
ultimately discharges into the Wachusett Reservoir and constitutes more than half of the average
annual inflow to the Wachusett Reservoir. Withdrawals from the Quabbin also occur through the
Chicopee Valley Aqueduct to supply three communities southwest of the Quabbin and the

McLaughlin Fish Hatchery. Additional outflow from the Quabbin includes releases and
overflows to the Swift River at the Winsor Dam.
Figure 3: Reservoir Flow Schematic
Reasonable Instream Flow
Quabbin Reservoir and the Swift River
The Quabbin Reservoir has a maximum storage capacity of 412 billion gallons, equivalent to
about five to six years’ worth of supply. It is fed by a well-protected watershed of 186 square
miles and contributes about 53% of the total Quabbin-Ware-Wachusett system safe yield.
Flow in the Swift River was significantly impacted when the Quabbin Reservoir was built
(completed in 1939). Minimum release requirements are governed by Massachusetts law and a
1929 War Department permit. Chapter 321 of the 1927 Acts of Massachusetts requires that
sufficient water must be discharged from the Quabbin Reservoir to provide at least 20 MGD in
the Swift River at the Village of Bondsville (in the Town of Palmer) located five miles
downstream of the Winsor Dam. According to the LCWD 2024 SEIR, at least 18 MGD is
released from the Winsor Dam each calendar day. This satisfies the 20 MGD requirement since
the intervening watershed between Winsor Dam and Bondsville is estimated on average to
contribute 4 MGD. In the summer months the watershed contributes less and approximately 25
MGD is released. The 1929 War Department permit, now overseen by the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers, requires releases based on the flow in the Connecticut River at the Montague gage in
order to maintain navigability. From June 1 to November 30, if the average daily flow is less
than 4,900 cubic feet per second (cfs), 45 MGD must be released, and if the flow is less than
4,460 cfs, 70 MGD must be released.
No impact to the Swift River 95% exceedance flow duration is expected from the proposed
transfer compared to existing conditions because of the mandated 20 MGD flow at Bondsville.
Page 16 of 24

Previous WRC Decisions on past requests by other communities joining MWRA have concluded
that impacts to high flows and flow velocity will be minimal.
Impacts to Fisheries and Other Uses, Swift River
According to MassWildlife, the Swift River below Winsor Dam and downstream to the
confluence of the Ware River contains significant fisheries habitat. The required flow releases
are beneficial to the fishery as they provide a continuous source of cold water. An instream flow
study of the Swift River was done by Normandeau Associates in 1997 for MWRA. MWRA
initiated the study after a 1991 fire damaged the turbines at Winsor Dam and MWRA was
considering reactivating the facility. The study found that the current flow releases were
adequate to protect the Swift River trout fishery.
Over the years MWRA, MassWildlife, and DCR have worked to improve flow and habitat
conditions in the Swift River through changes in how releases are done (e.g., continuous instead
of over 5-7 hours, slower ramp-ups during the summer, cooling warm water spills). More
recently, collaboration between MWRA and MassWildlife resulted in a pipeline to the
McLaughlin Fish Hatchery from the Chicopee Valley Aqueduct. Completed in 2017, the pipeline
provides a 6 MGD supply of consistent and reliable cold, well-oxygenated water to the Hatchery.
Previously the Hatchery withdrew water directly from the Swift River making the Hatchery
vulnerable to warm water spills from the Quabbin. The Hatchery discharges the water to the
Swift River effectively supplementing flows in the river.
The proposed additional withdrawal for LCWD will have no effect on anadromous fisheries,
searun brook and brown trout, smelt, and American shad. There are numerous downstream
barriers to fish passage on the Swift and Chicopee Rivers. In addition, the proposed additional
withdrawal will have no effect on hydropower or other instream uses.
Ware River
The Ware River at the diversion to the Quabbin Aqueduct has a watershed area of 96.8 square
miles. The Ware River contributes approximately 13% of the total Quabbin-Ware-Wachusett
system safe yield. Under the Acts of Massachusetts State Legislature Chapter 375, Acts of 1926,
Ware River diversions are only allowed when flows in the Ware River are above 85 mgd (131
cfs) and limited to the period from October 15 to June 15. In addition, permission must be
obtained from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to transfer water during the periods of June 1
through June 15 and October 15th through November 30th.
As water use has decreased in MWRA communities since the 1980’s, less water has been
typically diverted from the Ware River during normal to wet years. Under the “limited Ware”
operating approach currently implemented by MWRA, transfers from the Ware River are made
only on a limited basis for flood control (when requested) or to help fill the Quabbin when
Quabbin Reservoir is below Normal as defined in the MWRA Drought Management Plan.
Low flow impacts on the Ware River as a result of the additional demand posed by LCWD are
not expected. Ware River diversions are limited to non-low-flow months and to periods when
flow exceeds 85 MGD. As mentioned above, diversions from the Ware River to the Quabbin
Reservoir are typically only made when the reservoir level is below Normal or the U.S. Army
Page 17 of 24

Corps of Engineers requests them for flood control. Previous Decisions have summarized that
the frequency and magnitude of intermediate and high flows appear nearly normal/near natural.
It is acknowledged that Ware diversions are limited per MWRA’s operating practices. This could
change in the future, especially if MWRA service area demand increases.
There are no other impacts expected on other Ware River instream uses with the addition of
LCWD.
Wachusett Reservoir and Nashua River
Wachusett Reservoir has a maximum capacity of 65 billion gallons and has drainage area of 107
square miles. The watershed is slightly more developed than the Quabbin watershed. The
Wachusett Reservoir contributes about 34% of the total Quabbin-Ware-Wachusett system safe
yield. Wachusett Reservoir is managed for continuous water availability, optimal water quality,
release requirements, and flood control.
Chapter 488 of the Acts of 1895 requires that not less than 12 million gallons per week be
discharged into the South Branch of the Nashua River. This release is typically made via a
continuous release into the basin at the base of the Wachusett Dam and is typically higher than
the minimum required.
While the Quabbin Reservoir’s level fluctuates, the Wachusett Reservoir’s level is maintained
within a narrow operating band. The range of elevations was established because it provides
adequate supply to meet demands, minimizes shoreline erosion, provides adequate freeboard to
minimize downstream flooding, and improves water quality. This operating band is maintained
by Wachusett watershed yield, transfers from the Quabbin Reservoir, and additional releases as
needed.
MWRA has historically maintained water quality by mixing Wachusett water with higher quality
Quabbin water. During the summer stratification of the Wachusett Reservoir, water transferred
from the Quabbin can establish an “interflow” layer in which higher quality Quabbin water can
move through the Wachusett to the intake. When Wachusett watershed yields are sufficient to
maintain reservoir elevations within the normal operating band, and transfers of Quabbin water
for water quality purposes are made, higher volumes of releases through or over the Wachusett
Dam may be required to maintain adequate freeboard to minimize flooding potential. With the
decrease of MWRA system demand, it has become increasingly necessary to release more
Wachusett water. This has resulted in higher releases during the summer in recent years.
The 95% exceedance flow is not likely to be affected by LCWD’s proposed additional transfer
request as it will not affect MWRA’s ability to meet minimum releases. Since high flows from
the Wachusett Reservoir are generally uncontrolled spills, and the reservoir level is intended to
be managed to a narrow range of levels, the proposed LCWD interbasin transfer is not expected
to have an impact on high flows in the Nashua River.
Other Uses and Values
There are no other impacts expected with the addition of LCWD on other Nashua River instream
uses. The Central Nashua River Valley ACEC is located downstream of the Wachusett
Page 18 of 24

Reservoir, but will not be affected by this transfer as current operating procedures and required
discharges will not change.
Cumulative Impacts
In the 1992 Bedford ITA Decision, the WRC expressed agreement with concerns about
incremental impacts, whether from adding new communities to the MWRA Waterworks System
or increasing demand from communities already served, potentially resulting in long-term
cumulative reductions in supply available within the Quabbin Reservoir system safe yield.
However, the WRC expected that water conservation efforts, the requirements for admission to
MWRA, the MEPA review process, and the ITA process, as well as the various costs of MWRA
entry, including the entrance fee, pipeline costs, and supply costs, would all work in concert to
minimize the cumulative impacts by reducing existing demand and limiting new demand.
Since the 1992 Bedford WRC Decision, demand continued its downward trend from the high of
343 MGD in 1980 to about 2011 when the 5-year running average of reservoir withdrawals
leveled off around 200 MGD (Figure 4).
Figure 4: MWRA Reservoir Withdrawals (5-year running average)
This decrease has been due to MWRA demand management, especially in the years directly
following its creation in 1984, and due to other likely factors such as consumer response to
higher rates and improved metering, shifts in the commercial base away from water-intensive
manufacturing, changes in the plumbing code, and industry trends towards more efficient
fixtures. While the MWRA Board has waived the water system entrance fee through 2027, the
other factors mentioned in the Bedford Decision still remain including the ITA and the recently
updated ITA performance standards, which will work towards minimizing the transfers.
Table 1 lists the communities that have received WRC approval and the approved amounts, the
year of MWRA admission, and the 5-year average reservoir withdrawals at the time of
admission.

As previously mentioned, the Dedham-Westwood Water District was admitted to MWRA for up
to 2 MGD in 2005. This was not subject to ITA review, as the District had prior rights to obtain
water supply from MWRA. In addition, MWRA signed a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA)
with MassWildlife and DFG to provide 6 MGD to the McLaughlin Fish Hatchery (excluding
periods when drought restrictions are required). Note that Wilmington did not join the MWRA
Waterworks System for the full ITA approved amount, and, according to the SEIR, while
Burlington has begun to use water provided by MWRA, Ashland has not. The 2023 5-year
average reservoir withdrawal is 199 MGD and is used as a baseline in the following analysis.
Cumulative Impacts and Adequacy of the Safe Yield Analysis
The analysis presented in the SEIR considers existing, projected, and potential demand of the
existing MWRA water service area. By comparing the Quabbin-Ware-Wachusett system safe
yield and modeled performance with a conservative projection of future demand, the reliability
of supply can be assessed for both existing MWRA member communities and new members.
Additional demand was projected from 2010 to 2040 and uses volumes from the latest available
MWRA Water Master Plan (dated 2018). Table 2 “MWRA Demand Projections, 2040” provides
a summary of these volumes.
Table 2: MWRA Demand Projections, 2040
Use Categories Demand
Existing service area 2019-2023 199 MGD
Additional residential use, 362,000 population increase* at 65 rgpcd 23.6 MGD
Additional non-residential use, 9.8 %* increase 5.9 MGD
Contingency for partially supplied and emergency-only, 25% increase 17 MGD
Total 245 MGD
* calculated using MassDOT population and employment projections 2010-2040
The conservative projection of future demand used for analysis includes the proposed demand of
LCWD along with new cumulative demand of recently joined or soon-to-join communities of up
to 10 MGD for a total of 255 MGD. This is similar to the last WRC Decision for a new MWRA
community, Burlington, which used 260 MGD.
Page 20 of 24

Using its reservoir model, MWRA evaluated the impact of varying withdrawal rates on
“performance measures” developed as part of The National Study of Water Management During
Drought- The New England Drought Study: Trigger Planning (also known as “The Trigger
Planning Study”) dated 1994. The withdrawal rates analyzed ranged from 190 MGD to 300
MGD and the analysis used historical data from October 1948 through December 2023, which
includes the 1960’s drought of record. The model incorporates incrementally increasing demand
during drought from partially supplied and emergency communities. The modeling assumed full
compliance with mandated releases to the Swift and Nashua Rivers and assumed current
operating procedures for the Ware River. Results of analysis against three of the MWRA
“performance measures” are summarized below.
Safe Yield: (The quantity of water that can be supplied on a continuous basis during a critical
drought.) The Quabbin-Ware-Wachusett system has a calculated safe yield of about 300 MGD
(studies done in 1922, 1950, and several in the 1980’s and 1990’s).
Maximum Pool Descent: (The maximum deviation of the water level at Quabbin Reservoir
below a specific target pool level at a specific water demand.) The Trigger Planning Study
recommended that the Quabbin pool should not fall below 470’ Boston City Base elevation
(BCB) at which point the reservoir no longer functions as a single unit. At the analyzed demand
of 255 MGD, the Quabbin’s maximum pool descent is still above 500’ BCB, above the level at
which performance could be affected, and within the reservoir’s normal operating range. Even at
demands of 280 MGD, Quabbin would stay above elevation 490’ BCB (38% full) which,
according to MWRA’s 1989 Drought Plan, is the minimum pool elevation at which there is an
increased risk of poor water quality. Modeling shows that over the historical record of 1948-
2023, at a demand of 300 MGD, the lowest level the Quabbin would drop to is to about 488’
BCB.
Drought Actions: (The number of months that the reservoir level at Quabbin Reservoir remains
in each of the MWRA Drought Management Plan stages.) Table 3 shows the number of months
in MWRA drought plan stages associated with varying levels of demand using the historical
record of 1948-2023. Modeling shows that had the demand been 255 MGD during the drought of
the 1960’s, the system would not have reached Drought Emergency Stage 1. Comparing
demands of 245 MGD and 255 MGD (refer to asterisked rows in Table 3), there would be an
additional 12 months at the Below Normal stage, an additional 34 months at the Drought
Warning stage, and no months at Drought Emergency Stages (1-3). In the MWRA drought plan,
mandatory water use restrictions only start at the Drought Emergency Stages.

Quabbin Reservoir Levels - Performance during past droughts
Figures 5 and 6 below show system demand from 1950 through 2023 and the Quabbin Reservoir
levels for 1948 through 2023.
Figure 5: System Demand 1950-2023
The lowest Quabbin Reservoir levels occurred in the late 1960’s, near the end of a prolonged and
severe drought-of-record period resulting in low watershed yields. While demands were below
300 MGD during the 1960’s drought, they were still above 250 MGD. The lowest level Quabbin
Reservoir reached was 45% full in March 1967. During the periods 1950-1960 and 2000-2010
when demands varied between 200 and 250 MGD, the Quabbin reservoir was typically more
than 80% full and only briefly below Normal as defined by the MWRA drought plan. Since
2010, when demand has been around 200 MGD, there have been two times the Quabbin has been
below Normal - in 2002 and 2016-2017. Note that during the 2016-2017 drought, the Quabbin
yield for calendar year 2016 was the second lowest on record with the 1965 calendar year being
the lowest.

Summary
The LCWD SEIR indicates that in general, given the very small size of the LCWD transfer in
comparison to the capacity of the reservoirs and the magnitude of discharges over the spillways,
and the discharges governed by regulatory requirements, the effects on hydraulic characteristics
from LCWD’s withdrawals will be imperceptible. There will be no change in the operation of the
Reservoirs in response to the proposed LCWD transfer and downstream flows will continue to
meet all applicable regulatory requirements. Current resources will be unaffected by the transfer.
Intended downstream releases at the Quabbin Reservoir, Ware River, and the Wachusett
Reservoir will not change.
Criterion 6: Impacts of Groundwater Withdrawals
MWRA’s sources are surface water sources. This Criterion is not applicable to this proposal.
Conditions for Approval
Based on the analyses of this project, the approval of LCWD’s application under the ITA to
obtain supplemental water supply from MWRA is subject to the following conditions. LCWD
must commit in writing within 45 days of the approval to abide by all conditions required
by the approval of this transfer.
1. This approval is limited to no more than 0.83 MGD on a maximum daily basis to be
transferred from the MWRA Waterworks System to LCWD. Any increase in the rate of
interbasin transfer is subject to ITA review and will require WRC approval. LCWD staff
must contact WRC staff if any increases in the rate of transfer from the MWRA Waterworks
System are anticipated.
2. To attain compliance with water conservation performance standard 1, LCWD must:
Page 23 of 24

a. Implement a water bank program and submit documentation to MassDEP by
December 31, 2025.
b. Add additional information regarding rebates and links to additional resources such as
the state water conservation website (Massachusetts Water Conservation Toolkit) to
LCWD’s website to more effectively reach customers not signed up for the
WaterSmart portal.
c. Actively monitor the ICI customers in its system for excessive use and conduct
outreach/provide assistance as necessary. LCWD should also more proactively reach
out to the top 10 users to direct them to resources that can help facilities manage
water use, such as EPA's WaterSense page for commercial and institutional facilities.
3. To attain compliance with water conservation performance standard 2, LCWD must:
a. Submit the 2024 M36 audit report once it is available.
b. Continue to conduct annual M36 audits, detection surveys at least every three years,
implement water loss control activities as needed, and provide documentation to the
WRC annually for the first five years after approval, and upon request thereafter.
c. Use the results of its 2024 M36 audit to inform its water loss control program and
submit documentation of the program to WRC staff within one year. The program
will be updated based on the results of future M36 audits, with updates submitted to
WRC staff. The proponent should refer to the EPA, AWWA, and WRF for guidance
on water loss control program development. The program should include, at a
minimum, the elements outlined in Section III.A.2.a-h of the ITA Performance
Standards.
4. To attain compliance with water conservation performance standard 3, LCWD must:
a. Continue to implement its meter repair/replacement program, with updates made to
the program as needed per M36 audit results and its ongoing water loss control
program.
b. Continue meter replacements at least at the current rate.
c. Continue master meter calibration services on an annual basis.
d. Provide documentation of the above actions to the WRC annually for the first five
years after approval, and upon request thereafter.
5. To attain compliance with water conservation performance standard 4, LCWD must revise its
DMP to adequately define its “operational conditions triggers,” match its nonessential
outdoor water use restrictions to the state DMP guidelines, agree to follow the restrictions for
droughts as declared by the Secretary of EEA for the Northeast Drought Region and also as
set forth by MWRA, and submit the revised DMP to WRC staff within one year for review
and approval.
Executive Order 385
This Decision is consistent with Executive Order 385 - Planning for Growth, which has the dual
objective of resource protection and sustainable development. This Decision does not encourage
growth in areas without adequate infrastructure nor does it cause a loss of environmental quality
or resources.
