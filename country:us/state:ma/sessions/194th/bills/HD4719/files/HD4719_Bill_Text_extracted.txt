Secretary Terrence M. Reidy
Executive Office of Public Safety and Security
Facial Recognition Searches Annual Report
M.G.L. c. 6, § 220
Enforcement in the Commonwealth” (the Act), was signed into law. The Act created G.L. c. 6, §
220, which became effective on July 1, 2021, and imposes limitations and requirements on law
enforcement agencies requesting or performing facial recognition searches and establishes
reporting requirements for law enforcement agencies and the Executive Office of Public Safety
and Security (EOPSS).
A “facial recognition search” is defined in the statute as “a computer search using facial
recognition to attempt to identify an unidentified person by comparing an image containing the
face of the unidentified person to a set of images of identified persons; provided, however, that a
set of images shall not include moving images or video data.” G.L. c. 6, § 220(a). As of July 1,
2021, law enforcement agencies requesting or performing a facial recognition search may only do
so via written request and only based on two statutory justifications: court order or emergency.
G.L. c. 6, § 220(b). This requirement of a written request for limited purposes does not apply “to
the department of state police when performing investigatory functions related to the issuance of
identification documents by the registrar of motor vehicles.” G.L. c. 6, § 220(b).
Beginning July 1, 2021, law enforcement agencies were required to document certain
information about facial recognition searches requested by law enforcement agencies, and report
that information to EOPSS on a quarterly basis. G.L. c. 6, § 220(c). The Act requires law
enforcement agencies to provide the following information1:
1Such documentation shall not be a public record. G.L. c. 6, § 220(c).
2
(i) a copy of any written request made for a facial recognition search;
(ii) the date and time of the request;
(iii) the number of matches returned, if any;
(iv) the database searched;
(v) the name and position of the requesting individual and employing law enforcement
agency;
(vi) the reason for the request, including, but not limited to any underlying suspected
crime;
(vii) the entity to which the request was submitted; and
(viii) data detailing the individual characteristics included in the facial recognition request.
The Act requires EOPSS to publish on its website annually the documentation provided to EOPSS
on a quarterly basis by law enforcement agencies and the following information:
(i) the total number of facial recognition search requests made by other law
enforcement agencies to the department of state police, disaggregated by law
enforcement agency;
(ii) the total number of facial recognition searches performed by the department of state
police, disaggregated by law enforcement agency on whose behalf the search was
performed; an
(iii) the total number of facial recognition searches requested and performed by the state
police;
(iv) the total number of facial recognition search requests made by the department of
state police to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, disaggregated by law
enforcement agency on whose behalf the requests were made; and
3
(v) the total number of facial recognition searches performed by the Federal Bureau of
Investigation on behalf of Massachusetts law enforcement agencies.
Quarterly Documentation and Information About Facial Recognition Searches Requested
and Performed by Law Enforcement Agencies Between September 1, 2023, and October 1,
2024, Pursuant to G.L. c. 6, § 220(c) & (d).
The department of state police received a total of forty-five requests to utilize facial
recognition technology between September 1, 2023, and September 30, 2024. Of the forty-five
requests, thirty-seven were written requests, pursuant to a court order. The other seven searches
were the result of exigent circumstances. Photographs were submitted with all of the requests
received and the department’s database, Issuance 360, was used to perform all of the searches.
Fourteen of the searches yielded one potential match. The department of state police did not make
any facial recognition requests of any type to the Federal Bureau of Investigation between
September 2023 and October 2024.
Table 1 below includes the information required by G.L. c. 6, § 220(c) & (d) broken down

M.G.L. c. 6, § 220
On December 31, 2020, “An Act Relative to Justice, Equity and Accountability in Law
Enforcement in the Commonwealth” (the Act), was signed into law. The Act created G.L. c. 6, §
220, which became effective on July 1, 2021, and imposes limitations and requirements on law
enforcement agencies requesting or performing facial recognition searches and establishes
reporting requirements for law enforcement agencies and the Executive Office of Public Safety
and Security (EOPSS).
A “facial recognition search” is defined in the statute as “a computer search using facial
recognition to attempt to identify an unidentified person by comparing an image containing the
face of the unidentified person to a set of images of identified persons; provided, however, that a
set of images shall not include moving images or video data.” G.L. c. 6, § 220(a). As of July 1,
2021, law enforcement agencies requesting or performing a facial recognition search may only do
so via written request and only based on two statutory justifications: court order or emergency.
G.L. c. 6, § 220(b). This requirement of a written request for limited purposes does not apply “to
the department of state police when performing investigatory functions related to the issuance of
identification documents by the registrar of motor vehicles.” G.L. c. 6, § 220(b).
Beginning July 1, 2021, law enforcement agencies were required to document certain
information about facial recognition searches requested by law enforcement agencies, and report
that information to EOPSS on a quarterly basis. G.L. c. 6, § 220(c). The Act requires law
enforcement agencies to provide the following information1:

(i) the total number of facial recognition search requests made by other law
enforcement agencies to the department of state police, disaggregated by law

The department of state police received a total of forty-five requests to utilize facial
recognition technology between September 1, 2023, and September 30, 2024. Of the forty-five
requests, thirty-seven were written requests, pursuant to a court order. The other seven searches
were the result of exigent circumstances. Photographs were submitted with all of the requests
received and the department’s database, Issuance 360, was used to perform all of the searches.
Fourteen of the searches yielded one potential match. The department of state police did not make
any facial recognition requests of any type to the Federal Bureau of Investigation between
September 2023 and October 2024.
