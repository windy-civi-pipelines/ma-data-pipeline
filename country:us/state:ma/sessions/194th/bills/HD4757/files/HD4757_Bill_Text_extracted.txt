Section 7:
1. Introduction
The Devens Housing Working Group (Working Group) was created by the Legislature (Section
298 of Chapter 238 of the Acts of 2024) with the following charge:
The working group shall determine a strategy and plan to
provide for increased housing production within Devens,
including, but not limited to, the feasibility of allowing not
more than 400 multi-family residential units in the
Innovation and Technology Center zoning district
established by Article V(A)(13) of the zoning by-laws of the
Devens Regional Enterprise Zone.
The Working Group consists of the following members: Secretary of Economic Development –
Chair; Director, HLC Livable Communities Division; Director/Land Use Administrator, Devens
Enterprise Commission; Chair of the Devens Committee; President and CEO of Mass
Development; Select Board Member, Town of Ayer; Select Board Member, Town of Harvard; and
Select Board Member, Town of Shirley.
As presented in each meeting, the goal of the Working Group is: Provide a vision for increasing
housing production within Devens.
This final report was approved unanimously by the Working Group on May 14. The Working
Group considered a preliminary draft report at its meeting on April 1. An updated draft that was
expanded to incorporate feedback from Working Group members, the public, and surrounding
towns was presented to and discussed by the Working Group at its meeting on May 8.
Like the prior drafts, this updated and final report: provides some context about Devens and the
communities that surround it; explains the process by which the Working Group gathered
information and built consensus around its recommendations; sets forth a strategy and plan for
increased housing production in Devens; and proposes the framework for an amendment to the
Devens Zoning By-laws to achieve that objective.
This final report also includes a section addressing the process by which the Zoning By-laws
can be amended, as well as a draft of a zoning amendment that would achieve the goal of
promoting increased housing production at Devens. It also includes a section addressing the
process by which the Zoning By-laws may be amended.
This final report also includes several appendices with supporting information such as public
comments and details about the regional housing context, all of which were introduced in a prior
draft and presented to the Working Group members on May 8.

Section 8:
2. Regional Context and Background on Devens and the Surrounding Communities
Regional Housing Context
Devens is located in greater
north central Massachusetts in
the Montachusett Regional
Planning Commission (MRPC)
region, which has 22
municipalities, ranging from
mixed-use urban centers like
Fitchburg to small and rural
towns such as Ashby. The
region’s character and
community development has
been shaped by the historic
dominance of the
manufacturing industry and
the military. The region has the highest concentration of manufacturing jobs in the state but has
a critically low housing vacancy rate: only 1.1% of homes are for sale or rent, lower than the
vacancy rate for the state as a whole. This creates intense demand for the homes that are
available and pushes prices higher.
Within the Montachusett region, the
median sale price for a single-family home
or condo more than doubled from 2012 to
2023, rising from $158,000 to $375,000.
More than 30% of households in the region
are housing cost burdened, paying more
than 30% of their income in rent. Roughly
one in ten homeowners and one in five
renters in the region are paying more than
half their income on housing costs.
Communities in the Montachusett region,
including Devens, reported issuing building
permits for just 3,505 new homes between
2013 and 2023. Current EOHLC estimates
indicate the region may need 6,300 new
homes from 2025 to 2035. This
underscores the need and demand for
more housing in the entire region, including
Devens.
Additional regional context is included in
Appendix A of this report.

Devens Background
Devens was created by a special act of the Legislature (Chapter 498 of the Acts of 1993) to help
provide an orderly and expeditious conversion and development of approximately 4,400 acres
that were a portion of a former federal military base, Fort Devens, into a non-military-use
area. Devens comprises land area within the historic boundaries of the Towns of Ayer, Harvard,
and Shirley.
Devens Regional
Enterprise Zone
Page 4 of 11
Chapter 498 of the Acts of 1993 made the Massachusetts Government Land Bank (later merged
into MassDevelopment) exclusively responsible for acquisition, control, maintenance, and
redevelopment of Devens. To provide for orderly development, a long-term Reuse Plan and
Zoning By-laws were adopted by the Massachusetts Government Land Bank and the Towns of
Ayer, Harvard, and Shirley. The Reuse Plan and Zoning By-laws provided broad development
goals and planned uses of the property and were passed at town meetings in the three towns.
The legislation also established the Devens Enterprise Commission to function as the local
regulatory and permit-granting authority for all new development within Devens to ensure
development in a manner consistent with the Reuse Plan and Zoning By-laws.
Since the establishment of Devens, approximately 120 units of former military housing have
been repurposed and 136 new units of housing have been constructed within its boundaries.
Devens currently has 256 units of residential and senior housing and approximately 950
residents. MassDevelopment is obligated to provide the same educational benefits and
opportunities other Massachusetts residents enjoy, which MassDevelopment has typically done
by contracting with one of the nearby school districts. Since 2012, MassDevelopment has
contracted with the Harvard School District to educate students residing in Devens. In the 2023-
24 academic year, there were 86 full-time and 10 transitional students attending the Hildreth
Elementary and Bromfield (High) Schools and six out-of-district students.
Until recently, housing development in Devens was limited by the Reuse Plan to no more than
282 units. That housing cap was removed by the Legislature last year and the development of
new housing on parcels already zoned for residential uses is governed by the Zoning By-laws,
as approved by the three towns and MassDevelopment, and regulations promulgated by the
Devens Enterprise Commission.

Section 9:
3. The Working Group’s Process for Building Consensus
The Working Group has held five meetings to conduct its work and develop this final report.
Each meeting was held at a location in Devens or virtually and was open to the public. The
Working Group also established an online portal to accept public comments.
At the Working Group’s initial meeting on January 22, 2025, each member and legislator in
attendance was provided an opportunity to articulate what success would look like at the end of
the process. A strong consensus emerged that the Working Group should strive to propose
achievable recommendations and establish flexible zoning recommendations that would lead to
actual housing production within a reasonable timeframe.
At this initial meeting, Working Group members also were assigned to one of three subgroups:
• Devens Fundamentals: Asked to consider and report on the background of Devens and
existing zoning and regulatory framework.
• Community Considerations: Asked to consider and report on community needs and
opportunities.
• Innovation in Development and Sustainable Housing: Asked to consider and report on
the general framework for residential zoning in the ITC district.
The three subgroups met multiple times and shared their work at the second Working Group
meeting on February 25, 2025. At the end of the second meeting, Secretary Hao asked that a
“captain” of each subgroup meet subsequently to craft the first draft of a report and plan to
Page 5 of 11
provide for increased housing. The captains met five times to develop the first draft of this
report which was presented at the third Working Group meeting on April 1, 2025.
At its first two meetings, the Working Group heard that the following statements reflect the vision
for more housing at Devens.
• Adaptive reuse where feasible;
• Historic preservation and compatibility;
• Special attention to existing businesses and residences;
• New housing is compatible with surrounding land uses and densities;
• Connect new housing districts to open space – creating and maintaining the network of
recreational trails and green infrastructure;
• Importance of public education about zoning for additional housing types;
• Public education about the unique situation with MassDevelopment as the property
owner and DEC regulations is different from other zoning and development processes;
• Green and complete streets;
• Healthy buildings, social and active neighborhood design;
• Build from existing success of Innovative Residential District (IRD) regulations but
recognizing the different location and context;
• Careful not to let parking dictate design – design neighborhoods for people first
• Jurisdiction will not be accelerated – can accommodate additional housing if properly
planned;
• Ensure the existing levels of service that Devens residents, businesses and
organizations have come to expect are maintained.
The following community considerations were presented to the Working Group in the second
meeting.
Needs
• Increase senior housing by zoning for a range of housing types and densities. Smaller
units work well for seniors and downsizers. Do not need to restrict zoning for seniors.
• Maintain or increase green spaces, walking trails, and wildlife habitat;
• Consider how towns’ Councils on Aging work with Devens residents;
• Public education about existing public transportation – shuttles to MBTA Commuter Rail
and Montachusett Regional Transit Authority (MART) services that are available;
• Concern about increase in traffic;
• Desire to phase housing over time so that there is no “glut” of new housing units;
• Availability of healthcare system to support additional residents;
• Ability of regional education system to support additional residents;
• Importance of design so that community character reflects Devens historic designs;
• Rogers Field and existing recreational demands considered in design and location of
new residential areas;
• Playground within the ITC.
Opportunities
• Existing infrastructure in place to serve new residential development (roads, sewer,
water);
• Municipal services provided by MassDevelopment;
Page 6 of 11
• More customers for local businesses;
• New connections and trails to adjacent municipalities;
• Increase in affordable housing;
• Additional users of new amenities in Devens;
• Economic growth, increased revenue and job opportunities for the region.
The Working Group also solicited and reviewed written public comments as part of its
information gathering process. For the most part, the public comments were supportive of
additional housing at Devens. Most public commenters expressed a preference for the kinds of
housing they would prefer to be built at Devens, or the kinds of amenities that they would wish
for when new housing is developed. The Select Boards of Ayer, Harvard and Shirley also
submitted identical letters identifying the “two matters of greatest concern” as being “the
methods used to enact any changes to town zoning bylaws and the omission of binding
prescriptive development criteria, in particular for Vicksburg Square.” All public comments are in
Appendix B.

Section 10:
4. Strategies for Increased Housing at Devens
As directed by Legislature, the Working Group focused most of its attention on strategies to
promote housing production within the Innovation and Technology Center (ITC) zoning district.
The ITC comprises approximately 90 acres in total, including the historic buildings at Vicksburg
Square.
The Zoning By-laws currently allow commercial and other uses in the ITC, but no housing.
Preliminary findings support the need for and development of a range of housing types within
the ITC District to re-create the classic village/neo-traditional neighborhood design concept that
was originally laid out by the military with housing and a mix of uses surrounding Rogers Field.
Page 7 of 11
Additional housing in the ITC is also consistent with the Core patterns in the Reuse Plan (see
page 28). A diversity of housing types that includes primarily “missing-middle housing” (cottage
style/small footprint single family, duplex, townhomes, and apartments) in size and scale that is
in context with the surrounding development and the historic nature of this district.
The Working Group considered the following strategies and principles for a zoning amendment
that would permit housing within the ITC District:

Section 11:
1. Amend the existing zoning to permit a range of housing types within certain areas of the
district.
• Reuse of Vicksburg Square buildings – feasibility to be informed by further study;
• Allow housing over remaining 40+ developable acres (with a range of densities);
• The fine-tuning of densities will need to rely on design and compatibility;
• Densities – mixed – but generally higher near Rogers and reduce as we move away
from Rogers, (Devens Utilities can likely accommodate higher densities);
• Combination of market-rate and deed restricted affordable units – while there is a desire
to maintain Devens 25% affordable requirement the financial feasibility of such a
requirement needs to be further evaluated to ensure this aspirational target does not
make it financially unfeasible to actually build new housing.

Section 12:
2. Frame the ITC District area as a village center to capitalize on the classic neo-traditional
neighborhood design, recognizing existing opportunities and constraints within the District.
• Require innovative, low-carbon neighborhood and building designs in exchange for
higher densities that respect location and context (continuing to lead by example);
• Missing middle housing types – smaller footprint, mix of housing types, universal
accessibility, age-in place (life-cycle housing);
• Consider existing development and vacant parcel development opportunities and
constraints when considering density and building typologies;
• Mix of rental and for-sale units (flexibility to meet market demand);
• Mixed-use zoning (allowing for a mix of complementary commercial and residential
uses).
Following the adopting of a zoning amendment, the Devens Enterprise Commission will have
authority to promulgate more detailed regulations to minimize or mitigate any adverse impacts
of proposed housing developments, and to facilitate innovative residential development in the
ITC District consistent with these strategies and principles.

Section 13:
5. Process for Amending the Zoning By-laws
A zoning amendment consistent with the principles outlined above could be enacted either by a
super town meeting held in Ayer, Harvard, and Shirley, with the approval of MassDevelopment,
or by a special act of the Legislature. The Working Group has received a number of comments
about the process by which the Zoning By-laws can or should be amended, with the Select
Boards of Ayer, Harvard, and Shirley all expressing the view that the Zoning By-laws should
only be changed by super town meeting votes. Most of the public comment offered at the
Working Group’s meeting on May 8 was focused on the two methods of changing the Zoning
By-laws, and which process was preferable. Residents of Devens also expressed that they are
most directly affected by development in Devens and should have more say in whether and how
the Zoning By-laws are amended.
Page 8 of 11
The Working Group does not believe that its charge from the Legislature—to determine a
strategy and plan to provide for increased housing production within Devens—includes making
a recommendation on the process by which the Zoning By-laws are amended. Accordingly, the
Working Group is not making any recommendation as to how the Zoning By-laws should be
amended, only that they should be amended.
If a zoning amendment is proposed to be enacted at super town meeting, MassDevelopment
and the Towns would follow the process set forth in Section 10 of Chapter 498 of the Acts of
1993:
• MassDevelopment and the Towns hold two or more public hearings, as they
determine appropriate, in the Devens region to receive public comment.
• Within 30 days of the last public hearing held by MassDevelopment and the Towns,
submit the proposed revision(s) to the Select Board of each of the Towns.
• Within 90 days of receipt of the proposed revision(s), the Select Board of each of the
Towns shall convene a town meeting to be held at the same date and time in each of
the Towns for the purpose of adopting or rejecting, by majority vote of each town
meeting, the revision(s). Each Town shall vote to adopt or disapprove the revisions
as submitted. No amendments to the revisions shall be made by the Towns.
• Each Town shall, within 30 days of an adoption or rejection of the revision(s) at a
town meeting, provide MassDevelopment and the Devens Enterprise Commission
with a written notification stating whether town meeting adopted or rejected the
revision(s).
To promote local understanding of the benefits of new housing production at Devens, and to
ensure that MassDevelopment, the DEC and the Towns take appropriate action to prepare for
new housing development, the Working Group recommends that the MassDevelopment and the
Towns engage a planning consultant to undertake the following studies prior to any super town
meeting:

Section 14:
1. School needs assessment – for the region to include analysis of recent zoning
amendments in each community. The study should include a review of existing
enrollment levels in the region and capacity of each district at primary and secondary
levels. The study will use professional enrollment study models to predict enrollment
and determine if land should be set aside for a school within Devens.

Section 15:
2. Update assessments of existing buildings to determine adaptive reuse feasibility.

Section 16:
3. Traffic and parking study, including transit and Transportation Demand Management
initiatives.

Section 17:
4. Engage the community. Consider approaches such as design charrettes to identify
opportunities and constraints (e.g., utilities, topography). Identify effects of additional
residential units within the ITC District and create a plan to address through design
and permitting.
The Working Group has been informed that state funding is available for these kinds of planning
studies, through a grant from the Executive Office of Housing and Livable Communities to the
Town of Ayer acting as fiscal agent for the other towns.

Section 18:
6. Framework and Guiding Principles for a Zoning Amendment
Page 9 of 11
At its April 1 meeting, the Working Group developed a general consensus that its report and
recommendations would be most impactful if they include the text of a zoning amendment that
can be brought for approval at super town meeting, following the process noted above. The
initial draft report noted that such a zoning amendment would need to, at minimum:
• Add Residential Uses (Single or Two Family Dwelling, Multi Family Dwelling, Senior
Housing) as Permitted Uses in the Innovation Technology Center District in the Table
of Permitted Uses under Exhibit D of the Devens Zoning By-laws. (Note: small-scale
retail is already permitted as an accessory use so mixed use would be feasible.)
• Add new Multi-Family/Apartment category in Article VI.A1.k. General Land Use
Categories: Residential, of the Devens By-Laws to allow for multi-family apartment
buildings with more than 3-8 units.
• Set forth the applicable density limitations and height and other dimensional
limitations or requirements.
For clarity, the zoning amendment might also modify Article IX. E.1. of the Devens Zoning By-
laws to strike the reference to the 282-unit housing cap, making the by-law consistent with the
special act that eliminated the housing cap.
Consistent with the Working Group’s consensus to achieve an outcome that is practical and
feasible, the initial draft report recommended that a zoning amendment not be overly
prescriptive or detailed. For example, the zoning amendment should permit but not require
specific housing types. Affordability requirements should likewise be reasonable, i.e., not make
actual development financially unfeasible. Preliminary zoning amendments are included as
Appendix C.
This potential zoning amendment is consistent with the current By-laws and regulatory
framework governing development in Devens. Specifically, the amendment would allow
residential uses in the ITC District and allow the DEC to develop regulations through its
statutory processes to permit appropriate developments. Appendix D provides an overview of
the DEC’s process to promulgate new regulations, which is a public process that enables
interested individuals, communities, and organizations the opportunity to continue to be involved
and provide input throughout this process, before any housing is permitted or developed in the
ITC District.
Additional Considerations:
Planning for any additional housing within the ITC District must consider the existing
undeveloped residentially zoned lands within Devens as many of these areas abut or are near
the ITC District (context-sensitive planning and design). See the map of Devens on the following
page. The existing Innovative Residential Development (IRD) regulations at 974 CMR 5.02 and
Green and Complete Streets regulations at 974 CMR 2.07 are consistent with many of the
principles envisioned in this report and would complement the proposed residential
development patterns within the ITC District. However, it will be important to consider the
surrounding context existing undeveloped residentially zoned lands within Devens as part of the
drafting of any regulations that would facilitate residential development in the ITC District.

APPENDIX A:
Regional Context
Located in greater north central Massachusetts the Montachusett region has 22 municipalities,
ranging from mixed-use urban centers like Fitchburg to small and rural towns such as
Ashby.[1]The region also includes the Devens Regional Enterprise Zone (Devens), a 4,400 acre
former military base encompassing portions of the towns of Ayer, Harvard, and Shirley.
Key Considerations:
The Montachusett Region has a
critically low vacancy rate: only 1.1%
of homes are for sale or rent, lower than
the state’s vacancy rate. This creates
intense demand for the homes that are
available and pushes prices higher.
The median sale price for a single-family
home or condo more than doubled from
2012–2023, rising from $158,000 to
$375,000.
More than 30% of households in the
region are housing cost burdened,
paying more than 30% of their income in
rent. Roughly one in ten homeowners
and one in five renters in the region are
paying more than half of their income on
housing costs.
Montachusett region municipalities
reported issuing building permits for just
3,505 new homes from 2013–2023.
Current EOHLC estimates indicate the
region may need 6,300 new homes
from 2025 to 2035.
Appendix: 1
The region’s character and community development has been shaped by the historic
dominance of the manufacturing industry and the military. The region has the highest
concentration of manufacturing jobs in the state. The decline of the manufacturing sector has
opened new economic opportunities, such as expanding the region’s tourism sector; however,
the industrial character has left a lasting impact on the region’s community and housing
development. For instance, the region has a number of Environmental Justice Populations and
is faced with environmental challenges; 19 communities have brownfield sites[2] and Devens is
a Superfund site on the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) National Priorities List
(NPL). The amount of cleanup necessary varies by site, but the presence of hazardous
substances or pollutants present additional challenges to housing development or adaptive
reuse. Through MRPC’s Brownfields Program, the regional planning agency has made progress
on brownfield remediation by leveraging EPA funds. Redevelopment projects vary but include
building affordable single-family housing units in Fitchburg and Gardner.[3] The coordinated
clean-up effort by the EPA, the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection, the
U.S. Army, and MassDevelopment has facilitated the redevelopment of this former military base
into a thriving mixed-use community with nearly 100 employers and more than 6,000
employees, creating substantial economic growth in the region but further contributing to the
unique housing challenges.
The dominance and decline of industry are also reflected in the Gateway City designations of
two cities within the region: Fitchburg and Leominster. Both cities are economic hubs for the
region, with proximity to transportation hubs, but face unique housing challenges. Although both
cities are among the least expensive rental housing markets, the data also show a growing gap
in household income compared to the rest of the state.[4] As a result, housing costs in the
region are high for existing residents who live and work in the region. However, the region’s
relative affordability, connection to regional transit, and proximity to major economic centers
such as Boston and Worcester, has attracted an influx of new residents, creating tensions in the
region’s inventory supply.[5] One way in which MRPC prioritizes the preservation and production
of affordable housing is through the Montachusett Enterprise Center, Inc. (MEC), a nonprofit
Appendix: 2
subsidiary focused on affordable housing production and job creation in the region.[6] A reason
for the organization’s success is due to MEC’s receivership designation and authority to “take
temporary possession of abandoned/foreclosed properties which pose a threat to public health
and safety.”[7] A regional receivership program allows MEC to rehabilitate unused properties to
meet health and building code standards and resell more quickly than a property owner might
be able to do on their own.
With the military as a major employer in the eastern portion of the Montachusett Region, after
the base closure was announced in 1993, the redevelopment efforts in Devens focused more on
economic development. Up until November 2024, Devens was restricted to a limit of 282
housing units. While this artificial limitation was restrictive, Devens did require 25% to be
affordable to low- and moderate-income individuals and households.
The incidence of cost burden in the Montachusett region is slightly lower than statewide rates,
notably for severe cost burden. For example, only 21.1% (+/- 1.8%) of MRPC renters are
severely cost burdened, as compared to 25.2% (+/- 0.4%) of renters statewide.
EOHLC's Competing and Growing scenario forecasts that the number of households in the
region is projected to grow by 4,900 from 2025 - 2035 under the Competing and Growing
scenario used for the Statewide housing plan targets. With vacancy rates of just 1.0% for
homeownership units and 4.7% for rentals, EOHLC also estimates the region needs 1,400
additional homes for sale or rent to achieve a healthy vacancy rate. All told, EOHLC estimates
that MRPC region needs to add 6,400 homes to the year-round supply over ten years to meet
the forecasted need, an increase of 6.1% over the 2020 housing stock. The number of
projected households by age of householder (below) shows that the region is likely to see a
decline in households under the age of 40, an increase of those 40-54 (likely drawn to the
region for its lower housing costs), and an increase of 7,500 households headed by someone
70 or older.
Montachusett
Appendix: 3
Driven largely by the increase in the Oldest Adult households, all of the net growth is in
households earning less than $75,000 per year (growth of 5,600 households). The total number
of households earning $125,000 or more is projected to decline by nearly 1,000. This is due in
part to the large decline in households 55-69 (age groups that tend to have higher incomes than
older and younger groups) as the youngest Boomers age into retirement or leave the region.

APPENDIX B:
Proposed/Draft Zoning Amendments
To facilitate the development of housing in the Innovation and Technology Center Zoning
District, there would be four (4) text edits required, as shown below. Deletions are shown as
struck-through text and new text is underlined.

Section 19:
1. Article IX. E. Residential Density, Section 1.:
There is no limit on the total number of residential units to be allowed within the existing
residential zoning districts in Devens (as authorized under Section 272 of the 2024 Mass
Leads Act). shall not exceed two hundred and eighty-two (282) units, not including , with
the exception of the Senior Residential units within the Shirley Village Growth I Zoning
District, which shall not exceed one hundred twenty (120) units.

Section 20:
2. Article V.A. Development Goals, Section 13.b.:
The primary goal of this zoning district is to provide an urban center for the Devens
Regional Enterprise Zone in which residential, incubator ventures, and a broad range of
businesses are encouraged. Its combination of historic buildings and traditional open
space provides an environment unique to the former base and allows for an intensity
and of both a mix of residential, business, and public uses that is singular to Devens.
Development of design, siting, and retrofitting criteria should be flexible in order to
accommodate a wide range of users and their special needs, and any ancillary support
services. A major theme for this zone is to encourage and promote the development of a
range of housing types, as well as academic and educational support links for the entire
Devens Regional Enterprise Zone, as set forth in the Reuse Plan.

Section 21:
3. Article VI.A. General Land Use Categories, Section 3.k.:
The residential use type refers to the following activities: single and two family dwellings;
multi-family dwellings [containing three or more units]; nursing homes and congregate or
life care facilities with a permanent health care component; housing for the elderly,
including retirement communities and shared living developments; active and passive
recreation facilities; and professional offices and service businesses as accessory uses
or home occupations where allowed in particular districts.

Appendix: 6
APPENDIX C:
Devens Enterprise Commission Regulation Revision/Adoption Process
Once any Zoning By-Law amendments have been adopted, the Devens Enterprise Commission
(DEC) can craft and promulgate regulations to guide the development of housing within the ITC
District that is consistent with the findings of the Devens Housing Working Group Report and
subsequent supporting studies. Such a process would include:
Drafting of Innovative Housing Regulations specific to the ITC District to accommodate the
following:
• Missing Middle housing types (range of housing types and densities to meet market
demand and provide a wider range of price points for smaller homes and smaller lots).
• Maintaining an appropriate affordability requirement (both low- and moderate-income
levels)
• Green and Complete Streets (safe streets designed for all users and low-impact
development techniques that incorporate more natural elements for both environmental
and social benefits)
• Context sensitive design (compatibility with surrounding land uses and the Devens
Historic District)
• Interconnected network of parks and open spaces.
• Adaptive reuse potential (condition of existing buildings and realistic potential for reuse)
• Phased approach to any housing development in the ITC.
• Any additional factors that may be raised in the recommended supporting studies to
address traffic, schooling, utilities, etc.
The Devens Rules and Regulations are Code of Massachusetts Regulations (CMRs). To modify
or change these regulations, the DEC would take the following steps:

Section 23:

to the Plan/Report of the Devens Housing Production Working Group that you chair.
The two matters of greatest concern to us are the method used to enact any changes to town zoning
bylaws, and the omission of binding prescriptive development criteria for Vicksburg Square.
We strongly object to equating these two methods.

change town zoning bylaws. Any legislative
changes to the bylaws of the Devens Regional Enterprise Zone would violate both the detailed, specific
language and the spirit of informed self-governance enacted by Massachusetts General Law, Part I, Title
VII, Chapter 40A, Section 5. Further, Section 10 of Chapter 498 of the Acts of 1993, the enabling

Dear Secretary Hao:
The Harvard Select Board voted Unanimously at its meeting of April 15, 2025 that the following be included
as public Comment to the Plan/Report of the Devens Housing Production Working Group that you chair.
The two matters of greatest concern to us are the method used to enact any changes to town zoning
bylaws, and the omission of binding prescriptive development criteria for Vicksburg Square.
The draft plan seems to give equal weight to using either a super town meeting or special legislation to

Devens Regional Enterprise Zone, specifically states that changes to the Devens Reuse Plan and Bylaws
must use the same process as when they were originally adopted, which is a super town meeting, with
prior approval by MassDevelopment.
We know of no case where the Legislature has overridden local zoning bylaws. Such legislation would
set a precedent for every city and town in the Commonwealth. The fact that the Legislature has the
authority to enact such measures does not imply that it is appropriate or justified to do so. Every zoning
bylaw change enacted at Devens over the past 32 years has been accomplished by a super town meeting,
and this method has been overwhelmingly successful.
The draft plan calls for up to 400 units of housing to be added to the Innovation and Technology Center (ITC)
district, split between adaptive reuse of the Vicksburg Square quadrangle and the remainder of the ITC
zone. Given the size and location of the Vicksburg Square quadrangle and the anticipated density of units
created in them, we strongly recommend that MassDevelopment submit a detailed and enforceable
redevelopment plan for any proposed zoning changes.

A Vision of Housing Development at Devens. Bill Duston, Chance Street
I believe that the Devens residential community should remain intact and not be separated into two
towns. Currently Devens residents are separated politically by the old boundary lines of Ayer and
Harvard, but are physically located in a small compact area and share all the qualities of a small town
community of around 600 people. Whatever happens to the jurisdiction of Devens, I feel that the
residential community should remain together and be either part of Ayer, Shirley, Harvard or Devens as a
single entity. With that in mind, I would like to describe the future residential development of Devens as I
see it.
As residents, we experience Devens as a wonderful, vibrant, and very livable community with open
space, neighborhoods, excellent infrastructure and services that are close by. The existing housing and
residentially zoned area in Devens is no more than 1-1.5 square miles and is bounded by Adams Circle,
the Parker School, the end of Grant Road, and Bradley Circle. Our residential area is conveniently
adjacent to the commercial area of Devens Commons and near to all the other recreational offerings of
Devens, including Mirror Lake, Red Tail Golf, playing fields, disc golf and walking paths. The Innovation
and Technology Center District (ITC) including Vicksburg Square is in the center of our residential area.
Because the ITC is the center of the residential community of Devens, it should be the cornerstone of the
community and be the link that brings all of our neighborhoods together. Any new development in
Vicksburg Square should draw our community together both physically and socially.
How should the ITC be rezoned and developed? Here are some of the criteria that I feel are important
and essential to this development . Many of these were mentioned at the first Working Group Meeting.

Section 45:
1. Reuse existing buildings or tear them down and build on the same site. (i.e. BOQ)

Section 46:
2. Develop brown areas before green, if possible.

Section 47:
3. The density of the residential zone should incorporate cluster zoning with maximum open space and
walkability

Section 48:
4. Vicksburg Square should contain no more than 150-200 units of owned and rental housing in 1-2 of
the existing buildings with the remaining buildings torn down. Four large buildings with 400 units of
housing in Vicksburg Square is too massive for the residential area and for the region.

Section 49:
5. Live/Work/Play should be the guideline for the ITC residential area which should include recreation
and mixed use zoning.

Section 50:
6. Development should use the DEC zoning guidelines and include 25% affordable with an emphasis on
work force housing and affordability. The template used by NOW Communities at Emerson Green
should be the starting point and include a combination of single, multiple and rental units.
Construction should emphasize sustainability and a small carbon footprint.

Section 51:
7. The ITC should incorporate mixed use zoning to allow for ancillary commercial space that is
compatible with the current Devens Commons businesses and existing ITC businesses.

Section 52:
8. Pedestrian traffic should be encouraged and auto traffic should be restricted from certain areas such
as Buena Vista.

Section 53:
9. Zoning for future municipal use should be located outside of the residential zone.

Section 54:
10. Rogers Field should be used for recreation and open space, but large scale recreation events should
not be allowed due to the proximity to residential development.

Section 55:
11. New areas within the ITC should be rezoned for open space to include buffer zones between
Vicksburg Square and the surrounding residential neighborhoods. Jackson Road and Elm Street
provide a buffer for the Auman/Bates and lower Elm/Walnut neighborhoods, however new green
space should be considered. A green buffer zone should be developed between the ITC and the
Emerson Green/upper Walnut and Elm neighborhoods.

Section 56:
12. If possible, historical buildings should be reused with the exception of the four Vicksburg Square
buildings which could be reduced to 1-2 as described above in #4.

Section 57:
13. Utilities should be placed underground.

Section 58:
14.Construction should be done to the highest quality and aesthetics.

Devens New Housing should favor affordability (more than 25%). It is an economic
development issue for MA. Home ownership across the US is declining. Wealth gap is growing.
Devens New Housing should prefer home ownership over landlord/tenant housing.
Devens New Housing should prefer modular building practices over stick building housing to
improve quality, cost and time to market.
Devens New Housing should discriminate in favor of first time home buyers.
Devens New Housing should favor smaller cottage style housing that would improve
affordability and limit impact on local schools (fewer people in smaller homes means fewer
students that might lead to school system impacts).
Devens New Housing should avoid rezoning Vicksburg Square. It is too dense for the area. The
state of the building as it relates to hazardous materials, sheer volume and size of the building,
and the cost of rehabilitating the structures would not meet the immediate need for housing
relief. Time to market will interfere with affordability and will have a negative impact on other
Devens residents due to the number of people expected in these large buildings and the
number of cars without easy access to highways.
Devens New Housing should consider rezoning the ITC area ONLY as it relates to the
apartment buildings across from 100 Sherman Road (The Community Center). The apartment
buildings are in far better shape than the buildings at Vicksburg Square, and thus have a
shorter time to market. The number of units would be considerably smaller in scope and have
a lesser impact to current residents.
Devens New Housing should consider traffic impacts of any new development to minimize
impacts to existing residents. Devens is a benefit to surrounding residents who come to
Devens to walk themselves and pets in a place with lots of sidewalks and open space. Keeping
that intact as much of possible will benefit Devens residents but also residents of surrounding
communities.
Appendix: 19
My comments are an overview of Devens’ immediate needs in housing, although thoughtful and
intelligent planning of details should take precedence over speed.
I believe the primary concern should be to build for young adults so they can live near their jobs in or
around Devens. They need affordable apartments which would include studio, one and two bedroom
apartments. Many of these residents will be able to fill the jobs needed by local businesses here. It will
help stop the flight of productive people who are moving out of Massachusetts in droves. These
apartments should be built in quantity also to accommodate seniors who are downsizing and veterans
who have unique housing needs.
As those young adults increase their skills and move into higher paying jobs, building affordable condos
and small one family houses could then become the dominant focus. As time goes on and job income
increases, many will start families with small children and will need larger apartments, condos and single
family houses to accommodate them.
Housing in Devens is essential to the growth of the businesses in and around Devens, and the success of
the businesses will ensure a continuation of the quality of our lives here.

Appendix: 20
I do not understand the rush to change the zoning of the Innovation and Technology Center
District to include residential uses when there remains land already zoned for residential use
that has not been developed and absent any specific proposal for the redevelopment of
Vicksburg Square. Is there a role for the Commonwealth to play in facilitating the completion of
the Emerson Green project on Grant Road, and in developing housing for Adams Circle, rather
than simply adding to the overall land zoned for residential purposes?
I would like to see the redevelopment and reuse of Vicksburg Square and the Bachelor Office
Quarters. Those buildings are anchor points for the ITC District and knowing what will happen
with those structures is important to any integrated planning of the ITC District. My concern is
that the rest of the ITC District gets built out while those buildings continue to sit empty and to
deteriorate.

Without considering a total number of potential

Overview
Any discussion regarding trying to add to and achieve more affordable
housing at Devens (or for that matter anywhere in the Commonwealth)
centers around what type of home to encourage developers to build. The
general consensus is the “Missing Middle”. Small Cottage with walkable
Courtyards. Starter homes clustered on smaller lots with deed restrictions
on allowable expansion. Multi Family buildings. Potentially these become
“Affordable” by Smart Net Zero building techniques. Very adaptable to
Modular or Panelized production. Hence reduce the cost to construct that
then reduces the purchase price so that not all affordable units have to be
subsidized in a 40 B type use. Perhaps held to size by zoning to perpetuate
affordability.
Many of the lots reviewed in this proposal are currently owned by Mass
Development whether they are zoned residential or other zoning. A few
are in control of the Estates of Harvard Hills HOA.
In considering how much of a parcel to impact a basic standard of 50%
Preserved and 50% Impacted was used with adjustment to preserve more
if the sites natural features or historic preservation dictated. Or less
preserved if more has been impacted or abutting dense residential
neighborhoods. This to maintain the existing rural land use and feel of the
Devens campus.
The choices of housing being considered as the Missing Middle
also reflect a smaller lot foot print with more shared greenways
of forested or natural features, while acknowledging the need for all
impervious surfaces, roads and driveways in these calculations.

Vicksburg Square
• 19.74 Acres Existing
• 256 Apartments in Rehabbed Old Command Buildings
Currently Zoned Innovation and technology, this area is the focus of the Innovation in
Development and Sustainable Housing subcommittee work as to how to maximizes housing.
These lots abut the existing original officers’ quarters at the Estates at Harvard Hills, have many
important monuments and historical areas of note to be preserved and all border the Rogers
Field area. Widely used for sports by many towns in the commonwealth. As this area already
has many single family homes the suggestion is to build Cottage Courtyard, smaller starter
homes on Looped roads, new Multifamily and rehab existing buildings into Apartments or
Condos .
Further given the existing and new neighborhoods proposed with wide public use and
support of Rodgers field, having an abutting walkable retail Mall area of shops,
restaurants, bistro’s etc., could prove a valuable addition to the local land use for housing
and recreational as well as regional sports events .
It is noted added parking will be required if rezoned residential to facilitate the wide use
of Rodgers Field suggesting the value of a parking deck at 205 Jackson Road with
amenities like large public bath rooms to support the larger use of those fields.

Special Challenges the Old Batchelor’s Quarters
and former Sylvia’s Haven Apartment units 85 Proposed
Per the Batchelor’s Adaptive Reuse Study 2010 these buildings present a reasonable conversion
to a similar breakdown as the Vicksburg square apartments or condos noted but an existing
building structure more amenable to revamping the interiors to the new usage and specifications
for passive house required.
Note no need for added parking
The 101 Sherman Building (Red) is also part of this assessment

Special Challenges Vicksburg Square Buildings
Apartment units: 256 Proposed
Preservation and repurposing of the Vicksburg Square Buildings present many unique and
expensive challenges. The first of which is the Guting of the buildings back to the concrete
structures of foundations, walls, floors and the framed roofs. As outlined in the Vicksburg
Square Site Assessment and Hazard Identification 2017 report. It is nothing less than a hazmat
level full gut just to begin.
A full Structural site/building assessment is needed to determine the ability to convert
extensively these existing buildings into useable small, medium and larger apartments with
some of the larger apartments hopefully set aside for Affordable but would need to be
subsidized. Given the historical designation of these buildings preservation of the exteriors is
essential to any plan. This would include upgrade to thermally efficient doors and windows
maintaining the historical look. Gable ends being restored but likely roof areas could facilitate
Solar panels or a solar typical roof sheathing available now by many companies. Achieving the
goal of a passive house level of Net zero does represent challenges, given the potential of
thermal transfer of the existing masonry walls and concrete floor design into the interior of any
new configuration affecting room HVAC conditioning, even with new spray foam interior walls
The Center courtyard may also need a 2nd deck to facilitate the resident parking along with
guest parking. Suggested to make a garden surround at the street and 2nd deck level.

“Missing middle” homes proposed to break up the look of the single family home
neighborhood while keeping it walkable. Consider maximizing solar orientation of roofs where
reasonable.

Any approval for changes on lots and properties under the rules of the HOA for the Estates at
Harvard Hills has to have a 100% approval of the members.
For the Auman Street properties the suggestion would be Starter homes to match the density of
the existing homes on those lots but lean toward that affordable goal.
For the Walnut Street properties, the suggestions would be the Courtyard cluster type. They
could represent retirement homes as families downsized and those in the old officers’ quartets
could now retire in the neighborhood they have lived in for years. Or could be used as an ADU
or in-law apartments for the abutting homes.
4 Salerno Circle presents the challenge of being a view shed that had been impacted. So, the
suggestion is no new roads and single family homes on already disturbed lots as much as
possible. All to preserve this view shed. Total Acreage available 87 but only 22 acres impacted
with new housing on existing roads. Solar orient layouts and Design style to maximize potential

• You then have available square feet to be preserved or impacted as a usable measure for
the calculation of the total of individual units any site potentially can develop.
• In the Unit type columns, you can add how many of each type, which will then calculate
the impact of those decisions in total square feet for that type.
o This is an estimation of the noted housing types which then uses the lot size to
calculate the total SF impacted per lot while considering the Google Satellite map
of Devens as to how that could work out gracefully in the lot provided for the
estimated unit numbers abutting properties, preserved areas and/or usage.
o (A professional experienced judgment call)
• The Total Proposed building lot footprints SF column is then subtracted from the
Acreage Developable SF that will be impacted, that will then set up the calculation of
how much is left for roads/impervious surfaces.

Patrick Hughes Qualifications
My experience comes from a 47-year career in the custom residential building industry.
Overseeing construction of Architecturally designed homes in many towns and communities in
the Commonwealth. I also note 20 plus years of involvement with the town of Ayer and other
regional advocacy. Including 6 Years on the board of the Nashua River Watershed Association.
8 years ACEC Implementation then Stewardship committees. 3 Town of Ayer master plans.
Restoration of Ayer town hall and down town Historical District restoration advocacies. Ayer
Greenway Committee to touch on a few of them.
My interest in Devens goes back to the work of PACE (People of Ayer Concerned about the
Environment) in the late 90’s when the enormous cleanup effort of the former base was needed
and its potentially negative impact on Ayer. An important issue for the town to be involved with.
As I was advocating to protect Ayer’s Forested legacy from a Planning Board, more interested
in the profits of big developers than protecting that legacy, I used my experience as a builder to
learn subdivision design and planning so as to try and encourage a smaller foot print than just
chewing up land to build subdivisions. That along with my land preservation advocacy, I was
invited to join the Devens Open Space and Recreation Committee back in the early 2000’s
which I served on for 6 years.
20 years ago, there was a push to go beyond the original reuse plan and craft how Devens could
be developed. This was known as the Disposition of Devens Stakeholder MOU referred to as
the 2B proposal that notes other possibilities or outcomes were considered. But the consensus
was to create a template to form a Town of Devens. At that time, I was recruited to be on the
Land use and Zoning committee, which I served on for close to 3 years. In 2006 I was a
member of a consortium known as the Sustainable Design Working group. Our advocacy was
how to achieve Net zero building and low impact land usage in roads and neighborhoods
layouts at the subdivision level while remaining profitable. With my connections to Mass
Development, I was able to present the Groups findings to them. A result was influencing the
RFP that created the Transformation Net Zero Subdivision and evolved to the recently
completed Emerson Green project that is getting so much attention for adhering to those
principles. As a side note a few years later I worked for Transformations and 6 years back was
in discussions with the Emerson Green Developer to be the Field Project manager when another
opportunity arose that I recently retired from. Working as a full-time residential construction
estimator. I further note that in my retirement I am setting up a Net Zero Building Consulting
advocacy. Not to teach Architects or Planners what that is. But for builders as how to do it
simply and effectively so it does not become an expensive option.

My comments for the discussion on housing and community development at Devens:
- I would like to see truly affordable and high-quality housing developed: duplexes,
triplexes, 1-floor cottage-style houses, clustered small-ish houses with common
land/nature around. I am an active senior and would like to downsize and stay in the
area.
- I’d like to see the natural beauty be preserved and nurtured:
o areas of wild, natural land (not manicured and landscaped) with walking trails
that connect throughout Devens
o quiet and safe streets to walk on
o quiet and dark-sky – as much as possible – be preserved and protected (restrict /
reduce light pollution)
o continue to add and nurture trees and natural beauty at Devens (it lifts spirits,
makes people feel prouder of where they live, increases property values, and
positively contributes the benefits of nature: oxygen into the air, soil
conservation and support of other plant and animal life
- I would also love to see a space for a community garden! : )
Thanks for providing a place to contribute my / our comments into the process. I am in favor of
some additional, thoughtful, and affordable housing added to Devens with an eye out for not
only economic development but developing community among residents.
Kindly,
~ Bonnie Petrovich

Appendix: 54
The Devens Housing Working Group (HWG) has been an efficient and effective mechanism to engage a variety of critical
stakeholders, resulting in the initial Draft Strategy and Plan for adding housing to the Devens Innovation and Technology Center
Zoning District. It has been one of the least demanding, focused, and most effective quick-turn committees to provide a tangible
path forward for meaningful increased housing on Devens.
The report reflects the inputs from many varied participants and offers a solid, workable plan to meet the objectives.
I fully support and encourage the adaptive resue of existing buildings for housing or other appropriate purposes and strongly
encourage the engineering evaluation of those building as soon as possible, and in advance of the Zoning Amendment if possible.
Due to the significant questions and persistent town concerns over many years, particularly about the Vicksburg Square quadrangle,
having a factual assessment may make a huge difference to educate residents in all of the Towns, to hopefully provide the necessary
level of support to pass a Super Town Meeting.
Any demands for a more comprehensive development proposal before merely voting to amend the Zoning should be quickly
dismissed.
The Legislature should be prepared to pass legislation if the Super Town Meeting process fails.

1. Introduction
The Devens Housing Working Group (Working Group) was created by the Legislature (Section
298 of Chapter 238 of the Acts of 2024) with the following charge:
The working group shall determine a strategy and plan to
provide for increased housing production within Devens,
including, but not limited to, the feasibility of allowing not
more than 400 multi-family residential units in the
Innovation and Technology Center zoning district
established by Article V(A)(13) of the zoning by-laws of the
Devens Regional Enterprise Zone.
The Working Group consists of the following members: Secretary of Economic Development –
Chair; Director, HLC Livable Communities Division; Director/Land Use Administrator, Devens
Enterprise Commission; Chair of the Devens Committee; President and CEO of Mass
Development; Select Board Member, Town of Ayer; Select Board Member, Town of Harvard; and
Select Board Member, Town of Shirley.
As presented in each meeting, the goal of the Working Group is: Provide a vision for increasing
housing production within Devens.
This final report was approved unanimously by the Working Group on May 14. The Working
Group considered a preliminary draft report at its meeting on April 1. An updated draft that was
expanded to incorporate feedback from Working Group members, the public, and surrounding
towns was presented to and discussed by the Working Group at its meeting on May 8.
Like the prior drafts, this updated and final report: provides some context about Devens and the
communities that surround it; explains the process by which the Working Group gathered
information and built consensus around its recommendations; sets forth a strategy and plan for
increased housing production in Devens; and proposes the framework for an amendment to the
Devens Zoning By-laws to achieve that objective.
This final report also includes a section addressing the process by which the Zoning By-laws
can be amended, as well as a draft of a zoning amendment that would achieve the goal of
promoting increased housing production at Devens. It also includes a section addressing the
process by which the Zoning By-laws may be amended.
This final report also includes several appendices with supporting information such as public
comments and details about the regional housing context, all of which were introduced in a prior
draft and presented to the Working Group members on May 8.

2. Regional Context and Background on Devens and the Surrounding Communities
Regional Housing Context
Devens is located in greater
north central Massachusetts in
the Montachusett Regional
Planning Commission (MRPC)
region, which has 22
municipalities, ranging from
mixed-use urban centers like
Fitchburg to small and rural
towns such as Ashby. The
region’s character and
community development has
been shaped by the historic
dominance of the
manufacturing industry and
the military. The region has the highest concentration of manufacturing jobs in the state but has
a critically low housing vacancy rate: only 1.1% of homes are for sale or rent, lower than the
vacancy rate for the state as a whole. This creates intense demand for the homes that are
available and pushes prices higher.
Within the Montachusett region, the
median sale price for a single-family home
or condo more than doubled from 2012 to
2023, rising from $158,000 to $375,000.
More than 30% of households in the region
are housing cost burdened, paying more
than 30% of their income in rent. Roughly
one in ten homeowners and one in five
renters in the region are paying more than
half their income on housing costs.
Communities in the Montachusett region,
including Devens, reported issuing building
permits for just 3,505 new homes between
2013 and 2023. Current EOHLC estimates
indicate the region may need 6,300 new
homes from 2025 to 2035. This
underscores the need and demand for
more housing in the entire region, including
Devens.
Additional regional context is included in
Appendix A of this report.

Devens Background
Devens was created by a special act of the Legislature (Chapter 498 of the Acts of 1993) to help
provide an orderly and expeditious conversion and development of approximately 4,400 acres
that were a portion of a former federal military base, Fort Devens, into a non-military-use
area. Devens comprises land area within the historic boundaries of the Towns of Ayer, Harvard,
and Shirley.
Devens Regional
Enterprise Zone
Page 4 of 11

Chapter 498 of the Acts of 1993 made the Massachusetts Government Land Bank (later merged
into MassDevelopment) exclusively responsible for acquisition, control, maintenance, and
redevelopment of Devens. To provide for orderly development, a long-term Reuse Plan and
Zoning By-laws were adopted by the Massachusetts Government Land Bank and the Towns of
Ayer, Harvard, and Shirley. The Reuse Plan and Zoning By-laws provided broad development
goals and planned uses of the property and were passed at town meetings in the three towns.
The legislation also established the Devens Enterprise Commission to function as the local
regulatory and permit-granting authority for all new development within Devens to ensure
development in a manner consistent with the Reuse Plan and Zoning By-laws.
Since the establishment of Devens, approximately 120 units of former military housing have
been repurposed and 136 new units of housing have been constructed within its boundaries.
Devens currently has 256 units of residential and senior housing and approximately 950
residents. MassDevelopment is obligated to provide the same educational benefits and
opportunities other Massachusetts residents enjoy, which MassDevelopment has typically done
by contracting with one of the nearby school districts. Since 2012, MassDevelopment has
contracted with the Harvard School District to educate students residing in Devens. In the 2023-
24 academic year, there were 86 full-time and 10 transitional students attending the Hildreth
Elementary and Bromfield (High) Schools and six out-of-district students.
Until recently, housing development in Devens was limited by the Reuse Plan to no more than
282 units. That housing cap was removed by the Legislature last year and the development of
new housing on parcels already zoned for residential uses is governed by the Zoning By-laws,
as approved by the three towns and MassDevelopment, and regulations promulgated by the
Devens Enterprise Commission.
3. The Working Group’s Process for Building Consensus
The Working Group has held five meetings to conduct its work and develop this final report.
Each meeting was held at a location in Devens or virtually and was open to the public. The
Working Group also established an online portal to accept public comments.
At the Working Group’s initial meeting on January 22, 2025, each member and legislator in
attendance was provided an opportunity to articulate what success would look like at the end of
the process. A strong consensus emerged that the Working Group should strive to propose
achievable recommendations and establish flexible zoning recommendations that would lead to
actual housing production within a reasonable timeframe.
At this initial meeting, Working Group members also were assigned to one of three subgroups:
• Devens Fundamentals: Asked to consider and report on the background of Devens and
existing zoning and regulatory framework.
• Community Considerations: Asked to consider and report on community needs and
opportunities.
• Innovation in Development and Sustainable Housing: Asked to consider and report on
the general framework for residential zoning in the ITC district.
The three subgroups met multiple times and shared their work at the second Working Group
meeting on February 25, 2025. At the end of the second meeting, Secretary Hao asked that a
“captain” of each subgroup meet subsequently to craft the first draft of a report and plan to
Page 5 of 11

provide for increased housing. The captains met five times to develop the first draft of this
report which was presented at the third Working Group meeting on April 1, 2025.
At its first two meetings, the Working Group heard that the following statements reflect the vision
for more housing at Devens.
• Adaptive reuse where feasible;
• Historic preservation and compatibility;
• Special attention to existing businesses and residences;
• New housing is compatible with surrounding land uses and densities;
• Connect new housing districts to open space – creating and maintaining the network of
recreational trails and green infrastructure;
• Importance of public education about zoning for additional housing types;
• Public education about the unique situation with MassDevelopment as the property
owner and DEC regulations is different from other zoning and development processes;
• Green and complete streets;
• Healthy buildings, social and active neighborhood design;
• Build from existing success of Innovative Residential District (IRD) regulations but
recognizing the different location and context;
• Careful not to let parking dictate design – design neighborhoods for people first
• Jurisdiction will not be accelerated – can accommodate additional housing if properly
planned;
• Ensure the existing levels of service that Devens residents, businesses and
organizations have come to expect are maintained.
The following community considerations were presented to the Working Group in the second
meeting.
Needs
• Increase senior housing by zoning for a range of housing types and densities. Smaller
units work well for seniors and downsizers. Do not need to restrict zoning for seniors.
• Maintain or increase green spaces, walking trails, and wildlife habitat;
• Consider how towns’ Councils on Aging work with Devens residents;
• Public education about existing public transportation – shuttles to MBTA Commuter Rail
and Montachusett Regional Transit Authority (MART) services that are available;
• Concern about increase in traffic;
• Desire to phase housing over time so that there is no “glut” of new housing units;
• Availability of healthcare system to support additional residents;
• Ability of regional education system to support additional residents;
• Importance of design so that community character reflects Devens historic designs;
• Rogers Field and existing recreational demands considered in design and location of
new residential areas;
• Playground within the ITC.
Opportunities
• Existing infrastructure in place to serve new residential development (roads, sewer,
water);
• Municipal services provided by MassDevelopment;
Page 6 of 11

• More customers for local businesses;
• New connections and trails to adjacent municipalities;
• Increase in affordable housing;
• Additional users of new amenities in Devens;
• Economic growth, increased revenue and job opportunities for the region.
The Working Group also solicited and reviewed written public comments as part of its
information gathering process. For the most part, the public comments were supportive of
additional housing at Devens. Most public commenters expressed a preference for the kinds of
housing they would prefer to be built at Devens, or the kinds of amenities that they would wish
for when new housing is developed. The Select Boards of Ayer, Harvard and Shirley also
submitted identical letters identifying the “two matters of greatest concern” as being “the
methods used to enact any changes to town zoning bylaws and the omission of binding
prescriptive development criteria, in particular for Vicksburg Square.” All public comments are in
Appendix B.
4. Strategies for Increased Housing at Devens
As directed by Legislature, the Working Group focused most of its attention on strategies to
promote housing production within the Innovation and Technology Center (ITC) zoning district.
The ITC comprises approximately 90 acres in total, including the historic buildings at Vicksburg
Square.
The Zoning By-laws currently allow commercial and other uses in the ITC, but no housing.
Preliminary findings support the need for and development of a range of housing types within
the ITC District to re-create the classic village/neo-traditional neighborhood design concept that
was originally laid out by the military with housing and a mix of uses surrounding Rogers Field.
Page 7 of 11

Additional housing in the ITC is also consistent with the Core patterns in the Reuse Plan (see
page 28). A diversity of housing types that includes primarily “missing-middle housing” (cottage
style/small footprint single family, duplex, townhomes, and apartments) in size and scale that is
in context with the surrounding development and the historic nature of this district.
The Working Group considered the following strategies and principles for a zoning amendment
that would permit housing within the ITC District:
1. Amend the existing zoning to permit a range of housing types within certain areas of the
district.
• Reuse of Vicksburg Square buildings – feasibility to be informed by further study;
• Allow housing over remaining 40+ developable acres (with a range of densities);
• The fine-tuning of densities will need to rely on design and compatibility;
• Densities – mixed – but generally higher near Rogers and reduce as we move away
from Rogers, (Devens Utilities can likely accommodate higher densities);
• Combination of market-rate and deed restricted affordable units – while there is a desire
to maintain Devens 25% affordable requirement the financial feasibility of such a
requirement needs to be further evaluated to ensure this aspirational target does not
make it financially unfeasible to actually build new housing.
2. Frame the ITC District area as a village center to capitalize on the classic neo-traditional
neighborhood design, recognizing existing opportunities and constraints within the District.
• Require innovative, low-carbon neighborhood and building designs in exchange for
higher densities that respect location and context (continuing to lead by example);
• Missing middle housing types – smaller footprint, mix of housing types, universal
accessibility, age-in place (life-cycle housing);
• Consider existing development and vacant parcel development opportunities and
constraints when considering density and building typologies;
• Mix of rental and for-sale units (flexibility to meet market demand);
• Mixed-use zoning (allowing for a mix of complementary commercial and residential
uses).
Following the adopting of a zoning amendment, the Devens Enterprise Commission will have
authority to promulgate more detailed regulations to minimize or mitigate any adverse impacts
of proposed housing developments, and to facilitate innovative residential development in the
ITC District consistent with these strategies and principles.
5. Process for Amending the Zoning By-laws
A zoning amendment consistent with the principles outlined above could be enacted either by a
super town meeting held in Ayer, Harvard, and Shirley, with the approval of MassDevelopment,
or by a special act of the Legislature. The Working Group has received a number of comments
about the process by which the Zoning By-laws can or should be amended, with the Select
Boards of Ayer, Harvard, and Shirley all expressing the view that the Zoning By-laws should
only be changed by super town meeting votes. Most of the public comment offered at the
Working Group’s meeting on May 8 was focused on the two methods of changing the Zoning
By-laws, and which process was preferable. Residents of Devens also expressed that they are
most directly affected by development in Devens and should have more say in whether and how
the Zoning By-laws are amended.
Page 8 of 11

The Working Group does not believe that its charge from the Legislature—to determine a
strategy and plan to provide for increased housing production within Devens—includes making
a recommendation on the process by which the Zoning By-laws are amended. Accordingly, the
Working Group is not making any recommendation as to how the Zoning By-laws should be
amended, only that they should be amended.
If a zoning amendment is proposed to be enacted at super town meeting, MassDevelopment
and the Towns would follow the process set forth in Section 10 of Chapter 498 of the Acts of
1993:
• MassDevelopment and the Towns hold two or more public hearings, as they
determine appropriate, in the Devens region to receive public comment.
• Within 30 days of the last public hearing held by MassDevelopment and the Towns,
submit the proposed revision(s) to the Select Board of each of the Towns.
• Within 90 days of receipt of the proposed revision(s), the Select Board of each of the
Towns shall convene a town meeting to be held at the same date and time in each of
the Towns for the purpose of adopting or rejecting, by majority vote of each town
meeting, the revision(s). Each Town shall vote to adopt or disapprove the revisions
as submitted. No amendments to the revisions shall be made by the Towns.
• Each Town shall, within 30 days of an adoption or rejection of the revision(s) at a
town meeting, provide MassDevelopment and the Devens Enterprise Commission
with a written notification stating whether town meeting adopted or rejected the
revision(s).
To promote local understanding of the benefits of new housing production at Devens, and to
ensure that MassDevelopment, the DEC and the Towns take appropriate action to prepare for
new housing development, the Working Group recommends that the MassDevelopment and the
Towns engage a planning consultant to undertake the following studies prior to any super town
meeting:
1. School needs assessment – for the region to include analysis of recent zoning
amendments in each community. The study should include a review of existing
enrollment levels in the region and capacity of each district at primary and secondary
levels. The study will use professional enrollment study models to predict enrollment
and determine if land should be set aside for a school within Devens.
2. Update assessments of existing buildings to determine adaptive reuse feasibility.
3. Traffic and parking study, including transit and Transportation Demand Management
initiatives.
4. Engage the community. Consider approaches such as design charrettes to identify
opportunities and constraints (e.g., utilities, topography). Identify effects of additional
residential units within the ITC District and create a plan to address through design
and permitting.
The Working Group has been informed that state funding is available for these kinds of planning
studies, through a grant from the Executive Office of Housing and Livable Communities to the
Town of Ayer acting as fiscal agent for the other towns.
6. Framework and Guiding Principles for a Zoning Amendment
Page 9 of 11

At its April 1 meeting, the Working Group developed a general consensus that its report and
recommendations would be most impactful if they include the text of a zoning amendment that
can be brought for approval at super town meeting, following the process noted above. The
initial draft report noted that such a zoning amendment would need to, at minimum:
• Add Residential Uses (Single or Two Family Dwelling, Multi Family Dwelling, Senior
Housing) as Permitted Uses in the Innovation Technology Center District in the Table
of Permitted Uses under Exhibit D of the Devens Zoning By-laws. (Note: small-scale
retail is already permitted as an accessory use so mixed use would be feasible.)
• Add new Multi-Family/Apartment category in Article VI.A1.k. General Land Use
Categories: Residential, of the Devens By-Laws to allow for multi-family apartment
buildings with more than 3-8 units.
• Set forth the applicable density limitations and height and other dimensional
limitations or requirements.
For clarity, the zoning amendment might also modify Article IX. E.1. of the Devens Zoning By-
laws to strike the reference to the 282-unit housing cap, making the by-law consistent with the
special act that eliminated the housing cap.
Consistent with the Working Group’s consensus to achieve an outcome that is practical and
feasible, the initial draft report recommended that a zoning amendment not be overly
prescriptive or detailed. For example, the zoning amendment should permit but not require
specific housing types. Affordability requirements should likewise be reasonable, i.e., not make
actual development financially unfeasible. Preliminary zoning amendments are included as
Appendix C.
This potential zoning amendment is consistent with the current By-laws and regulatory
framework governing development in Devens. Specifically, the amendment would allow
residential uses in the ITC District and allow the DEC to develop regulations through its
statutory processes to permit appropriate developments. Appendix D provides an overview of
the DEC’s process to promulgate new regulations, which is a public process that enables
interested individuals, communities, and organizations the opportunity to continue to be involved
and provide input throughout this process, before any housing is permitted or developed in the
ITC District.
Additional Considerations:
Planning for any additional housing within the ITC District must consider the existing
undeveloped residentially zoned lands within Devens as many of these areas abut or are near
the ITC District (context-sensitive planning and design). See the map of Devens on the following
page. The existing Innovative Residential Development (IRD) regulations at 974 CMR 5.02 and
Green and Complete Streets regulations at 974 CMR 2.07 are consistent with many of the
principles envisioned in this report and would complement the proposed residential
development patterns within the ITC District. However, it will be important to consider the
surrounding context existing undeveloped residentially zoned lands within Devens as part of the
drafting of any regulations that would facilitate residential development in the ITC District.

APPENDIX A:
Regional Context
Located in greater north central Massachusetts the Montachusett region has 22 municipalities,
ranging from mixed-use urban centers like Fitchburg to small and rural towns such as
Ashby.[1]The region also includes the Devens Regional Enterprise Zone (Devens), a 4,400 acre
former military base encompassing portions of the towns of Ayer, Harvard, and Shirley.
Key Considerations:
The Montachusett Region has a
critically low vacancy rate: only 1.1%
of homes are for sale or rent, lower than
the state’s vacancy rate. This creates
intense demand for the homes that are
available and pushes prices higher.
The median sale price for a single-family
home or condo more than doubled from
2012–2023, rising from $158,000 to
$375,000.
More than 30% of households in the
region are housing cost burdened,
paying more than 30% of their income in
rent. Roughly one in ten homeowners
and one in five renters in the region are
paying more than half of their income on
housing costs.
Montachusett region municipalities
reported issuing building permits for just
3,505 new homes from 2013–2023.
Current EOHLC estimates indicate the
region may need 6,300 new homes
from 2025 to 2035.
Appendix: 1

The region’s character and community development has been shaped by the historic
dominance of the manufacturing industry and the military. The region has the highest
concentration of manufacturing jobs in the state. The decline of the manufacturing sector has
opened new economic opportunities, such as expanding the region’s tourism sector; however,
the industrial character has left a lasting impact on the region’s community and housing
development. For instance, the region has a number of Environmental Justice Populations and
is faced with environmental challenges; 19 communities have brownfield sites[2] and Devens is
a Superfund site on the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) National Priorities List
(NPL). The amount of cleanup necessary varies by site, but the presence of hazardous
substances or pollutants present additional challenges to housing development or adaptive
reuse. Through MRPC’s Brownfields Program, the regional planning agency has made progress
on brownfield remediation by leveraging EPA funds. Redevelopment projects vary but include
building affordable single-family housing units in Fitchburg and Gardner.[3] The coordinated
clean-up effort by the EPA, the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection, the
U.S. Army, and MassDevelopment has facilitated the redevelopment of this former military base
into a thriving mixed-use community with nearly 100 employers and more than 6,000
employees, creating substantial economic growth in the region but further contributing to the
unique housing challenges.
The dominance and decline of industry are also reflected in the Gateway City designations of
two cities within the region: Fitchburg and Leominster. Both cities are economic hubs for the
region, with proximity to transportation hubs, but face unique housing challenges. Although both
cities are among the least expensive rental housing markets, the data also show a growing gap
in household income compared to the rest of the state.[4] As a result, housing costs in the
region are high for existing residents who live and work in the region. However, the region’s
relative affordability, connection to regional transit, and proximity to major economic centers
such as Boston and Worcester, has attracted an influx of new residents, creating tensions in the
region’s inventory supply.[5] One way in which MRPC prioritizes the preservation and production
of affordable housing is through the Montachusett Enterprise Center, Inc. (MEC), a nonprofit
Appendix: 2

subsidiary focused on affordable housing production and job creation in the region.[6] A reason
for the organization’s success is due to MEC’s receivership designation and authority to “take
temporary possession of abandoned/foreclosed properties which pose a threat to public health
and safety.”[7] A regional receivership program allows MEC to rehabilitate unused properties to
meet health and building code standards and resell more quickly than a property owner might
be able to do on their own.
With the military as a major employer in the eastern portion of the Montachusett Region, after
the base closure was announced in 1993, the redevelopment efforts in Devens focused more on
economic development. Up until November 2024, Devens was restricted to a limit of 282
housing units. While this artificial limitation was restrictive, Devens did require 25% to be
affordable to low- and moderate-income individuals and households.
The incidence of cost burden in the Montachusett region is slightly lower than statewide rates,
notably for severe cost burden. For example, only 21.1% (+/- 1.8%) of MRPC renters are
severely cost burdened, as compared to 25.2% (+/- 0.4%) of renters statewide.
EOHLC's Competing and Growing scenario forecasts that the number of households in the
region is projected to grow by 4,900 from 2025 - 2035 under the Competing and Growing
scenario used for the Statewide housing plan targets. With vacancy rates of just 1.0% for
homeownership units and 4.7% for rentals, EOHLC also estimates the region needs 1,400
additional homes for sale or rent to achieve a healthy vacancy rate. All told, EOHLC estimates
that MRPC region needs to add 6,400 homes to the year-round supply over ten years to meet
the forecasted need, an increase of 6.1% over the 2020 housing stock. The number of
projected households by age of householder (below) shows that the region is likely to see a
decline in households under the age of 40, an increase of those 40-54 (likely drawn to the
region for its lower housing costs), and an increase of 7,500 households headed by someone
70 or older.
Montachusett
Appendix: 3

Driven largely by the increase in the Oldest Adult households, all of the net growth is in
households earning less than $75,000 per year (growth of 5,600 households). The total number
of households earning $125,000 or more is projected to decline by nearly 1,000. This is due in
part to the large decline in households 55-69 (age groups that tend to have higher incomes than
older and younger groups) as the youngest Boomers age into retirement or leave the region.

APPENDIX B:
Proposed/Draft Zoning Amendments
To facilitate the development of housing in the Innovation and Technology Center Zoning
District, there would be four (4) text edits required, as shown below. Deletions are shown as
struck-through text and new text is underlined.
1. Article IX. E. Residential Density, Section 1.:
There is no limit on the total number of residential units to be allowed within the existing
residential zoning districts in Devens (as authorized under Section 272 of the 2024 Mass
Leads Act). shall not exceed two hundred and eighty-two (282) units, not including , with
the exception of the Senior Residential units within the Shirley Village Growth I Zoning
District, which shall not exceed one hundred twenty (120) units.
2. Article V.A. Development Goals, Section 13.b.:
The primary goal of this zoning district is to provide an urban center for the Devens
Regional Enterprise Zone in which residential, incubator ventures, and a broad range of
businesses are encouraged. Its combination of historic buildings and traditional open
space provides an environment unique to the former base and allows for an intensity
and of both a mix of residential, business, and public uses that is singular to Devens.
Development of design, siting, and retrofitting criteria should be flexible in order to
accommodate a wide range of users and their special needs, and any ancillary support
services. A major theme for this zone is to encourage and promote the development of a
range of housing types, as well as academic and educational support links for the entire
Devens Regional Enterprise Zone, as set forth in the Reuse Plan.
3. Article VI.A. General Land Use Categories, Section 3.k.:
The residential use type refers to the following activities: single and two family dwellings;
multi-family dwellings [containing three or more units]; nursing homes and congregate or
life care facilities with a permanent health care component; housing for the elderly,
including retirement communities and shared living developments; active and passive
recreation facilities; and professional offices and service businesses as accessory uses
or home occupations where allowed in particular districts.
4. Exhibit D: Table of Permitted Uses: (additions highlighted for ease of reference)

Appendix: 6

APPENDIX C:
Devens Enterprise Commission Regulation Revision/Adoption Process
Once any Zoning By-Law amendments have been adopted, the Devens Enterprise Commission
(DEC) can craft and promulgate regulations to guide the development of housing within the ITC
District that is consistent with the findings of the Devens Housing Working Group Report and
subsequent supporting studies. Such a process would include:
Drafting of Innovative Housing Regulations specific to the ITC District to accommodate the
following:
• Missing Middle housing types (range of housing types and densities to meet market
demand and provide a wider range of price points for smaller homes and smaller lots).
• Maintaining an appropriate affordability requirement (both low- and moderate-income
levels)
• Green and Complete Streets (safe streets designed for all users and low-impact
development techniques that incorporate more natural elements for both environmental
and social benefits)
• Context sensitive design (compatibility with surrounding land uses and the Devens
Historic District)
• Interconnected network of parks and open spaces.
• Adaptive reuse potential (condition of existing buildings and realistic potential for reuse)
• Phased approach to any housing development in the ITC.
• Any additional factors that may be raised in the recommended supporting studies to
address traffic, schooling, utilities, etc.
The Devens Rules and Regulations are Code of Massachusetts Regulations (CMRs). To modify
or change these regulations, the DEC would take the following steps:
1. Prepare a draft of the proposed regulation amendments in a format acceptable to the
Code of Massachusetts Register;
2. Send notice to the Local Government Advisory Committee (LGAC) 14 days before giving
notice of a public hearing (indicating any potential impact of proposed regulation
changes on local governments);
3. Schedule and advertise a public hearing;
4. Circulate copies of the proposed amendments to the Towns of Ayer, Harvard, and
Shirley, and the Register (and make available to the general public);
5. Include a 30-day comment period prior to the hearing date;
6. File a small business impact statement with the Register (noting how the regulations
will/will not impact small business in MA);
7. Hold a public hearing in Devens, allow for public input, and continue or close the
hearing;
8. File final draft amendments with the Register, including any changes made during the
hearing or public comment process.
9. Register publishes final regulations and they become effective (CMRs are published
every two weeks).
10.DEC updates Rules and Regulations locally and enforces them.

Dear Secretary Hao:
The Harvard Select Board voted Unanimously at its meeting of April 15, 2025 that the following be included
as public Comment to the Plan/Report of the Devens Housing Production Working Group that you chair.
The two matters of greatest concern to us are the method used to enact any changes to town zoning

A Vision of Housing Development at Devens. Bill Duston, Chance Street
I believe that the Devens residential community should remain intact and not be separated into two
towns. Currently Devens residents are separated politically by the old boundary lines of Ayer and
Harvard, but are physically located in a small compact area and share all the qualities of a small town
community of around 600 people. Whatever happens to the jurisdiction of Devens, I feel that the
residential community should remain together and be either part of Ayer, Shirley, Harvard or Devens as a
single entity. With that in mind, I would like to describe the future residential development of Devens as I
see it.
As residents, we experience Devens as a wonderful, vibrant, and very livable community with open
space, neighborhoods, excellent infrastructure and services that are close by. The existing housing and
residentially zoned area in Devens is no more than 1-1.5 square miles and is bounded by Adams Circle,
the Parker School, the end of Grant Road, and Bradley Circle. Our residential area is conveniently
adjacent to the commercial area of Devens Commons and near to all the other recreational offerings of
Devens, including Mirror Lake, Red Tail Golf, playing fields, disc golf and walking paths. The Innovation
and Technology Center District (ITC) including Vicksburg Square is in the center of our residential area.
Because the ITC is the center of the residential community of Devens, it should be the cornerstone of the
community and be the link that brings all of our neighborhoods together. Any new development in
Vicksburg Square should draw our community together both physically and socially.
How should the ITC be rezoned and developed? Here are some of the criteria that I feel are important
and essential to this development . Many of these were mentioned at the first Working Group Meeting.
1. Reuse existing buildings or tear them down and build on the same site. (i.e. BOQ)
2. Develop brown areas before green, if possible.
3. The density of the residential zone should incorporate cluster zoning with maximum open space and
walkability
4. Vicksburg Square should contain no more than 150-200 units of owned and rental housing in 1-2 of
the existing buildings with the remaining buildings torn down. Four large buildings with 400 units of
housing in Vicksburg Square is too massive for the residential area and for the region.
5. Live/Work/Play should be the guideline for the ITC residential area which should include recreation
and mixed use zoning.
6. Development should use the DEC zoning guidelines and include 25% affordable with an emphasis on
work force housing and affordability. The template used by NOW Communities at Emerson Green
should be the starting point and include a combination of single, multiple and rental units.
Construction should emphasize sustainability and a small carbon footprint.
7. The ITC should incorporate mixed use zoning to allow for ancillary commercial space that is
compatible with the current Devens Commons businesses and existing ITC businesses.
8. Pedestrian traffic should be encouraged and auto traffic should be restricted from certain areas such
as Buena Vista.
9. Zoning for future municipal use should be located outside of the residential zone.
10. Rogers Field should be used for recreation and open space, but large scale recreation events should
not be allowed due to the proximity to residential development.
11. New areas within the ITC should be rezoned for open space to include buffer zones between
Vicksburg Square and the surrounding residential neighborhoods. Jackson Road and Elm Street
provide a buffer for the Auman/Bates and lower Elm/Walnut neighborhoods, however new green
space should be considered. A green buffer zone should be developed between the ITC and the
Emerson Green/upper Walnut and Elm neighborhoods.
12. If possible, historical buildings should be reused with the exception of the four Vicksburg Square
buildings which could be reduced to 1-2 as described above in #4.
13. Utilities should be placed underground.
14.Construction should be done to the highest quality and aesthetics.

Devens, MA 01434
Devens New Housing should favor affordability (more than 25%). It is an economic
development issue for MA. Home ownership across the US is declining. Wealth gap is growing.
Devens New Housing should prefer home ownership over landlord/tenant housing.
Devens New Housing should prefer modular building practices over stick building housing to
improve quality, cost and time to market.
Devens New Housing should discriminate in favor of first time home buyers.
Devens New Housing should favor smaller cottage style housing that would improve
affordability and limit impact on local schools (fewer people in smaller homes means fewer
students that might lead to school system impacts).
Devens New Housing should avoid rezoning Vicksburg Square. It is too dense for the area. The
state of the building as it relates to hazardous materials, sheer volume and size of the building,
and the cost of rehabilitating the structures would not meet the immediate need for housing
relief. Time to market will interfere with affordability and will have a negative impact on other
Devens residents due to the number of people expected in these large buildings and the
number of cars without easy access to highways.
Devens New Housing should consider rezoning the ITC area ONLY as it relates to the
apartment buildings across from 100 Sherman Road (The Community Center). The apartment
buildings are in far better shape than the buildings at Vicksburg Square, and thus have a
shorter time to market. The number of units would be considerably smaller in scope and have
a lesser impact to current residents.
Devens New Housing should consider traffic impacts of any new development to minimize
impacts to existing residents. Devens is a benefit to surrounding residents who come to
Devens to walk themselves and pets in a place with lots of sidewalks and open space. Keeping
that intact as much of possible will benefit Devens residents but also residents of surrounding
communities.
Appendix: 19

My comments are an overview of Devens’ immediate needs in housing, although thoughtful and
intelligent planning of details should take precedence over speed.
I believe the primary concern should be to build for young adults so they can live near their jobs in or
around Devens. They need affordable apartments which would include studio, one and two bedroom
apartments. Many of these residents will be able to fill the jobs needed by local businesses here. It will
help stop the flight of productive people who are moving out of Massachusetts in droves. These
apartments should be built in quantity also to accommodate seniors who are downsizing and veterans
who have unique housing needs.
As those young adults increase their skills and move into higher paying jobs, building affordable condos
and small one family houses could then become the dominant focus. As time goes on and job income
increases, many will start families with small children and will need larger apartments, condos and single
family houses to accommodate them.
Housing in Devens is essential to the growth of the businesses in and around Devens, and the success of
the businesses will ensure a continuation of the quality of our lives here.

I do not understand the rush to change the zoning of the Innovation and Technology Center
District to include residential uses when there remains land already zoned for residential use
that has not been developed and absent any specific proposal for the redevelopment of
Vicksburg Square. Is there a role for the Commonwealth to play in facilitating the completion of
the Emerson Green project on Grant Road, and in developing housing for Adams Circle, rather
than simply adding to the overall land zoned for residential purposes?
I would like to see the redevelopment and reuse of Vicksburg Square and the Bachelor Office
Quarters. Those buildings are anchor points for the ITC District and knowing what will happen
with those structures is important to any integrated planning of the ITC District. My concern is
that the rest of the ITC District gets built out while those buildings continue to sit empty and to
deteriorate.

Overview
Any discussion regarding trying to add to and achieve more affordable
housing at Devens (or for that matter anywhere in the Commonwealth)
centers around what type of home to encourage developers to build. The
general consensus is the “Missing Middle”. Small Cottage with walkable
Courtyards. Starter homes clustered on smaller lots with deed restrictions
on allowable expansion. Multi Family buildings. Potentially these become
“Affordable” by Smart Net Zero building techniques. Very adaptable to
Modular or Panelized production. Hence reduce the cost to construct that
then reduces the purchase price so that not all affordable units have to be
subsidized in a 40 B type use. Perhaps held to size by zoning to perpetuate
affordability.
Many of the lots reviewed in this proposal are currently owned by Mass
Development whether they are zoned residential or other zoning. A few
are in control of the Estates of Harvard Hills HOA.
In considering how much of a parcel to impact a basic standard of 50%
Preserved and 50% Impacted was used with adjustment to preserve more
if the sites natural features or historic preservation dictated. Or less
preserved if more has been impacted or abutting dense residential
neighborhoods. This to maintain the existing rural land use and feel of the
Devens campus.
The choices of housing being considered as the Missing Middle
also reflect a smaller lot foot print with more shared greenways
of forested or natural features, while acknowledging the need for all
impervious surfaces, roads and driveways in these calculations.

• 21 Unit Walkable single floor retail mall
• 85 Apartments in Rehabbed Old Officers Quarters and former Sylvia’s Haven
Vicksburg Square
• 19.74 Acres Existing
• 256 Apartments in Rehabbed Old Command Buildings
Currently Zoned Innovation and technology, this area is the focus of the Innovation in
Development and Sustainable Housing subcommittee work as to how to maximizes housing.
These lots abut the existing original officers’ quarters at the Estates at Harvard Hills, have many
important monuments and historical areas of note to be preserved and all border the Rogers
Field area. Widely used for sports by many towns in the commonwealth. As this area already
has many single family homes the suggestion is to build Cottage Courtyard, smaller starter
homes on Looped roads, new Multifamily and rehab existing buildings into Apartments or
Condos .
Further given the existing and new neighborhoods proposed with wide public use and
support of Rodgers field, having an abutting walkable retail Mall area of shops,
restaurants, bistro’s etc., could prove a valuable addition to the local land use for housing
and recreational as well as regional sports events .
It is noted added parking will be required if rezoned residential to facilitate the wide use
of Rodgers Field suggesting the value of a parking deck at 205 Jackson Road with
amenities like large public bath rooms to support the larger use of those fields.

Special Challenges the Old Batchelor’s Quarters
and former Sylvia’s Haven Apartment units 85 Proposed
Per the Batchelor’s Adaptive Reuse Study 2010 these buildings present a reasonable conversion
to a similar breakdown as the Vicksburg square apartments or condos noted but an existing
building structure more amenable to revamping the interiors to the new usage and specifications
for passive house required.
Note no need for added parking

Special Challenges Vicksburg Square Buildings
Apartment units: 256 Proposed
Preservation and repurposing of the Vicksburg Square Buildings present many unique and
expensive challenges. The first of which is the Guting of the buildings back to the concrete
structures of foundations, walls, floors and the framed roofs. As outlined in the Vicksburg
Square Site Assessment and Hazard Identification 2017 report. It is nothing less than a hazmat
level full gut just to begin.
A full Structural site/building assessment is needed to determine the ability to convert
extensively these existing buildings into useable small, medium and larger apartments with
some of the larger apartments hopefully set aside for Affordable but would need to be
subsidized. Given the historical designation of these buildings preservation of the exteriors is
essential to any plan. This would include upgrade to thermally efficient doors and windows
maintaining the historical look. Gable ends being restored but likely roof areas could facilitate
Solar panels or a solar typical roof sheathing available now by many companies. Achieving the
goal of a passive house level of Net zero does represent challenges, given the potential of
thermal transfer of the existing masonry walls and concrete floor design into the interior of any
new configuration affecting room HVAC conditioning, even with new spray foam interior walls
The Center courtyard may also need a 2nd deck to facilitate the resident parking along with
guest parking. Suggested to make a garden surround at the street and 2nd deck level.

Any approval for changes on lots and properties under the rules of the HOA for the Estates at
Harvard Hills has to have a 100% approval of the members.
For the Auman Street properties the suggestion would be Starter homes to match the density of
the existing homes on those lots but lean toward that affordable goal.
For the Walnut Street properties, the suggestions would be the Courtyard cluster type. They
could represent retirement homes as families downsized and those in the old officers’ quartets
could now retire in the neighborhood they have lived in for years. Or could be used as an ADU
or in-law apartments for the abutting homes.
4 Salerno Circle presents the challenge of being a view shed that had been impacted. So, the
suggestion is no new roads and single family homes on already disturbed lots as much as
possible. All to preserve this view shed. Total Acreage available 87 but only 22 acres impacted
with new housing on existing roads. Solar orient layouts and Design style to maximize potential

• You then have available square feet to be preserved or impacted as a usable measure for
the calculation of the total of individual units any site potentially can develop.
• In the Unit type columns, you can add how many of each type, which will then calculate
the impact of those decisions in total square feet for that type.
o This is an estimation of the noted housing types which then uses the lot size to
calculate the total SF impacted per lot while considering the Google Satellite map
of Devens as to how that could work out gracefully in the lot provided for the
estimated unit numbers abutting properties, preserved areas and/or usage.
o (A professional experienced judgment call)
• The Total Proposed building lot footprints SF column is then subtracted from the
Acreage Developable SF that will be impacted, that will then set up the calculation of
how much is left for roads/impervious surfaces.
o Road LF is calculated at 22’ wide
• It is helpful to have Google Earth Satellite view on an adjacent screen ( Viewed
above) in assessing lots along with local knowledge of the sites

Patrick Hughes Qualifications
My experience comes from a 47-year career in the custom residential building industry.
Overseeing construction of Architecturally designed homes in many towns and communities in
the Commonwealth. I also note 20 plus years of involvement with the town of Ayer and other
regional advocacy. Including 6 Years on the board of the Nashua River Watershed Association.
8 years ACEC Implementation then Stewardship committees. 3 Town of Ayer master plans.
Restoration of Ayer town hall and down town Historical District restoration advocacies. Ayer
Greenway Committee to touch on a few of them.
My interest in Devens goes back to the work of PACE (People of Ayer Concerned about the
Environment) in the late 90’s when the enormous cleanup effort of the former base was needed
and its potentially negative impact on Ayer. An important issue for the town to be involved with.
As I was advocating to protect Ayer’s Forested legacy from a Planning Board, more interested
in the profits of big developers than protecting that legacy, I used my experience as a builder to
learn subdivision design and planning so as to try and encourage a smaller foot print than just
chewing up land to build subdivisions. That along with my land preservation advocacy, I was
invited to join the Devens Open Space and Recreation Committee back in the early 2000’s
which I served on for 6 years.
20 years ago, there was a push to go beyond the original reuse plan and craft how Devens could
be developed. This was known as the Disposition of Devens Stakeholder MOU referred to as
the 2B proposal that notes other possibilities or outcomes were considered. But the consensus
was to create a template to form a Town of Devens. At that time, I was recruited to be on the
Land use and Zoning committee, which I served on for close to 3 years. In 2006 I was a
member of a consortium known as the Sustainable Design Working group. Our advocacy was
how to achieve Net zero building and low impact land usage in roads and neighborhoods
layouts at the subdivision level while remaining profitable. With my connections to Mass
Development, I was able to present the Groups findings to them. A result was influencing the
RFP that created the Transformation Net Zero Subdivision and evolved to the recently
completed Emerson Green project that is getting so much attention for adhering to those
principles. As a side note a few years later I worked for Transformations and 6 years back was
in discussions with the Emerson Green Developer to be the Field Project manager when another
opportunity arose that I recently retired from. Working as a full-time residential construction
estimator. I further note that in my retirement I am setting up a Net Zero Building Consulting
advocacy. Not to teach Architects or Planners what that is. But for builders as how to do it
simply and effectively so it does not become an expensive option.

5 March 2025
My comments for the discussion on housing and community development at Devens:
- I would like to see truly affordable and high-quality housing developed: duplexes,
triplexes, 1-floor cottage-style houses, clustered small-ish houses with common
land/nature around. I am an active senior and would like to downsize and stay in the
area.
- I’d like to see the natural beauty be preserved and nurtured:
o areas of wild, natural land (not manicured and landscaped) with walking trails
that connect throughout Devens
o quiet and safe streets to walk on
o quiet and dark-sky – as much as possible – be preserved and protected (restrict /
reduce light pollution)
o continue to add and nurture trees and natural beauty at Devens (it lifts spirits,
makes people feel prouder of where they live, increases property values, and
positively contributes the benefits of nature: oxygen into the air, soil
conservation and support of other plant and animal life
- I would also love to see a space for a community garden! : )
Thanks for providing a place to contribute my / our comments into the process. I am in favor of
some additional, thoughtful, and affordable housing added to Devens with an eye out for not
only economic development but developing community among residents.
Kindly,
~ Bonnie Petrovich

Appendix: 54

The Devens Housing Working Group (HWG) has been an efficient and effective mechanism to engage a variety of critical
stakeholders, resulting in the initial Draft Strategy and Plan for adding housing to the Devens Innovation and Technology Center
Zoning District. It has been one of the least demanding, focused, and most effective quick-turn committees to provide a tangible
path forward for meaningful increased housing on Devens.
The report reflects the inputs from many varied participants and offers a solid, workable plan to meet the objectives.
I fully support and encourage the adaptive resue of existing buildings for housing or other appropriate purposes and strongly
encourage the engineering evaluation of those building as soon as possible, and in advance of the Zoning Amendment if possible.
Due to the significant questions and persistent town concerns over many years, particularly about the Vicksburg Square quadrangle,
having a factual assessment may make a huge difference to educate residents in all of the Towns, to hopefully provide the necessary
level of support to pass a Super Town Meeting.
Any demands for a more comprehensive development proposal before merely voting to amend the Zoning should be quickly
dismissed.
The Legislature should be prepared to pass legislation if the Super Town Meeting process fails.
