Exits (values as of 5/29/2025)
EOHLC provides various resources to support families exiting from EA shelter into long-term
stable housing. EA-eligible families have access to the HomeBASE program, which provides
financial assistance for up to three years to pay for rent and other rehousing costs, and related
stabilization casework. EOHLC has provided flexible funding through Strategic Rehousing
Initiative (SRI) funds to help EA shelter providers secure units and cover moving costs for
families exiting into long-term stable housing. A set of EA families also exited shelter into long-
term stable housing with housing subsidies, including mobile and project-based vouchers.

Exits (values as of 5/29/2025)
EOHLC provides various resources to support families exiting from EA shelter into long-term
stable housing. EA-eligible families have access to the HomeBASE program, which provides
financial assistance for up to three years to pay for rent and other rehousing costs, and related
stabilization casework. EOHLC has provided flexible funding through Strategic Rehousing
Initiative (SRI) funds to help EA shelter providers secure units and cover moving costs for
families exiting into long-term stable housing. A set of EA families also exited shelter into long-
term stable housing with housing subsidies, including mobile and project-based vouchers.
