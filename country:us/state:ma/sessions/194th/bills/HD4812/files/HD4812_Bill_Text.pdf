Remarks from FY2025 Chair
The past year has been incredibly transformative for the
Massachusetts Commission on the Status of Women (MCSW)
in so many ways. As Chairwoman, it is an honor to stand
alongside each of you as we reflect on a year of tremendous
growth, renewed purpose, and unshakable commitment.
Our Commission’s origin story is rooted in global solidarity.
When the United Nations held its Fourth World Conference on
Women in Beijing in 1995, it sparked a fire in delegates from
Massachusetts, including then-First Lady Susan Roosevelt
Weld. They returned home with a vision — that women and
girls in the Commonwealth deserved a Commission of their
own to advance equality, protect rights, and amplify the voices
too often left out. Just three years later, the MCSW was established by statute with a mission to advance
women toward full equality in all areas of life, regardless of party, ideology, or zip code.
With the help of many, such as the women’s caucus of state legislatures and others, a unique and model
Commission was born. What makes the MCSW so unique — and so vital — is that we are a nonpartisan
special state agency. With 19 volunteer Commissioners appointed jointly by the Executive and Legislative
branches, all reflecting a shared belief across the aisle that gender equity is not a partisan issue — it’s a
human one. We are not here to play politics. We are here to speak truth, lift voices, and shape systems
that work for all women and girls in the Commonwealth. Since its conception, MCSW commissioners
have used their passion and talents to get many things accomplished, such as the creation of 11
Regional Commissions. The Commissioners, the passionate staff, and interns have dedicated
themselves to promoting and protecting equality for women and girls in all areas of their lives.
I am filled with gratitude to see the many ways in which the MCSW Team has grown. In a short time, the
Commission and the Executive Director has overhauled the Commission’s infrastructure, rising to meet
the challenge of rebuilding our regional bodies to full strength, welcomed new State and Regional
Commissioners, and expanded our reach into underserved communities across the Commonwealth. As
we look toward the future, we do so with a strong foundation, a broader bench of leadership, and a
renewed sense of direction. We are more ready for the opportunities ahead in the coming year!
I am so proud to be the Chairwoman of the MCSW at this pivotal moment in time. We hosted public
hearings all across the state, trained more than 250 young women as next-generation leaders at our 2025
Girls Empowerment Leadership (GELI) Summit, and awarded more than 125 incredible local women as
Commonwealth Heroines, our signature event that highlights local women who don’t always make the
news, but who always make the difference in our communities. These aren’t just programs — they are
platforms for power, visibility, and systemic change.
Furthermore, we couldn’t be prouder to continue our work to advance the lives of women and girls
through policy advocacy. Our policy work continues to be at the heart of everything we do. The

Commission is laser-focused on legislation that addresses real-world inequalities — maternal health,
economic security, safety, and access to opportunity — and we’re committed to advancing that work
through coalitions, testimony, and data-driven solutions.
We express our deepest gratitude to our appointing authorities: the Governor, the Speaker of the House,
the Senate President, and the Massachusetts Caucus of Women Legislators for continually collaborating
with us to move the needle on policy that can change all our lives for the better. We are thankful for their
partnership, support, expertise, incredible energy, and passionate commitment to this work. As the 194th
General Court of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts swings into high gear, we’re more committed than
ever to working collaboratively to advance our lives for the better.
While there is still much uncertainty, inequity, and discrimination in the world, I draw hope from my Sister
Commissioners, staff, partners, advocates, and our collective work as a community to improve the lives of
women and girls in the Commonwealth.
In solidarity and gratitude,

Our Mission
The MCSW is comprised of 19 volunteer state commissioners, 11 regional bodies, dedicated staff members, and
seasonal interns. MCSW state commissioners are appointed by one of four appointing authorities: the Governor, the
Senate President, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, and the Caucus of Women Legislators.

committees include:
• Legislative and Public Policy
• Program and Planning
• Finance Committee
• Executive Committee
For more than 25 years now, the Commission and our regional bodies have worked to advance the rights and
opportunities of all women and girls across Massachusetts, and advance an inclusive environment for everyone,
regardless of race, ethnicity, nationality, religion, color, sex, age, disability (seen and unseen), genetic information,
sexual orientation, gender identity, parental status, marital status, socioeconomic status or background.
Our Charges and Purpose

Financial Overview
During the fiscal year of 2025 (July 1, 2024 - June 30,
2025) MCSW received a Massachusetts State General
Appropriation budget of $958,785. Additionally, the State
Treasurer maintains a statutory trust fund of money
donated and raised by the MCSW to support external
community projects, established in 2004.
In the spring of 2024, the commission submitted its request
to amend its legislative language to expand the use of the
trust fund and change the annual reporting deadline from
June 2 to July 31. As of February 27th, 2025, the bill has
been referred to the Joint Committee on State
Administration and Regulatory Oversight.
MCSW operational expenses include salaried staff and contracted services, operational technology needs, language
accessibility, program costs, and support for advocacy and engagement through the Regional Grant Program for the
operation of the 11 regional commissions. The MCSW Regional Grant Program is provided to the regionals for the
costs associated with advocacy and community engagement to gather information on the issues impacting the
various regions of the Commonwealth.
Throughout the year, MCSW had a dedicated team of 5.5 full-time staff members, each with their own role in the
organization. The MCSW also had 8 paid part-time interns from various educational institutions across the
Commonwealth contributing to our mission.
As stewards of public funding, the MCSW takes its fiduciary responsibility seriously and is dedicated to using these
resources to empower women and girls across Massachusetts. The commission is committed to financial
transparency and using state funds to re-invest into the Commonwealth.
Our major financial commitments include:

Programs and Impact
In 2025, the Massachusetts Commission on the Status of Women (MCSW) expanded its statewide engagement
through a robust series of programs and events for both youth and adults. The Commission hosted three public
hearings across the Commonwealth, introduced a new legislative agenda informed by community voices, and
brought over 250 advocates to the State House for its Biennial Advocacy Day. More than 300 women and girls
participated in the Girl’s Empowerment Leadership Initiative (GELI) 2025 Summit held at the Woods Hole
Oceanographic Institution (WHOI), which focused on STEAM education and leadership. In June, MCSW will
celebrate over 125 exceptional women at its annual Commonwealth Heroines event.
These events, attended by hundreds of individuals both in person and virtually, serve as critical opportunities for the
Commission to connect directly with women and girls across Massachusetts. Through testimony, dialogue,
collaboration, data collection, and more, MCSW identifies the most pressing issues, builds coalitions for change, and
strengthens local networks of women leaders working to improve their communities.
In alignment with its commitment to equity and access, MCSW is translating many of its publicly available materials
into the ten most commonly spoken languages in Massachusetts, offering American Sign Language (ASL)
interpretation, and providing additional language and physical accommodations as needed to ensure full participation
for all women and girls in our programming.

Public Hearings
Public Hearings are key to the MCSW’s mandate to study and report on the status of women and girls in the
Commonwealth. Throughout FY25, the MCSW committed to offering programming that would not only engage
constituents in-person, but also model hybrid options that would allow all interested residents to participate and share
their stories about the challenges they face. The MCSW is further committed not only to diversity in terms of
representation but also in terms of the towns, counties, and various locations we visit to conduct these public
hearings to solicit as much public input as possible. Throughout the year, the MCSW held two virtual hearings and
one hybrid hearing in Amherst. The virtual public hearings were issue-specific, centering the impact of Health Issues
on Women in Massachusetts and the voices of Women of Color in Massachusetts, and the hybrid-hearing held in
Amherst was open format, where we heard about a wide range of issues.
Hybrid Public Hearing: Hampshire-Franklin
On October 22, 2024, the MCSW hosted a hybrid public hearing at
the Great Hall in Old Chapel, University of Massachusetts Amherst.
This regional forum allowed community members from Hampshire
and Franklin counties—and surrounding areas—to share lived
experiences and policy concerns directly with MCSW commissioners,
staff, and state representatives.
A total of 13 individuals gave live testimony, with additional written
testimony submitted. The event was attended by 24 people in person,
39 virtually, and over 285 views across Facebook and YouTube.
Interpretation services were provided to enhance accessibility, and
outreach materials were shared in multiple languages.
Testimonies highlighted urgent and intersecting issues including
housing insecurity, foreclosure fraud, predatory lending, and the lack
of legal recognition of women’s property ownership. Attendees also
raised concerns about insufficient mental health care, the impact of
domestic violence on addiction and eating disorders, and challenges
related to trans women participating in women’s sports.
Local advocates, including members of the Worcester Anti-Foreclosure Team and Girls Scouts of Central and
Western Massachusetts, emphasized the need for legislative action to support women’s economic security and
emotional wellbeing. Key bills and study orders discussed included the Healthy Youth Act, COVID-19 impact
resolution, and foreclosure reform. Read the summary on our website.

Virtual Public Hearing: Impact of Health Issues on Women
On November 20, 2024, the MCSW held a virtual public hearing focused on the health and wellness of women across
Massachusetts. With 55 participants and 14 individuals providing testimony, the hearing spotlighted barriers to care,
disparities in maternal health, access to reproductive services, and the impact of systemic inequities on vulnerable
communities. Residents, advocates, healthcare professionals, and community leaders from across the
Commonwealth testified on issues including postpartum care, criminal record sealing for survivors of trafficking,
reproductive health access, and the dissolution of the Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) program on Cape

Cod. Key themes included the need for comprehensive postpartum mental health services, improved access to
abortion and emergency contraception, expanded support for BIPOC birthing individuals, and protection of patient
autonomy. Testimony also emphasized the importance of housing stability and economic opportunity as foundational
to women’s health.
Recommendations emerging from the hearing included automating criminal record sealing, restoring in-person SANE
services, eliminating barriers to durable medical equipment under Medicare, and investing in long-term, community-
based solutions to address health inequities. The hearing reinforced MCSW’s commitment to using public testimony
to inform its policy and advocacy agenda. Read the summary on our website.

Virtual Public Hearing: Women of Color COVID-19 Updated Survey Launch
On May 20, 2025, the MCSW hosted a virtual public hearing
dedicated to uplifting the voices of women of color across the
Commonwealth. Held on Zoom with 27 attendees and live
American Sign Language (ASL) interpretation, the event offered
a platform for four speakers to share personal stories and policy
recommendations directly with state and regional
commissioners. The hearing opened with welcoming remarks
from MCSW Chair Mary-dith Tuitt and concluded with the launch
of the Commission’s 2025 COVID-19 Follow-Up Survey, aimed
at capturing the long-term impact of the pandemic five years on.
The testimony presented highlighted the urgent and intersecting
challenges women of color continue to face. One speaker from
Athol raised serious concerns about maternity healthcare
access following the closure of a local birthing center, pointing to
instances of mothers giving birth outside of medical facilities due
to the lack of nearby options. She called on state leaders to
study the impact of such closures and to explore increased public transportation access as part of the solution.

Another speaker, MCSW Commissioner and Executive Director of The Theater Offensive Giselle Byrd, shared a
deeply personal account of her journey as a trans woman. She spoke passionately about the systemic neglect trans
women of color experience—from lack of familial and societal support to ongoing threats to their safety. “I'm now
really working to help make sure that our queer and trans artists across the country are taken care of in a time of
immense censorship—that our women, and especially our trans women of color, do not go unheard and unseen; that
their murders do not go unsolved; and that there is a liberated future for all of us,” she stated.
Additional testimony addressed the mental, emotional, and financial toll on women of color navigating multiple roles
as caregivers, workers, and entrepreneurs. One Boston-based speaker described the difficulty of balancing a full-time
job while managing her own business and family responsibilities. She called for policies that reflect the high cost of
living, including livable wages, paid family leave, and affordable childcare. A high school student from Lexington
closed the testimony portion by reflecting on the enduring struggles of immigrant families, noting that she faces many
of the same barriers her parents experienced decades ago.
This hearing reinforced the Commission’s mission to center lived experiences of women and girls in its advocacy.
The perspectives shared directly inform MCSW’s policy agenda and legislative priorities in the year ahead, ensuring
that the concerns of women of color are heard, documented, and addressed at the highest levels of state leadership.

Advocacy Day 2025
On March 24, 2025, the MCSW hosted its biennial Advocacy Day at the
Massachusetts State House, convening a powerful group of 242
participants, including 98 individuals and 144 youth advocates. This
biennial convening is a cornerstone of MCSW’s public engagement and
policy education efforts, offering constituents a direct opportunity to
engage with legislators and elevate issues impacting women, girls, and
gender-expansive people across the Commonwealth.
The day featured remarks from prominent state leaders, including
Attorney General Andrea Joy Campbell and State Auditor Diana
DiZoglio, whose moving words inspired and energized the crowd. Youth
participation brought added significance to the event, with many
students leading legislative conversations and demonstrating deep
knowledge of the bills they had researched. Throughout the day,
attendees met with legislative offices to advocate for MCSW priority bills
and other issues of community importance.
To assess the event's impact, MCSW circulated a 15-question Exit
Survey through follow-up emails and QR codes available at the event.
Nine participants submitted feedback, providing helpful insights into the
participant experience. A third of respondents were first-time advocates,
highlighting Advocacy Day’s success in welcoming new voices into civic
life. Two-thirds had attended an MCSW event before, and most
respondents heard about Advocacy Day through MCSW’s email
communications and outreach.
Advocacy Day also served as an effective platform for legislative
education. All respondents reported that the legislative offices they met
with were familiar with the bills being discussed, and none indicated that
follow-up was needed after their meetings. Bills discussed included top
MCSW priorities such as the I AM Bill (S.1549/H.2483), the Menopause
Awareness Bill (H.2499), Medicare for All (S.860/H.1405), and others
covering issues ranging from reproductive health and racial equity to
open meeting laws and midwifery access. While only a quarter of
respondents received firm commitments of support or co-sponsorship from legislative offices, many reported positive
engagements and an openness to further discussion.
Participants shared memorable moments, including legislative chamber tours, heartfelt speeches by public officials,
and the camaraderie of sharing the day with fellow advocates, many with daughters, classmates, and colleagues by
their side. The presence of "Advocacy Cookies" featuring QR codes to MCSW’s legislative priorities was also a
popular highlight. Recommendations for future events emphasized the need for expanded dietary accommodations,
more inclusive language and representation of trans women and gender-diverse communities, and earlier distribution
of legislative materials and meeting schedules. Some respondents suggested deeper training sessions on the bills
and more structured opportunities to speak during legislative visits, especially for adults accompanying youth
advocates. Advocacy Day 2025 affirmed MCSW’s ongoing commitment to ensuring every voice has a seat at the
table. The feedback received will guide future improvements, and the Commission remains dedicated to
strengthening partnerships with legislators and communities in the year ahead.

Girls Empowerment Leadership Initiative (GELI) Summit 2025
On April 24, 2025, the MCSW hosted its annual Girls Empowerment & Leadership Initiative (GELI) Summit at the
Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI), in partnership with the Marine Biological Laboratory (MBL) and with
the support of over 40 volunteers. The summit brought together over 250 young women (ages 14–22) from across
the Commonwealth for a powerful day of leadership development, civic engagement, and hands-on STEM/STEAM
exploration.
Promoted with the call to “Unleash Your Potential,” the summit empowered participants to explore their interests,
connect with mentors, and gain practical tools for advocacy and leadership. The program featured more than 15
interactive workshops, including sessions on ocean science, engineering, climate resilience, public speaking,
advocacy, and communication, led by women experts in STEM and policy.
A key highlight of the day was the GELI Girls Town Hall, facilitated by youth leaders Julie Karam and Ayesha Shafi
from MCSW’s Regional Commissions in MetroWest and Cape Cod & the Islands. Participants spoke candidly about
the challenges of being a girl today, touching on issues such as gender bias in trades and STEM, unequal treatment
and representation, double standards, and the urgent need for mental health support and safety. These reflections
underscored the importance of centering girls’ voices in policy conversations. Survey feedback revealed that
attendees found the workshops engaging, relevant, and empowering, especially appreciating the hands-on activities,
real-world applications, and direct access to women mentors and professionals. Participants reported increased
confidence, stronger communication skills, and greater awareness of career pathways in science and leadership.
The 2025 GELI Summit demonstrated the transformative impact of investing in young women’s leadership. By
creating space for their voices and visions, MCSW continues strengthening a statewide pipeline of empowered girls
ready to lead change in their communities and beyond. In addition to inspiring participants, the summit served as a
platform for collecting data to guide MCSW’s future advocacy efforts. Key themes identified for future programming:
• Mental health and emotional wellbeing
• Environmental justice and climate policy
• Intersectionality and identity-based equity
• Youth policy engagement and advocacy tools
• Career pathways for women in trades and STEM
• Peer connection and networking

Commonwealth Heroines
Commonwealth Heroines are women who don’t make the
news but make the difference. Every day, women perform
acts that make our homes, neighborhoods, cities, and towns
better places to live. Commonwealth Heroines use their time,
talent, spirit, and enthusiasm to enrich the lives of others in
their community. They are mentors, volunteers, and
innovators who strive to protect and represent the interests
of seniors, victims of violence, children, immigrants, and
other vulnerable populations. They are the glue that keeps a
community together.
Each year the Commission partners with state legislators to
identify women who make outstanding contributions to their
organizations and communities. Legislators are encouraged
to highlight women within their constituencies as a means of
celebrating their outstanding community endeavors. In 2025,
the MCSW will recognize 125 Commonwealth Heroines as a
part of the Class of 2025 at a celebration taking place on
June 26, 2025, at the Massachusetts Statehouse.
Congratulations to the Class of 2025!

The MCSW Speakers Bureau
The MCSW Speakers Bureau amplifies the voices and expertise of our Commissioners and staff to raise awareness
and spark dialogue on the issues affecting women and girls across Massachusetts. Through presentations, panels,
and community events, the Speakers Bureau educates the public about the work of the MCSW and encourages civic
engagement, advocacy, and collaboration. In FY25, the Speakers Bureau reached audiences statewide by partnering
with dozens of organizations to support gender equity through storytelling, education, and strategic convening.
Highlights included:

Arise for Social Justice, Cape Cod Foundation and the Boston Mayor’s Youth Council. These events reflect MCSW’s
commitment to elevating diverse voices, building intergenerational networks, and strengthening advocacy for all
women and girls in Massachusetts.
Program Impact
The impact of MCSW’s 2025 programming is both measurable and meaningful. By creating inclusive spaces for
testimony, dialogue, and leadership, the Commission continues to elevate the voices of women and girls who are
often underrepresented in policy conversations. Stories and recommendations shared at public hearings directly
informed this year’s legislative agenda, which prioritizes maternal health, childcare access, economic equity, and
protections for survivors of gender-based violence.
The Biennial Advocacy Day mobilized a new generation of community leaders, many of whom met with their
legislators for the first time. The event resulted in increased legislative co-sponsorship and deeper partnerships
between elected officials and constituents across the state. Similarly, the GELI Summit empowered girls from diverse
communities to explore careers in STEAM fields, expand their networks, and see themselves as future
changemakers. Through these programs, MCSW is not only gathering data and community feedback but also helping
to shape policy, shift narratives, and build sustained civic engagement. The Commission’s ongoing efforts to improve
language access and provide disability accommodations have also expanded participation among immigrant
communities, women of color, and women with disabilities—ensuring that equity remains at the heart of its mission.
Together, these outcomes reflect a growing, statewide movement to center the experiences of women and girls in
public discourse and policymaking.
MCSW Legislative Agenda and Recommendations
The Massachusetts Commission on the Status of Women (MCSW) is committed to advancing policies that ensure
women and girls are not only granted equal rights but also empowered as equal participants in economic opportunity,
healthcare access, civil rights, education, and business development. Through its Legislative and Public Policy
Committee, the Commission endorses, tracks, and advocates for legislation aligned with these goals. MCSW
commissioners and staff meet regularly with lawmakers and provide both written and verbal testimony at state
legislative hearings in support of priority legislation.

As part of its statutory authority, MCSW holds regular public meetings, fact-finding hearings, and forums to collect
firsthand accounts from women, girls, and their advocates. These engagements generate meaningful data and lived
experiences that shape our legislative agenda.
Since the release of our last Annual Report, MCSW is proud to report the passage of several key bills that reflect our
legislative priorities and the voices we have uplifted through research, public hearings, and coalition partnerships:
The Frances Perkins Workplace Equity Act // An Act relative to salary range transparency: Signed into law on
August 6, 2024, this legislation requires Massachusetts employers to disclose salary ranges on all job postings and
mandates employer reporting of EEOC data to address racial and gender pay gaps. Sponsored by Representatives
Josh Cutler and Brandy Fluker-Reid and Senator Pat Jehlen, this law marks a critical step toward pay transparency
and equity. MCSW is a proud member of the Wage Equity Now (WEN) Coalition, which led the advocacy efforts, and
continues to monitor the law’s implementation.
The Affordable Homes Act: This omnibus housing bill, also signed into law on August 6, 2024, responds directly to
issues raised during the MCSW’s January 2024 Public Hearing on Housing. The legislation addresses affordable
housing development, housing stability in seasonal communities, and increasing the availability of units. MCSW
continues to track initiatives within the bill to ensure they meet the housing needs of women and families across the
Commonwealth.
The Massachusetts Parentage Act //
An Act to ensure legal parentage
equality: Signed by Governor Healey
on August 8, 2024 (Chapter 166 of the
Acts of 2024), this law modernizes
Massachusetts’ parentage statutes to
recognize diverse family structures and
ensure every child has access to legal
parentage regardless of birth
circumstances. Sponsored by
Representatives Sarah Peake, Hannah
Kane, and Kay Khan, and Senators
Julian Cyr and Bruce Tarr, this law was
a direct recommendation from the MCSW’s 2023 research report on LGBTQ+ individuals and families. The
Commission served on the MPA Coalition, which led advocacy efforts, and the law took effect on January 1, 2025.
The HERO Act: Among its many provisions, the HERO Act—signed on August 8, 2024—expands behavioral health
treatment options and protects cost-of-living adjustments (COLA) for veterans. The Commission recognizes this law’s
importance to women veterans and the broader community, and supports its continued implementation.
Maternal Health and Midwifery Access ("Momnibus" Package): MCSW serves on the Bay State Birth Coalition
and remains engaged in monitoring and supporting the implementation of this legislation. Signed on August 23, 2024,
this legislative package includes:
• An Act promoting access to midwifery care and out-of-hospital birth options, sponsored by
Representatives Kay Khan and Brandy Fluker-Oakley and Senator Becca Rausch
• Key elements of Senator Liz Miranda’s An Act relative to Birthing Justice
Together, these laws establish a licensure pathway for Certified Professional Midwives (CPMs), update outdated birth
center regulations, and ensure MassHealth reimbursement parity for Certified Nurse Midwives and CPMs. Maternal
health and birthing equity have been recurring themes in testimony heard by MCSW and its Regional Commissions.
An Act Supporting Parents Running for Public Office: This legislation, included in the Economic Development Bill
signed on November 14, 2024, permits candidates to use campaign funds to cover childcare expenses, regardless of
gender or family status. Sponsored by Representatives Mike Connolly and Joan Meschino and Senator Patricia

of Campaign and Political Finance regulations adopted in January 2025.
Throughout FY2025, MCSW held three public hearings across the Commonwealth, hosted a Girls Empowerment and
Leadership Initiative (GELI) Town Hall, and engaged directly with hundreds of women and over 40 grassroots
organizations, coalitions, and community-based groups. Working alongside its 11 Regional Commissions, the
Commission gathered critical insight into the most pressing issues facing women and girls in Massachusetts.

egaP
• Expand access to leadership and empowerment programs
• Encourage the inclusion of girls in trades and non-traditional career pathways
These insights will inform future legislative priorities and programmatic efforts to advance gender equity for youth
across the Commonwealth. In addition to the extensive legislative priorities outlined above, each of the 11 Regional
Commissions on the Status of Women across the Commonwealth has identified region-specific legislation that
reflects the unique needs and priorities of their communities. These recommendations amplify local voices and
advance MCSW’s commitment to equity in every region. Details on each Regional Commission’s legislative
endorsements are available on their respective webpages and in their FY2025 annual reports.
MCSW Regional Commissions
The MCSW’s 11 Regional Commissions expand the reach of its mission across the Commonwealth of
Massachusetts. Modeled after the MCSW, the 11 county and regional
women’s commissions were legislatively created to study and report on the MCSW’s Regional Commissions:
status of women and girls in their geographical areas, and to provide

Regional Convenings
MCSW hosts two Regional Convenings per year for the
purpose of providing education, support, and
networking opportunities for our 11 regional
commissions. These events are organized by our
Regional Commissions Director Tina Games, in
collaboration with the Program and Planning
Committee.
This year’s convenings were held on December 5th in
Fall River at the Bristol Community College – and on
May 7th in Pittsfield at the Berkshire Community
College, giving visibility to different parts of the state.
Both events were hybrid which gave regional and state
commissioners from across the Commonwealth an
opportunity to participate in person or virtually, where distance was a factor.
The December 5th convening featured the launch of an online Regional Resource Corner where commissioners
could easily locate and access various documents, materials, and resources needed for their commission work.
There was also a segment focused on board management and MCSW policies which covered items such as best
practices for onboarding, commissioner expectations, community agreements, code of conduct, regional attendance
policy, and the regional grant application and approval process. Each regional commission had an opportunity to
report on their successes, challenges, and legislative work during the first half of the fiscal year.
The May 7th convening featured a legislative training, taking regional commissioners through the advocacy process,
beginning with establishing regional priorities – and how to research, track, and advocate on selected bills that
support these priorities. This segment was led by MCSW Chair Mary-dith Tuitt who gave several real-time examples
of current legislative bills, taking regional commissioners through the process from start to finish. There was also a
presentation on strategic planning led by MCSW Secretary Kim Shea which outlined best practices for creating a
regional strategic plan that aligns with the mission statement, supports the goals of the regional commission, and
invites participation and input from every regional commissioner. This presentation sparked good discussion, curious
questions, and lots of great ideas. Each regional commission had an opportunity to report on their successes,
challenges, and legislative work during the last half of the fiscal year – which always presents potential for regional
collaborations. Our Regional Convenings continue to be well-received by our regional and state commissioners – and
we always look forward to hearing from our regional commissions on what topics they would like to learn more about
and what networking opportunities they would like to experience with each other.

as a platform for raising awareness about the Commission’s work and demonstrating solidarity with
communities historically marginalized in policy and representation.
• Community Listening and Engagement – To facilitate direct dialogue with the public, the Commission
hosted open hours, including a community coffee chat at The Sphere in Northampton. These informal
gatherings invited constituents to share their experiences, raise concerns, and learn more about the
Commission’s mission and ongoing initiatives.
• Media and Public Awareness – To strengthen its advocacy reach, the Commission expanded its media
presence by building relationships with press and communication outlets. This enhanced visibility positioned
the Commission to inform the public, influence policy conversations, and advocate more effectively on behalf
of women and girls in Hampshire and Franklin counties.
• Legislative Advocacy – The creation and publication of an op-ed in support of Bill H.2499, “An Act
pertaining to women’s health at midlife and public, medical and workplace awareness of the transitional
stage of menopause and related chronic conditions.” This advocacy contributed to increased visibility and
public discourse on women’s health.
Goals for Next Fiscal Year
• Recruit new commissioners, strengthen our relationships in the community and with academic partners,
build even stronger partnerships with state legislators, continue our media presence.
