B. Mental health promotion and prevention services
In its role as the state mental health authority, DMH provides an array of mental health promotion and prevention
services for the general population. This includes services such as family support, workforce training, mental health
public awareness and stigma reduction campaigns, support for schools, and participation in various inter-agency
initiatives and workgroups.
Community and School Therapeutic Supports $5.1M
DMH funds Family Support Programs in each of its five geographic areas. These programs assist with system navigation,
community education and advocacy and provide group support meetings (in multiple languages) and some individual
support for caregivers.
Community and School Therapeutic Supports also funds ten Young Adult (YA) Access Centers statewide to increase the
ability of YA with mental health conditions, emerging mental health needs or those who are at risk for mental health
challenges, to access needed services and supports in a timely and effective manner. YA Access Centers are attuned to
the developmental needs of YA and increase the capacity of local communities to effectively support YA with behavioral
health needs. The services and supports available through YA Access Centers do not require DMH Service Authorization,
are low-barrier, flexible, person-centered, trauma informed, and strength-based. These Centers provide an array of
services to support the needs of YA in a community-based setting. YA Access Centers provide opportunities for YA to
develop a community of peers and engage in a variety of individual and group supports including; peer support, arts,
social activities, and linkages to mental health services, healthcare, housing, employment and education resources. YA
Access Centers are welcoming and inclusive spaces that promote an environment that specifically and effectively
engages Black, Indigenous, People of Color (BIPOC) and Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual Queer/Questioning (LGBTQ) YA.
Family and Community Empowerment $425,000
The Department also supports the Parent/Professional Advocacy League (PPAL), a statewide, family-run organization
dedicated to improving the mental health and well-being of youth and families through education, advocacy, and
partnership. PPAL facilitates statewide support groups for parents and conducts monthly educational events on topics of
interest to families. Additionally, within PPAL DMH supports activities of Youth Move, the local chapter of the national
organization, which promotes youth development.
4 | P age
School Based Mental Health Initiatives $4.1M
DMH is addressing challenges related to school based mental health through three initiatives in FY24. The Behavioral
Health Integrated Resources for Children (BIRCh) Project offers professional development to school professionals on the
implementation of evidence-based school mental health interventions, social-emotional learning practices, strategies to
create and sustain positive school climates, and universal screening for early identification and intervention of student
needs. Through a separate but connected contract, DMH is funding the Massachusetts Association of Mental Health to
research and compile information on existing mental health literacy curricula and related resources to support schools.
MAMH will work closely with the BIRCh Project to ensure that all research and deliverables are consistent with the overall
goals of the BIRCh technical assistance center and consistent with DESE standards.
Finally, DMH is funding the BRYT program at Brookline Mental Health Center to provide technical assistance to 33 schools
statewide in implementing the Bryt model. The BRYT Program is a school-based intervention that focuses on providing
support for youth who have missed a significant amount of school or who are returning after several absences due to
hospitalization, out of home placement, etc. The implementation of this statewide technical assistance initiative will
focus on schools in communities with traditionally marginalized racial, ethnic, and cultural populations where schools
have high proportions of students with SED/SMI or at high risk of dropping out.
Massachusetts Child Psychiatric Access Program and MCPAP for Moms $4.3M
Massachusetts Child Psychiatric Access Program (MCPAP) provides specialized psychiatric consultation to pediatricians
and other primary care providers (PCPs) who serve children. The goal is to increase access to behavioral health
treatment by making child psychiatry services available to PCPs across the Commonwealth. MCPAP is currently funded
by DMH and through assessments on state regulated health insurance plans in Massachusetts. MCPAP for Moms
provides specialized psychiatric consultation to OB-GYN physicians and other providers who care for women during the
perinatal period.
Insurance Resource Center for Autism and Behavioral Health $105,000
Funding supports access to information, technical assistance, training, and other resources related to navigating
insurance coverage for autism and behavioral health services for children and adolescents.
Restraint and seclusion initiative $144,980
DMH organized and implemented a statewide restraint and seclusion prevention initiative more than 20 years ago that
was initially DMH-focused but soon became an Interagency effort with six other agencies participating (DCF, Department
of Youth Services, Department of Developmental Services, Department of Elementary and Secondary Education, Early
Education and Care and, Office of the Child Advocate) in a collaborative effort to address conflict, violence and the
situations that lead to restraint/seclusion of youth (and adults) in community/residential/school/hospital/detention
settings.
Training and technical assistance $352,780
Through its Children’s Behavioral Health Knowledge Center (CBHKC), the DMH CYF Division helps ensure that the
workforce who provides services to youth and families are highly skilled and well-trained. The Center supports a range of
training, workforce development and technical assistance opportunities focused on developing competencies of the
children’s behavioral health workforce including a focus on early childhood mental health diagnosis and assessment,
transitional age youth peer mentor workforce, and family therapy interventions for intensive home-based settings. The
5 | P age
Center supports capacity building of behavioral health supervisors who can further train and influence their supervisees’
practice by offering training in reflective supervision, secondary stress and supervising peer mentors. All of the CBHKC’s
work integrates attention to racial and cultural difference, and relevant practices.
DMH’s Coordinator of Infant and Early Childhood Mental Health (IECMH) convenes and staffs an interagency IECMH
workgroup whose members include the Department of Public Health (DPH), Department of Transitional Assistance (DTA),
Department of Early Education and Care (DEEC), and Department of Elementary and Secondary Education (DESE). This
group also works closely with external stakeholders to support the growth and development of IECMH promotion,
prevention, and treatment. To increase knowledge around IECMH assessment and diagnosis, DMH funded training in
intervention modalities with younger children, as well as support of the entire workforce (not just clinical) on family
engagement, observation, and child development, as well as reflective capacity and access to reflective supervision. To
address these needs, we will provide training in Theraplay and in Facilitating Attuned Interactions (FAN).
The DMH CYF Division, the Knowledge Center, in collaboration with MassHealth’s Children’s Behavioral Health Initiative
supported scholarships for 28 clinicians working in the publicly funded mental health system to attend the Intensive
Certificate Program in Family Systems Therapy. Our publicly funded treatment systems work to ensure full family
engagement in treatment and seek to prepare families to support their children successfully at home. This course
supports beginning and intermediate level clinicians to become more skilled, self-aware and confident family-centered
clinicians and supervisors. This project is the result of cross-agency collaboration and alignment of training approaches
across systems.
III. Recommendations
Crucial collaborations are underway in communities with a wide array of stakeholders to promote an understanding of and
how to access the new behavioral health system, including but not limited to the Behavioral Health Helpline and CBHCs to
assist individuals and families to access the right behavioral health services at the time they are needed. DMH will
continue to provide additional recommendations for investment in mental health promotion and prevention, intervention
and treatment, workforce capacity, and promoting collaboration across the systems that serve youth and families in the
Commonwealth. Some key recommendations in these areas are described in more detail below.
A. Invest in Mental Health Promotion and Prevention
Intervention and Care Services
It is important to continue to enhance public awareness of the Behavioral Health Roadmap initiatives through
marketing and social media campaigns with a focus on preventive care. A successful public awareness campaign efforts
will take into consideration cultural preferences and target communities who historically have encountered barriers
with access to care. A comprehensive and integrated approach will promote caregiver mental health and services in
relation to children and families.
Education and Support Services
Due to the current workforce challenges, sustaining and enhancing current peer-based promotion and prevention for
youth and families is beneficial to the service system. This may include investing in evidenced-based prevention programs
that could be offered in non-clinical community settings.
6 | P age
B. Enhance and Expand Access to Intervention and Treatment
Services/ Stabilization/ Supports
The Community Behavioral Health Center’s Mobile Crisis Intervention (MCI) teams and community crisis stabilization and
home and community-based services for youth help prevent the need for out of home treatment and should continue to
be supported.
C. Invest in the Workforce
System Capacity and Building Improvement
To enhance support of the behavioral health workforce loan forgiveness, scholarships, paid internships, access to
reflective supervision, and investigating and investing in alternative interventions that are less staff intensive should
continued to be explored. Specific focus should target BIPOC, bilingual, peer-based workforce, as well as other diverse
and specialized populations.
D. Promote Collaboration Among Children’s Mental Health Service Provider Sectors
The Department of Mental Health should continue strengthening collaboration and communication among existing
interagency and cross-sector groups focused on children’s behavioral health. This includes building on existing DMH
partnerships with other state agencies such as DESE, DCF, DPH, MassHealth, among others. Special attention should be
given to ensure policies and practices are consistent with the mission of increasing access and relevancy of services to
BIPOC and other diverse communities.
7 | P age
Appendix
Intensive Community Services (ICS) Descriptions
Intensive Home-Based Therapeutic Care (formerly known as the Continuum) is a treatment service provided for youth
and families in their home and community. The service prevents, reduces or helps to shorten the need for out of home
treatment. Treatment is provided by a core team consisting of a clinician and an outreach worker. In addition to these
roles, the team consists of an occupational therapist (OT), Young Adult Peer Mentor (YAPM), Family Partner (FP) and
psychiatrist. Participation by those roles in the assessment and treatment varies for each youth and family, as clinically
indicated. Treatment is individualized to each family’s needs with the goal of keeping the youth successfully at home. If
an out of home treatment intervention occurs, the core team will continue to work with the family, collaborate and
coordinate treatment with the out of home treatment provider and assist in the safe transition of the youth back home
after an out of home treatment intervention.
Therapeutic Group Care is an out of home treatment service for youth who have mental health needs such that their
behaviors put them and/or others at such risk that they require therapeutic interventions that can be safely delivered
only in a 24-hour staffed therapeutic milieu. The service provides flexible individualized assessment and treatment with
the goal of reintegrating youth with their families and communities. Staff work with the family to develop and support a
plan for the youth to return home. Family engagement and participation is crucial to supporting the youth in returning
to their home and community. This service also provides short term, planned respite, included in the capacity of the
program. There is one direct care staff for every three youth. Youth attend a community-based school, community-
based treatment, vocational training, or a job. If a youth is also enrolled in Intensive Home-Based Therapeutic Care, the
Therapeutic Group Care staff work with Intensive Home-Based Therapeutic Care staff who take the lead collaborating
and coordinating treatment for the youth and family
Young Adult Therapeutic Care is for young adults, 18 through 25 years of age. This service provides placement
intervention and services designed to promote health, wellness, and recovery through person-centered services and
supports that enable individuals to live, work, attend school and participate in their communities. This model facilitates
transitioning through different levels of service according to the young adult’s developmental and treatment needs by
providing different types of placement intervention with supportive services. Participation in work, school, or a job
training program during weekday daytime hours is required. Levels of supportive intervention are individualized so
young adults may transition through the levels as needed or use just one. This program is a combined array of intensity
that includes the following types of out of home treatment:
• Staffed Apartments: group living with onsite staff support for up to 6 young adults (including beds for respite).
• Supported Apartments: individual apartments with intermittent on-site staff support, but 24/7 access.
• Outreach: some programs also have community team-based support for young adults living at home with family
or in their own apartments. This is determined by the terms of the applicable contract.

Community and School Therapeutic Supports also funds ten Young Adult (YA) Access Centers statewide to increase the
ability of YA with mental health conditions, emerging mental health needs or those who are at risk for mental health
challenges, to access needed services and supports in a timely and effective manner. YA Access Centers are attuned to
the developmental needs of YA and increase the capacity of local communities to effectively support YA with behavioral
health needs. The services and supports available through YA Access Centers do not require DMH Service Authorization,
are low-barrier, flexible, person-centered, trauma informed, and strength-based. These Centers provide an array of
services to support the needs of YA in a community-based setting. YA Access Centers provide opportunities for YA to
develop a community of peers and engage in a variety of individual and group supports including; peer support, arts,
social activities, and linkages to mental health services, healthcare, housing, employment and education resources. YA

School Based Mental Health Initiatives $4.1M
DMH is addressing challenges related to school based mental health through three initiatives in FY24. The Behavioral
Health Integrated Resources for Children (BIRCh) Project offers professional development to school professionals on the
implementation of evidence-based school mental health interventions, social-emotional learning practices, strategies to
create and sustain positive school climates, and universal screening for early identification and intervention of student
needs. Through a separate but connected contract, DMH is funding the Massachusetts Association of Mental Health to
research and compile information on existing mental health literacy curricula and related resources to support schools.
MAMH will work closely with the BIRCh Project to ensure that all research and deliverables are consistent with the overall
goals of the BIRCh technical assistance center and consistent with DESE standards.
Finally, DMH is funding the BRYT program at Brookline Mental Health Center to provide technical assistance to 33 schools
statewide in implementing the Bryt model. The BRYT Program is a school-based intervention that focuses on providing
support for youth who have missed a significant amount of school or who are returning after several absences due to
hospitalization, out of home placement, etc. The implementation of this statewide technical assistance initiative will
focus on schools in communities with traditionally marginalized racial, ethnic, and cultural populations where schools
have high proportions of students with SED/SMI or at high risk of dropping out.
Massachusetts Child Psychiatric Access Program and MCPAP for Moms $4.3M
Massachusetts Child Psychiatric Access Program (MCPAP) provides specialized psychiatric consultation to pediatricians
and other primary care providers (PCPs) who serve children. The goal is to increase access to behavioral health
treatment by making child psychiatry services available to PCPs across the Commonwealth. MCPAP is currently funded
by DMH and through assessments on state regulated health insurance plans in Massachusetts. MCPAP for Moms
provides specialized psychiatric consultation to OB-GYN physicians and other providers who care for women during the
perinatal period.
Insurance Resource Center for Autism and Behavioral Health $105,000
Funding supports access to information, technical assistance, training, and other resources related to navigating
insurance coverage for autism and behavioral health services for children and adolescents.
Restraint and seclusion initiative $144,980
DMH organized and implemented a statewide restraint and seclusion prevention initiative more than 20 years ago that
was initially DMH-focused but soon became an Interagency effort with six other agencies participating (DCF, Department
of Youth Services, Department of Developmental Services, Department of Elementary and Secondary Education, Early
Education and Care and, Office of the Child Advocate) in a collaborative effort to address conflict, violence and the
situations that lead to restraint/seclusion of youth (and adults) in community/residential/school/hospital/detention
settings.
Training and technical assistance $352,780
Through its Children’s Behavioral Health Knowledge Center (CBHKC), the DMH CYF Division helps ensure that the
workforce who provides services to youth and families are highly skilled and well-trained. The Center supports a range of
training, workforce development and technical assistance opportunities focused on developing competencies of the
children’s behavioral health workforce including a focus on early childhood mental health diagnosis and assessment,
transitional age youth peer mentor workforce, and family therapy interventions for intensive home-based settings. The
5 | P age

Center supports capacity building of behavioral health supervisors who can further train and influence their supervisees’
practice by offering training in reflective supervision, secondary stress and supervising peer mentors. All of the CBHKC’s
work integrates attention to racial and cultural difference, and relevant practices.
DMH’s Coordinator of Infant and Early Childhood Mental Health (IECMH) convenes and staffs an interagency IECMH
workgroup whose members include the Department of Public Health (DPH), Department of Transitional Assistance (DTA),
Department of Early Education and Care (DEEC), and Department of Elementary and Secondary Education (DESE). This
group also works closely with external stakeholders to support the growth and development of IECMH promotion,
prevention, and treatment. To increase knowledge around IECMH assessment and diagnosis, DMH funded training in
intervention modalities with younger children, as well as support of the entire workforce (not just clinical) on family
engagement, observation, and child development, as well as reflective capacity and access to reflective supervision. To
address these needs, we will provide training in Theraplay and in Facilitating Attuned Interactions (FAN).
The DMH CYF Division, the Knowledge Center, in collaboration with MassHealth’s Children’s Behavioral Health Initiative
supported scholarships for 28 clinicians working in the publicly funded mental health system to attend the Intensive
Certificate Program in Family Systems Therapy. Our publicly funded treatment systems work to ensure full family
engagement in treatment and seek to prepare families to support their children successfully at home. This course
supports beginning and intermediate level clinicians to become more skilled, self-aware and confident family-centered
clinicians and supervisors. This project is the result of cross-agency collaboration and alignment of training approaches
across systems.
III. Recommendations
Crucial collaborations are underway in communities with a wide array of stakeholders to promote an understanding of and
how to access the new behavioral health system, including but not limited to the Behavioral Health Helpline and CBHCs to
assist individuals and families to access the right behavioral health services at the time they are needed. DMH will
continue to provide additional recommendations for investment in mental health promotion and prevention, intervention
and treatment, workforce capacity, and promoting collaboration across the systems that serve youth and families in the
Commonwealth. Some key recommendations in these areas are described in more detail below.
A. Invest in Mental Health Promotion and Prevention
Intervention and Care Services
It is important to continue to enhance public awareness of the Behavioral Health Roadmap initiatives through
marketing and social media campaigns with a focus on preventive care. A successful public awareness campaign efforts
will take into consideration cultural preferences and target communities who historically have encountered barriers
with access to care. A comprehensive and integrated approach will promote caregiver mental health and services in
relation to children and families.
Education and Support Services
Due to the current workforce challenges, sustaining and enhancing current peer-based promotion and prevention for
youth and families is beneficial to the service system. This may include investing in evidenced-based prevention programs
that could be offered in non-clinical community settings.
6 | P age

B. Enhance and Expand Access to Intervention and Treatment
Services/ Stabilization/ Supports
The Community Behavioral Health Center’s Mobile Crisis Intervention (MCI) teams and community crisis stabilization and
home and community-based services for youth help prevent the need for out of home treatment and should continue to
be supported.
C. Invest in the Workforce
System Capacity and Building Improvement
To enhance support of the behavioral health workforce loan forgiveness, scholarships, paid internships, access to
reflective supervision, and investigating and investing in alternative interventions that are less staff intensive should
continued to be explored. Specific focus should target BIPOC, bilingual, peer-based workforce, as well as other diverse
and specialized populations.
D. Promote Collaboration Among Children’s Mental Health Service Provider Sectors
The Department of Mental Health should continue strengthening collaboration and communication among existing
interagency and cross-sector groups focused on children’s behavioral health. This includes building on existing DMH
partnerships with other state agencies such as DESE, DCF, DPH, MassHealth, among others. Special attention should be
given to ensure policies and practices are consistent with the mission of increasing access and relevancy of services to
BIPOC and other diverse communities.

Appendix
Intensive Community Services (ICS) Descriptions
Intensive Home-Based Therapeutic Care (formerly known as the Continuum) is a treatment service provided for youth
and families in their home and community. The service prevents, reduces or helps to shorten the need for out of home
treatment. Treatment is provided by a core team consisting of a clinician and an outreach worker. In addition to these
roles, the team consists of an occupational therapist (OT), Young Adult Peer Mentor (YAPM), Family Partner (FP) and
psychiatrist. Participation by those roles in the assessment and treatment varies for each youth and family, as clinically
indicated. Treatment is individualized to each family’s needs with the goal of keeping the youth successfully at home. If
an out of home treatment intervention occurs, the core team will continue to work with the family, collaborate and
coordinate treatment with the out of home treatment provider and assist in the safe transition of the youth back home
after an out of home treatment intervention.
Therapeutic Group Care is an out of home treatment service for youth who have mental health needs such that their
behaviors put them and/or others at such risk that they require therapeutic interventions that can be safely delivered
only in a 24-hour staffed therapeutic milieu. The service provides flexible individualized assessment and treatment with
the goal of reintegrating youth with their families and communities. Staff work with the family to develop and support a
plan for the youth to return home. Family engagement and participation is crucial to supporting the youth in returning
to their home and community. This service also provides short term, planned respite, included in the capacity of the
program. There is one direct care staff for every three youth. Youth attend a community-based school, community-
based treatment, vocational training, or a job. If a youth is also enrolled in Intensive Home-Based Therapeutic Care, the
Therapeutic Group Care staff work with Intensive Home-Based Therapeutic Care staff who take the lead collaborating
and coordinating treatment for the youth and family
Young Adult Therapeutic Care is for young adults, 18 through 25 years of age. This service provides placement
intervention and services designed to promote health, wellness, and recovery through person-centered services and
supports that enable individuals to live, work, attend school and participate in their communities. This model facilitates
transitioning through different levels of service according to the young adult’s developmental and treatment needs by
providing different types of placement intervention with supportive services. Participation in work, school, or a job
training program during weekday daytime hours is required. Levels of supportive intervention are individualized so
young adults may transition through the levels as needed or use just one. This program is a combined array of intensity
that includes the following types of out of home treatment:
• Staffed Apartments: group living with onsite staff support for up to 6 young adults (including beds for respite).
• Supported Apartments: individual apartments with intermittent on-site staff support, but 24/7 access.
• Outreach: some programs also have community team-based support for young adults living at home with family
or in their own apartments. This is determined by the terms of the applicable contract.
