Dear Chairs,
Section 2SSSS of Chapter 29 of the Massachusetts General Laws requires
the Executive Office of Health and Human Services (EOHHS) to submit to the
House and Senate Committees on Ways and Means a detailed accounting of all
monies transferred credited or deposited into the MassHealth Delivery System
Reform Payment (DSRIP) Trust Fund.
Expenditures from the DSRIP Trust Fund include payments for services delivered to
MassHealth beneficiaries by acute hospitals, infrastructure payments for Accountable
Care Organizations (ACOs) and Community Partners (CPs), investments in statewide
infrastructure and workforce capacity to support successful reform implementation, and
DSRIP operations and implementation. DSRIP investment funds are critical in the
implementation of the ACO and CP programs and will support care coordination.
In August 2017, 17 health care organizations across the state executed agreements to
participate in the MassHealth ACO program and in December 2017, 26 community
organizations executed contracts to participate in the CP program. MassHealth began
paying DSRIP funds to ACOs in September 2017 and began paying DSRIP funds to
CPs in December 2017. Full implementation of the ACO program took place in March
2018 and full implementation of the CP program took place in July 2018.

Below is the expenditure detail for SFY17-23, SFY24, and SFY25 Q1-Q2.
Trust Fund expenditures are not consistent every quarter due to the timing of payments
to providers, which results in unexpended balances in the Trust at the end of each state
fiscal year. The timing of revenue receipts can vary by quarter which may cause a
negative balance in a given quarter.
As part of the DSRIP program, MassHealth prospectively paid ACOs and CPs
infrastructure dollars in accordance with an approved budget for each year. At the end
of the final year of DSRIP, ACOs and CPs reported final expenditures for those
infrastructure dollars. Since the infrastructure dollars can only be used for DSRIP
purposes and the program has now ended, MassHealth must recoup all unspent DSRIP
dollars. The ACO & CP returned funds line reflects that recoupment and the return of
associated federal match.
Thank you for your continuing commitment to the MassHealth program. If you
have any questions about this report, please contact Sarah Nordberg at
Sarah.Nordberg@mass.gov.
Sincerely,
Mike Levine
