Executive Summary
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
In accordance with Section 12 of Chapter 11 of the Massachusetts General Laws, the Office of the State
Auditor (OSA) has conducted a performance audit of the Massachusetts State College Building Authority
(MSCBA) for the period July 1, 2022 through June 30, 2024.
The purpose of our audit was to determine the following:
• whether MSCBA had a process in place to ensure that it met the fiscal years 2023 and 2024
benchmarks set by the Supplier Diversity Office (SDO) for contracting with minority-, women-, and
veteran-owned businesses;
• to what extent MSCBA ensured that its residential buildings on university campuses met the
minimum public health and safety requirements, in accordance with Section 101.3 of Title 780 of
the Code of Massachusetts Regulations and MSCBA’s established procedures for monitoring its
properties;
• whether MSCBA took corrective actions to address the issue identified in the prior OSA audit
(Audit No. 2018-0209-3A) regarding its business continuity plan (BCP); and
• whether MSCBA took corrective actions to address the issue identified in the prior OSA audit
(Audit No. 2018-0209-3A) regarding its internal control plan (ICP).
Below is a summary of our findings, the effects of those findings, and our recommendations, with
hyperlinks to each page listed.
Finding 1 MSCBA did not ensure that it met the annual benchmarks for diverse supplier spending set
Page 14 by SDO.
Effect MSCBA has demonstrated a commitment to promoting diversity in its procurement process
by voluntarily participating in the Supplier Diversity Program (SDP). However, because
MSCBA did not have an established process for meeting these spending benchmarks,
MSCBA limited its ability to evaluate and improve the effectiveness of its efforts to promote
diversity in its procurement process.
Recommendations 1. MSCBA should develop, document, and implement policies and procedures to
Pages 15 effectively monitor the extent to which it achieves SDO annual benchmarks for diverse
supplier spending. These policies should incorporate the updated requirements of the
SDP, which, effective July 1, 2024, include spending benchmarks for businesses owned
by LGBTQ individuals and individuals with disabilities.

Section 6:
2. MSCBA should develop strategies aimed at enhancing the participation of diverse
businesses in its procurement process. This could include expanding targeted outreach
to certified diverse vendors to increase their participation as both prime contractors
and subcontractors.
Finding 2 MSCBA’s BCP was missing critical components.
Page 16
1
Audit No. 2025-0209-3A Massachusetts State College Building Authority
Executive Summary
Effect Without a comprehensive BCP, MSCBA cannot ensure that it has adequate procedures in
place to protect critical information assets or to recover essential operations in the event
of a disruption or disaster.
Recommendation MSCBA should update its BCP to include all critical components outlined by the Executive
Page 17 Office of Technology Services and Security.
Finding 3 MSCBA’s ICP was not based on an agency-wide risk assessment and was missing key
Page 18 elements of enterprise risk management.
Effect Without a sufficiently developed ICP based on an agency-wide risk assessment, MSCBA is
limited in its ability to identify vulnerabilities, which could prevent it from achieving
organizational goals.
Recommendations 1. MSCBA should develop an ICP based on a current agency-wide risk assessment that
Page 19 includes all aspects of its business activities. MSCBA should ensure that its ICP includes
all the critical components of enterprise risk management.

Section 7:
2. After completing its ICP, MSCBA should ensure that the ICP is communicated to all
employees, used within its operations, and reviewed and updated at least annually.
Finding 4a MSCBA did not adequately manage employee access rights.
Page 20
Effect Without management approval, MSCBA does not have sufficient verification that system
users were approved to access the system at all or that user accounts were limited to the
fewest privileges necessary for the employees’ job duties.
Finding 4b MSCBA could not provide evidence that its employees completed cybersecurity awareness
Page 21 training.
Effect If MSCBA does not ensure that its employees complete cybersecurity awareness training,
then it is exposed to an increased risk of cyberattacks and financial and/or reputational
losses.
Finding 4c MSCBA was missing documentation for a completed background check.
Page 22
Effect Without proper screening, MSCBA assumes a higher-than-acceptable risk of hiring
individuals who may pose security threats to its systems and data.
Finding 4d MSCBA did not promptly revoke access rights to its accounting and project management
Page 22 system.
Effect If MSCBA does not promptly revoke former employees’ access rights to its system, then
there is an increased risk that former employees could improperly access and/or change
information in the system.
Finding 4e MSCBA did not have session lock mechanisms in place.
Page 23
Effect If MSCBA does not have session lock mechanisms in place, then employees may remain
logged on indefinitely, increasing the risk of unauthorized access and reducing the
organization’s ability to effectively monitor and control system activity.
Finding 4f MSCBA did not have a documented configuration management policy.
Page 24
2
Audit No. 2025-0209-3A Massachusetts State College Building Authority
Executive Summary
Effect Without a configuration management policy, MSCBA makes its accounting and project
management system vulnerable to misconfigurations, security threats, and performance
issues.
Finding 4g MSCBA did not have established procedures to review audit logs.
Page 25
Effect If MSCBA does not run regular audit logs of its accounting and project management system,
then it exposes itself to a higher-than-acceptable risk of unauthorized user activity. It also
exposes itself to a higher-than-acceptable risk that security incidents and policy violations
go undetected by MSCBA management.
Recommendations 1. MSCBA should ensure that documented records are kept to evidence supervisory
Page 26 approval for system user rights for its accounting and project management system.

Section 8:
2. MSCBA should develop and implement policies and procedures to ensure that all
employees receive cybersecurity awareness training within 30 days of orientation and
annually thereafter. Also, MSCBA should maintain certificates of completion of these
trainings for all of its employees.

Section 9:
3. MSCBA should ensure that all employees with access to confidential information
undergo background checks, as required by its policy. MSCBA should maintain
documentation of these screenings to ensure accountability and compliance.

Section 10:
4. MSCBA should ensure that system privileges are revoked within 24 business hours of
termination. Additionally, MSCBA should consider temporarily suspending employees’
privileges when they are on leaves of absence.

Section 11:
5. MSCBA should configure both its network and its accounting and project management
system to lock out after a five-minute period of inactivity.

Section 12:
6. MSCBA should establish controls to ensure that configuration management
procedures are in place to safeguard its accounting and project management system.

Section 13:
7. MSCBA should ensure that audit logs are run for its accounting and project
management system on a regular basis, so that system user activity is tracked.

Overview of Audited Entity
OVERVIEW OF AUDITED ENTITY
The Massachusetts State College Building Authority (MSCBA) was established under Chapter 703 of the
Acts of 1963. MSCBA is authorized to finance and oversee the design and construction of housing, dining,
athletic, parking, and other student activity facilities at the 15 community colleges1 and nine state
universities.2 This financing and oversight authority, which is established by its enabling legislation, is
subject to written approval from the Secretary of Administration and Finance and the Commissioner of
Higher Education for Massachusetts. MSCBA is also authorized to issue bonds and collect student rents
and fees for the operation of student living facilities.
MSCBA oversees residence halls that house approximately 16,500 students across 54 residential
complexes. These facilities accommodate about 50% of the total undergraduate student population in
Massachusetts state colleges and universities and span approximately 4.5 million square feet across the
nine state university campuses (as shown below). There are no residence halls located on community
college campuses.

withFinancialStatements.pdf)

Section 14:
1. The community colleges are Berkshire, Bristol, Bunker Hill, Cape Cod, Greenfield, Holyoke, Massachusetts Bay, Massasoit,
Middlesex, Mount Wachusett, North Shore, Northern Essex, Quinsigamond, Roxbury, and Springfield Technical.

Section 15:
2. The state universities are Bridgewater, Fitchburg, Framingham, Salem, Westfield, and Worcester, as well as the
Massachusetts College of Art and Design, the Massachusetts College of Liberal Arts, and the Massachusetts Maritime
Academy.

Audit No. 2025-0209-3A Massachusetts State College Building Authority
Overview of Audited Entity
MSCBA is governed by a nine-member board, the members of which are appointed by the Governor.
Three members of the board must also be members of the state’s Board of Higher Education. It is also
governed by various state procurement laws and regulations; the trust agreements for all bonds that
MSCBA issues; and the Contract for Financial Assistance, Management and Services between MSCBA and
the Board of Higher Education, which acts on behalf of the community colleges and universities served by
MSCBA. Further, the Secretary of Administration and Finance and the State Treasurer and Receiver
General must approve the sale of all bonds and notes issued by MSCBA to fund its projects. MSCBA’s
board appoints an executive director who is responsible for overseeing the day-to-day operations of
MSCBA.
The Commonwealth does not appropriate any state funding for MSCBA, nor does it guarantee the bonds
issued by MSCBA for its building projects. Instead, all revenue used to support the design, construction,
and operation of MSCBA facilities is generated through rents and fees paid by students for the use of
these facilities and related services. According to the MSCBA fiscal year 2023 audit report that was
completed by an independent auditor, MSCBA’s principal amount of outstanding bond debt, as of June
30, 2023, was $1.135 billion. For the fiscal year that ended June 30, 2023, MSCBA spent $30,323,667 on
land, construction, buildings, improvements, furnishings, and equipment for MSCBA capital assets at
community colleges and universities.
MSCBA is located at 10 High Street in Boston and had 14 employees as of June 30, 2024.
Supplier Diversity Program
MSCBA voluntarily participates in the Supplier Diversity Office’s (SDO’s) Supplier Diversity Program (SDP).
According to the Supplier Diversity Office Comprehensive Annual Report Fiscal Year 2023, “the role of the
SDO is to certify, provide resources for, and support a wide range of diverse and small businesses in
competing for contracts being bid across the Commonwealth.”
Through consultation with the Office for Access and Opportunity and Community Affairs, which falls under
the Office of the Governor, SDO sets annual benchmark percentages for spending by SDP participants with
5
Audit No. 2025-0209-3A Massachusetts State College Building Authority
Overview of Audited Entity
minority-owned,3 woman-owned, and veteran-owned businesses.4 The annual spending benchmarks are
expressed as a percentage of the discretionary budget for each participating state agency.
For fiscal years 2023 and 2024, SDO set the spending benchmarks5 outlined in the table below.
Business Certification Category Spending Benchmark
(Percentage of State Agency’s Discretionary Budget)
Minority-Owned Business 8%
Women-Owned Business 14%
Veteran-Owned Business 3%
During the audit, MSCBA officials told us that they determine discretionary spending by identifying
expenditures linked to specific job codes within various projects. This includes costs for building
construction such as materials, labor, and permits; design services, which cover architectural and interior
design; and project management, which involves coordinating budgets, schedules, and resources to
ensure the successful completion of projects.
MSCBA voluntarily submits a narrative describing its efforts to meet the spending benchmarks and to
advance diversity and inclusion in its procurement, which SDO includes as part of its annual report.
According to the Supplier Diversity Office Comprehensive Annual Report Fiscal Year 2023,
[MSCBA] is committed to fostering, cultivating, and preserving a culture of diversity, equity, and
inclusion. [MSCBA] partners with the Commonwealth’s Supplier Diversity Office, other state
entities, and industry associations to strengthen the diverse workforce within the Commonwealth.
In addition to adopting the Commonwealth’s diversity goals for hiring design and construction
firms, the MSCBA continues to reach out to the subcontractor community by engaging Minority
Business Enterprises, Women Owned Business Enterprises, and Veteran-Owned Business
Enterprises in a web-based trade contractor prequalification process where they are awarded
additional credit toward becoming prequalified to bid on MSCBA projects.

Section 16:
3. According to the Supplier Diversity Office Comprehensive Annual Report Fiscal Year 2023, SDO defines a minority-owned
business “as a business that is owned by a racially or ethnically diverse individual. While the [term is] meant to define an
ethnically or racially diverse individual or business . . . [it is] not meant to denote a smaller or lesser status of the individuals
or businesses included in this definition.” We use this terminology here because it is a defined term used by the auditee.

Section 17:
4. The percentage for veteran-owned businesses combines the requirement for veteran- and service-disabled veteran–owned
businesses. For more information about veteran- and service-disabled veteran–owned businesses, see SDO’s Comprehensive
Annual Report for Fiscal Year 2023.

Section 18:
5. Effective July 1, 2024, spending benchmarks for businesses owned by LGBTQ individuals and individuals with disabilities were
incorporated into the Commonwealth’s Supplier Diversity Program. This change occurred outside of the audit period and was
therefore not included in the scope of our audit.

Audit No. 2025-0209-3A Massachusetts State College Building Authority
Overview of Audited Entity
Building Safety
Staff members of community colleges and universities manage the day-to-day operations of buildings
owned by MSCBA. According to the Contract for Financial Assistance, Management and Services, dated
February 1, 2003, between MSCBA and the Board of Higher Education, each community college and
university is required to operate and maintain the buildings located on its campus and to keep them in
good order and repair. Universities collect rents and fees from students for the use of the buildings;
procure all necessary equipment, materials, and supplies for upkeeping buildings; and make necessary
repairs—all of which are similar to the responsibilities that a property manager has. As the legal owner of
the properties, MSCBA remains accountable for the overall condition of the properties and provides the
financing for upkeep and repairs.
MSCBA assigns a project manager to each campus to help oversee building maintenance. These project
managers stay in contact with campus facilities staff members and keep track of any deferred
maintenance needs. Project managers meet with campus facility staff members regularly to identify any
issues, needed repairs, or renovation requests.
MSCBA has a number of requirements to which community colleges and universities must adhere. For
example, each year, MSCBA requires community colleges and universities to confirm that they have active
service contracts for key systems in MSCBA-owned buildings on their campuses, such as boilers, elevators,
fire escapes, fire alarms, fire suppression systems, and generators. In order to confirm that they hold these
active contracts, community colleges and universities submit copies of the contract tracking sheets to
MSCBA. Universities must also certify that the annual Certificates of Occupancy are on file for residential
buildings. Additionally, community colleges and universities must notify MSCBA of any deficiencies or
violations that need to be addressed as soon as they are identified—for example, sprinkler systems that
need to be updated or issues identified during building system maintenance inspections. Community
colleges and universities submit this information via email using a Service Contract Tracking Sheet
provided by MSCBA.
Business Continuity and Internal Control Plans
During our prior audit (Audit No. 2018-0209-3A), we found that MSCBA had not developed an effective
business continuity plan (BCP) or conducted testing of its disaster recovery plan in accordance with the
Executive Office of Technology Services and Security’s (EOTSS’s) Business Continuity and Disaster
7
Audit No. 2025-0209-3A Massachusetts State College Building Authority
Overview of Audited Entity
Recovery Standard IS.005.6 This standard required that Commonwealth agencies have a plan to keep
essential business functions running, especially during disruptions. The BCP should focus on the most
likely and most impactful risks to information security, identify key functions, and include ways to keep
those functions going if systems or environments fail. Additionally, the BCP must be tested every year to
check for any overlooked issues or necessary updates, including changes to equipment or staff members.
Although MSCBA is not required to follow these standards, since it is not a Commonwealth agency within
the executive branch and is instead categorized as a quasi-governmental agency, EOTSS still recommends
that non-executive branch state agencies follow these standards. We also consider them best practices.
Additionally, during our prior audit (Audit No. 2018-0209-3A), we found that MSCBA’s system of internal
controls needed improvement. Specifically, we found that MSCBA had not developed an internal control
plan (ICP) that clearly summarized (1) all of the risks that could potentially prevent it from achieving its
financial, operational, and compliance goals and (2) the internal controls that MSCBA had in place to
mitigate these risks. While our report acknowledged that MSCBA had documented policies and
procedures, primarily related to its financial operations, these controls were limited to specific areas and
did not form a comprehensive ICP. In our prior audit, we recommended that MSCBA conduct an agency-
wide risk assessment and develop internal controls to mitigate identified risks and achieve organizational
goals.
While there are no specific legal or regulatory requirements related to MSCBA’s system of internal
controls, Chapter 647 of the Acts of 1989 requires state agencies to develop and clearly document internal
control systems in accordance with the guidelines established by the Office of the Comptroller of the
Commonwealth (CTR). These guidelines require that an ICP be based on an agency-wide risk assessment
and be revised annually. Although MSCBA is not required to follow these standards, since it is not a
Commonwealth agency within the executive branch and is instead categorized as a quasi-governmental
agency, we consider them best practices.

Section 19:
6. EOTSS has since changed the titles and numbers of at least some of its policies and standards between the end of the audit
period and the publication of this report. In this report, we reference the titles and numbers of EOTSS’s policies and/or
standards as they were during the audit period (unless stated otherwise).

Audit Objectives, Scope, and Methodology
AUDIT OBJECTIVES, SCOPE, AND METHODOLOGY
In accordance with Section 12 of Chapter 11 of the Massachusetts General Laws, the Office of the State
Auditor (OSA) has conducted a performance audit of certain activities of the Massachusetts State College
Building Authority (MSCBA) for the period July 1, 2022 through June 30, 2024.
We conducted this performance audit in accordance with generally accepted government auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate
evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We
believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on
our audit objectives.
Below is a list of our audit objectives, indicating each question we intended our audit to answer; the
conclusion we reached regarding each objective; and, if applicable, where each objective is discussed in
the audit findings.
Objective Conclusion

Section 24:
4. Did MSCBA take corrective actions to address the issue identified in the prior OSA audit Partially; see
(Audit No. 2018-0209-3A) regarding its internal control plan (ICP)? Finding 3
To accomplish our audit objectives, we gained an understanding of the aspects of MSCBA’s internal
control environment relevant to our objectives by reviewing applicable policies and procedures, reviewing
relevant contracts, and interviewing officials at MSCBA and two state universities. We evaluated the
design and implementation of the internal controls related to our audit objectives. We also tested the
operating effectiveness of controls related to the verification of service contracts for key safety systems
in MSCBA-owned buildings. In addition, to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to address our audit
objectives, we performed the procedures described below.

Audit No. 2025-0209-3A Massachusetts State College Building Authority
Audit Objectives, Scope, and Methodology
Supplier Diversity Program
To determine whether MSCBA had a process in place to ensure that it met the fiscal year 2023 and 2024
benchmarks set by SDO for contracting with minority-, women-, and veteran-owned businesses, we took
the following actions. First, we obtained a list of all 3,947 expenses, totaling $104,299,510, recorded by
MSCBA during the audit period in its accounting and project management system. From this data, we
identified MSCBA’s discretionary spending for fiscal years 2023 and 2024 as $43,968,982 and $41,582,622,
respectively, totaling 2,752 transactions. We then determined how much of the identified discretionary
spending was directed to certified minority-, women-, and veteran-owned businesses. To do this, we
cross-referenced the vendors in the discretionary spending dataset with SDO’s directory of certified
businesses. We calculated the total dollar amount and the percentage of discretionary spending awarded
to diverse vendors during the audit period and compared it to the applicable SDO benchmarks for fiscal
years 2023 and 2024.
Based on the results of our testing, we determined that MSCBA did not have a process in place to ensure
that it met the benchmarks set by SDO for contracting with minority-, women-, and veteran-owned
businesses during the audit period. Also, although MSCBA met the SDO benchmark for contracting with
veteran-owned businesses, it did not meet the spending benchmarks for minority- and women-owned
businesses. See Finding 1 for more information.
Residential Building Safety
To determine to what extent MSCBA ensured that its residential buildings on university campuses met
the minimum public health and safety requirements, in accordance with 780 CMR 101.3 and MSCBA’s
established procedures for monitoring its properties, we took the actions described below.
We selected a random, nonstatistical7 sample of 20 MSCBA-owned residential properties from a
population of 54 for our testing. For each property in our sample, we verified that the respective state
university submitted the required Service Contract Tracking Sheet to MSCBA. We reviewed the tracking
sheets submitted by the university facilities staff members to ensure that they were fully completed and
that they provided vendor information for all applicable building systems. We requested executed vendor
agreements and Certificates of Occupancy for each property and the service contracts listed on the

Section 25:
7. Auditors use nonstatistical sampling to select items for audit testing when a population is very small, the population items
are not similar enough, or there are specific items in the population that the auditors want to review.
10
Audit No. 2025-0209-3A Massachusetts State College Building Authority
Audit Objectives, Scope, and Methodology
tracking sheets in our sample. We examined each contract to ensure that it corresponded with the correct
property and vendor listed on the tracking sheet, and we ensured that the contract dates were active
during the audit period. In addition, we confirmed that the sampled universities maintained a valid
Certificate of Occupancy on file for each property.
We did not identify any exceptions in our testing. Therefore, we concluded that, during the audit period,
MSCBA ensured that its residential buildings on university campuses met the minimum public health and
safety requirements, in accordance with 780 CMR 101.3 and MSCBA’s established procedures for
monitoring its properties.
BCP
During our prior audit (Audit No. 2018-0209-3A), we found that MSCBA had not developed an effective
BCP or conducted testing of its disaster recovery plan in accordance with the Executive Office of
Technology Services and Security’s (EOTSS’s) Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery Standard IS.005.
To determine whether MSCBA took corrective actions to address the issue identified in our prior audit
(Audit No. 2018-0209-3A) regarding its BCP, we interviewed knowledgeable MSCBA staff members and
inspected MSCBA’s BCP to confirm that a plan was in place during this report’s audit period and that it
complied with EOTSS’s Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery Standard IS.005. Additionally, we
reviewed documented test results to determine whether MSCBA’s disaster recovery plan was tested
annually during the audit period.
Based on the results of our testing, we determined that MSCBA’s BCP did not include all required
elements. See Finding 2 for more information.
ICP
During our prior audit (Audit No. 2018-0209-3A), we found that MSCBA had not developed an ICP that
clearly summarized all of MSCBA’s risks and the internal controls that it had in place to mitigate them. To
determine whether MSCBA took corrective actions to address the issue identified in our prior audit (Audit
No. 2018-0209-3A) regarding its ICP, we interviewed knowledgeable MSCBA staff members and inspected
the agency’s ICP that was in effect during this report’s audit period to determine whether it had been
updated to include an agency-wide risk assessment, as recommended in our prior audit. Additionally, we
examined the ICP to assess whether it complied with the Office of the Comptroller of the Commonwealth’s
11
Audit No. 2025-0209-3A Massachusetts State College Building Authority
Audit Objectives, Scope, and Methodology
(CTR’s) guidelines, which require inclusion of the eight components of the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission’s enterprise risk management framework.
Based on the results of our testing, we determined that MSCBA’s ICP does not meet all of the
requirements of CTR’s guidelines. See Finding 3 for more information.
We used nonstatistical sampling methods for testing and therefore did not project the results of our
testing to any population.
Data Reliability Assessment
To determine the reliability of the list of expenses that we obtained from MSCBA’s accounting and project
management system, we conducted interviews and system walkthroughs with MSCBA management and
staff members who were knowledgeable about and responsible for overseeing the data. We also checked
the list to ensure that there were no duplicates or missing data, and that all of the data corresponded to
dates within the audit period. To confirm the completeness of the list of expenses, we selected a random
sample of 20 purchase orders we inspected from MSCBA’s physical files and traced vendor names,
purchase order numbers, and payment amounts to the list of expenses we received. To confirm the
accuracy of the list of expenses, we selected a random sample of 20 expenses from the list and traced
vendor names, payment dates, and payment amounts to invoices that we inspected from MSCBA’s
records.
We also reviewed select system controls related to security management, access controls, configuration
management, segregation of duties, and contingency planning. Through this testing, we found that
MSCBA has not established adequate internal controls over its accounting system. See Finding 4 for more
information regarding the results of our review of the information system controls.
Further, we conducted a Benford’s Law test8 on the list of overall expenses to detect any indication of
fraud or tampering with general ledger expenses that would compromise data integrity, and we found no
indication of such activity.

Section 26:
8. Benford’s Law is a statistical principle that predicts how often each digit (one through nine) appears as the leading digit in
naturally occurring numerical data. Significant deviations from this distribution may indicate irregularities or potential
manipulation and can be used as a tool for data analysis in audits.

To determine the reliability of the list of properties owned by MSCBA that was provided to us, we
interviewed MSCBA officials who were knowledgeable about the list. We checked the list for blank and
duplicate records. We also confirmed that final construction dates for all listed properties occurred before
the start of the audit period. Additionally, we verified the list of properties against community college and
university records and MSCBA contracts. Finally, we reconciled the list of residential properties with
MSCBA’s Annual Report Fiscal Year 2023.
Based on the results of the data reliability assessment procedures described above, we determined that
the information we obtained was sufficiently reliable for the purposes of our audit.

DETAILED AUDIT FINDINGS WITH AUDITEE’S RESPONSE

Section 27:
1. The Massachusetts State College Building Authority did not ensure that it
met the annual benchmarks for diverse supplier spending set by the
Supplier Diversity Office.
The Massachusetts State College Building Authority (MSCBA) did not have processes to ensure that it met
the annual benchmarks for diverse supplier spending set by the Supplier Diversity Office (SDO). During
the audit period, MSCBA did not meet discretionary spending benchmarks for minority-owned and
women-owned businesses.
MSCBA’s spending on minority-owned businesses was only 0.2% in both fiscal years 2023 and 2024, far
below the 8% benchmark. Similarly, spending on women-owned businesses was 1.2% in fiscal year 2023
and 2.1% in fiscal year 2024, well below the 14% benchmark. The table below summarizes MSCBA’s
benchmark attainment during fiscal years 2023 and 2024.
Fiscal Year 2023 Fiscal Year 2024
Total Discretionary Budget $43,968,982 $41,582,622
Minimum Amount MSBCA Needed to Spend to Meet $3,517,519 $3,326,610
the Minority-Owned Business Benchmark (8%)
Amount Spent $89,489 (0.2%) $74,366 (0.2%)
Minimum Amount MSBCA Needed to Spend to Meet $6,155,657 $5,821,567
the Women-Owned Business Benchmark (14%)
Amount Spent $530,638 (1.2%) $890,001 (2.1%)
Minimum Amount MSBCA Needed to Spend to Meet $1,319,069 $1,247,479
the Veteran-Owned Business Benchmark (3%)
Amount Spent $2,813,780 (6.4%) $1,456,939 (3.5%)
MSCBA has demonstrated a commitment to promoting diversity in its procurement process by voluntarily
participating in the Supplier Diversity Program (SDP). However, because MSCBA did not have an
established process for meeting these spending benchmarks, MSCBA limited its ability to evaluate and
improve the effectiveness of its efforts to promote diversity in its procurement process.
14
Audit No. 2025-0209-3A Massachusetts State College Building Authority
Detailed Audit Findings with Auditee’s Response
Authoritative Guidance
SDO’s “The Commonwealth of Massachusetts Diverse and Small Business Program Policies for Goods and
Services Procurements” states,
Annual benchmarks for departmental supplier diversity and small business spending are set by the
SDO and are subject to approval by the Secretary for Administration and Finance and the
Governor’s Office for Access and Engagement. The benchmark spending amounts are based on
applying current benchmark percentages to each department’s discretionary budget and, at the
end of each fiscal year, to its discretionary spending.
Program Certification Type Benchmark Percentage
Minority Business Enterprise (MBE) 8%
Supplier
Woman Business Enterprise (WBE) 14%
Diversity
Program (SDP) Veteran Business, including Veteran Business Enterprise (VBE) and 3%
Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Business Enterprise (SDVOBE)
Reasons for Issue
According to MSCBA officials, MSCBA’s ability to meet SDO’s annual spending benchmarks is constrained
by procurement regulations that require contracts to be awarded to the lowest eligible and responsible
bidder. Specifically, for construction projects, MSCBA must follow the bidding procedures outlined in
Chapter 149 of the Massachusetts General Laws, which mandate contract awards based solely on price.
As a result, even when a certified diverse business submits a bid, MSCBA cannot prioritize that vendor if
a lower bid is received from a nondiverse business.
Recommendations
MSCBA should develop, document, and implement policies and procedures to effectively monitor the
extent to which it achieves SDO annual benchmarks for diverse supplier spending. These policies
should incorporate the updated requirements of the SDP, which, effective July 1, 2024, include
spending benchmarks for businesses owned by LGBTQ individuals and individuals with disabilities.
MSCBA should develop strategies aimed at enhancing the participation of diverse businesses in its
procurement process. This could include expanding targeted outreach to certified diverse vendors to
increase their participation as both prime contractors and subcontractors.
Auditee’s Response
As correctly noted by the [Office of the State Auditor], the Authority is not a Commonwealth agency
within the executive branch and is instead categorized as a quasi-governmental agency and,
therefore, not subject to the SDO annual benchmarks. However, as supporting supplier diversity is
15
Audit No. 2025-0209-3A Massachusetts State College Building Authority
Detailed Audit Findings with Auditee’s Response
important to the Authority’s mission in serving the Commonwealth’s campuses, the Authority has
established a long-standing practice of setting goals for diversity and specifically supporting
diversity of the Commonwealth’s workforce.
Moving forward, the Authority intends to improve its process for monitoring and reporting of direct and
indirect spending on a fiscal year basis; consider amending existing contracts when new diversity
benchmarks are released by the state; expand outreach to diverse vendors in non-construction cost
categories of work; and consider incorporating additional spending benchmarks for businesses owned
by LGBTQ individuals and individuals with disabilities. Lastly, the Authority may establish its own process
for expanding its sources of information in determining the pool of available minority- and women-
owned businesses in accordance with [Section 6(c) of Chapter 7C of the General Laws].
Additionally, the Authority continues to reach out to the subcontractor community by engaging
Minority-, Woman, and Veteran-Owned Business Enterprises in a web-based trade contractor
prequalification process where they are awarded additional credit toward becoming prequalified to
bid on Authority projects. Along with such [minority-owned / women-owned business enterprise]
goals, the Authority has also adopted workforce participation goals to ensure opportunities for
minorities and women to participate in the Authority’s construction projects.
Auditor’s Reply
Based on its response, MSCBA is taking measures to address our concerns regarding this matter. As part
of our post-audit review process, we will follow up on this matter in approximately six months.

Section 28:
2. The Massachusetts State College Building Authority’s business continuity
plan was missing critical components.
In our previous audit (Audit No. 2018-0209-3A), we reported that MSCBA had not developed a business
continuity plan (BCP). During the current audit, we found that MSCBA has since developed a BCP, but it
did not meet the requirements outlined by the Executive Office of Technology Services and Security
(EOTSS). Specifically, MSCBA’s BCP did not have the following critical components:
• a detailed inventory of critical information assets;
• a clear definition of mission-essential functions;
• identification of and management procedures for risks associated with the potential loss or
disruption of essential business processes and information assets;
• an analysis of critical business processes;
• an assessment of likely disruptive events;
• insights from business impact analyses and risk assessments; and
• documentation of an order of succession, delegation of authority, and a list of essential records.
16
Audit No. 2025-0209-3A Massachusetts State College Building Authority
Detailed Audit Findings with Auditee’s Response
Without a comprehensive BCP, MSCBA cannot ensure that it has adequate procedures in place to protect
critical information assets or to recover essential operations in the event of a disruption or disaster.
Authoritative Guidance
According to Section 6.1 of EOTSS’s Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery Standard IS.005,
Commonwealth Agencies and Offices must establish a Business Continuity Program

Section 29:
6.1.1.2 Perform a risk assessment of critical information assets: Establish controls to
identify, contain and mitigate the risks associated with the loss or disruption of
critical business processes and information assets. . . .

Section 30:
6.1.1.4 Develop business continuity plans (BCP): Commonwealth Agencies and Offices
will develop BCPs for critical business processes based on prioritization of likely
disruptive events in light of their probability, severity and consequences for
information security identified through the [business impact analysis] and
risk assessment processes. . . .

Section 31:
6.1.1.4.3 BCPs must be updated whenever a major organizational change occurs or
at least annually, whichever comes first. . . .

Section 32:
6.1.1.4.4.1 Identify essential mission and business functions and a plan for
maintaining these functions in the event of system or environment
compromise, disruption, or failure. . . .

Section 33:
6.1.1.4.6.1 Perform annual tests of the BCPs to identify incorrect assumptions,
oversights, and account for updates to equipment or personnel
changes. Test results will be reported to senior management, the
Commonwealth [chief information security officer], or his or
her designee, and the Security Office.
Although MSCBA is not required to follow this standard, since it is not a Commonwealth agency within
the executive branch and is instead categorized as a quasi-governmental agency, EOTSS still recommends
that non-executive branch state agencies follow these standards. We also consider them best practices.
Reasons for Issue
MSCBA officials stated that they were in the process of developing the BCP when the COVID-19 pandemic
began. The unexpected pandemic required the agency to shift its focus, delaying completion of its BCP.
Recommendation
MSCBA should update its BCP to include all critical components outlined by EOTSS.
17
Audit No. 2025-0209-3A Massachusetts State College Building Authority
Detailed Audit Findings with Auditee’s Response
Auditee’s Response
The Authority has made significant progress on the development of a BCP since the [Office of the
State Auditor’s (OSA’s)] 2018 audit (Audit No. 2018-0209-3A). Many of the elements of business
continuity that relate to technology cited in OSA’s 2018 report have been rectified. For example,
the Authority completes an annual disaster recovery drill, performed by its external [information
technology) network support provider. As noted in the OSA’s 2018 report and during discussions
regarding the OSA’s 2024 audit of the Authority, these disaster recovery drills are performed
annually to ensure that all information assets are safeguarded and recoverable should a disruption
to access occur. These annual drills have successfully recovered all Authority information assets
for seven (7) consecutive years since 2018. Moreover, the Authority is committed to continuing to
develop and refine the BCP so that it is continually focused on improving the Authority’s response
in the event of a disruption or disaster.
Auditor’s Reply
We acknowledge MSCBA’s efforts in developing a BCP since our prior audit and commend its consistent
annual testing of its disaster recovery plan. However, as noted above, MSCBA’s BCP remains incomplete
and does not fully align with the requirements established by EOTSS. While disaster recovery is a key
element of business continuity, a comprehensive BCP must also address organizational mission-essential
functions, risk management procedures, business impact analysis, and succession planning—among other
critical areas—which we found are still lacking in the current plan.
We encourage MSCBA to fully implement our recommendation and expand the scope of its BCP to ensure
compliance with EOTSS standards, strengthening its ability to withstand and recover from operational
disruptions.

Section 34:
3. The Massachusetts State College Building Authority’s internal control plan
was not based on an agency-wide risk assessment and was missing key
elements of enterprise risk management.
In our previous audit (Audit No. 2018-0209-3A), we found that MSCBA had not developed a
comprehensive internal control plan (ICP) that identified all agency risks and related controls. While some
policies and procedures were documented, they primarily addressed financial operations and therefore
did not constitute a comprehensive ICP.
In the current audit, we again identified deficiencies in MSCBA’s ICP. Specifically, the ICP was not based
on an agency-wide risk assessment, which is a critical element for identifying and addressing potential
risks across all aspects of MSCBA’s business operations. Similarly to what we found in our prior audit, the
18
Audit No. 2025-0209-3A Massachusetts State College Building Authority
Detailed Audit Findings with Auditee’s Response
ICP remained focused primarily on financial and accounting functions. Additionally, MSCBA’s ICP did not
incorporate all critical components of enterprise risk management as outlined by the Office of the
Comptroller of the Commonwealth’s (CTR) Internal Control Guide.
Without a sufficiently developed ICP based on an agency-wide risk assessment, MSCBA is limited in its
ability to identify vulnerabilities, which could prevent it from achieving organizational goals.
Authoritative Guidance
There are no specific legal or regulatory requirements related to MSCBA’s internal control system;
however, according to Chapter 647 of the Acts of 1989, state agencies are required to develop and clearly
document internal control systems in accordance with guidelines established by CTR. These guidelines
require an ICP to be based on a risk assessment and revised annually. Although MSCBA is not required to
follow these standards, since it is not a Commonwealth agency within the executive branch and is instead
categorized as a quasi-governmental agency, we consider them best practices.
CTR’s Internal Control Guide states,
Your department is obligated to review and update your Internal Control Plan on an annual basis,
as well as whenever there is a new objective, risk, or management structure. . . .
An internal control plan should have a statement of awareness and compliance with [the General
Laws] Chapter 647 guidelines in addition to the [Committee of Sponsoring Organizations’] eight
[enterprise risk management framework] components.
Reasons for Issue
MSCBA has not developed policies and procedures to ensure that it creates and annually reviews a
comprehensive ICP that addresses all of MSCBA’s operations. According to MSCBA officials, although
MSCBA staff members independently monitor various documents related to internal controls, MSCBA
does not have the staff capacity to consolidate these efforts into a centralized ICP.
Recommendations

Section 35:
1. MSCBA should develop an ICP based on a current agency-wide risk assessment that includes all
aspects of its business activities. MSCBA should ensure that its ICP includes all the critical components
of enterprise risk management.

Section 36:
2. After completing its ICP, MSCBA should ensure that the ICP is communicated to all employees, used
within its operations, and reviewed and updated at least annually.
19
Audit No. 2025-0209-3A Massachusetts State College Building Authority
Detailed Audit Findings with Auditee’s Response
Auditee’s Response
The Authority has written policies and procedures for specific operations, and finance and accounting
internal controls are reviewed annually both internally and by the Authority’s external audit firm.
Although these documents do not take the form of a singular document or plan, they collectively
direct and guide day-to-day internal operations of the Authority. The Authority will review its internal
controls documents, as well as suggested guidance from CTR and other authorities, consistent with
the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations (COSO) framework to further develop a single
comprehensive plan for all the critical components of enterprise risk management.
Auditor’s Reply
Based on its response, MSCBA is taking measures to address our concerns regarding this matter. As part
of our post-audit review process, we will follow up on this matter in approximately six months.

Section 37:
4. The Massachusetts State College Building Authority had inadequate
information system general controls over its accounting and project
management system.
MSCBA did not have adequate information system general controls over its accounting and project
management system. Specifically, we identified issues with management of employee access rights,
employee cybersecurity awareness training, background checks, revocation of employee access rights,
session lock mechanisms, configuration management, and audit log reviews.
a. The Massachusetts State College Building Authority did not adequately
manage employee access rights.
MSCBA did not have documented management approval for its employees’ access rights to its
accounting and project management system for 12 (80%) out of 15 users in the population of
employees who were active during the audit period.
Without management approval, MSCBA does not have sufficient verification that system users were
approved to access the system at all or that user accounts were limited to the fewest privileges
necessary for the employees’ job duties.
Authoritative Guidance

Section 38:
Section 6.1 of EOTSS’s Access Management Standard IS.003 states,

Section 39:
6.1.5 Request access privileges: User requests for access privileges will follow a formal
process. . . .
20
Audit No. 2025-0209-3A Massachusetts State College Building Authority
Detailed Audit Findings with Auditee’s Response

Section 40:
6.1.5.2 User registration and revocation procedures will be implemented for all
information systems and services.

Section 41:
6.1.5.3 User access requests will be recorded (paper or tool-based), include a
business justification for access, and be approved by the requestor’s
supervisor and the appropriate Information Owner or authorized delegate.
Although MSCBA is not required to follow this standard, since it is not a Commonwealth agency within
the executive branch and is instead categorized as a quasi-governmental agency, EOTSS still
recommends that non-executive branch state agencies follow these standards. We also consider them
best practices.
Reason for Issue
MSCBA did not have documented policies and procedures regarding recording and maintaining user
access request approvals for its accounting and project management system during the audit period.
b. The Massachusetts State College Building Authority could not provide
evidence that its employees completed cybersecurity awareness
training.
MSCBA was unable to produce any attendance records or certificates of completion to verify that
accounting and project management system users received cybersecurity awareness training during
the audit period.
If MSCBA does not ensure that its employees complete cybersecurity awareness training, then it is
exposed to an increased risk of cyberattacks and financial and/or reputational losses.
Authoritative Guidance
According to Section 6.2 of EOTSS’s Information Security Risk Standard IS.010,

Section 42:
6.2.3 New Hire Security Awareness Training: All new personnel must complete an
Initial Security Awareness Training course. . . . The New Hire Security Awareness
course must be completed within 30 days of new hire orientation.

Section 43:
6.2.4 Annual Security Awareness Training: All personnel will be required to complete
Annual Security Awareness Training.
Although MSCBA is not required to follow this standard, since it is not a Commonwealth agency within
the executive branch and is instead categorized as a quasi-governmental agency, EOTSS still
21
Audit No. 2025-0209-3A Massachusetts State College Building Authority
Detailed Audit Findings with Auditee’s Response
recommends that non-executive branch state agencies follow these standards. We also consider them
best practices.
Reason for Issue
MSCBA did not have documented policies and procedures that required newly hired employees to
complete cybersecurity awareness training within 30 days of their orientation or that required existing
employees to complete annual refresher cybersecurity awareness training.
c. The Massachusetts State College Building Authority was missing
documentation for a completed background check.
One (7%) out of 15 system users was missing documentation confirming that MSCBA had completed
a required background check on them before they gained access to MSCBA’s accounting and project
management system.
Without proper screening, MSCBA assumes a higher-than-acceptable risk of hiring individuals who
may pose security threats to its systems and data.
Authoritative Guidance
According to Section C of MSCBA’s Employee Handbook, “The Authority will complete background
checks for criminal records and social security verification for existing employees every five years and
for new employees within 90 days of their start date.”
Reason for Issue
According to MSCBA officials, the one employee in our sample who was missing documentation for a
completed background check was a post-retiree state employee who was returning to work part-time,
and the background check was not performed.
d. The Massachusetts State College Building Authority did not promptly
revoke access rights to its accounting and project management system.
MSCBA did not promptly revoke access rights to its accounting and project management system for
the one former user whose employment ended during the audit period.
22
Audit No. 2025-0209-3A Massachusetts State College Building Authority
Detailed Audit Findings with Auditee’s Response
If MSCBA does not promptly revoke former employees’ access rights to its system, then there is an
increased risk that former employees could improperly access and/or change information in the
system.
Authoritative Guidance
According to Section 6 of EOTSS’s Access Management Standard IS.003,

Section 44:
6.1.8.3 If the termination date of a user is known in advance, the respective access
privileges—specifically those with access to confidential information—will be
configured to terminate automatically.

Section 45:
6.1.8.3.1. If not, access must be manually removed within 24 business hours.
Although MSCBA is not required to follow this standard, since it is not a Commonwealth agency within
the executive branch and is instead categorized as a quasi-governmental agency, EOTSS still
recommends that non-executive branch state agencies follow these standards. We also consider them
best practices.
Reason for Issue
According to MSCBA officials, the terminated employee whose access was not revoked was on a six-
month leave of absence before their employment was terminated.
e. The Massachusetts State College Building Authority did not have session
lock mechanisms in place.
MSCBA did not implement session lock mechanisms on its network or within its accounting and
project management system. For instance, there was no established protocol for defining a specific
duration of user inactivity that would trigger an automatic session lock.
If MSCBA does not have session lock mechanisms in place, then employees may remain logged on
indefinitely, increasing the risk of unauthorized access and reducing the organization’s ability to
effectively monitor and control system activity.
Authoritative Guidance
According to Section 6 of EOTSS’s Access Management Standard IS.003,

Section 46:
6.3.6 An automatic screen saver lock will be configured to become active no more than
five (5) minutes after inactivity for workstations used by personnel with access to
any Commonwealth network and information system.

Section 47:
6.3.6.1 Put devices into sleep or locked mode any time they are not in active use.
Although MSCBA is not required to follow this standard, since it is not a Commonwealth agency within
the executive branch and is instead categorized as a quasi-governmental agency, EOTSS still
recommends that non-executive branch state agencies follow these standards. We also consider them
best practices.
Reason for Issue
MSCBA officials could not explain why they do not have a policy for session timeouts for its network
or accounting and project management system.
f. The Massachusetts State College Building Authority did not have a
documented configuration management policy.
MSCBA did not have a documented configuration management policy for its accounting and project
management system to address how changes are processed before they are implemented. The
configuration policy should include a testing plan, results of the testing plan, and the process to
approve the changes to MSCBA’s accounting and project management system. Configuration
management ensures that system settings, updates, and security patches are consistently applied.
Without a configuration management policy, MSCBA makes its accounting and project management
system vulnerable to misconfigurations, security threats, and performance issues.
Authoritative Guidance
According to Section 6 of EOTSS’s Operations Management Standard IS.012,

Section 48:
6.3 Commonwealth Agencies and Offices must establish controls to maintain the integrity
of information systems, including: . . .

Section 49:
6.3.3. Create, maintain, and update standard operating procedures . . . for the secure
configuration of information systems. Assess compliance with configuration
requirements at least annually.
Although MSCBA is not required to follow this standard, since it is not a Commonwealth agency within
the executive branch and is instead categorized as a quasi-governmental agency, EOTSS still
24
Audit No. 2025-0209-3A Massachusetts State College Building Authority

recommends that non-executive branch state agencies follow these standards. We also consider them
best practices.
Reason for Issue
MSCBA officials could not explain why MSCBA does not have established controls to ensure that
procedures are in place to safeguard its accounting and project management system.
g. The Massachusetts State College Building Authority did not have
established procedures to review audit logs.
MSCBA did not establish procedures to conduct regular reviews of audit logs for its accounting and
project management system. Our testing found that user activity logs were not reviewed periodically
but rather only when issues emerged, which limits the organization’s ability to detect unauthorized
access or suspicious activity.
If MSCBA does not run regular audit logs of its accounting and project management system, then it
exposes itself to a higher-than-acceptable risk of unauthorized user activity. It also exposes itself to a
higher-than-acceptable risk that security incidents and policy violations go undetected by MSCBA
management.
Authoritative Guidance
According to Section 6 of EOTSS’s Logging and Event Monitoring IS.011,

Section 50:
6.1.6 Log review and reporting
Commonwealth Agencies and Offices must ensure that logs are periodically
reviewed by personnel from the Enterprise Security Office (or personnel with a
security role in the agency) to detect anomalous events and apply resolution in
a timely manner.
Although MSCBA is not required to follow this standard, since it is not a Commonwealth agency within
the executive branch and is instead categorized as a quasi-governmental agency, EOTSS still
recommends that non-executive branch state agencies follow these standards. We also consider them
best practices.
Reason for Issue
MSCBA does not have a written policy to ensure that logs are run on a regular basis to track user activity.
25
Audit No. 2025-0209-3A Massachusetts State College Building Authority
Detailed Audit Findings with Auditee’s Response
Recommendations
MSCBA should ensure that documented records are kept to evidence supervisory approval for system
user rights for its accounting and project management system.
MSCBA should develop and implement policies and procedures to ensure that all employees receive
cybersecurity awareness training within 30 days of orientation and annually thereafter. Also, MSCBA
should maintain certificates of completion of these trainings for all of its employees.
MSCBA should ensure that all employees with access to confidential information undergo background
checks, as required by its policy. MSCBA should maintain documentation of these screenings to ensure
accountability and compliance.
MSCBA should ensure that system privileges are revoked within 24 business hours of termination.
Additionally, MSCBA should consider temporarily suspending employees’ privileges when they are on
leaves of absence.
MSCBA should configure both its network and its accounting and project management system to lock
out after a five-minute period of inactivity.
MSCBA should establish controls to ensure that configuration management procedures are in place
to safeguard its accounting and project management system.
MSCBA should ensure that audit logs are run for its accounting and project management system on a
regular basis, so that system user activity is tracked.
Auditee’s Response

Section 51:
1. Supervisory review / approval of user access—The Authority, through its [information
technology (IT)] vendor, currently utilizes forms to establish and terminate user access for its
network. Separately, there is a process in place for establishing new employees’ access to . . .
the Authority’s accounting and project management software, however, because network access
is required to access [this software], there is a secondary level of control. The Authority
acknowledges that it can improve the documentation of this portion of the process and is
currently investigating and discussing further enhancements to the Authority’s existing processes.

Section 52:
2. Cybersecurity Training—Since 2021, the Authority has provided cybersecurity awareness
training annually for its employees. These trainings were conducted by the Authority’s IT
Network Service Provider . . . at an annual “All Staff” meeting. Consistent [with the Office of
the State Auditor’s (OSA’s)] review, the Authority has adopted a more structured and
documented approach. Since the informal exit conference with the OSA, the Authority has
retrained all staff via its provider’s Learning Management System and has current certificates
of completion. Existing employees will continue to complete such training annually and new
staff members will be required to complete such training within 30 days of hire.

Section 53:
3. Employee Background Checks—The Authority’s policy is to ensure that all employees
undergo appropriate background checks during the hiring process. The omission of a singular
employee was in error.
26
Audit No. 2025-0209-3A Massachusetts State College Building Authority
Detailed Audit Findings with Auditee’s Response

Section 54:
4. Employee Access Changes upon Leave or Termination—The Authority regards access to
the network and its security as a critical component to minimizing risk and routinely ensures
that system privileges are revoked within 1 business day of an employee’s leave or termination.
Moving forward, the Authority will make operational changes to ensure timely revocation of
access for separated employees.

Section 55:
5. Inactivity Lockout—Since the OSA informal exit conference, based on the recommendation
of its IT network service provider . . . the Authority has implemented a procedure by which
automatic lockout is initiated after 15 minutes of inactivity. The 15-minute lockout standard is
based upon the nationally recognized NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology)
recommendation.

Section 56:
6. Network Access / Configuration & Accounting / Project Management . . .
Configuration—The Authority will work with its IT consultants and vendors to develop an IT
Configuration Management Plan.

Section 57:
7. Audit Logs for the Accounting / Project Management . . . system—As previously noted,
the Authority considers system access a critical component to minimizing risk and will
investigate what reports, logs, and / or other tools are available to provide additional review
capabilities of user activity to enhance internal controls.
Auditor’s Reply
Based on its response, MSCBA is taking measures to address our concerns regarding this matter. As part
of our post-audit review process, we will follow up on this matter in approximately six months.

Executive Summary
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
In accordance with Section 12 of Chapter 11 of the Massachusetts General Laws, the Office of the State
Auditor (OSA) has conducted a performance audit of the Massachusetts State College Building Authority
(MSCBA) for the period July 1, 2022 through June 30, 2024.
The purpose of our audit was to determine the following:
• whether MSCBA had a process in place to ensure that it met the fiscal years 2023 and 2024
benchmarks set by the Supplier Diversity Office (SDO) for contracting with minority-, women-, and
veteran-owned businesses;
• to what extent MSCBA ensured that its residential buildings on university campuses met the
minimum public health and safety requirements, in accordance with Section 101.3 of Title 780 of
the Code of Massachusetts Regulations and MSCBA’s established procedures for monitoring its
properties;
• whether MSCBA took corrective actions to address the issue identified in the prior OSA audit
(Audit No. 2018-0209-3A) regarding its business continuity plan (BCP); and
• whether MSCBA took corrective actions to address the issue identified in the prior OSA audit
(Audit No. 2018-0209-3A) regarding its internal control plan (ICP).
Below is a summary of our findings, the effects of those findings, and our recommendations, with
hyperlinks to each page listed.
Finding 1 MSCBA did not ensure that it met the annual benchmarks for diverse supplier spending set
Page 14 by SDO.
Effect MSCBA has demonstrated a commitment to promoting diversity in its procurement process
by voluntarily participating in the Supplier Diversity Program (SDP). However, because
MSCBA did not have an established process for meeting these spending benchmarks,
MSCBA limited its ability to evaluate and improve the effectiveness of its efforts to promote
diversity in its procurement process.
Recommendations 1. MSCBA should develop, document, and implement policies and procedures to
Pages 15 effectively monitor the extent to which it achieves SDO annual benchmarks for diverse
supplier spending. These policies should incorporate the updated requirements of the
SDP, which, effective July 1, 2024, include spending benchmarks for businesses owned
by LGBTQ individuals and individuals with disabilities.
2. MSCBA should develop strategies aimed at enhancing the participation of diverse
businesses in its procurement process. This could include expanding targeted outreach
to certified diverse vendors to increase their participation as both prime contractors
and subcontractors.
Finding 2 MSCBA’s BCP was missing critical components.
Page 16
1

Audit No. 2025-0209-3A Massachusetts State College Building Authority
Executive Summary
Effect Without a comprehensive BCP, MSCBA cannot ensure that it has adequate procedures in
place to protect critical information assets or to recover essential operations in the event
of a disruption or disaster.
Recommendation MSCBA should update its BCP to include all critical components outlined by the Executive
Page 17 Office of Technology Services and Security.
Finding 3 MSCBA’s ICP was not based on an agency-wide risk assessment and was missing key
Page 18 elements of enterprise risk management.
Effect Without a sufficiently developed ICP based on an agency-wide risk assessment, MSCBA is
limited in its ability to identify vulnerabilities, which could prevent it from achieving
organizational goals.
Recommendations 1. MSCBA should develop an ICP based on a current agency-wide risk assessment that
Page 19 includes all aspects of its business activities. MSCBA should ensure that its ICP includes
all the critical components of enterprise risk management.
2. After completing its ICP, MSCBA should ensure that the ICP is communicated to all
employees, used within its operations, and reviewed and updated at least annually.
Finding 4a MSCBA did not adequately manage employee access rights.
Page 20
Effect Without management approval, MSCBA does not have sufficient verification that system
users were approved to access the system at all or that user accounts were limited to the
fewest privileges necessary for the employees’ job duties.
Finding 4b MSCBA could not provide evidence that its employees completed cybersecurity awareness
Page 21 training.
Effect If MSCBA does not ensure that its employees complete cybersecurity awareness training,
then it is exposed to an increased risk of cyberattacks and financial and/or reputational
losses.
Finding 4c MSCBA was missing documentation for a completed background check.
Page 22
Effect Without proper screening, MSCBA assumes a higher-than-acceptable risk of hiring
individuals who may pose security threats to its systems and data.
Finding 4d MSCBA did not promptly revoke access rights to its accounting and project management
Page 22 system.
Effect If MSCBA does not promptly revoke former employees’ access rights to its system, then
there is an increased risk that former employees could improperly access and/or change
information in the system.
Finding 4e MSCBA did not have session lock mechanisms in place.
Page 23
Effect If MSCBA does not have session lock mechanisms in place, then employees may remain
logged on indefinitely, increasing the risk of unauthorized access and reducing the
organization’s ability to effectively monitor and control system activity.
Finding 4f MSCBA did not have a documented configuration management policy.
Page 24
2

Audit No. 2025-0209-3A Massachusetts State College Building Authority
Executive Summary
Effect Without a configuration management policy, MSCBA makes its accounting and project
management system vulnerable to misconfigurations, security threats, and performance
issues.
Finding 4g MSCBA did not have established procedures to review audit logs.
Page 25
Effect If MSCBA does not run regular audit logs of its accounting and project management system,
then it exposes itself to a higher-than-acceptable risk of unauthorized user activity. It also
exposes itself to a higher-than-acceptable risk that security incidents and policy violations
go undetected by MSCBA management.
Recommendations 1. MSCBA should ensure that documented records are kept to evidence supervisory
Page 26 approval for system user rights for its accounting and project management system.
2. MSCBA should develop and implement policies and procedures to ensure that all
employees receive cybersecurity awareness training within 30 days of orientation and
annually thereafter. Also, MSCBA should maintain certificates of completion of these
trainings for all of its employees.
3. MSCBA should ensure that all employees with access to confidential information
undergo background checks, as required by its policy. MSCBA should maintain
documentation of these screenings to ensure accountability and compliance.
4. MSCBA should ensure that system privileges are revoked within 24 business hours of
termination. Additionally, MSCBA should consider temporarily suspending employees’
privileges when they are on leaves of absence.
5. MSCBA should configure both its network and its accounting and project management
system to lock out after a five-minute period of inactivity.
6. MSCBA should establish controls to ensure that configuration management
procedures are in place to safeguard its accounting and project management system.
7. MSCBA should ensure that audit logs are run for its accounting and project
management system on a regular basis, so that system user activity is tracked.

Overview of Audited Entity
OVERVIEW OF AUDITED ENTITY
The Massachusetts State College Building Authority (MSCBA) was established under Chapter 703 of the
Acts of 1963. MSCBA is authorized to finance and oversee the design and construction of housing, dining,
athletic, parking, and other student activity facilities at the 15 community colleges1 and nine state
universities.2 This financing and oversight authority, which is established by its enabling legislation, is
subject to written approval from the Secretary of Administration and Finance and the Commissioner of
Higher Education for Massachusetts. MSCBA is also authorized to issue bonds and collect student rents
and fees for the operation of student living facilities.
MSCBA oversees residence halls that house approximately 16,500 students across 54 residential
complexes. These facilities accommodate about 50% of the total undergraduate student population in
Massachusetts state colleges and universities and span approximately 4.5 million square feet across the
nine state university campuses (as shown below). There are no residence halls located on community
college campuses.

withFinancialStatements.pdf)
1. The community colleges are Berkshire, Bristol, Bunker Hill, Cape Cod, Greenfield, Holyoke, Massachusetts Bay, Massasoit,
Middlesex, Mount Wachusett, North Shore, Northern Essex, Quinsigamond, Roxbury, and Springfield Technical.
2. The state universities are Bridgewater, Fitchburg, Framingham, Salem, Westfield, and Worcester, as well as the
Massachusetts College of Art and Design, the Massachusetts College of Liberal Arts, and the Massachusetts Maritime
Academy.
4

Audit No. 2025-0209-3A Massachusetts State College Building Authority
Overview of Audited Entity
MSCBA is governed by a nine-member board, the members of which are appointed by the Governor.
Three members of the board must also be members of the state’s Board of Higher Education. It is also
governed by various state procurement laws and regulations; the trust agreements for all bonds that
MSCBA issues; and the Contract for Financial Assistance, Management and Services between MSCBA and
the Board of Higher Education, which acts on behalf of the community colleges and universities served by
MSCBA. Further, the Secretary of Administration and Finance and the State Treasurer and Receiver
General must approve the sale of all bonds and notes issued by MSCBA to fund its projects. MSCBA’s
board appoints an executive director who is responsible for overseeing the day-to-day operations of
MSCBA.
The Commonwealth does not appropriate any state funding for MSCBA, nor does it guarantee the bonds
issued by MSCBA for its building projects. Instead, all revenue used to support the design, construction,
and operation of MSCBA facilities is generated through rents and fees paid by students for the use of
these facilities and related services. According to the MSCBA fiscal year 2023 audit report that was
completed by an independent auditor, MSCBA’s principal amount of outstanding bond debt, as of June
30, 2023, was $1.135 billion. For the fiscal year that ended June 30, 2023, MSCBA spent $30,323,667 on
land, construction, buildings, improvements, furnishings, and equipment for MSCBA capital assets at
community colleges and universities.
MSCBA is located at 10 High Street in Boston and had 14 employees as of June 30, 2024.
Supplier Diversity Program
MSCBA voluntarily participates in the Supplier Diversity Office’s (SDO’s) Supplier Diversity Program (SDP).
According to the Supplier Diversity Office Comprehensive Annual Report Fiscal Year 2023, “the role of the
SDO is to certify, provide resources for, and support a wide range of diverse and small businesses in
competing for contracts being bid across the Commonwealth.”
Through consultation with the Office for Access and Opportunity and Community Affairs, which falls under
the Office of the Governor, SDO sets annual benchmark percentages for spending by SDP participants with
5

Audit No. 2025-0209-3A Massachusetts State College Building Authority
Overview of Audited Entity
minority-owned,3 woman-owned, and veteran-owned businesses.4 The annual spending benchmarks are
expressed as a percentage of the discretionary budget for each participating state agency.
For fiscal years 2023 and 2024, SDO set the spending benchmarks5 outlined in the table below.
Business Certification Category Spending Benchmark
(Percentage of State Agency’s Discretionary Budget)
Minority-Owned Business 8%
Women-Owned Business 14%
Veteran-Owned Business 3%
During the audit, MSCBA officials told us that they determine discretionary spending by identifying
expenditures linked to specific job codes within various projects. This includes costs for building
construction such as materials, labor, and permits; design services, which cover architectural and interior
design; and project management, which involves coordinating budgets, schedules, and resources to
ensure the successful completion of projects.
MSCBA voluntarily submits a narrative describing its efforts to meet the spending benchmarks and to
advance diversity and inclusion in its procurement, which SDO includes as part of its annual report.
According to the Supplier Diversity Office Comprehensive Annual Report Fiscal Year 2023,
[MSCBA] is committed to fostering, cultivating, and preserving a culture of diversity, equity, and
inclusion. [MSCBA] partners with the Commonwealth’s Supplier Diversity Office, other state
entities, and industry associations to strengthen the diverse workforce within the Commonwealth.
In addition to adopting the Commonwealth’s diversity goals for hiring design and construction
firms, the MSCBA continues to reach out to the subcontractor community by engaging Minority
Business Enterprises, Women Owned Business Enterprises, and Veteran-Owned Business
Enterprises in a web-based trade contractor prequalification process where they are awarded
additional credit toward becoming prequalified to bid on MSCBA projects.
3. According to the Supplier Diversity Office Comprehensive Annual Report Fiscal Year 2023, SDO defines a minority-owned
business “as a business that is owned by a racially or ethnically diverse individual. While the [term is] meant to define an
ethnically or racially diverse individual or business . . . [it is] not meant to denote a smaller or lesser status of the individuals
or businesses included in this definition.” We use this terminology here because it is a defined term used by the auditee.
4. The percentage for veteran-owned businesses combines the requirement for veteran- and service-disabled veteran–owned
businesses. For more information about veteran- and service-disabled veteran–owned businesses, see SDO’s Comprehensive
Annual Report for Fiscal Year 2023.
5. Effective July 1, 2024, spending benchmarks for businesses owned by LGBTQ individuals and individuals with disabilities were
incorporated into the Commonwealth’s Supplier Diversity Program. This change occurred outside of the audit period and was
therefore not included in the scope of our audit.

Audit No. 2025-0209-3A Massachusetts State College Building Authority
Overview of Audited Entity
Building Safety
Staff members of community colleges and universities manage the day-to-day operations of buildings
owned by MSCBA. According to the Contract for Financial Assistance, Management and Services, dated
February 1, 2003, between MSCBA and the Board of Higher Education, each community college and
university is required to operate and maintain the buildings located on its campus and to keep them in
good order and repair. Universities collect rents and fees from students for the use of the buildings;
procure all necessary equipment, materials, and supplies for upkeeping buildings; and make necessary
repairs—all of which are similar to the responsibilities that a property manager has. As the legal owner of
the properties, MSCBA remains accountable for the overall condition of the properties and provides the
financing for upkeep and repairs.
MSCBA assigns a project manager to each campus to help oversee building maintenance. These project
managers stay in contact with campus facilities staff members and keep track of any deferred
maintenance needs. Project managers meet with campus facility staff members regularly to identify any
issues, needed repairs, or renovation requests.
MSCBA has a number of requirements to which community colleges and universities must adhere. For
example, each year, MSCBA requires community colleges and universities to confirm that they have active
service contracts for key systems in MSCBA-owned buildings on their campuses, such as boilers, elevators,
fire escapes, fire alarms, fire suppression systems, and generators. In order to confirm that they hold these
active contracts, community colleges and universities submit copies of the contract tracking sheets to
MSCBA. Universities must also certify that the annual Certificates of Occupancy are on file for residential
buildings. Additionally, community colleges and universities must notify MSCBA of any deficiencies or
violations that need to be addressed as soon as they are identified—for example, sprinkler systems that
need to be updated or issues identified during building system maintenance inspections. Community
colleges and universities submit this information via email using a Service Contract Tracking Sheet
provided by MSCBA.
Business Continuity and Internal Control Plans
During our prior audit (Audit No. 2018-0209-3A), we found that MSCBA had not developed an effective
business continuity plan (BCP) or conducted testing of its disaster recovery plan in accordance with the
Executive Office of Technology Services and Security’s (EOTSS’s) Business Continuity and Disaster
7

Audit No. 2025-0209-3A Massachusetts State College Building Authority
Overview of Audited Entity
Recovery Standard IS.005.6 This standard required that Commonwealth agencies have a plan to keep
essential business functions running, especially during disruptions. The BCP should focus on the most
likely and most impactful risks to information security, identify key functions, and include ways to keep
those functions going if systems or environments fail. Additionally, the BCP must be tested every year to
check for any overlooked issues or necessary updates, including changes to equipment or staff members.
Although MSCBA is not required to follow these standards, since it is not a Commonwealth agency within
the executive branch and is instead categorized as a quasi-governmental agency, EOTSS still recommends
that non-executive branch state agencies follow these standards. We also consider them best practices.
Additionally, during our prior audit (Audit No. 2018-0209-3A), we found that MSCBA’s system of internal
controls needed improvement. Specifically, we found that MSCBA had not developed an internal control
plan (ICP) that clearly summarized (1) all of the risks that could potentially prevent it from achieving its
financial, operational, and compliance goals and (2) the internal controls that MSCBA had in place to
mitigate these risks. While our report acknowledged that MSCBA had documented policies and
procedures, primarily related to its financial operations, these controls were limited to specific areas and
did not form a comprehensive ICP. In our prior audit, we recommended that MSCBA conduct an agency-
wide risk assessment and develop internal controls to mitigate identified risks and achieve organizational
goals.
While there are no specific legal or regulatory requirements related to MSCBA’s system of internal
controls, Chapter 647 of the Acts of 1989 requires state agencies to develop and clearly document internal
control systems in accordance with the guidelines established by the Office of the Comptroller of the
Commonwealth (CTR). These guidelines require that an ICP be based on an agency-wide risk assessment
and be revised annually. Although MSCBA is not required to follow these standards, since it is not a
Commonwealth agency within the executive branch and is instead categorized as a quasi-governmental
agency, we consider them best practices.
6. EOTSS has since changed the titles and numbers of at least some of its policies and standards between the end of the audit
period and the publication of this report. In this report, we reference the titles and numbers of EOTSS’s policies and/or
standards as they were during the audit period (unless stated otherwise).

Audit No. 2025-0209-3A Massachusetts State College Building Authority
Audit Objectives, Scope, and Methodology
AUDIT OBJECTIVES, SCOPE, AND METHODOLOGY
In accordance with Section 12 of Chapter 11 of the Massachusetts General Laws, the Office of the State
Auditor (OSA) has conducted a performance audit of certain activities of the Massachusetts State College
Building Authority (MSCBA) for the period July 1, 2022 through June 30, 2024.
We conducted this performance audit in accordance with generally accepted government auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate
evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We
believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on
our audit objectives.
Below is a list of our audit objectives, indicating each question we intended our audit to answer; the
conclusion we reached regarding each objective; and, if applicable, where each objective is discussed in
the audit findings.
Objective Conclusion
1. Did MSCBA have a process in place to ensure that it met the fiscal year 2023 and 2024 No; see Finding 1
benchmarks set by the Supplier Diversity Office (SDO) for contracting with minority-,
women-, and veteran-owned businesses?
2. To what extent did MSCBA ensure that its residential buildings on university campuses To a satisfactory
met the minimum public health and safety requirements, in accordance with Section extent
101.3 of Title 780 of the Code of Massachusetts Regulations (CMR) and MSCBA’s
established procedures for monitoring its properties?
3. Did MSCBA take corrective actions to address the issue identified in the prior OSA audit Partially; see
(Audit No. 2018-0209-3A) regarding its business continuity plan (BCP)? Finding 2
4. Did MSCBA take corrective actions to address the issue identified in the prior OSA audit Partially; see
(Audit No. 2018-0209-3A) regarding its internal control plan (ICP)? Finding 3
To accomplish our audit objectives, we gained an understanding of the aspects of MSCBA’s internal
control environment relevant to our objectives by reviewing applicable policies and procedures, reviewing
relevant contracts, and interviewing officials at MSCBA and two state universities. We evaluated the
design and implementation of the internal controls related to our audit objectives. We also tested the
operating effectiveness of controls related to the verification of service contracts for key safety systems
in MSCBA-owned buildings. In addition, to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to address our audit
objectives, we performed the procedures described below.
9

Audit No. 2025-0209-3A Massachusetts State College Building Authority
Audit Objectives, Scope, and Methodology
Supplier Diversity Program
To determine whether MSCBA had a process in place to ensure that it met the fiscal year 2023 and 2024
benchmarks set by SDO for contracting with minority-, women-, and veteran-owned businesses, we took
the following actions. First, we obtained a list of all 3,947 expenses, totaling $104,299,510, recorded by
MSCBA during the audit period in its accounting and project management system. From this data, we
identified MSCBA’s discretionary spending for fiscal years 2023 and 2024 as $43,968,982 and $41,582,622,
respectively, totaling 2,752 transactions. We then determined how much of the identified discretionary
spending was directed to certified minority-, women-, and veteran-owned businesses. To do this, we
cross-referenced the vendors in the discretionary spending dataset with SDO’s directory of certified
businesses. We calculated the total dollar amount and the percentage of discretionary spending awarded
to diverse vendors during the audit period and compared it to the applicable SDO benchmarks for fiscal
years 2023 and 2024.
Based on the results of our testing, we determined that MSCBA did not have a process in place to ensure
that it met the benchmarks set by SDO for contracting with minority-, women-, and veteran-owned
businesses during the audit period. Also, although MSCBA met the SDO benchmark for contracting with
veteran-owned businesses, it did not meet the spending benchmarks for minority- and women-owned
businesses. See Finding 1 for more information.
Residential Building Safety
To determine to what extent MSCBA ensured that its residential buildings on university campuses met
the minimum public health and safety requirements, in accordance with 780 CMR 101.3 and MSCBA’s
established procedures for monitoring its properties, we took the actions described below.
We selected a random, nonstatistical7 sample of 20 MSCBA-owned residential properties from a
population of 54 for our testing. For each property in our sample, we verified that the respective state
university submitted the required Service Contract Tracking Sheet to MSCBA. We reviewed the tracking
sheets submitted by the university facilities staff members to ensure that they were fully completed and
that they provided vendor information for all applicable building systems. We requested executed vendor
agreements and Certificates of Occupancy for each property and the service contracts listed on the
7. Auditors use nonstatistical sampling to select items for audit testing when a population is very small, the population items
are not similar enough, or there are specific items in the population that the auditors want to review.
10

Audit No. 2025-0209-3A Massachusetts State College Building Authority
Audit Objectives, Scope, and Methodology
tracking sheets in our sample. We examined each contract to ensure that it corresponded with the correct
property and vendor listed on the tracking sheet, and we ensured that the contract dates were active
during the audit period. In addition, we confirmed that the sampled universities maintained a valid
Certificate of Occupancy on file for each property.
We did not identify any exceptions in our testing. Therefore, we concluded that, during the audit period,
MSCBA ensured that its residential buildings on university campuses met the minimum public health and
safety requirements, in accordance with 780 CMR 101.3 and MSCBA’s established procedures for
monitoring its properties.
BCP
During our prior audit (Audit No. 2018-0209-3A), we found that MSCBA had not developed an effective
BCP or conducted testing of its disaster recovery plan in accordance with the Executive Office of
Technology Services and Security’s (EOTSS’s) Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery Standard IS.005.
To determine whether MSCBA took corrective actions to address the issue identified in our prior audit
(Audit No. 2018-0209-3A) regarding its BCP, we interviewed knowledgeable MSCBA staff members and
inspected MSCBA’s BCP to confirm that a plan was in place during this report’s audit period and that it
complied with EOTSS’s Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery Standard IS.005. Additionally, we
reviewed documented test results to determine whether MSCBA’s disaster recovery plan was tested
annually during the audit period.
Based on the results of our testing, we determined that MSCBA’s BCP did not include all required
elements. See Finding 2 for more information.
ICP
During our prior audit (Audit No. 2018-0209-3A), we found that MSCBA had not developed an ICP that
clearly summarized all of MSCBA’s risks and the internal controls that it had in place to mitigate them. To
determine whether MSCBA took corrective actions to address the issue identified in our prior audit (Audit
No. 2018-0209-3A) regarding its ICP, we interviewed knowledgeable MSCBA staff members and inspected
the agency’s ICP that was in effect during this report’s audit period to determine whether it had been
updated to include an agency-wide risk assessment, as recommended in our prior audit. Additionally, we
examined the ICP to assess whether it complied with the Office of the Comptroller of the Commonwealth’s
11

Audit No. 2025-0209-3A Massachusetts State College Building Authority
Audit Objectives, Scope, and Methodology
(CTR’s) guidelines, which require inclusion of the eight components of the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission’s enterprise risk management framework.
Based on the results of our testing, we determined that MSCBA’s ICP does not meet all of the
requirements of CTR’s guidelines. See Finding 3 for more information.
We used nonstatistical sampling methods for testing and therefore did not project the results of our
testing to any population.
Data Reliability Assessment
To determine the reliability of the list of expenses that we obtained from MSCBA’s accounting and project
management system, we conducted interviews and system walkthroughs with MSCBA management and
staff members who were knowledgeable about and responsible for overseeing the data. We also checked
the list to ensure that there were no duplicates or missing data, and that all of the data corresponded to
dates within the audit period. To confirm the completeness of the list of expenses, we selected a random
sample of 20 purchase orders we inspected from MSCBA’s physical files and traced vendor names,
purchase order numbers, and payment amounts to the list of expenses we received. To confirm the
accuracy of the list of expenses, we selected a random sample of 20 expenses from the list and traced
vendor names, payment dates, and payment amounts to invoices that we inspected from MSCBA’s
records.
We also reviewed select system controls related to security management, access controls, configuration
management, segregation of duties, and contingency planning. Through this testing, we found that
MSCBA has not established adequate internal controls over its accounting system. See Finding 4 for more
information regarding the results of our review of the information system controls.
Further, we conducted a Benford’s Law test8 on the list of overall expenses to detect any indication of
fraud or tampering with general ledger expenses that would compromise data integrity, and we found no
indication of such activity.
8. Benford’s Law is a statistical principle that predicts how often each digit (one through nine) appears as the leading digit in
naturally occurring numerical data. Significant deviations from this distribution may indicate irregularities or potential
manipulation and can be used as a tool for data analysis in audits.

Audit No. 2025-0209-3A Massachusetts State College Building Authority
Audit Objectives, Scope, and Methodology
To determine the reliability of the list of properties owned by MSCBA that was provided to us, we
interviewed MSCBA officials who were knowledgeable about the list. We checked the list for blank and
duplicate records. We also confirmed that final construction dates for all listed properties occurred before
the start of the audit period. Additionally, we verified the list of properties against community college and
university records and MSCBA contracts. Finally, we reconciled the list of residential properties with
MSCBA’s Annual Report Fiscal Year 2023.
Based on the results of the data reliability assessment procedures described above, we determined that
the information we obtained was sufficiently reliable for the purposes of our audit.

Detailed Audit Findings with Auditee’s Response
DETAILED AUDIT FINDINGS WITH AUDITEE’S RESPONSE
1. The Massachusetts State College Building Authority did not ensure that it
met the annual benchmarks for diverse supplier spending set by the
Supplier Diversity Office.
The Massachusetts State College Building Authority (MSCBA) did not have processes to ensure that it met
the annual benchmarks for diverse supplier spending set by the Supplier Diversity Office (SDO). During
the audit period, MSCBA did not meet discretionary spending benchmarks for minority-owned and
women-owned businesses.
MSCBA’s spending on minority-owned businesses was only 0.2% in both fiscal years 2023 and 2024, far
below the 8% benchmark. Similarly, spending on women-owned businesses was 1.2% in fiscal year 2023
and 2.1% in fiscal year 2024, well below the 14% benchmark. The table below summarizes MSCBA’s
benchmark attainment during fiscal years 2023 and 2024.
Fiscal Year 2023 Fiscal Year 2024
Total Discretionary Budget $43,968,982 $41,582,622
Minimum Amount MSBCA Needed to Spend to Meet $3,517,519 $3,326,610
the Minority-Owned Business Benchmark (8%)
Amount Spent $89,489 (0.2%) $74,366 (0.2%)
Minimum Amount MSBCA Needed to Spend to Meet $6,155,657 $5,821,567
the Women-Owned Business Benchmark (14%)
Amount Spent $530,638 (1.2%) $890,001 (2.1%)
Minimum Amount MSBCA Needed to Spend to Meet $1,319,069 $1,247,479
the Veteran-Owned Business Benchmark (3%)
Amount Spent $2,813,780 (6.4%) $1,456,939 (3.5%)
MSCBA has demonstrated a commitment to promoting diversity in its procurement process by voluntarily
participating in the Supplier Diversity Program (SDP). However, because MSCBA did not have an
established process for meeting these spending benchmarks, MSCBA limited its ability to evaluate and
improve the effectiveness of its efforts to promote diversity in its procurement process.
14

Audit No. 2025-0209-3A Massachusetts State College Building Authority
Detailed Audit Findings with Auditee’s Response
Authoritative Guidance
SDO’s “The Commonwealth of Massachusetts Diverse and Small Business Program Policies for Goods and
Services Procurements” states,
Annual benchmarks for departmental supplier diversity and small business spending are set by the
SDO and are subject to approval by the Secretary for Administration and Finance and the
Governor’s Office for Access and Engagement. The benchmark spending amounts are based on
applying current benchmark percentages to each department’s discretionary budget and, at the
end of each fiscal year, to its discretionary spending.
Program Certification Type Benchmark Percentage
Minority Business Enterprise (MBE) 8%
Supplier
Woman Business Enterprise (WBE) 14%
Diversity
Program (SDP) Veteran Business, including Veteran Business Enterprise (VBE) and 3%
Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Business Enterprise (SDVOBE)
Reasons for Issue
According to MSCBA officials, MSCBA’s ability to meet SDO’s annual spending benchmarks is constrained
by procurement regulations that require contracts to be awarded to the lowest eligible and responsible
bidder. Specifically, for construction projects, MSCBA must follow the bidding procedures outlined in
Chapter 149 of the Massachusetts General Laws, which mandate contract awards based solely on price.
As a result, even when a certified diverse business submits a bid, MSCBA cannot prioritize that vendor if
a lower bid is received from a nondiverse business.
Recommendations
MSCBA should develop, document, and implement policies and procedures to effectively monitor the
extent to which it achieves SDO annual benchmarks for diverse supplier spending. These policies
should incorporate the updated requirements of the SDP, which, effective July 1, 2024, include
spending benchmarks for businesses owned by LGBTQ individuals and individuals with disabilities.
MSCBA should develop strategies aimed at enhancing the participation of diverse businesses in its
procurement process. This could include expanding targeted outreach to certified diverse vendors to
increase their participation as both prime contractors and subcontractors.
Auditee’s Response
As correctly noted by the [Office of the State Auditor], the Authority is not a Commonwealth agency
within the executive branch and is instead categorized as a quasi-governmental agency and,
therefore, not subject to the SDO annual benchmarks. However, as supporting supplier diversity is
15

Audit No. 2025-0209-3A Massachusetts State College Building Authority
Detailed Audit Findings with Auditee’s Response
important to the Authority’s mission in serving the Commonwealth’s campuses, the Authority has
established a long-standing practice of setting goals for diversity and specifically supporting
diversity of the Commonwealth’s workforce.
Moving forward, the Authority intends to improve its process for monitoring and reporting of direct and
indirect spending on a fiscal year basis; consider amending existing contracts when new diversity
benchmarks are released by the state; expand outreach to diverse vendors in non-construction cost
categories of work; and consider incorporating additional spending benchmarks for businesses owned
by LGBTQ individuals and individuals with disabilities. Lastly, the Authority may establish its own process
for expanding its sources of information in determining the pool of available minority- and women-
owned businesses in accordance with [Section 6(c) of Chapter 7C of the General Laws].
Additionally, the Authority continues to reach out to the subcontractor community by engaging
Minority-, Woman, and Veteran-Owned Business Enterprises in a web-based trade contractor
prequalification process where they are awarded additional credit toward becoming prequalified to
bid on Authority projects. Along with such [minority-owned / women-owned business enterprise]
goals, the Authority has also adopted workforce participation goals to ensure opportunities for
minorities and women to participate in the Authority’s construction projects.
Auditor’s Reply
Based on its response, MSCBA is taking measures to address our concerns regarding this matter. As part
of our post-audit review process, we will follow up on this matter in approximately six months.
2. The Massachusetts State College Building Authority’s business continuity
plan was missing critical components.
In our previous audit (Audit No. 2018-0209-3A), we reported that MSCBA had not developed a business
continuity plan (BCP). During the current audit, we found that MSCBA has since developed a BCP, but it
did not meet the requirements outlined by the Executive Office of Technology Services and Security
(EOTSS). Specifically, MSCBA’s BCP did not have the following critical components:
• a detailed inventory of critical information assets;
• a clear definition of mission-essential functions;
• identification of and management procedures for risks associated with the potential loss or
disruption of essential business processes and information assets;
• an analysis of critical business processes;
• an assessment of likely disruptive events;
• insights from business impact analyses and risk assessments; and
• documentation of an order of succession, delegation of authority, and a list of essential records.
16

Audit No. 2025-0209-3A Massachusetts State College Building Authority
Detailed Audit Findings with Auditee’s Response
Without a comprehensive BCP, MSCBA cannot ensure that it has adequate procedures in place to protect
critical information assets or to recover essential operations in the event of a disruption or disaster.
Authoritative Guidance
According to Section 6.1 of EOTSS’s Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery Standard IS.005,
Commonwealth Agencies and Offices must establish a Business Continuity Program
6.1.1.2 Perform a risk assessment of critical information assets: Establish controls to
identify, contain and mitigate the risks associated with the loss or disruption of
critical business processes and information assets. . . .
6.1.1.4 Develop business continuity plans (BCP): Commonwealth Agencies and Offices
will develop BCPs for critical business processes based on prioritization of likely
disruptive events in light of their probability, severity and consequences for
information security identified through the [business impact analysis] and
risk assessment processes. . . .
6.1.1.4.3 BCPs must be updated whenever a major organizational change occurs or
at least annually, whichever comes first. . . .
6.1.1.4.4.1 Identify essential mission and business functions and a plan for
maintaining these functions in the event of system or environment
compromise, disruption, or failure. . . .
6.1.1.4.6.1 Perform annual tests of the BCPs to identify incorrect assumptions,
oversights, and account for updates to equipment or personnel
changes. Test results will be reported to senior management, the
Commonwealth [chief information security officer], or his or
her designee, and the Security Office.
Although MSCBA is not required to follow this standard, since it is not a Commonwealth agency within
the executive branch and is instead categorized as a quasi-governmental agency, EOTSS still recommends
that non-executive branch state agencies follow these standards. We also consider them best practices.
Reasons for Issue
MSCBA officials stated that they were in the process of developing the BCP when the COVID-19 pandemic
began. The unexpected pandemic required the agency to shift its focus, delaying completion of its BCP.
Recommendation
MSCBA should update its BCP to include all critical components outlined by EOTSS.
17

Audit No. 2025-0209-3A Massachusetts State College Building Authority
Detailed Audit Findings with Auditee’s Response
Auditee’s Response
The Authority has made significant progress on the development of a BCP since the [Office of the
State Auditor’s (OSA’s)] 2018 audit (Audit No. 2018-0209-3A). Many of the elements of business
continuity that relate to technology cited in OSA’s 2018 report have been rectified. For example,
the Authority completes an annual disaster recovery drill, performed by its external [information
technology) network support provider. As noted in the OSA’s 2018 report and during discussions
regarding the OSA’s 2024 audit of the Authority, these disaster recovery drills are performed
annually to ensure that all information assets are safeguarded and recoverable should a disruption
to access occur. These annual drills have successfully recovered all Authority information assets
for seven (7) consecutive years since 2018. Moreover, the Authority is committed to continuing to
develop and refine the BCP so that it is continually focused on improving the Authority’s response
in the event of a disruption or disaster.
Auditor’s Reply
We acknowledge MSCBA’s efforts in developing a BCP since our prior audit and commend its consistent
annual testing of its disaster recovery plan. However, as noted above, MSCBA’s BCP remains incomplete
and does not fully align with the requirements established by EOTSS. While disaster recovery is a key
element of business continuity, a comprehensive BCP must also address organizational mission-essential
functions, risk management procedures, business impact analysis, and succession planning—among other
critical areas—which we found are still lacking in the current plan.
We encourage MSCBA to fully implement our recommendation and expand the scope of its BCP to ensure
compliance with EOTSS standards, strengthening its ability to withstand and recover from operational
disruptions.
3. The Massachusetts State College Building Authority’s internal control plan
was not based on an agency-wide risk assessment and was missing key
elements of enterprise risk management.
In our previous audit (Audit No. 2018-0209-3A), we found that MSCBA had not developed a
comprehensive internal control plan (ICP) that identified all agency risks and related controls. While some
policies and procedures were documented, they primarily addressed financial operations and therefore
did not constitute a comprehensive ICP.
In the current audit, we again identified deficiencies in MSCBA’s ICP. Specifically, the ICP was not based
on an agency-wide risk assessment, which is a critical element for identifying and addressing potential
risks across all aspects of MSCBA’s business operations. Similarly to what we found in our prior audit, the
18

Audit No. 2025-0209-3A Massachusetts State College Building Authority
Detailed Audit Findings with Auditee’s Response
ICP remained focused primarily on financial and accounting functions. Additionally, MSCBA’s ICP did not
incorporate all critical components of enterprise risk management as outlined by the Office of the
Comptroller of the Commonwealth’s (CTR) Internal Control Guide.
Without a sufficiently developed ICP based on an agency-wide risk assessment, MSCBA is limited in its
ability to identify vulnerabilities, which could prevent it from achieving organizational goals.
Authoritative Guidance
There are no specific legal or regulatory requirements related to MSCBA’s internal control system;
however, according to Chapter 647 of the Acts of 1989, state agencies are required to develop and clearly
document internal control systems in accordance with guidelines established by CTR. These guidelines
require an ICP to be based on a risk assessment and revised annually. Although MSCBA is not required to
follow these standards, since it is not a Commonwealth agency within the executive branch and is instead
categorized as a quasi-governmental agency, we consider them best practices.
CTR’s Internal Control Guide states,
Your department is obligated to review and update your Internal Control Plan on an annual basis,
as well as whenever there is a new objective, risk, or management structure. . . .
An internal control plan should have a statement of awareness and compliance with [the General
Laws] Chapter 647 guidelines in addition to the [Committee of Sponsoring Organizations’] eight
[enterprise risk management framework] components.
Reasons for Issue
MSCBA has not developed policies and procedures to ensure that it creates and annually reviews a
comprehensive ICP that addresses all of MSCBA’s operations. According to MSCBA officials, although
MSCBA staff members independently monitor various documents related to internal controls, MSCBA
does not have the staff capacity to consolidate these efforts into a centralized ICP.
Recommendations
1. MSCBA should develop an ICP based on a current agency-wide risk assessment that includes all
aspects of its business activities. MSCBA should ensure that its ICP includes all the critical components
of enterprise risk management.
2. After completing its ICP, MSCBA should ensure that the ICP is communicated to all employees, used
within its operations, and reviewed and updated at least annually.
19

Audit No. 2025-0209-3A Massachusetts State College Building Authority
Detailed Audit Findings with Auditee’s Response
Auditee’s Response
The Authority has written policies and procedures for specific operations, and finance and accounting
internal controls are reviewed annually both internally and by the Authority’s external audit firm.
Although these documents do not take the form of a singular document or plan, they collectively
direct and guide day-to-day internal operations of the Authority. The Authority will review its internal
controls documents, as well as suggested guidance from CTR and other authorities, consistent with
the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations (COSO) framework to further develop a single
comprehensive plan for all the critical components of enterprise risk management.
Auditor’s Reply
Based on its response, MSCBA is taking measures to address our concerns regarding this matter. As part
of our post-audit review process, we will follow up on this matter in approximately six months.
4. The Massachusetts State College Building Authority had inadequate
information system general controls over its accounting and project
management system.
MSCBA did not have adequate information system general controls over its accounting and project
management system. Specifically, we identified issues with management of employee access rights,
employee cybersecurity awareness training, background checks, revocation of employee access rights,
session lock mechanisms, configuration management, and audit log reviews.
a. The Massachusetts State College Building Authority did not adequately
manage employee access rights.
MSCBA did not have documented management approval for its employees’ access rights to its
accounting and project management system for 12 (80%) out of 15 users in the population of
employees who were active during the audit period.
Without management approval, MSCBA does not have sufficient verification that system users were
approved to access the system at all or that user accounts were limited to the fewest privileges
necessary for the employees’ job duties.
Authoritative Guidance
Section 6.1 of EOTSS’s Access Management Standard IS.003 states,
6.1.5 Request access privileges: User requests for access privileges will follow a formal
process. . . .
20

Audit No. 2025-0209-3A Massachusetts State College Building Authority
Detailed Audit Findings with Auditee’s Response
6.1.5.2 User registration and revocation procedures will be implemented for all
information systems and services.
6.1.5.3 User access requests will be recorded (paper or tool-based), include a
business justification for access, and be approved by the requestor’s
supervisor and the appropriate Information Owner or authorized delegate.
Although MSCBA is not required to follow this standard, since it is not a Commonwealth agency within
the executive branch and is instead categorized as a quasi-governmental agency, EOTSS still
recommends that non-executive branch state agencies follow these standards. We also consider them
best practices.
Reason for Issue
MSCBA did not have documented policies and procedures regarding recording and maintaining user
access request approvals for its accounting and project management system during the audit period.
b. The Massachusetts State College Building Authority could not provide
evidence that its employees completed cybersecurity awareness
training.
MSCBA was unable to produce any attendance records or certificates of completion to verify that
accounting and project management system users received cybersecurity awareness training during
the audit period.
If MSCBA does not ensure that its employees complete cybersecurity awareness training, then it is
exposed to an increased risk of cyberattacks and financial and/or reputational losses.
Authoritative Guidance
According to Section 6.2 of EOTSS’s Information Security Risk Standard IS.010,
6.2.3 New Hire Security Awareness Training: All new personnel must complete an
Initial Security Awareness Training course. . . . The New Hire Security Awareness
course must be completed within 30 days of new hire orientation.
6.2.4 Annual Security Awareness Training: All personnel will be required to complete
Annual Security Awareness Training.
Although MSCBA is not required to follow this standard, since it is not a Commonwealth agency within
the executive branch and is instead categorized as a quasi-governmental agency, EOTSS still
21

Audit No. 2025-0209-3A Massachusetts State College Building Authority
Detailed Audit Findings with Auditee’s Response
recommends that non-executive branch state agencies follow these standards. We also consider them
best practices.
Reason for Issue
MSCBA did not have documented policies and procedures that required newly hired employees to
complete cybersecurity awareness training within 30 days of their orientation or that required existing
employees to complete annual refresher cybersecurity awareness training.
c. The Massachusetts State College Building Authority was missing
documentation for a completed background check.
One (7%) out of 15 system users was missing documentation confirming that MSCBA had completed
a required background check on them before they gained access to MSCBA’s accounting and project
management system.
Without proper screening, MSCBA assumes a higher-than-acceptable risk of hiring individuals who
may pose security threats to its systems and data.
Authoritative Guidance
According to Section C of MSCBA’s Employee Handbook, “The Authority will complete background
checks for criminal records and social security verification for existing employees every five years and
for new employees within 90 days of their start date.”
Reason for Issue
According to MSCBA officials, the one employee in our sample who was missing documentation for a
completed background check was a post-retiree state employee who was returning to work part-time,
and the background check was not performed.
d. The Massachusetts State College Building Authority did not promptly
revoke access rights to its accounting and project management system.
MSCBA did not promptly revoke access rights to its accounting and project management system for
the one former user whose employment ended during the audit period.
22

Audit No. 2025-0209-3A Massachusetts State College Building Authority
Detailed Audit Findings with Auditee’s Response
If MSCBA does not promptly revoke former employees’ access rights to its system, then there is an
increased risk that former employees could improperly access and/or change information in the
system.
Authoritative Guidance
According to Section 6 of EOTSS’s Access Management Standard IS.003,
6.1.8.3 If the termination date of a user is known in advance, the respective access
privileges—specifically those with access to confidential information—will be
configured to terminate automatically.
6.1.8.3.1. If not, access must be manually removed within 24 business hours.
Although MSCBA is not required to follow this standard, since it is not a Commonwealth agency within
the executive branch and is instead categorized as a quasi-governmental agency, EOTSS still
recommends that non-executive branch state agencies follow these standards. We also consider them
best practices.
Reason for Issue
According to MSCBA officials, the terminated employee whose access was not revoked was on a six-
month leave of absence before their employment was terminated.
e. The Massachusetts State College Building Authority did not have session
lock mechanisms in place.
MSCBA did not implement session lock mechanisms on its network or within its accounting and
project management system. For instance, there was no established protocol for defining a specific
duration of user inactivity that would trigger an automatic session lock.
If MSCBA does not have session lock mechanisms in place, then employees may remain logged on
indefinitely, increasing the risk of unauthorized access and reducing the organization’s ability to
effectively monitor and control system activity.
Authoritative Guidance
According to Section 6 of EOTSS’s Access Management Standard IS.003,
23

Audit No. 2025-0209-3A Massachusetts State College Building Authority
Detailed Audit Findings with Auditee’s Response
6.3.6 An automatic screen saver lock will be configured to become active no more than
five (5) minutes after inactivity for workstations used by personnel with access to
any Commonwealth network and information system.
6.3.6.1 Put devices into sleep or locked mode any time they are not in active use.
Although MSCBA is not required to follow this standard, since it is not a Commonwealth agency within
the executive branch and is instead categorized as a quasi-governmental agency, EOTSS still
recommends that non-executive branch state agencies follow these standards. We also consider them
best practices.
Reason for Issue
MSCBA officials could not explain why they do not have a policy for session timeouts for its network
or accounting and project management system.
f. The Massachusetts State College Building Authority did not have a
documented configuration management policy.
MSCBA did not have a documented configuration management policy for its accounting and project
management system to address how changes are processed before they are implemented. The
configuration policy should include a testing plan, results of the testing plan, and the process to
approve the changes to MSCBA’s accounting and project management system. Configuration
management ensures that system settings, updates, and security patches are consistently applied.
Without a configuration management policy, MSCBA makes its accounting and project management
system vulnerable to misconfigurations, security threats, and performance issues.
Authoritative Guidance
According to Section 6 of EOTSS’s Operations Management Standard IS.012,
6.3 Commonwealth Agencies and Offices must establish controls to maintain the integrity
of information systems, including: . . .
6.3.3. Create, maintain, and update standard operating procedures . . . for the secure
configuration of information systems. Assess compliance with configuration
requirements at least annually.
Although MSCBA is not required to follow this standard, since it is not a Commonwealth agency within
the executive branch and is instead categorized as a quasi-governmental agency, EOTSS still
24

Audit No. 2025-0209-3A Massachusetts State College Building Authority
Detailed Audit Findings with Auditee’s Response
recommends that non-executive branch state agencies follow these standards. We also consider them
best practices.
Reason for Issue
MSCBA officials could not explain why MSCBA does not have established controls to ensure that
procedures are in place to safeguard its accounting and project management system.
g. The Massachusetts State College Building Authority did not have
established procedures to review audit logs.
MSCBA did not establish procedures to conduct regular reviews of audit logs for its accounting and
project management system. Our testing found that user activity logs were not reviewed periodically
but rather only when issues emerged, which limits the organization’s ability to detect unauthorized
access or suspicious activity.
If MSCBA does not run regular audit logs of its accounting and project management system, then it
exposes itself to a higher-than-acceptable risk of unauthorized user activity. It also exposes itself to a
higher-than-acceptable risk that security incidents and policy violations go undetected by MSCBA
management.
Authoritative Guidance
According to Section 6 of EOTSS’s Logging and Event Monitoring IS.011,
6.1.6 Log review and reporting
Commonwealth Agencies and Offices must ensure that logs are periodically
reviewed by personnel from the Enterprise Security Office (or personnel with a
security role in the agency) to detect anomalous events and apply resolution in
a timely manner.
Although MSCBA is not required to follow this standard, since it is not a Commonwealth agency within
the executive branch and is instead categorized as a quasi-governmental agency, EOTSS still
recommends that non-executive branch state agencies follow these standards. We also consider them
best practices.
Reason for Issue
MSCBA does not have a written policy to ensure that logs are run on a regular basis to track user activity.
25

Audit No. 2025-0209-3A Massachusetts State College Building Authority
Detailed Audit Findings with Auditee’s Response
Recommendations
MSCBA should ensure that documented records are kept to evidence supervisory approval for system
user rights for its accounting and project management system.
MSCBA should develop and implement policies and procedures to ensure that all employees receive
cybersecurity awareness training within 30 days of orientation and annually thereafter. Also, MSCBA
should maintain certificates of completion of these trainings for all of its employees.
MSCBA should ensure that all employees with access to confidential information undergo background
checks, as required by its policy. MSCBA should maintain documentation of these screenings to ensure
accountability and compliance.
MSCBA should ensure that system privileges are revoked within 24 business hours of termination.
Additionally, MSCBA should consider temporarily suspending employees’ privileges when they are on
leaves of absence.
MSCBA should configure both its network and its accounting and project management system to lock
out after a five-minute period of inactivity.
MSCBA should establish controls to ensure that configuration management procedures are in place
to safeguard its accounting and project management system.
MSCBA should ensure that audit logs are run for its accounting and project management system on a
regular basis, so that system user activity is tracked.
Auditee’s Response
1. Supervisory review / approval of user access—The Authority, through its [information
technology (IT)] vendor, currently utilizes forms to establish and terminate user access for its
network. Separately, there is a process in place for establishing new employees’ access to . . .
the Authority’s accounting and project management software, however, because network access
is required to access [this software], there is a secondary level of control. The Authority
acknowledges that it can improve the documentation of this portion of the process and is
currently investigating and discussing further enhancements to the Authority’s existing processes.
2. Cybersecurity Training—Since 2021, the Authority has provided cybersecurity awareness
training annually for its employees. These trainings were conducted by the Authority’s IT
Network Service Provider . . . at an annual “All Staff” meeting. Consistent [with the Office of
the State Auditor’s (OSA’s)] review, the Authority has adopted a more structured and
documented approach. Since the informal exit conference with the OSA, the Authority has
retrained all staff via its provider’s Learning Management System and has current certificates
of completion. Existing employees will continue to complete such training annually and new
staff members will be required to complete such training within 30 days of hire.
3. Employee Background Checks—The Authority’s policy is to ensure that all employees
undergo appropriate background checks during the hiring process. The omission of a singular
employee was in error.
26

Audit No. 2025-0209-3A Massachusetts State College Building Authority
Detailed Audit Findings with Auditee’s Response
4. Employee Access Changes upon Leave or Termination—The Authority regards access to
the network and its security as a critical component to minimizing risk and routinely ensures
that system privileges are revoked within 1 business day of an employee’s leave or termination.
Moving forward, the Authority will make operational changes to ensure timely revocation of
access for separated employees.
5. Inactivity Lockout—Since the OSA informal exit conference, based on the recommendation
of its IT network service provider . . . the Authority has implemented a procedure by which
automatic lockout is initiated after 15 minutes of inactivity. The 15-minute lockout standard is
based upon the nationally recognized NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology)
recommendation.
6. Network Access / Configuration & Accounting / Project Management . . .
Configuration—The Authority will work with its IT consultants and vendors to develop an IT
Configuration Management Plan.
7. Audit Logs for the Accounting / Project Management . . . system—As previously noted,
the Authority considers system access a critical component to minimizing risk and will
investigate what reports, logs, and / or other tools are available to provide additional review
capabilities of user activity to enhance internal controls.
Auditor’s Reply
Based on its response, MSCBA is taking measures to address our concerns regarding this matter. As part
of our post-audit review process, we will follow up on this matter in approximately six months.
