Dear Chair Michlewitz, Chair Rodrigues, and Secretary Gorzkowicz:
Please accept this letter and related attachments as the annual report and quarterly report pursuant to
Section 2, appropriation 4000-0321 of Chapter 140 of the Acts of 2024. The pertinent reporting
language reads as follows:
…and provided further, that not later than December 20, 2024, the secretary of health
and human services shall submit a report to the executive office for administration
and finance and the house and senate committees on ways and means detailing: (a)
the amounts of the agreements; (b) a delineation of all ongoing and new projects;
and (c) the amount of federal reimbursement and cost avoidance derived from the
contracts for the previous fiscal year’s;
The Executive Office of Health and Human Services’ (EOHHS) maintains ongoing business
relationships with several vendors including the University of Massachusetts Chan Medical
School (forHealth/UMass), Public Consulting Group (PCG), Accenture, and other vendors to
provide expertise in health care consulting opportunities, third party liability (TPL), and clinical
resources for the Commonwealth. These relationships have been instrumental in assisting the
Commonwealth with achieving significant program savings through revenue enhancement and
cost avoidance strategies.
The summary of projects and table attached contain details of contingency agreements between
EOHHS and its health care vendors and the actuals/projections for revenue and cost avoidance
projects as well as the estimated fees for the state fiscal year (SFY) 2024. As you can see, these
projects have yielded total cost avoidance and revenue for SFY 24 of approximately $8.4 billion.

Your continued support for maintaining and expending on these contingency based contracts is
much appreciated. If you have any further questions or require addition information, please do
not hesitate to contact Thomas Statuto at Thomas.Statuto@mass.gov.
Sincerely,
Kathleen E. Walsh
Encl.

Brief Summary of Contingency Projects
forHealth/UMass
• MassHealth Revenue and Savings - The primary goal of this project is to identify other insurers
including commercial health insurers and Medicare to cover the cost of providing health care to
MassHealth and Health Safety Net (HSN) members. This also includes estate recoveries,
premium assistance, and enhanced coordination of medically complex Medicaid benefits,
federal claiming, CHIP, Health Services Initiatives (HSI), Non-Acute Hospital Payment on Account
Factor adjustment and School Based Claiming which collects Federal Financial Participation (FFP)
for school district spending on direct Medicaid eligible medical services.
• Program Integrity and Compliance- EOHHS is required to perform activities that identify
potential fraud, waste and abuse, and to ensure integrity of the Medicaid program. The
contract provides surveillance utilization reviews, provider audits, and recovery activities.
• EOHHS Revenue - The purpose of this contract is to maximize reimbursement for the cost for
health care and other public services provided by various health and human service agencies
including payment rate setting, medical billing, accounts receivable management, and
administrative claiming.
• New Initiatives- The purpose of this ISA is to identify and develop new cost avoidance and
revenue opportunities for EOHHS. Prospective eligibility review of long-term care applicants
(asset verification), Medicare outreach and enrollment, Medicare missed entitlement, Elder
Affairs Options Counseling claiming, Medicare Part B cost avoidance, Third Party Liability
screening using the Public Assistance Reporting Information System (PARIS), Enhanced Lien
Services, and Long-Term Care monitoring are examples of some of our new initiatives. One of
the newer projects, Enhanced Coordination of Benefits for Community Services for newly
Determined Disabled has generated $8M in cost savings for the Medicaid program. A new
Eligibility and Program Integrity project will review/reconcile all cases between MA21 and HIX
and redirect to HIX or close any that no longer meet eligibility standards. This project is
projected to save over $100M once fully implemented.
Accenture
• Health Insurance Investigation and Claims Recovery- The primary goal of this project is to
identify other commercial health insurers to cover the cost of providing health care to
MassHealth and HSN and the implementation of the premium assistance program.
PCG
• TANF Contingency Fund- PCG provides EOHHS and the Department of Transitional Assistance
(DTA) with consulting services on the Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF) program
including identifying new programs available for claiming, maintenance of efforts
determinations, data matching, and assistance with random moment time studies.
• CPE for Public Ambulance Providers- The primary goal of this project is to claim Certified Public
Expenditures (CPE) for government ambulance providers serving Medicaid clients up to
allowable costs. Last year, 115 Ambulance providers participated, and cities/ towns received
$25M in FFP.
• Financial Asset Verification- PCG performs an analysis of all new applications for Medicaid to
ensure that all bank accounts information is properly reported and shares this information with
the Medicaid Eligibility Centers.
• TCM Claiming- The Commonwealth received approval of a State Plan Amendment (SPA) in early
August 2020 that will allow the Department of Children and Families (DCF) to claim for Targeted
Case Management (TCM) for children receiving these services provided from DCF social workers.
This SPA generates approximately $20M in additional FFP annually. An amendment to the SPA
to claim additional services has recently been approved by CMS and will generate additional
FFP.
• Title IV-E Claiming for Transportation- A program that allows for schools to claim a portion of
their transportation costs under foster care under Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA).
• Title IV-E Claiming for Legal Representation Services- A new program that allows claiming for
Legal Representation for Child in Foster Care or Parent, and Legal Representation for Foster Care
Candidate or Parent. This Cost Allocation amendment will generate approximately $12M in
additional FFP annually.

• Title IV-E Claiming for Comprehensive Foster Care and Intensive Foster Care- A program that
allows claiming of eligible administrative expenditures incurred by Comprehensive Foster
Care/Intensive Foster Care (CFC/IFC) providers.
• Web Based Cost Allocation Plan- The web-based cost allocation plan will streamline the import
of financial, payroll, and statistical data and improve data integrity and allow for additional
savings.
Sivic
• Come Behind Review- EHS entered a contract with Sivic to perform internal reviews of
operations and cost allocation plans to find additional revenue and savings for Massachusetts.
