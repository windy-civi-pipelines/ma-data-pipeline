LETTER FROM THE CHAIR
January 2025
The Honorable Maura Healey, Governor
The Honorable Andrea Joy Campbell, Attorney General
The Honorable Deborah B. Goldberg, Treasurer
The Honorable Michael Rodrigues, Chair, Senate Committee on Ways and Means
The Honorable Aaron Michlewitz, Chair, House Committee on Ways and Means
The Honorable Barry Finegold, Senate Chair, Joint Committee on Economic Development and Emerging Technologies
The Honorable Carole Fiola, House Chair, Joint Committee on Economic Development and Emerging Technologies
HONORABLE EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND MEMBERS OF THE GREAT AND GENERAL COURT,
I would like to begin by recognizing former Chair Cathy Judd-Stein, who finished her service to the Commission in
March 2024. Her work is reflected throughout this annual report and we are grateful for her leadership during her
five-plus years serving as Chair.
Fiscal Year 2024 (FY24) saw significant growth for the Massachusetts Gaming Commission (Commission or MGC).
First, we successfully oversaw the first full year of Sports Wagering in the Commonwealth. We are proud to have three
fully licensed Category 1 operators and seven Category 3 operators under temporary licensure. We added new team
members to round out the nine-person Sports Wagering Division who work to support the operators and monitor their
compliance with our regulations. Sports Wagering has been as asset to the Commonwealth, bringing in $116.69M in
additional revenue in FY24 and directing those who choose to gamble on sports away from the illegal market to safe
and regulated operators.
We continue to focus on creating and enhancing regulations to govern this new industry. As Interim Chair, I have been
proud to spearhead, along with Commissioner Brad Hill, the MGC’s involvement in the Attorney General’s Youth Sports
Safety Coalition, working with statewide partners to combat underage sports wagering while creating a curriculum
to educate youth on the potential harms of unsafe gambling. Responsible Gaming is a key pillar of our work and I am
proud of the MGC’s role as a national leader as we promote essential responsible gaming initiatives and build on our
vast library of research.
While Sports Wagering may be the newest addition to the gaming offerings here in the Commonwealth, the Commission
continues to focus on overseeing our three brick-and-mortar casinos and the live horse racing and simulcasting
industry. Our brick-and-mortar casinos generated $33.87M in state taxes and employed roughly 5,400 people. We also
saw standardbred horses compete in 108 races in 2024.
The Community Mitigation Fund completed its first year of grants using its new block grant formula, which has proven
successful and will continue to be the model moving forward. We are proud to have awarded $18M to communities
and partners impacted by the construction of the casino facilities. The Community Mitigation Fund continues to be an
important source of funding for impactful projects across the Commonwealth.
I would like to recognize the MGC’s new Executive Director, Dean Serpa. After an exhaustive search led by Commissioner
Eileen O’Brien, Dean was unanimously selected by the Commission to serve as the administrative leader of our
organization. Dean brings a wealth of experience in state government to this role, and we are thrilled to have him. I want
to thank General Counsel Todd Grossman for serving as Interim Executive Director with distinction.
I also want to recognize the selection of Caitlin Monahan, who previously served as Deputy General Counsel, as Director
of Investigations and Enforcement Bureau. Caitlin was presented by Commissioner Nakisha Skinner, who Chaired
the search committee, and Commissioner Brad Hill as a final candidate and was ultimately selected for the role by a
unanimous Commission vote. We pride ourselves on recognizing the talent we have right here in this building and are
thrilled to see our team members further their careers at the MGC.
As we look forward to FY2025, I am deeply proud of the work of the entire MGC team. Serving as Interim Chair has given
me a new look into this organization, and it has been an honor to lead this incredibly talented team. The pages of this
annual report will show you just how dedicated this team is to upholding the mission of the Massachusetts Gaming
Commission.
The following Annual Report offers details of the Commission’s operations from July 1, 2023 through June 30, 2024
(FY24) in accordance with G.L. c. 23K, s. 70 and c. 23N, s. 14(d).
Sincerely,
Jordan Maynard
MISSION STATEMENT
Former Chair Cathy Judd-Stein convened a Mission Statement Working Group
to reexamine the Commission’s Mission Statement and Core Values following
the introduction of sports wagering in the Commonwealth to more accurately
reflect the current Commission. The working group, led by Interim Chair
Jordan Maynard and Commissioner Eileen O’Brien and including a diverse
representation of MGC staff, drafted a new mission statement and core values
which were unanimously adopted by the Commissioners in FY24.
The MGC is pleased to present its updated Mission Statement and Core Values.
The mission of the Massachusetts Gaming Commission is to regulate the
legal casino, horse racing, and sports wagering industries with integrity
and transparency. Our goal is to maximize consumer protections, minimize
negative impacts, and promote responsible gaming through regulation,
research, and informed policy making. The Commission endeavors to create
a fair and safe gaming environment in the Commonwealth while fostering
economic benefits and a diverse workforce for its licensees, residents,
and businesses.
PAGE 4 MASSACHUSETTS GAMING COMMISSION ANNUAL REPORT
CORE VALUES

Commission are committed to public service and a set of core values that

the benefit of all Massachusetts residents.
• Fostering an inclusive culture at the Commission and among our partners in
the Massachusetts gaming, horse racing, and sports wagering industry that

• Maintaining the integrity of the Commission’s work to promote objective and
thorough regulation, enforcement, and compliance.
• Ensuring transparency in the regulation and oversight of the industries we
oversee.
• Holding the Commission and its employees to the highest level of ethical
conduct through a commitment to the law and our enhanced code of ethics.

all whom we come in contact.

expanded gaming, horse racing, and sports wagering to prevent and mitigate
gambling-related harms.

gambling-related harm to individuals and the community.

KEY PROVISIONS OF
OF THE GAMING ACT
Chapter 194 of the Acts of 2011 (The Gaming Act) includes significant features to ensure public
confidence and a robust gaming industry that generates economic development while providing
mitigation measures to protect potentially vulnerable groups. The Gaming Act established a body of
five, full-time commissioners to implement rigorous standards for suitability by licensed companies,
vendors, and employees. The Gaming Act also established specific protocols for the operations of
oversight of expanded gaming in the Commonwealth to ensure integrity, transparency, and fairness.
The statute specifically identifies a variety of uses for gaming revenue generated for the
Commonwealth for local aid, health care, education and community colleges, transportation
infrastructure, manufacturing initiatives, debt reduction, and tourism. Additionally, a portion of
gaming taxes to the Community Mitigation Fund, which provides grants to cities and towns affected
by the operation of casinos — additionally, Host Communities are entitled to a Host Community
Agreement negotiated between the licensee and local community. Surrounding Communities also
have a process for addressing mitigation concerns with the licensees.
The Gaming Act also established the Public Health Trust Fund to assist social service and public
health programs dedicated to addressing challenges associated with problem gambling. The
statute focuses on the development of a research agenda and directs the Commission to use
research to make, in collaboration with the Gaming Policy Advisory Committee, scientifically based
recommendations to the Legislature and consider such recommendations in all decisions related
to enhancing responsible gambling and mitigating problem gambling. To further these ends, the
Secretary of the Executive Office of Health and Human Services and the Commission entered into
a second memorandum of understanding in August 2021, which addresses distributions from the
Public Health Trust Fund and supports the Gaming Act’s directives.

KEY PROVISIONS OF
THE MASSACHUSETTS
SPORTS WAGERING ACT
On August 10, 2022, then Governor Charlie Baker signed Chapter 173 of the Acts of 2022, An Act to
Regulate Sports Wagering, which legalized sports betting in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.
The Massachusetts Gaming Commission was tasked with overseeing the promulgation of the state’s
sports wagering industry.
The Massachusetts Sports Wagering Act created three categories of sports wagering licensees:
Category 1 for licensed casinos, Category 2 for racetracks and/or simulcast centers, and Category 3
for online mobile operators. The Commission is directed to determine eligibility for sports
wagering licenses.
Licensed retail operators are taxed at 15% and online operators at 20% of their gross sports
wagering revenue with these funds distributed to various state funds according to law.
An application period opened shortly after the law was signed and the Commission engaged in
a robust and transparent evaluation, which included a public review of the applicants’ sports
wagering platforms and plans for responsible gaming, diversity, community engagement, vendor
spending, company history, and other matters commissioners deemed necessary for evaluating
the applicants.
Retail sports wagering launched at three casinos in Massachusetts on January 31, 2023, just under
six months from the time the law was signed. Online/mobile wagering launched on March 10, 2023,
exactly seven months from the date the law was signed.

RECOMMENDATIONS
FOR LEGISLATIVE ACTION
In FY24, the Massachusetts Gaming Commission performed a comprehensive review of existing statutes within its
purview and submitted a letter to the Legislature with proposals to amend certain statues to help ensure that the
Commission is able to efficiently, fairly, and transparently execute its mandate while at the same time ensuring that
it has a clear, modern, and flexible statutory base from which to regulate.
The Commission appreciates the Legislatures consideration of the outlined proposals and looks forward to continued
work on these matters.
Of the proposals outlined in the letter, the Commission would like to highlight the following items as a top priority in
the fiscal year to come.
ALIGN SPORTS WAGERING OVERSIGHT WITH GAMING OVERSIGHT
• A mend G.L. c. 23K, 23N, and 128A to create a statutory exemption under the Massachusetts Public Records Law for
records received by the Commission from its licensees that, in its discretion, are determined to contain trade secrets,
competitively-sensitive or other proprietary information, the public disclosure of which would place the subject
licensee at a competitive disadvantage (Rationale — It is difficult for the Commission to engage in robust oversight
of the regulated entities in the sports wagering or racing space without being able to access certain sensitive
information [e.g. — unaudited financial reports] that are otherwise not subject to an exemption to the public records
law. While there is some ability to protect certain information from public disclosure on the casino gaming side,
language more clearly outlining that authority would be beneficial.);
• A mend G.L. c. 23K, § 21(a)(7) to clarify the authority of the Commission to enter into agreements with gaming
licensees and the types of materials that may be covered by such agreements (Rationale — Similar to the previous
point, it is imperative that the Commission be afforded the ability to receive sensitive information from its licensees
in order to ensure robust regulatory oversight. While there is some ability to do so at present, a clearer outline of such
authority would be beneficial.);
• A mend G.L. c. 23N to allow the Commission and the Investigations and Enforcement Bureau (IEB) to obtain or
provide pertinent information regarding applicants or licensees from or to law enforcement entities or sports
wagering regulatory authorities and other domestic, federal or foreign jurisdictions, including the Federal Bureau
of Investigation, and to transmit such information to each other electronically. See G.L. c. 23K, § 6(e) (Rationale
— While this authority exists on the casino gaming side and is a beneficial tool allowing a cooperative and efficient
approach across regulatory jurisdictions, no such authority exists in the context of sports wagering and may hinder
the Commission’s ability to secure information relative to its licensed entities or applicants.)
ENHANCED OPERATIONAL FLEXIBILITY
• A mend G.L. c. 23K, § 61(b) to afford the Commission greater discretion to distribute funds in the Community
Mitigation Funds for the overall enhancement of host, surrounding, and nearby communities to a gaming
establishment (Rationale — At present, the Commission may only distribute monies from the Fund for the narrow
purpose of assisting the host community and surrounding communities in offsetting costs related to the construction
and operation of a gaming establishment. By broadening the scope for which funds may be distributed, greater
benefit may be achieved in the communities in some way affected by the operation of a casino.)*
* The Commission is grateful for the collaborative discussions during the FY25 budget process and would like to thank the Legislature for maintaining the
distribution to the Community Mitigation Fund after FY25.

COMMUNITY AFFAIRS
The Community Mitigation Fund receives monies from the taxes on gross gaming revenues and is designed to address
impacts that result from the construction and operation of casinos. It may also be used for planning to determine how to
achieve further benefits from a facility.
The Division of Community Affairs reviews requests for mitigation dollars and makes recommendations to the
Commission on the award of grants from the Community Mitigation Fund. These recommendations are developed
through an intensive process involving analysis by many MGC staff members.
During Fiscal Year 2024 the Community Affairs Division made major modification the Community Mitigation Fund
program to improve the utilization of the funds. The modifications resulted in the development of the Municipal Block
Grant Program and the Regional Agency Grant Program. The modifications included: enhanced guidance on the
identification of casino-related impacts and the selection of mitigation projects; the development of a grant distribution
formula to equitably distribute funds to eligible communities; and the development of guidance for the new Regional
Agency Grant Program.
The Municipal Block Grant Program provided funds for eligible municipalities to mitigate casino-related impacts in the
areas of public safety, community planning, transportation, and gambling harm reduction. The Regional Agency Grant
Program funded projects to be carried out by regional agencies in the areas of workforce development, public safety,
and regional planning.

INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY
Information Technology Services Division
The Information Technology Services Division (ITS), led by the Chief Information Officer, plays a vital role in supporting
the Commission’s mission to regulate and oversee the state’s gaming industry. ITS focuses on providing efficient and
secure technology solutions, ensuring that all IT infrastructure, applications, and services align with the Commission's
strategic objectives. The division is comprised of two main teams: Enterprise Technology and Gaming Technical
Compliance. Overall, ITS is dedicated to fostering innovation and excellence within the Massachusetts gaming
landscape, ultimately advancing the Commission’s goal of ensuring a fair and responsible gaming experience for all
stakeholders. In 2024, ITS provided continuous technical support to the Commission, as well as monitoring the 5,185
active Electronic Gaming Devices across Massachusetts.
ENTERPRISE TECHNOLOGY
The Enterprise Technology team provides information technology products and services, governance, and security
to meet the needs of the MGC community and achieve the highest level of customer satisfaction. More specifically,

The Gaming Technical Compliance team is responsible for the planning, organization, management, and implementation
of regulations, policies, procedures, and testing to ensure the integrity of electronic gaming devices (EGDs or slot
machines), sports wagering, and related software and equipment. This unit also oversees the ongoing technical
compliance requirements for sports wagering operators, focusing on areas such as information security, change
management, testing, and reporting. By ensuring that all gaming technologies and systems adhere to state regulations
and standards, the Gaming Technology Compliance Unit plays a vital role in maintaining the integrity and security of
Massachusetts's gaming environment.
MASSACHUSETTS GAMING COMMISSION ANNUAL REPORT PAGE 31
Casino Gaming
Currently, there are 5,185 active electronic gaming devices (EGDs) operating across the three casinos in Massachusetts.
The Gaming Technical Compliance team continuously monitors these devices to ensure compliance and integrity. The
team is also responsible for issuing certifications and permits for EGDs within the state. In 2024, the team certified a
total of 1,872 individual software packages for use in Massachusetts, evaluated by our Certified Independent Testing
Labs (CITLs). Among these, 1,497 packages received approval from Gaming Laboratories International (GLI), while 375
were approved by BMM Testlabs (BMM). To maintain compliance, the Massachusetts Gaming Commission's Central
Monitoring System (CMS) verifies software signatures for licensees on a daily basis. Additionally, each CITL undergoes
an annual review to ensure strict adherence to the standards set forth by the MGC.
Issuing revocations typically begins with a notification from the CITL when an issue is identified with a specific piece of
gaming software, detailing the severity and nature of the issue. The Gaming Technical Compliance team reviews each
notification to verify if the software is active in Massachusetts. A notification is then sent to each property, including
software information, removal date, and, if any, the affected EGDs. During FY2024, 47 revocations were issued based
on recommendations from the CITLs. Below is a breakdown of the software approved and revoked by manufacturers for
each CITL in FY2024.

Sports Wagering
The Gaming Technology Compliance team oversees the technical compliance requirements for sports wagering
operators in Massachusetts, focusing on information security, change management, testing, and reporting. The team
ensures that each operator conducts an annual independent technical security audit, annual recertification, quarterly
vulnerability scans, and quarterly change management log reports. Additionally, provides MGC staff with reporting
access and test accounts.
On February 16, 2024, Betr, followed by WynnBET on February 23, 2024, ceased their sports wagering operations in
Massachusetts. In the lead-up to these cessations, the team reviewed the cessation plans of both operators to ensure
compliance with regulatory and reporting requirements. We collaborated with other divisions of the MGC to facilitate
the orderly shutdown of these mobile operations.
On July 2, 2024, Massachusetts successfully launched online sports wagering for Bally Bet. In preparation for this
milestone, the team conducted regular meetings with Bally's to ensure compliance with regulatory software, newly
established regulations, certified testing, and reporting requirements. The team, in collaboration with other divisions
of the MGC, played a crucial role in ensuring a smooth onboarding process by actively participating in compliance
discussions and verifying software readiness.
Below are screenshots of the approved sports wagering mobile apps in Massachusetts, along with geolocation pin
drop information.
These geolocations are also displayed in the main lobby of the MGC office so that staff and visitors can view where bets
are being placed in real-time.

IEB/LICENSING
Investigations & Enforcement Bureau/Division Of Licensing
The Investigations and Enforcement Bureau (IEB) is comprised of: 1) the Massachusetts State Police (MSP) Gaming
Enforcement Unit (GEU), which maintains a 24/7 presence at all three licensed gaming establishments; 2) the
Financial Investigations Division, a team of civilian financial investigators, who conduct suitability investigations; 3)
the Gaming Agents Division, comprised of civilian agents who maintain a 24/7 presence in the three licensed gaming
establishments, and are charged with providing regulatory oversight and on-site monitoring of the establishments; and
4) the Chief Enforcement Counsel’s Office (CEC), comprised of a team of a paralegal/intake officer and four attorneys,
whose duties include legal review of investigations and representing the IEB in licensing and enforcement actions
initiated by the IEB. The Director of the IEB also oversees the Division of Licensing, which administers the licensing
and registration functions on behalf of the Commission. During FY24, Loretta Lillios, Director of the Investigations and
Enforcement Bureau, retired. IEB is grateful for Director Lillios’ tireless dedication, guidance, and leadership during
her tenure. In addition, IEB has welcomed Caitlin Monahan as its new Director. Director Monahan previously served as
Deputy General Counsel at MGC.
The IEB conducts probity investigations to determine the suitability of gaming establishment employees and vendors,
per gaming licensing regulations (205 CMR 134.00). These regulations also define thresholds, standards, and
procedures for licensing and registration. During FY2024, the IEB collaborated with the MGC’s General Counsel’s Office,
outside counsel, and other divisions within the MGC on implementing the sports wagering law, G.L. c. 23N. The IEB
provided input on draft sports wagering regulations for conducting temporary and full suitability investigations; issuing
temporary and full licenses to operators, and sports wagering employees (205 CMR 235.00), and vendors (205 CMR

Section 3:
234.00); as well as reporting requirements for licensees.
There are five types of employee licensure: Key Gaming Employee — Executive; Key Gaming Employee — Standard;
Gaming Employee; Key Sports Wagering Employee — Executive; and Key Sports Wagering Employee — Standard. If an
employee is not classified by regulation, they must register as a Gaming Service Employee, unless exempted from
classification by the Commission. Similarly, there are three levels of casino vendor licensure and registration: Gaming
Vendor — Primary; Gaming Vendor — Secondary; and Non-gaming Vendor. For sports wagering, there are Sports
MASSACHUSETTS GAMING COMMISSION ANNUAL REPORT PAGE 37
Wagering Vendors; Sports Wagering Registrants; and Non-sports Wagering Vendors. Each credentialed employee or
vendor must submit to a background check. The depth of all background checks are commensurate with the level of
licensure/registration.
With respect to Gaming, in FY24, the Division of Licensing and the IEB processed and completed background
investigations for 1,996 applications for individual employee licensure or registration. The IEB completed renewal
investigations for six gaming vendors, consisting of 10 entity qualifiers and 22 individual qualifiers. The IEB also
completed standalone investigations for 1 entity qualifier and 5 individual qualifiers pertaining to Gaming Vendors.
Further, with respect to casino qualifiers (corporate level suitability investigations), the Division of Licensing and the
IEB processed and conducted background investigations for 3 individual qualifiers. The IEB and the Division of Licensing
processed and conducted background investigations for 510 non-gaming vendor registrations.
With respect to Sports Wagering, the Division of Licensing processed 7 applications for individual employee
licensure. The IEB and the Division of Licensing processed and conducted background investigation for 36 Sports
Wagering Registrants. The IEB completed its investigation of Plainridge Park Casino, and presented its findings to the
Commission, which resulted in the Commission finding Plainridge Park Casino durably suitable and awarding a full
Category 1 Sports Wagering Operator license. The durable suitability investigations for the Category 3 Sports Wagering
Operator licenses are ongoing.
In FY24, over the course of the fiscal year the Gaming Agents conducted the necessary regulatory work for the ongoing
operations of Plainridge Park Casino, MGM Springfield, and Encore Boston Harbor. Gaming Agents conducted hundreds
of regulatory examinations to test casino internal controls and procedures at each facility to ensure compliance with
MGC regulations. Gaming Agents continue to oversee and review a variety of tasks at the three gaming establishments,
including slot machine moves and inspections, operational audits, compliance reports, patron complaints, machine
jackpots over certain thresholds, and tips from the Fair Deal tip line, with one of their primary duties being certification
of revenue for the Commonwealth.
The members of the Massachusetts State Police GEU have criminal enforcement responsibilities, and are also assigned
to conduct employee background checks and corporate-level suitability investigations of applicants for gaming and
sports wagering licenses.

RESEARCH AND RESPONSIBLE GAMING
The Office of Research and Responsible Gaming leads MGC’s efforts to mitigate gambling-related harm through the
development and implementation of casino-based responsible gaming programs. In addition, this office directs the
implementation of a comprehensive gaming research program as mandated by Section 71 of Chapter 23K and Section 23
of Chapter 23N.
MGC and the Department of Public Health set an annual budget for expenditures from the Public Health Trust Fund,
which includes funding for the annual gaming research program. For FY24, the Public Health Trust Fund directed
approximately $7.6 million to support the MGC’s gaming research, and responsible gaming programs.
Research Studies and Activities
The Commission has supported a wide range of gambling-related research projects, of which six were released in
FY24; adding up to more than 80 reports since 2014. Of importance during FY24, the MGC released two major studies:
Gambling and Problem Gambling in Massachusetts: Results of a Follow-up Population Survey (4/3/24) and GameSense
in Focus: Insights from an Evaluation in Massachusetts Casinos (5/9/24). The main purpose of the Follow-up Population
Survey report was to determine whether and how gambling attitudes, gambling behavior, and problem gambling
prevalence changed in Massachusetts following the introduction of casinos. The evaluation of the GameSense
program was intended to provide the MGC with an understanding of the extent to which the program in Massachusetts
is contributing to the overall goal of creating an effective, sustainable, measurable, socially responsible, and
accountable approach to gambling, through assessing awareness, perceptions, and engagement with GameSense.
MASSACHUSETTS GAMING COMMISSION ANNUAL REPORT PAGE 39
FY24 Research Findings Highlights:
• T he prevalence of problem gambling in Massachusetts in 2021 was 1.4% of the population aged 18 and over. An
additional 8.5% of the population aged 18 and over were classified as engaging in at-risk gambling. It should be noted
that because gambling participation was suppressed to some extent in 2021 by COVID-19, it is reasonable to assume
that problem gambling may also have been suppressed to some extent. The prevalence of problem gambling in
Massachusetts in 2021 was not significantly different from the prevalence rate of 2.0% identified in Massachusetts in

Section 4:
2013. The rate of at-risk gambling was also not significantly different from the rate of 8.4% identified in 2013. This is
notable considering the introduction of three casinos. (Gambling and Problem Gambling in Massachusetts: Results of
a Follow-up Population Survey)
• R eview of available data raises concerns about the impact of gambling advertising on vulnerable groups in the
Massachusetts population such as individuals who are underage and individuals in recovery from gambling
problems. While many jurisdictions have implemented regulations to limit the exposure of underage individuals to
gambling advertising, few have addressed the vulnerability of individuals in recovery from gambling problems and
their susceptibility to relapse in response to gambling advertising or news coverage. Another concern is the scarcity
of population-level approaches to minimizing and mitigating gambling harms and the nearly exclusive focus on
individual responsibility for gambling behavior. (Impacts of Advertising on Gambling Behavior in Massachusetts)
• O verall, casino operators in Massachusetts are committed to their local economies and to their goals of recruiting
and hiring a diverse workforce. Casino jobs offer flexibility in scheduling, low barriers to entry, and career
advancement for women and minority workers. Casino workers are well compensated in comparison to other jobs in
the Accommodation and Food Services Industry and have far lower rates of turnover. Analysis suggests that hiring
across job title hierarchy is intentionally geared toward gender equity, though equity across this hierarchy for people
of color has yet to be achieved. (Assessment of Job Quality at Massachusetts Casinos, 2022)
• There is a high level of GameSense awareness among regular patrons and casino employees, and that patrons benefit
from interacting with GameSense Advisors. Further efforts are needed to increase understanding of the program’s
comprehensive purpose and target audience. (GameSense in Focus: Insights from an Evaluation in Massachusetts Casinos)
FY 2024 Research:
Encore Boston Harbor 3.5 Year Operating Report (2019 — 2022)
November 30, 2023
In 2022, the $1.1 billion dollars spent in and around Encore Boston Harbor (EBH) by casino patrons
supported an average of 3,282 positions at the casino, paid $206 million in compensation, and
created demand for $85.4 million of intermediate goods and services EBH purchased from vendors.
EBH paid $197.4 million to government entities, comprised mostly of tax revenue on gross gaming
revenues. Net consumer impacts for state business were negative, as on net, consumers shifted
$167.6 million in spending away from other goods and services and towards the casino. However,
new spending and shifts in spending led to a net total of 9,917 jobs supported by the casino, with the
majority of jobs located in the Metro Boston region. EBH also supported $1.1 billion in new personal
income and $1.7 billion in new output within the Massachusetts economy, of which $1.3 billion was
value added.

Gambling and Problem Gambling in Massachusetts: Results of a Follow-up Population Survey
April 3, 2024
The main purpose of this report is to determine whether and how gambling attitudes, gambling
behavior, and problem gambling prevalence changed in Massachusetts following the introduction
of casinos. There has been a significant decrease in past year participation in most types of
gambling from 2013 to 2021, and an increase in the percentage of people who report not gambling
at all. The exception to this pattern is that no significant declines were seen in daily lottery
games, horse racing, and online gambling. The lingering effects of COVID-19 and the associated
restrictions are likely partly responsible for these broad declines. There has been no significant
change in the rate of problem gambling from 2013 (2.0%) to 2021 (1.4%), which is notable
considering the introduction of three casinos.

May 23, 2024
The purpose of this report was to examine workforce conditions at the Commonwealth’s three
casinos, analyze the extent to which Massachusetts casino jobs are benefiting the casino
workforce, and assess the quality of casino jobs. Overall, casino operators in Massachusetts are
committed to their goals of recruiting and hiring a diverse workforce. Casino jobs offer flexibility
in scheduling, low barriers to entry, and career advancement for women and minority workers.
Casino workers are well compensated in comparison to other jobs in the accommodation and food

Impacts of Advertising on Gambling Behavior in Massachusetts
June 20, 2024
Advertising has substantial impacts on attitudes toward and consumption of addictive products,
including gambling. Review of available data raises concerns about the impact of gambling
advertising on vulnerable groups in the Massachusetts population such as individuals who are
underage and individuals in recovery from gambling problems. Recommendations to prevent and
mitigate harm include limitations on gambling advertising including types of games, advertising
focused on specific purposes, and celebrity endorsements; restrictions on inducements; and
monitoring emerging forms of gambling advertising.

RESPONSIBLE GAMING INITIATIVES
Since its inception, the MGC has developed, implemented, refined, and adapted its responsible gaming strategy to
respond to the needs of all patrons. Responsible gaming is a core priority and central to the MGC mission. Objectives
of the program are to 1) promote positive play, 2) reduce gambling related harms, and 3) support the development of
responsible gaming focused casino workforce.
The Voluntary Self-exclusion (VSE) Program assists patrons who recognize that they have experienced a loss of
control over their gambling and wish to invoke external controls. People enroll in the program for one, three, or five-
year terms and are prohibited from wagering at Massachusetts casinos or sports wagering mobile platforms. If they do,
any gambling winnings are confiscated and transferred to the Gaming Revenue Fund. The MGC’s VSE process utilizes an
engaged approach, ensuring that enrollees are offered additional assistance, responded to in a respectful, timely and
discreet manner, and feels supported. In FY24, a total 658 of persons enrolled in the VSE program, a 102% increase from
FY23. Remote VSE was implemented on January 4, 2021 in response to the COVID pandemic and in FY24 there were 280
remote VSE enrollments, a 133% increase from FY23. On January 23, 2023, MGC began accepting VSE enrollments for
Sports Wagering. As of June 30, 2024, there are 1,781 people enrolled in the Gaming VSE and 468 people enrolled in the
Sports Wagering VSE.
GameSense is an innovative responsible gaming program based at Massachusetts casinos and available virtually
through LiveChat with a goal of promoting positive play behaviors and attitudes that reduce the risk of gambling-
related harm. In furtherance of the statute, which calls for an on-site player protection program, the MGC-licensed
the GameSense brand from the British Columbia Lottery Corporation in 2015 and drew upon the experience of the
Massachusetts Council on Gaming and Health staff to operate the program at all three licensee properties.
To extend reach and awareness of the GameSense program, the partnered with ASG, a communication firm to develop
an integrated marketing strategy. Two videos were developed, one targeted toward sports betters to encourage taking
a break and the other to educate viewers about understanding the odds. The campaign yielded a reach to over 42,000
listeners on a sports radio station, and 1 million YouTube impressions.
In FY23, GameSenseMA.com was updated to include dedicated responsible gaming information about sports Wagering,
debunking gambling myths and misconceptions, and educating players on how games, odds and probabilities work. In
the first full fiscal year since it’s launch, gamesensema.com had 107,000 active users.
Most people who visit Massachusetts casinos engage in safe levels of gambling behavior, also known as positive play.
Based at each MA casino, GameSense Information Centers are staffed by trained GameSense Advisors who offer a range
of information, resources and tools with a goal of increasing gambling literacy and reducing gambling related harms.
In FY24, GameSense Advisors engaged with over 83,400 casino and sports wagering patrons and employees to deliver
information about responsible gaming and problem gambling. To put a finer point on this, of these interactions 25% were
about GameSense generally, 14% were about setting a budget, 14% were about PlayMyWay, 12% were about positive
play strategies, and 11% were about debunking odds and myths. An independent evaluation of the GameSense program
revealed that 17% of regular casino patrons visited a GameSense Information Center, and a high proportion (74.2%) of
patrons that interacted with a GameSense Advisor reported feeling more informed about responsible gaming strategies.
PAGE 42 MASSACHUSETTS GAMING COMMISSION ANNUAL REPORT
GameSense Advisors provide training to staff at all three Massachusetts casinos with a goal to increase their knowledge
about responsible gaming and spur referrals to the GameSense program. In FY24, 1,249 people were trained at 120
training events. An independent evaluation of the GameSense program reveled a high degree of program awareness
(96%) from staff, and of the casino staff that interacted with a GameSense Advisor a vast majority (64.2%) have referred
a patron to the program.
In the community, GameSense Advisors also engage with groups at greater risk of gambling harm to promote informed
player choice before they visit the casino. In FY23, GameSense Advisors led community on-site and virtual presentations
to the 786 community members.
In 2021, the MGC launched the first 24-hour online chat dedicated to responsible gaming in the U.S. Chat users connect
directly with GameSense Advisors to enroll in the Voluntary Self-exclusion program, connect with help, learn tips on
responsible gaming and rules of the games. LiveChat is accessible on GameSense’s website, GameSenseMA.com. In
FY24, GameSense Advisors engaged in 1,345 chats on the GAM Line and LiveChat including the 288 sessions which
resulted in a VSE enrollment.
PlayMyWay (PMW) is a first in the nation budgeting tool designed to allow players the ability to set a budget and
monitor the amount of money they spend on electronic gaming machines. PMW was first launched at Plainridge Park
Casino in 2016 followed by MGM Springfield in 2018. On September 12, 2022, PMW became available at Encore Boston
Harbor meaning that it’s available on all slots and electronic gaming machines in Massachusetts. Once enrolled, a player
receives automatic notifications when approaching their daily, weekly, or monthly budget. They may then choose to stop
at any point or keep playing. PMW allows enrollment/unenrollment and budget adjustments at any time.
In September 2023, Dr. Michael Wohl of Carleton University conducted a study of PMW enrollment at MGM Springfield to
better understand why players do or do not enroll or the effect enrollment has on player behavior. The study found that
PMW enrollees rated high in impulsivity and lower in honesty and control over their gambling compared to those who
didn’t enroll. While PMW enrollees tended to visit the casino more frequently, they lost less money leading Dr. Wohl to
find the tool works as intended. As of June 30, 2024 there were 52,731 players actively enrolled in PlayMyWay with an
average un-enrollment rate of 12.7%.
Responsible Gaming tools on Sports Wagering platforms are offered to all sports wagering players on mobile
applications and digital websites. As required by regulation, sports wagering operators offer play management tools
similar to PMW that enable sports wagering players to set limits on deposits into sports wagering account, specified
dollar amount of a wager, and cumulative dollar amount wagered. As of June 30, 2024, over 32,000 sports wagering
accounts in Massachusetts, have utilized play management tools.
Additionally, operators are required to offer players struggling to control their gambling the opportunity to temporary
prohibit or “cooling off”. Similar to the VSE Program, the player may elect to prohibit access to their sports wagering
account. However, unlike VSE which extends to all operators statewide, temporary prohibition, only applies to a single
account or operator.

PENDING LITIGATION
FBT Everett Realty, LLC v. Massachusetts Gaming Commission v. Wynn MA, LLC (CA no. 1881CV00304)
On November 14, 2016, the Massachusetts Gaming Commission was sued by FBT Everett Realty, LLC for tortious
interference with respect to the plaintiff’s agreement to sell property to Wynn Resorts for the Region A Category 1
facility in Everett. The plaintiff is requesting damages as determined at trial. On May 14, 2018, the Superior Court
granted the MGC’s motion to dismiss on two of three claims then remaining. On July 5, 2018, the MGC filed a third-party
complaint against the Region A Category 1 licensee for unjust enrichment and indemnification relating to the remaining
claim against the MGC. The Region A licensee filed a motion to dismiss the complaint. On January 2, 2020, the court
issued a decision effectively denying the motion to dismiss. On February 12, 2021, the MGC filed a motion for summary
judgment. On June 16, 2021, the Court granted the MGC’s motion for summary judgment and dismissed the case. The
Court also dismissed the MGC’s third-party claims against the Region A Category 1 licensee. The plaintiff appealed the
Court’s decisions and was granted direct appellate review by the Supreme Judicial Court. On May 23, 2022, the Supreme
Judicial Court affirmed the lower court’s allowance of the MGC’s motion to dismiss the plaintiff’s intentional interference
with contract claim and reversed its entry of summary judgment in favor of the Massachusetts Gaming Commission on
the plaintiff’s regulatory takings claim. The matter was remanded to the Superior Court for further proceedings. The
summary judgement process is presently underway.

INDUSTRY IMPACTS ON WORKFORCE & DIVERSITY
This data is provided by UMDI. The data in this table reflects payroll and vendor spending data for fiscal year 2024 (July
2023-June 2024). Data collected from casino operators and Category 1 licensees were reported on a biweekly basis
for payroll and on a record-level basis for vendor spending. Data collected from Category 3 licensees were reported in
aggregate on a quarterly basis for both payroll and vendor spending and included total counts of workers, as well as total
counts of women, minority workers, and veterans. Before the introduction of sports betting, this table has previously
been reported in terms of total employment counts using operator data from the casinos. Due to the differences in data
collection, averages and totals for Category 1, Casino, and Category 3 are reported in terms of quarterly averages across
the industry to enable comparison and create consistency.
Quarterly averages across the industry are created by summing employment or vendors across the industry in a single
quarter and averaging across the four quarters to get to a quarterly average.
Due to the nature of operations at the retail sports betting locations, which operate within the casinos, and crossover
among the workforce between sports betting and casino workers, category 1 licensees and casino operators are
reported together as one aggregate workforce.

The Honorable Andrea Joy Campbell, Attorney General
The Honorable Deborah B. Goldberg, Treasurer
The Honorable Michael Rodrigues, Chair, Senate Committee on Ways and Means
The Honorable Aaron Michlewitz, Chair, House Committee on Ways and Means
The Honorable Barry Finegold, Senate Chair, Joint Committee on Economic Development and Emerging Technologies
The Honorable Carole Fiola, House Chair, Joint Committee on Economic Development and Emerging Technologies
HONORABLE EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND MEMBERS OF THE GREAT AND GENERAL COURT,
I would like to begin by recognizing former Chair Cathy Judd-Stein, who finished her service to the Commission in
March 2024. Her work is reflected throughout this annual report and we are grateful for her leadership during her
five-plus years serving as Chair.
Fiscal Year 2024 (FY24) saw significant growth for the Massachusetts Gaming Commission (Commission or MGC).
First, we successfully oversaw the first full year of Sports Wagering in the Commonwealth. We are proud to have three
fully licensed Category 1 operators and seven Category 3 operators under temporary licensure. We added new team
members to round out the nine-person Sports Wagering Division who work to support the operators and monitor their
compliance with our regulations. Sports Wagering has been as asset to the Commonwealth, bringing in $116.69M in
additional revenue in FY24 and directing those who choose to gamble on sports away from the illegal market to safe
and regulated operators.
We continue to focus on creating and enhancing regulations to govern this new industry. As Interim Chair, I have been
proud to spearhead, along with Commissioner Brad Hill, the MGC’s involvement in the Attorney General’s Youth Sports
Safety Coalition, working with statewide partners to combat underage sports wagering while creating a curriculum
to educate youth on the potential harms of unsafe gambling. Responsible Gaming is a key pillar of our work and I am
proud of the MGC’s role as a national leader as we promote essential responsible gaming initiatives and build on our
vast library of research.
While Sports Wagering may be the newest addition to the gaming offerings here in the Commonwealth, the Commission
continues to focus on overseeing our three brick-and-mortar casinos and the live horse racing and simulcasting
industry. Our brick-and-mortar casinos generated $33.87M in state taxes and employed roughly 5,400 people. We also
saw standardbred horses compete in 108 races in 2024.
The Community Mitigation Fund completed its first year of grants using its new block grant formula, which has proven
successful and will continue to be the model moving forward. We are proud to have awarded $18M to communities
and partners impacted by the construction of the casino facilities. The Community Mitigation Fund continues to be an
important source of funding for impactful projects across the Commonwealth.
I would like to recognize the MGC’s new Executive Director, Dean Serpa. After an exhaustive search led by Commissioner
Eileen O’Brien, Dean was unanimously selected by the Commission to serve as the administrative leader of our
organization. Dean brings a wealth of experience in state government to this role, and we are thrilled to have him. I want
to thank General Counsel Todd Grossman for serving as Interim Executive Director with distinction.
I also want to recognize the selection of Caitlin Monahan, who previously served as Deputy General Counsel, as Director
of Investigations and Enforcement Bureau. Caitlin was presented by Commissioner Nakisha Skinner, who Chaired
the search committee, and Commissioner Brad Hill as a final candidate and was ultimately selected for the role by a
unanimous Commission vote. We pride ourselves on recognizing the talent we have right here in this building and are
thrilled to see our team members further their careers at the MGC.

As we look forward to FY2025, I am deeply proud of the work of the entire MGC team. Serving as Interim Chair has given
me a new look into this organization, and it has been an honor to lead this incredibly talented team. The pages of this
annual report will show you just how dedicated this team is to upholding the mission of the Massachusetts Gaming
Commission.
The following Annual Report offers details of the Commission’s operations from July 1, 2023 through June 30, 2024
(FY24) in accordance with G.L. c. 23K, s. 70 and c. 23N, s. 14(d).
Sincerely,
Jordan Maynard

MISSION STATEMENT
Former Chair Cathy Judd-Stein convened a Mission Statement Working Group
to reexamine the Commission’s Mission Statement and Core Values following
the introduction of sports wagering in the Commonwealth to more accurately
reflect the current Commission. The working group, led by Interim Chair
Jordan Maynard and Commissioner Eileen O’Brien and including a diverse
representation of MGC staff, drafted a new mission statement and core values
which were unanimously adopted by the Commissioners in FY24.
The MGC is pleased to present its updated Mission Statement and Core Values.
The mission of the Massachusetts Gaming Commission is to regulate the
legal casino, horse racing, and sports wagering industries with integrity
and transparency. Our goal is to maximize consumer protections, minimize
negative impacts, and promote responsible gaming through regulation,
research, and informed policy making. The Commission endeavors to create
a fair and safe gaming environment in the Commonwealth while fostering
economic benefits and a diverse workforce for its licensees, residents,
and businesses.

KEY PROVISIONS OF
OF THE GAMING ACT
Chapter 194 of the Acts of 2011 (The Gaming Act) includes significant features to ensure public
confidence and a robust gaming industry that generates economic development while providing
mitigation measures to protect potentially vulnerable groups. The Gaming Act established a body of
five, full-time commissioners to implement rigorous standards for suitability by licensed companies,
vendors, and employees. The Gaming Act also established specific protocols for the operations of
oversight of expanded gaming in the Commonwealth to ensure integrity, transparency, and fairness.
The statute specifically identifies a variety of uses for gaming revenue generated for the
Commonwealth for local aid, health care, education and community colleges, transportation
infrastructure, manufacturing initiatives, debt reduction, and tourism. Additionally, a portion of
gaming taxes to the Community Mitigation Fund, which provides grants to cities and towns affected
by the operation of casinos — additionally, Host Communities are entitled to a Host Community
Agreement negotiated between the licensee and local community. Surrounding Communities also
have a process for addressing mitigation concerns with the licensees.
The Gaming Act also established the Public Health Trust Fund to assist social service and public
health programs dedicated to addressing challenges associated with problem gambling. The
statute focuses on the development of a research agenda and directs the Commission to use
research to make, in collaboration with the Gaming Policy Advisory Committee, scientifically based
recommendations to the Legislature and consider such recommendations in all decisions related
to enhancing responsible gambling and mitigating problem gambling. To further these ends, the
Secretary of the Executive Office of Health and Human Services and the Commission entered into
a second memorandum of understanding in August 2021, which addresses distributions from the
Public Health Trust Fund and supports the Gaming Act’s directives.

KEY PROVISIONS OF
THE MASSACHUSETTS
SPORTS WAGERING ACT
On August 10, 2022, then Governor Charlie Baker signed Chapter 173 of the Acts of 2022, An Act to
Regulate Sports Wagering, which legalized sports betting in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.
The Massachusetts Gaming Commission was tasked with overseeing the promulgation of the state’s
sports wagering industry.
The Massachusetts Sports Wagering Act created three categories of sports wagering licensees:
Category 1 for licensed casinos, Category 2 for racetracks and/or simulcast centers, and Category 3
for online mobile operators. The Commission is directed to determine eligibility for sports
wagering licenses.
Licensed retail operators are taxed at 15% and online operators at 20% of their gross sports
wagering revenue with these funds distributed to various state funds according to law.
An application period opened shortly after the law was signed and the Commission engaged in
a robust and transparent evaluation, which included a public review of the applicants’ sports
wagering platforms and plans for responsible gaming, diversity, community engagement, vendor
spending, company history, and other matters commissioners deemed necessary for evaluating
the applicants.
Retail sports wagering launched at three casinos in Massachusetts on January 31, 2023, just under
six months from the time the law was signed. Online/mobile wagering launched on March 10, 2023,
exactly seven months from the date the law was signed.

RECOMMENDATIONS
FOR LEGISLATIVE ACTION
In FY24, the Massachusetts Gaming Commission performed a comprehensive review of existing statutes within its
purview and submitted a letter to the Legislature with proposals to amend certain statues to help ensure that the
Commission is able to efficiently, fairly, and transparently execute its mandate while at the same time ensuring that
it has a clear, modern, and flexible statutory base from which to regulate.
The Commission appreciates the Legislatures consideration of the outlined proposals and looks forward to continued
work on these matters.
Of the proposals outlined in the letter, the Commission would like to highlight the following items as a top priority in
the fiscal year to come.
ALIGN SPORTS WAGERING OVERSIGHT WITH GAMING OVERSIGHT
• A mend G.L. c. 23K, 23N, and 128A to create a statutory exemption under the Massachusetts Public Records Law for
records received by the Commission from its licensees that, in its discretion, are determined to contain trade secrets,
competitively-sensitive or other proprietary information, the public disclosure of which would place the subject
licensee at a competitive disadvantage (Rationale — It is difficult for the Commission to engage in robust oversight
of the regulated entities in the sports wagering or racing space without being able to access certain sensitive
information [e.g. — unaudited financial reports] that are otherwise not subject to an exemption to the public records
law. While there is some ability to protect certain information from public disclosure on the casino gaming side,
language more clearly outlining that authority would be beneficial.);
• A mend G.L. c. 23K, § 21(a)(7) to clarify the authority of the Commission to enter into agreements with gaming
licensees and the types of materials that may be covered by such agreements (Rationale — Similar to the previous
point, it is imperative that the Commission be afforded the ability to receive sensitive information from its licensees
in order to ensure robust regulatory oversight. While there is some ability to do so at present, a clearer outline of such
authority would be beneficial.);
• A mend G.L. c. 23N to allow the Commission and the Investigations and Enforcement Bureau (IEB) to obtain or
provide pertinent information regarding applicants or licensees from or to law enforcement entities or sports
wagering regulatory authorities and other domestic, federal or foreign jurisdictions, including the Federal Bureau
of Investigation, and to transmit such information to each other electronically. See G.L. c. 23K, § 6(e) (Rationale
— While this authority exists on the casino gaming side and is a beneficial tool allowing a cooperative and efficient
approach across regulatory jurisdictions, no such authority exists in the context of sports wagering and may hinder
the Commission’s ability to secure information relative to its licensed entities or applicants.)
ENHANCED OPERATIONAL FLEXIBILITY
• A mend G.L. c. 23K, § 61(b) to afford the Commission greater discretion to distribute funds in the Community
Mitigation Funds for the overall enhancement of host, surrounding, and nearby communities to a gaming
establishment (Rationale — At present, the Commission may only distribute monies from the Fund for the narrow
purpose of assisting the host community and surrounding communities in offsetting costs related to the construction
and operation of a gaming establishment. By broadening the scope for which funds may be distributed, greater
benefit may be achieved in the communities in some way affected by the operation of a casino.)*
* The Commission is grateful for the collaborative discussions during the FY25 budget process and would like to thank the Legislature for maintaining the
distribution to the Community Mitigation Fund after FY25.

The Commission approved an FY24 budget for the Gaming Control fund of $37.87M, requiring a $32.23M assessment
on licensees. The Gaming Control Fund’s final spending for FY24 was $37.5M, which was $367.7K (0.97%) less than the
approved budget. The Gaming Control Fund’s final revenue for FY24 was $38.46M. The net impact of spending under

in FY25 resulted in a $1.26M FY24 surplus in the Gaming Control Fund. The surplus will be credited to licensees’
FY25 assessments.
The Sports Wagering Control fund was estimated to spend $10.15M, requiring a $5.77M assessment on licensees.
Final spending for the fund in FY24 was $8.00M, which was $2.15M (21.15%) less than the approved budget. The Sports
Wagering Control Fund’s final revenue for FY24 was $10.75M. The net impact of spending under budget, revenue
exceeding projections, and carryforward of suitability investigation deposits resulted in a $2.24M FY24 surplus in the
fund. The surplus will be credited to sports wagering licensees’ FY25 assessments.

COMMUNITY AFFAIRS
The Community Mitigation Fund receives monies from the taxes on gross gaming revenues and is designed to address
impacts that result from the construction and operation of casinos. It may also be used for planning to determine how to
achieve further benefits from a facility.
The Division of Community Affairs reviews requests for mitigation dollars and makes recommendations to the
Commission on the award of grants from the Community Mitigation Fund. These recommendations are developed
through an intensive process involving analysis by many MGC staff members.
During Fiscal Year 2024 the Community Affairs Division made major modification the Community Mitigation Fund
program to improve the utilization of the funds. The modifications resulted in the development of the Municipal Block
Grant Program and the Regional Agency Grant Program. The modifications included: enhanced guidance on the
identification of casino-related impacts and the selection of mitigation projects; the development of a grant distribution
formula to equitably distribute funds to eligible communities; and the development of guidance for the new Regional
Agency Grant Program.
The Municipal Block Grant Program provided funds for eligible municipalities to mitigate casino-related impacts in the
areas of public safety, community planning, transportation, and gambling harm reduction. The Regional Agency Grant
Program funded projects to be carried out by regional agencies in the areas of workforce development, public safety,
and regional planning.

MASSACHUSETTS GAMING COMMISSION ANNUAL REPORT PAGE 31

Casino Gaming
Currently, there are 5,185 active electronic gaming devices (EGDs) operating across the three casinos in Massachusetts.
The Gaming Technical Compliance team continuously monitors these devices to ensure compliance and integrity. The
team is also responsible for issuing certifications and permits for EGDs within the state. In 2024, the team certified a
total of 1,872 individual software packages for use in Massachusetts, evaluated by our Certified Independent Testing
Labs (CITLs). Among these, 1,497 packages received approval from Gaming Laboratories International (GLI), while 375
were approved by BMM Testlabs (BMM). To maintain compliance, the Massachusetts Gaming Commission's Central
Monitoring System (CMS) verifies software signatures for licensees on a daily basis. Additionally, each CITL undergoes
an annual review to ensure strict adherence to the standards set forth by the MGC.
Issuing revocations typically begins with a notification from the CITL when an issue is identified with a specific piece of
gaming software, detailing the severity and nature of the issue. The Gaming Technical Compliance team reviews each
notification to verify if the software is active in Massachusetts. A notification is then sent to each property, including
software information, removal date, and, if any, the affected EGDs. During FY2024, 47 revocations were issued based
on recommendations from the CITLs. Below is a breakdown of the software approved and revoked by manufacturers for
each CITL in FY2024.

Sports Wagering
The Gaming Technology Compliance team oversees the technical compliance requirements for sports wagering
operators in Massachusetts, focusing on information security, change management, testing, and reporting. The team
ensures that each operator conducts an annual independent technical security audit, annual recertification, quarterly
vulnerability scans, and quarterly change management log reports. Additionally, provides MGC staff with reporting
access and test accounts.
On February 16, 2024, Betr, followed by WynnBET on February 23, 2024, ceased their sports wagering operations in
Massachusetts. In the lead-up to these cessations, the team reviewed the cessation plans of both operators to ensure
compliance with regulatory and reporting requirements. We collaborated with other divisions of the MGC to facilitate
the orderly shutdown of these mobile operations.
On July 2, 2024, Massachusetts successfully launched online sports wagering for Bally Bet. In preparation for this
milestone, the team conducted regular meetings with Bally's to ensure compliance with regulatory software, newly
established regulations, certified testing, and reporting requirements. The team, in collaboration with other divisions
of the MGC, played a crucial role in ensuring a smooth onboarding process by actively participating in compliance
discussions and verifying software readiness.
Below are screenshots of the approved sports wagering mobile apps in Massachusetts, along with geolocation pin
drop information.
These geolocations are also displayed in the main lobby of the MGC office so that staff and visitors can view where bets
are being placed in real-time.
Change Management
The GTCU manages all change management releases for the retail and mobile sports wagering operators and informs
other MGC divisions, most notably, the Sports Wagering Division and IEB, of the releases.

IEB/LICENSING
Investigations & Enforcement Bureau/Division Of Licensing
The Investigations and Enforcement Bureau (IEB) is comprised of: 1) the Massachusetts State Police (MSP) Gaming
Enforcement Unit (GEU), which maintains a 24/7 presence at all three licensed gaming establishments; 2) the
Financial Investigations Division, a team of civilian financial investigators, who conduct suitability investigations; 3)
the Gaming Agents Division, comprised of civilian agents who maintain a 24/7 presence in the three licensed gaming
establishments, and are charged with providing regulatory oversight and on-site monitoring of the establishments; and
4) the Chief Enforcement Counsel’s Office (CEC), comprised of a team of a paralegal/intake officer and four attorneys,
whose duties include legal review of investigations and representing the IEB in licensing and enforcement actions
initiated by the IEB. The Director of the IEB also oversees the Division of Licensing, which administers the licensing
and registration functions on behalf of the Commission. During FY24, Loretta Lillios, Director of the Investigations and
Enforcement Bureau, retired. IEB is grateful for Director Lillios’ tireless dedication, guidance, and leadership during
her tenure. In addition, IEB has welcomed Caitlin Monahan as its new Director. Director Monahan previously served as
Deputy General Counsel at MGC.
The IEB conducts probity investigations to determine the suitability of gaming establishment employees and vendors,
per gaming licensing regulations (205 CMR 134.00). These regulations also define thresholds, standards, and
procedures for licensing and registration. During FY2024, the IEB collaborated with the MGC’s General Counsel’s Office,
outside counsel, and other divisions within the MGC on implementing the sports wagering law, G.L. c. 23N. The IEB
provided input on draft sports wagering regulations for conducting temporary and full suitability investigations; issuing
temporary and full licenses to operators, and sports wagering employees (205 CMR 235.00), and vendors (205 CMR
234.00); as well as reporting requirements for licensees.
There are five types of employee licensure: Key Gaming Employee — Executive; Key Gaming Employee — Standard;
Gaming Employee; Key Sports Wagering Employee — Executive; and Key Sports Wagering Employee — Standard. If an
employee is not classified by regulation, they must register as a Gaming Service Employee, unless exempted from
classification by the Commission. Similarly, there are three levels of casino vendor licensure and registration: Gaming
Vendor — Primary; Gaming Vendor — Secondary; and Non-gaming Vendor. For sports wagering, there are Sports
MASSACHUSETTS GAMING COMMISSION ANNUAL REPORT PAGE 37

Wagering Vendors; Sports Wagering Registrants; and Non-sports Wagering Vendors. Each credentialed employee or
vendor must submit to a background check. The depth of all background checks are commensurate with the level of
licensure/registration.
With respect to Gaming, in FY24, the Division of Licensing and the IEB processed and completed background
investigations for 1,996 applications for individual employee licensure or registration. The IEB completed renewal
investigations for six gaming vendors, consisting of 10 entity qualifiers and 22 individual qualifiers. The IEB also
completed standalone investigations for 1 entity qualifier and 5 individual qualifiers pertaining to Gaming Vendors.
Further, with respect to casino qualifiers (corporate level suitability investigations), the Division of Licensing and the
IEB processed and conducted background investigations for 3 individual qualifiers. The IEB and the Division of Licensing
processed and conducted background investigations for 510 non-gaming vendor registrations.
With respect to Sports Wagering, the Division of Licensing processed 7 applications for individual employee
licensure. The IEB and the Division of Licensing processed and conducted background investigation for 36 Sports
Wagering Registrants. The IEB completed its investigation of Plainridge Park Casino, and presented its findings to the
Commission, which resulted in the Commission finding Plainridge Park Casino durably suitable and awarding a full
Category 1 Sports Wagering Operator license. The durable suitability investigations for the Category 3 Sports Wagering
Operator licenses are ongoing.
In FY24, over the course of the fiscal year the Gaming Agents conducted the necessary regulatory work for the ongoing
operations of Plainridge Park Casino, MGM Springfield, and Encore Boston Harbor. Gaming Agents conducted hundreds
of regulatory examinations to test casino internal controls and procedures at each facility to ensure compliance with
MGC regulations. Gaming Agents continue to oversee and review a variety of tasks at the three gaming establishments,
including slot machine moves and inspections, operational audits, compliance reports, patron complaints, machine
jackpots over certain thresholds, and tips from the Fair Deal tip line, with one of their primary duties being certification
of revenue for the Commonwealth.
The members of the Massachusetts State Police GEU have criminal enforcement responsibilities, and are also assigned
to conduct employee background checks and corporate-level suitability investigations of applicants for gaming and
sports wagering licenses.
RACING

Race Horse Development Fund Disbursements
FY24 marked the tenth year that the Race Horse Development Fund had monies available to supplement purses, and
accordingly the Commission approved disbursements for the prescribed purposes in the manner recommended by the
Horse Racing Committee in accordance with G.L. c. 23K, §60.
The distributions out of the Race Horse Development Fund were as follows:

TOTAL $ 18,641,307
RESEARCH AND RESPONSIBLE GAMING
The Office of Research and Responsible Gaming leads MGC’s efforts to mitigate gambling-related harm through the
development and implementation of casino-based responsible gaming programs. In addition, this office directs the
implementation of a comprehensive gaming research program as mandated by Section 71 of Chapter 23K and Section 23
of Chapter 23N.
MGC and the Department of Public Health set an annual budget for expenditures from the Public Health Trust Fund,
which includes funding for the annual gaming research program. For FY24, the Public Health Trust Fund directed
approximately $7.6 million to support the MGC’s gaming research, and responsible gaming programs.
Research Studies and Activities
The Commission has supported a wide range of gambling-related research projects, of which six were released in
FY24; adding up to more than 80 reports since 2014. Of importance during FY24, the MGC released two major studies:
Gambling and Problem Gambling in Massachusetts: Results of a Follow-up Population Survey (4/3/24) and GameSense
in Focus: Insights from an Evaluation in Massachusetts Casinos (5/9/24). The main purpose of the Follow-up Population
Survey report was to determine whether and how gambling attitudes, gambling behavior, and problem gambling
prevalence changed in Massachusetts following the introduction of casinos. The evaluation of the GameSense
program was intended to provide the MGC with an understanding of the extent to which the program in Massachusetts
is contributing to the overall goal of creating an effective, sustainable, measurable, socially responsible, and
accountable approach to gambling, through assessing awareness, perceptions, and engagement with GameSense.
MASSACHUSETTS GAMING COMMISSION ANNUAL REPORT PAGE 39

FY24 Research Findings Highlights:
• T he prevalence of problem gambling in Massachusetts in 2021 was 1.4% of the population aged 18 and over. An
additional 8.5% of the population aged 18 and over were classified as engaging in at-risk gambling. It should be noted
that because gambling participation was suppressed to some extent in 2021 by COVID-19, it is reasonable to assume
that problem gambling may also have been suppressed to some extent. The prevalence of problem gambling in
Massachusetts in 2021 was not significantly different from the prevalence rate of 2.0% identified in Massachusetts in
2013. The rate of at-risk gambling was also not significantly different from the rate of 8.4% identified in 2013. This is
notable considering the introduction of three casinos. (Gambling and Problem Gambling in Massachusetts: Results of
a Follow-up Population Survey)
• R eview of available data raises concerns about the impact of gambling advertising on vulnerable groups in the
Massachusetts population such as individuals who are underage and individuals in recovery from gambling
problems. While many jurisdictions have implemented regulations to limit the exposure of underage individuals to
gambling advertising, few have addressed the vulnerability of individuals in recovery from gambling problems and
their susceptibility to relapse in response to gambling advertising or news coverage. Another concern is the scarcity
of population-level approaches to minimizing and mitigating gambling harms and the nearly exclusive focus on
individual responsibility for gambling behavior. (Impacts of Advertising on Gambling Behavior in Massachusetts)
• O verall, casino operators in Massachusetts are committed to their local economies and to their goals of recruiting
and hiring a diverse workforce. Casino jobs offer flexibility in scheduling, low barriers to entry, and career
advancement for women and minority workers. Casino workers are well compensated in comparison to other jobs in
the Accommodation and Food Services Industry and have far lower rates of turnover. Analysis suggests that hiring
across job title hierarchy is intentionally geared toward gender equity, though equity across this hierarchy for people
of color has yet to be achieved. (Assessment of Job Quality at Massachusetts Casinos, 2022)
• There is a high level of GameSense awareness among regular patrons and casino employees, and that patrons benefit
from interacting with GameSense Advisors. Further efforts are needed to increase understanding of the program’s
comprehensive purpose and target audience. (GameSense in Focus: Insights from an Evaluation in Massachusetts Casinos)
FY 2024 Research:
Encore Boston Harbor 3.5 Year Operating Report (2019 — 2022)
November 30, 2023
In 2022, the $1.1 billion dollars spent in and around Encore Boston Harbor (EBH) by casino patrons
supported an average of 3,282 positions at the casino, paid $206 million in compensation, and
created demand for $85.4 million of intermediate goods and services EBH purchased from vendors.
EBH paid $197.4 million to government entities, comprised mostly of tax revenue on gross gaming
revenues. Net consumer impacts for state business were negative, as on net, consumers shifted
$167.6 million in spending away from other goods and services and towards the casino. However,
new spending and shifts in spending led to a net total of 9,917 jobs supported by the casino, with the
majority of jobs located in the Metro Boston region. EBH also supported $1.1 billion in new personal
income and $1.7 billion in new output within the Massachusetts economy, of which $1.3 billion was
value added.

Gambling and Problem Gambling in Massachusetts: Results of a Follow-up Population Survey
April 3, 2024
The main purpose of this report is to determine whether and how gambling attitudes, gambling
behavior, and problem gambling prevalence changed in Massachusetts following the introduction
of casinos. There has been a significant decrease in past year participation in most types of
gambling from 2013 to 2021, and an increase in the percentage of people who report not gambling
at all. The exception to this pattern is that no significant declines were seen in daily lottery
games, horse racing, and online gambling. The lingering effects of COVID-19 and the associated
restrictions are likely partly responsible for these broad declines. There has been no significant
change in the rate of problem gambling from 2013 (2.0%) to 2021 (1.4%), which is notable
considering the introduction of three casinos.

among regular patrons and casino employees, and that patrons benefit from interacting with
GameSense Advisors. Insights from the survey and focus groups with GameSense Advisors
emphasize the dynamic nature of player — GameSense Advisors interactions and the need for
adaptability in navigating the evolving gambling landscape. Further efforts are needed to increase

May 23, 2024
The purpose of this report was to examine workforce conditions at the Commonwealth’s three
casinos, analyze the extent to which Massachusetts casino jobs are benefiting the casino
workforce, and assess the quality of casino jobs. Overall, casino operators in Massachusetts are
committed to their goals of recruiting and hiring a diverse workforce. Casino jobs offer flexibility
in scheduling, low barriers to entry, and career advancement for women and minority workers.
Casino workers are well compensated in comparison to other jobs in the accommodation and food

Impacts of Advertising on Gambling Behavior in Massachusetts
June 20, 2024
Advertising has substantial impacts on attitudes toward and consumption of addictive products,
including gambling. Review of available data raises concerns about the impact of gambling
advertising on vulnerable groups in the Massachusetts population such as individuals who are
underage and individuals in recovery from gambling problems. Recommendations to prevent and
mitigate harm include limitations on gambling advertising including types of games, advertising
focused on specific purposes, and celebrity endorsements; restrictions on inducements; and
monitoring emerging forms of gambling advertising.

RESPONSIBLE GAMING INITIATIVES
Since its inception, the MGC has developed, implemented, refined, and adapted its responsible gaming strategy to
respond to the needs of all patrons. Responsible gaming is a core priority and central to the MGC mission. Objectives
of the program are to 1) promote positive play, 2) reduce gambling related harms, and 3) support the development of
responsible gaming focused casino workforce.
The Voluntary Self-exclusion (VSE) Program assists patrons who recognize that they have experienced a loss of
control over their gambling and wish to invoke external controls. People enroll in the program for one, three, or five-
year terms and are prohibited from wagering at Massachusetts casinos or sports wagering mobile platforms. If they do,
any gambling winnings are confiscated and transferred to the Gaming Revenue Fund. The MGC’s VSE process utilizes an
engaged approach, ensuring that enrollees are offered additional assistance, responded to in a respectful, timely and
discreet manner, and feels supported. In FY24, a total 658 of persons enrolled in the VSE program, a 102% increase from
FY23. Remote VSE was implemented on January 4, 2021 in response to the COVID pandemic and in FY24 there were 280
remote VSE enrollments, a 133% increase from FY23. On January 23, 2023, MGC began accepting VSE enrollments for
Sports Wagering. As of June 30, 2024, there are 1,781 people enrolled in the Gaming VSE and 468 people enrolled in the
Sports Wagering VSE.
GameSense is an innovative responsible gaming program based at Massachusetts casinos and available virtually
through LiveChat with a goal of promoting positive play behaviors and attitudes that reduce the risk of gambling-
related harm. In furtherance of the statute, which calls for an on-site player protection program, the MGC-licensed
the GameSense brand from the British Columbia Lottery Corporation in 2015 and drew upon the experience of the
Massachusetts Council on Gaming and Health staff to operate the program at all three licensee properties.
To extend reach and awareness of the GameSense program, the partnered with ASG, a communication firm to develop
an integrated marketing strategy. Two videos were developed, one targeted toward sports betters to encourage taking
a break and the other to educate viewers about understanding the odds. The campaign yielded a reach to over 42,000
listeners on a sports radio station, and 1 million YouTube impressions.
In FY23, GameSenseMA.com was updated to include dedicated responsible gaming information about sports Wagering,
debunking gambling myths and misconceptions, and educating players on how games, odds and probabilities work. In
the first full fiscal year since it’s launch, gamesensema.com had 107,000 active users.
Most people who visit Massachusetts casinos engage in safe levels of gambling behavior, also known as positive play.
Based at each MA casino, GameSense Information Centers are staffed by trained GameSense Advisors who offer a range
of information, resources and tools with a goal of increasing gambling literacy and reducing gambling related harms.
In FY24, GameSense Advisors engaged with over 83,400 casino and sports wagering patrons and employees to deliver
information about responsible gaming and problem gambling. To put a finer point on this, of these interactions 25% were
about GameSense generally, 14% were about setting a budget, 14% were about PlayMyWay, 12% were about positive
play strategies, and 11% were about debunking odds and myths. An independent evaluation of the GameSense program
revealed that 17% of regular casino patrons visited a GameSense Information Center, and a high proportion (74.2%) of
patrons that interacted with a GameSense Advisor reported feeling more informed about responsible gaming strategies.
PAGE 42 MASSACHUSETTS GAMING COMMISSION ANNUAL REPORT

GameSense Advisors provide training to staff at all three Massachusetts casinos with a goal to increase their knowledge
about responsible gaming and spur referrals to the GameSense program. In FY24, 1,249 people were trained at 120
training events. An independent evaluation of the GameSense program reveled a high degree of program awareness
(96%) from staff, and of the casino staff that interacted with a GameSense Advisor a vast majority (64.2%) have referred
a patron to the program.
In the community, GameSense Advisors also engage with groups at greater risk of gambling harm to promote informed
player choice before they visit the casino. In FY23, GameSense Advisors led community on-site and virtual presentations
to the 786 community members.
In 2021, the MGC launched the first 24-hour online chat dedicated to responsible gaming in the U.S. Chat users connect
directly with GameSense Advisors to enroll in the Voluntary Self-exclusion program, connect with help, learn tips on
responsible gaming and rules of the games. LiveChat is accessible on GameSense’s website, GameSenseMA.com. In
FY24, GameSense Advisors engaged in 1,345 chats on the GAM Line and LiveChat including the 288 sessions which
resulted in a VSE enrollment.
PlayMyWay (PMW) is a first in the nation budgeting tool designed to allow players the ability to set a budget and
monitor the amount of money they spend on electronic gaming machines. PMW was first launched at Plainridge Park
Casino in 2016 followed by MGM Springfield in 2018. On September 12, 2022, PMW became available at Encore Boston
Harbor meaning that it’s available on all slots and electronic gaming machines in Massachusetts. Once enrolled, a player
receives automatic notifications when approaching their daily, weekly, or monthly budget. They may then choose to stop
at any point or keep playing. PMW allows enrollment/unenrollment and budget adjustments at any time.
In September 2023, Dr. Michael Wohl of Carleton University conducted a study of PMW enrollment at MGM Springfield to
better understand why players do or do not enroll or the effect enrollment has on player behavior. The study found that
PMW enrollees rated high in impulsivity and lower in honesty and control over their gambling compared to those who
didn’t enroll. While PMW enrollees tended to visit the casino more frequently, they lost less money leading Dr. Wohl to
find the tool works as intended. As of June 30, 2024 there were 52,731 players actively enrolled in PlayMyWay with an
average un-enrollment rate of 12.7%.
Responsible Gaming tools on Sports Wagering platforms are offered to all sports wagering players on mobile
applications and digital websites. As required by regulation, sports wagering operators offer play management tools
similar to PMW that enable sports wagering players to set limits on deposits into sports wagering account, specified
dollar amount of a wager, and cumulative dollar amount wagered. As of June 30, 2024, over 32,000 sports wagering
accounts in Massachusetts, have utilized play management tools.
Additionally, operators are required to offer players struggling to control their gambling the opportunity to temporary
prohibit or “cooling off”. Similar to the VSE Program, the player may elect to prohibit access to their sports wagering
account. However, unlike VSE which extends to all operators statewide, temporary prohibition, only applies to a single
account or operator.

PENDING LITIGATION
FBT Everett Realty, LLC v. Massachusetts Gaming Commission v. Wynn MA, LLC (CA no. 1881CV00304)
On November 14, 2016, the Massachusetts Gaming Commission was sued by FBT Everett Realty, LLC for tortious
interference with respect to the plaintiff’s agreement to sell property to Wynn Resorts for the Region A Category 1
facility in Everett. The plaintiff is requesting damages as determined at trial. On May 14, 2018, the Superior Court
granted the MGC’s motion to dismiss on two of three claims then remaining. On July 5, 2018, the MGC filed a third-party
complaint against the Region A Category 1 licensee for unjust enrichment and indemnification relating to the remaining
claim against the MGC. The Region A licensee filed a motion to dismiss the complaint. On January 2, 2020, the court
issued a decision effectively denying the motion to dismiss. On February 12, 2021, the MGC filed a motion for summary
judgment. On June 16, 2021, the Court granted the MGC’s motion for summary judgment and dismissed the case. The
Court also dismissed the MGC’s third-party claims against the Region A Category 1 licensee. The plaintiff appealed the
Court’s decisions and was granted direct appellate review by the Supreme Judicial Court. On May 23, 2022, the Supreme
Judicial Court affirmed the lower court’s allowance of the MGC’s motion to dismiss the plaintiff’s intentional interference
with contract claim and reversed its entry of summary judgment in favor of the Massachusetts Gaming Commission on
the plaintiff’s regulatory takings claim. The matter was remanded to the Superior Court for further proceedings. The
summary judgement process is presently underway.

INDUSTRY IMPACTS ON WORKFORCE & DIVERSITY
This data is provided by UMDI. The data in this table reflects payroll and vendor spending data for fiscal year 2024 (July
2023-June 2024). Data collected from casino operators and Category 1 licensees were reported on a biweekly basis
for payroll and on a record-level basis for vendor spending. Data collected from Category 3 licensees were reported in
aggregate on a quarterly basis for both payroll and vendor spending and included total counts of workers, as well as total
counts of women, minority workers, and veterans. Before the introduction of sports betting, this table has previously
been reported in terms of total employment counts using operator data from the casinos. Due to the differences in data
collection, averages and totals for Category 1, Casino, and Category 3 are reported in terms of quarterly averages across
the industry to enable comparison and create consistency.
Quarterly averages across the industry are created by summing employment or vendors across the industry in a single
quarter and averaging across the four quarters to get to a quarterly average.
Due to the nature of operations at the retail sports betting locations, which operate within the casinos, and crossover
among the workforce between sports betting and casino workers, category 1 licensees and casino operators are
reported together as one aggregate workforce.
