Dear Clerk Carroll,
Pursuant to Executive Office for Administration and Finance (A&F) Administrative Bulletin #6, please
be advised that the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner (OCME) has moved to amend 505 CMR 4.03, Fee
Assessed for Cremation or Burial at Sea Views. The purpose of the fee increase is to better support the
comprehensive system of medicolegal investigative services delivered by the agency and in accordance with the
agencyâ€™s increased retained revenue budget. The estimated revenue raised will be increased to approximately
$8.6 million, which is based on the estimated 30,000+ cremation views performed by the OCME each year. The
OCME will hold a public hearing on August 5, 2025, and expects the amended regulation to go into effect no
sooner than sixty (60) days from the date of this letter.
If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me at 857-377-2245.
Sincerely,
Eric Hogberg
Eric B. Hogberg
General Counsel
