Dear Members of the General Court:
I am pleased to submit this Report to the Legislature: Genocide Education Programming:
FY2023. The Department of Elementary and Secondary Education’s genocide education
grant program is based on Chapter 98 of the Acts of 2021, An act concerning genocide
education, which directs the Department to establish a grant program to support
instruction on the history of genocide at the middle and high school levels.
Chapter 98 further stipulates:
“…the commissioner shall provide a report on the progress of genocide education
programs in public schools and school districts to the clerks of the house of
representatives and the senate and the joint committee on education. The report
shall provide a description of the manner in which grantees…are offering genocide
instruction including: (i) the number of hours of instruction offered; (ii) the grade
levels at which such instruction is offered; and (iii) the title and description of the
course in which such instruction is integrated.”
During FY2023, the Department offered the inaugural Genocide Education Grant (Fund
Code 215), which provided 39 Local Education Agencies with the funds to expand and
deepen their instruction in the history and patterns of genocide. During the grant
application process, we surveyed prospective grantees about their genocide education
offerings and have summarized our findings in this report. In future years, we will have
updated information regarding changes in grantees’ offerings as a result of grant funding.
Sincerely,
Patrick Tutwiler
Acting Commissioner of Elementary and Secondary Education

Introduction
The Department of Elementary and Secondary Education (Department) respectfully
submits this Report to the Legislature: Genocide Education Programs: FY2023, pursuant to

Section 2:
Section 3 of Chapter 98 of the Acts of 2021, which stipulates:
“Annually, not later than October 1, the commissioner shall provide a report on the
progress of genocide education programs in public schools and school districts to
the clerks of the house of representatives and the senate and the joint committee
on education. The report shall provide a description of the manner in which grantees
under subsection (e) of section 2MMMMM of chapter 29 are offering genocide
instruction including: (i) the number of hours of instruction offered; (ii) the grade
levels at which such instruction is offered; and (iii) the title and description of the
course in which such instruction is integrated.”
During FY2023, the Department offered the inaugural Genocide Education Grant. This
grant provided 39 local education agencies (LEAs) with the funds to expand and deepen
their instruction in the history and patterns of genocide.
In making awards, the Department prioritized proposals that:
• included meaningful learning experiences that are well-integrated into existing
instruction;
• sought to increase equitable access to high-quality genocide education for all
students;
• had the potential for sustainable, long-term impact as opposed to “one-off”
activities; and
• included opportunities to work in partnership with relevant organizations and/or
engage local community members.
Competitive priority in the scoring process was also given to:
• LEAs with at least one school identified as requiring assistance according to the
state accountability system;
• LEAs with a student population in which greater than 40% are designated as
low-income; and
• LEAs who do not already have a well-established genocide education program.
A total of $1,193,400 in grants were awarded in FY2023. Individual awards ranged from
$6,100 to $60,000, with an average of $32,389. Due to the timing of state appropriations,
we were unable to offer the grant until midway through the school year and thus gave LEAs
the option to use awarded funds across both FY2023 and FY2024.

Summary of Genocide Education Programming – FY2023
This report is intended to provide a description of the manner in which the 39 Genocide
Education Grant grantees are offering genocide instruction, including:
• the number of hours of instruction offered,
• the grade levels at which such instruction is offered,
• the title and description of the course in which such instruction is
integrated.
The above information was requested by the Department of all grant recipients. While all
grantees provided information regarding the grade levels and courses within which
instruction is offered, no district provided information regarding the number of hours of
instruction.
Given that most grantees have only partially completed their grant activities at this time,
the data presented in this report represents genocide instruction prior to grant activities.
We expect to be able to present data for grantees regarding genocide instruction following
grant activities in our FY2024 report.
Data Regarding Genocide Instruction Amongst Grantees
Grade Levels
LEAs offered instruction in genocide education across all secondary grade levels, with the
most frequent instruction occurring in 10th and 11th grades. Below is a table showing
instruction at each grade level by frequency across the pool of grantees. Note that some
respondents did not specify the grade levels at which courses were offered.
N=39
Grade Level 6 7 8 9 10 11 12
Number of Grantees 5 9 10 10 17 18 16
Reporting Instruction at
this Grade Level
Courses and Topics of Instruction
LEAs offered instruction in genocide education across a variety of courses, including both
required and elective courses. Twenty-seven grantees reported including topics of
genocide within mandatory courses in history, social studies, and English Language Arts.
Of LEAs that offered instruction in required courses aligned to the 2018 History and Social
2
Science Framework, instruction most frequently occurred in World History I and II courses,
as well as in US History II. Additional required course titles mentioned included US History
I, ELA 8, ELA 9, World Geography and Ancient Civilizations I and II, and Civics.
Fourteen grantees reported offering genocide education-specific electives and an
additional four grantees reported offering elective courses that include topics of genocide.
Seven grantees reported offering an elective entitled “Facing History: The Holocaust and
Human Behavior.” Additional elective course titles included Modern Conflict, Indigenous
Peoples, World Studies, World War II Stories, Holocaust and Genocide Studies, The Third
Reich: the Rise and Fall of Nazism, Our Story: a Social History of the US, Dictators and
Disasters, Government and Politics, Modern World in the 20th Century, Untold History, and
America at War. Several districts reported incorporating instruction on genocide into AP US
History and AP World History courses.
Within these courses, LEAs referenced the teaching of a variety of specific genocides. The
most common genocides taught included the Holocaust (mentioned by 28 LEAs), the
Armenian genocide (11 LEAs), Rwandan genocide (nine LEAs), and the
Holodomor/Ukrainian Famine (six LEAs). Other LEAs reported teaching about topics of
genocide in connection to Bosnia, Kosovo, Sudan, indigenous peoples of North America,
Cambodia, the Congo, American slavery, and the Uighurs in China.
Seven grantees report that literature related to topics of genocide is included in their
curriculum. Five grantees report having invited guest speakers to discuss topics of
genocide with their students and one grantee reports taking students on a genocide-
education related field trip.
Summary
This year, educators across Massachusetts are working to expand and deepen their
instruction surrounding the history and patterns of genocide. With this report, we provide
baseline data regarding grantees’ instruction prior to grant activities. We look forward to
sharing additional data regarding the impact of grant activities on genocide instruction in
our Fall 2024 report.
