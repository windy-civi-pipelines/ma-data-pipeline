Dear Chairs,
Chapter 140 of the Acts of 2024, line item 4000-0300, requires the Executive Office of Health and
Human Services to submit a report including the total spending related to pharmaceutical utilization for
fiscal year (FY) 2024; estimated spending related to pharmaceutical utilization for FY25; the actual and
estimated revenue amounts, both in the form of supplemental rebates and federal financial participation
(FFP), received in FY24 and FY25 as a result of total pharmaceutical spending; total or projected savings
amounts delivered from supplemental rebate negotiations in FY24; and the relative impact of price and
utilization of pharmaceutical drugs added to the MassHealth drug list within FY24 and FY25.
MassHealth has been working to lower drug costs to manage the program’s spending while ensuring
robust access for members at a time when rising drug prices have driven overall budget growth.
With approval from the Legislature, in July 2019, MassHealth received the authority through the FY20
budget to directly and more effectively negotiate with drug manufacturers to come to supplemental and
value-based rebate agreements. This has provided MassHealth with effective tools to pursue the best
value for the Commonwealth through these agreements. This authority has also dramatically increased the
pace at which MassHealth can enter into these agreements.
As of February 1, 2025, MassHealth has active supplemental rebate contracts on 74 drugs with 28
manufacturers, including 11 value-based agreements, with a total annual rebate value of approximately
$451 million.1

1 Due to the dynamic nature of drug pricing, all rebate values in this report have been calculated
compared to a base period of Q4 FY2024 pricing. It is anticipated that the total annual rebate value may
be higher when compared to CY2025 pricing; however, this is unavailable at the time of this report. This
pricing will be reflected in the October 2025 legislative report.
Direct negotiations have not had any negative impact on consumer access. MassHealth continues to
provide its members access to all covered outpatient drugs approved by the Food and Drug
Administration (FDA), regardless of whether the manufacturer signs a supplemental rebate agreement
with MassHealth. Supplemental rebate agreements are negotiated to determine a drug’s positioning within
the MassHealth formulary, not coverage of the drug for MassHealth members.
In FY24, MassHealth spent $2.74 billion on pharmaceuticals before rebates and Federal Financial
Participation (FFP). MassHealth received $1.59 billion in total rebates. The actual spend for FY24 is
consistent with the estimated spend and rebate collection, as well as FFP projected in the previous
report.
In FY25, MassHealth estimates it will spend $3.00 billion on pharmaceutical utilization before rebates
and FFP. MassHealth estimates it will receive about $1.78 billion in total pharmaceutical rebates. The
growth in pharmacy spend is driven by an increased utilization of high-cost drugs.
Aggregate FFP was 64% for FY24 and is expected to be 64% for FY25.
In FY24, 123 drugs were added to the MassHealth Drug List (MHDL) and, to date in FY25, 100 drugs
were added to the MHDL. MassHealth spent approximately $43.5 million in FY24 on these 123 drugs
and estimates $6.9 million for FY25 on these 100 new drugs, based on data through December 2024. The
addition of a new pharmaceutical drug to the MHDL typically has a delayed fiscal impact because initial
utilization is often very low for the first few quarters a drug is available.
Thank you for your continued support of the MassHealth program. Please feel free to contact Sarah
Nordberg at Sarah.Nordberg@mass.gov should you have any questions about this report.
Sincerely,
Mike Levine
