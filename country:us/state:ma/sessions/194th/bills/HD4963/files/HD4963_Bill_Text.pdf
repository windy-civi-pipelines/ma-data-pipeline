Dear Chairs Rodrigues, Michlewitz, Velis, and Domb,
Budget line item 4000-0300 of Section 2 of Chapter 140 of the Acts of 2024 requires the Executive Office
of Health and Human Services to conduct and submit a comparative analysis of the rate differential for
inpatient psychiatric hospitals and substance abuse treatment hospital per diem payments. The
comparative analysis should analyze the per diem payments made by MassHealth Managed Care Entities
(MCEs), including Managed Care Organizations, Accountable Care Partnership Plans, the behavioral
health vendor, One Care, and Senior Care Options (SCO) plans, in comparison to the MassHealth (MH)
Fee for Service (FFS) rate.
