The Modular Units (North and South) have a capacity of 50 per unit. The extra 20 beds are for overflow in the case of emergencies (flexible dayroom spaces).
The Regional Police Lock-Up is a stand alone facility that is designed to public health standards, therefore it cannot be used for permanent housing (used for overnight & weekend holds for local courts).
Bridge to the Future is a leased dwelling off of the main campus of the facility (not state-owned property).
Rocky Hill Re-Entry Collaberative-capacity is designed at 42 (state occupancy permit); under the contract for use it has a maximum capacity of 20.
316 is a number that could possibly be occupied in a worst-case scenerio under state occupancy guidelines (state building inspector).
