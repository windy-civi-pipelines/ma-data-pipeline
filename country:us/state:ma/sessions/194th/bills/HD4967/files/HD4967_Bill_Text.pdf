ii MA DCF Foster Care Review Report – FY2024

Executive Summary
Pursuant to Massachusetts General Law Chapter 18B Section 6A, the Department of Children and Families (DCF)
submits the FY2024 Foster Care Review (FCR) report. When children cannot remain safely at home, DCF acts
immediately to identify a safe foster care placement. FCR serves the critical purposes of monitoring efforts to plan
for and achieve permanency for children, reassuring the Department is meeting children’s needs while they are in
foster care, and engaging with parents working to reunify with their children. With this legislative report, DCF
provides a comprehensive public view of FCR performance data and how child-serving organizations can support
permanent homes for children.
Removing a child from his or her family home is one of the most difficult decisions DCF makes. While the agency
serves 80% of children in their family home, 20% are placed in foster care or other out-of-home placements
because of serious abuse and/or neglect. Given its significance, maintaining a strong and robust system of FCR is
a departmental priority.
DCF began its overhaul of Foster Care Review in 2018 in collaboration with the Office of the Child Advocate (OCA)
and members of the Legislature. In March 2019, DCF revised the Foster Care Review Policy1 and related
regulations2 to:
• Emphasize permanency planning at every review
• Clarify the roles of DCF social workers and parents’ attorneys in preparing parents for the review
• Establish a process for stakeholders, including parents’/child’s attorneys, to transmit documents to DCF
10 days in advance to ensure they are incorporated into the review
• Enhance recruitment and training for Volunteer Case Reviewers who, along with the DCF Foster Care
Reviewer and a DCF manager or supervisor, serve as members of the 3-party panels that decide the
outcomes of FCRs
To operationalize the revisions, the Department made corresponding changes to its i-FamilyNet system to
establish metrics for measuring outcomes and adherence to the FCR policy. Additionally, FCRs are included in the
Department’s Continuous Quality Improvement (CQI) efforts to produce quantitative and qualitative information
about case practice, case outcomes, and systems processes.
Because participation is paramount to FCRs, the Department has fully transitioned to virtual reviews. Foster
parents, group care providers, parent/child attorneys, and others with intimate knowledge of the family are
invited to the FCRs and provide valuable feedback to the panel. FCRs were held in-person at Area Offices until the
COVID-19 pandemic required the Commonwealth to pivot to video conferencing. The convenience of meeting
remotely significantly increased FCR attendance and provided new flexibility for Volunteer Case Reviewers to
participate in reviews for children involved with multiple Area Offices.
A three-party panel review with a Volunteer Case Reviewer, a DCF Foster Care Reviewer, and a supervisor or
manager from the child’s local area office results in FCRs with greater perspective and depth. In FY2024, there was
a 6.3% increase in three-party panel reviews compared to FY2020. To that end, DCF continues to grow and diversify
the Volunteer Case Reviewer program with a webpage on Mass.gov that includes an online volunteer application,
recruitment materials, and volunteer training.
When an FCR is conducted by a three-party panel, and there is a lack of agreement among panel members on a
given determination, a majority of two prevails. The opinion of the FCR Panel member with a differing

determination is documented as a Minority Opinion. Of the 11,375 reviews approved in FY2024, there were 543
(4.8%) reviews with Minority Opinions. This represents an increase of 381 reviews with Minority Opinions
compared to FY2020.
All youth ages 14-17 and young adults ages 18-22 receiving voluntary services from DCF are invited and
encouraged to participate in their FCR. Between FY2020 and FY2024, attendance for these youth and young adults
(in placement) declined by 31.3%, concurrent with students’ return to in-person learning and the resumption of
after-school activities and work. The FCRU tries to schedule reviews for youth and young adults after school or
work hours and continues to collaborate with Area Offices to increase participation.
In FY2024, the Department conducted 11,242 Foster Care Reviews, of which 88.4% were completed on time (i.e.,
initial review occurred within 6 months of entry into foster care; if subsequent review, it occurred within 6-months
of the last FCR). The decline in this productivity measure compared to FY2020 is attributable to pandemic-related
workforce retention and recruitment challenges that resulted in increased vacancies in the FCRU. Though subject
to normal turnover, as of April 2024, the FCRU was fully staffed, and timeliness is rebounding.
Another important component of the FCR is the assessment of supportive services provided to children and their
families. Following a home removal, DCF first tries to reunify children with their biological parents, who engage in
services to build their capacity to safely care for their children. While FCRs indicate the majority of child service
needs are being met, 20.1% of parents report systemic barriers to housing, individual and family counseling,
transportation, parent evaluation/education services, domestic violence services, and substance use treatment,
among other supports, while their children are in DCF’s care.
Throughout FY2022, DCF collaborated with the Office of the Child Advocate (OCA) to sit in on a random sample of
FCRs and to assess policy and IT systems improvements. In March and April of 2022, the OCA’s former legal counsel
attended 64 FCRs to determine whether policy changes were implemented and to confirm that the desired
outcome of improved reviews was achieved.
In FY2023 and throughout FY2024, the collaboration continued with DCF providing the OCA with all safety alerts
identified in FCRs. OCA staff tracked the Department’s completion of follow-up activities and participated in the
training of new Volunteer Case Reviewers. DCF will continue to work with the OCA to improve the quality of FCRs.
Childhood cannot be put on hold, and every child deserves a timely resolution of a permanent family or a lifelong
connection to support them into adulthood. A strong FCR system is imperative to meeting that goal.
iv MA DCF Foster Care Review Report – FY2024

DATA SUMMARY
Children, Youth, Young Adults and Families Served
At the start of FY2024, 22,913 families were being served by the Department of Children and Families (20,686
clinical cases and 2,227 adoption cases). These cases contained 80,019 individuals, 38,548 children (0-17), 2,073
young adults (18 & up), and 39,398 adults (i.e., parents/caregivers).3 (Tables/Figures 1-2, p.1)
The 2,073 young adults (18 & up) were served by DCF prior to their 18th birthday. To remain open with DCF beyond
age 18, these young adults signed a Voluntary Placement Agreement (VPA). A young adult can sign a VPA at age
18 and remain open with the Department up through age 22. Young adults who decline DCF services at age 18 may
later request services by signing a VPA prior to turning 23.
Children and Youth in Foster Care
DCF strives to safely stabilize families, and 80% of children and youth (0-17) open with the Department at the start
of FY2024 safely remained at home. When a child’s safety is at serious risk, children may be placed in out-of-home
care (foster care or group care). At the start of FY2024, DCF had 9,297 children, youth, and young adults in out-of-
home placement. Of these, 7,692 (82.7%) were children and youth (0-17), and 1,605 (17.3%) were young adults
(18 & up). (Table/Figure 3, p.1)
Notwithstanding the 9,297 children, youth, and young adults in out-of-home care at the start of FY2024, there
were new entries and exits from care throughout the year. As such, a total of 12,810 unique children, youth, and
young adults were in out-of-home care during FY2024. Of these, some 10,886 were in placement for sufficient
duration to convene a Foster Care Review. In total, 11,242 FCRs were convened in FY2024. (Table 4, p.2)
A Permanency Plan is established for children and youth (0-17) in DCF’s care. This Permanency Plan seeks to ensure
that each child has a nurturing family—preferably one that is permanent—within a timeframe supportive of their
needs.
Foster Care Review Introduction
Federal law requires child welfare agencies nationwide to conduct Foster Care Reviews at least once every six
months on behalf of children in out-of-home placements. Massachusetts state law established the FCRU as a
distinct and independent unit of DCF in 19844. The information learned from the FCR is a valuable component of
the Department’s quality improvement and complements the oversight role of the courts in individual cases.
An FCR is conducted by a three-party panel. This panel assesses the circumstances of the child’s current placement,
the services they are receiving and progress toward their permanency goal. The three-party panel makes formal
binding determinations about child safety, whether the foster care placement is still appropriate for the child,
progress toward the achievement of the Permanency Plan, and the projected date for achieving permanency.
These binding determinations and the panel’s non-binding recommendations are incorporated into the review by
the Area Office serving the child. FCR recommendations may result in modifications to a child’s Permanency Plan
or placement, including but not limited to a new foster care placement, a change in the frequency of a child’s

a family assessment or an action plan. These selection criteria exclude consumers not in placement who have an active case
status that is pending the outcome of an investigation.

contact with their biological family, or a change in the child’s permanency goal. It is ultimately the responsibility
of the courts to award permanent custody of children and youth.
Scheduling and Timeliness
Effort is made to convene FCRs in the month they are due. Nonetheless, consideration is given to the ability of the
parent/invited party, child and parent’s attorney, the FCR Reviewer, and DCF Area Office staff to participate. The
Foster Care Review Unit convened 11,242 reviews in FY2024, of which 88.4% were convened on time. While the
Department had been evidencing an increase in the timeliness of convened FCRs (SFY2020 = 90.8%), the COVID-
19 pandemic impacted the scheduling and convening of FCRs (SFY2021 = 58.4%). This was most notable early on
in the pandemic. Shifting to a virtual platform for convening reviews removed many obstacles to convening
reviews during the pandemic and thereafter. However, workforce retention and recruitment challenges were
exacerbated by the pandemic—resulting in increased vacancies within the FCRU. (Table 5, p.4)
Concurrent with concerted efforts to backfill vacant FCR positions, the Department allocated funding for an
additional FCR team. The FCRU consists of 8 units (plus 1 volunteer recruitment/support unit), each staffed with a
manager and 5-6 case reviewers. The timeliness of convened FCRs is approaching pre-pandemic levels.
FCR Meeting Panel Composition
FCRs are conducted by three‐party panels whose members must not carry responsibility for case management,
oversight, or service delivery for the case under review. A panel consists of a Case Reviewer from DCF’s Foster
Care Review Unit (FCRU) who convenes the meeting, a manager or supervisor from the child’s DCF Area Office
who is not directly responsible for the case under review, and a Volunteer Case Reviewer from the community
who is trained by the FCRU. Volunteer Case Reviewers are recruited to represent, to the maximum extent feasible,
the various socio-economic, racial, and ethnic groups of the community served by DCF. Three-party panels allow
for greater independence and depth of review, and DCF is working to increase FCRs with all three panel members
present. This is evident in the observed 6.3% increase in three-party panel reviews convened in FY2024 (i.e., 77.7%
of panels had three members) compared to FY2020 (i.e., 73.1%). (Table 9, p.6)
Mandated FCR Participants
To promote the inclusion of a variety of perspectives, several parties are invited and included in the FCR. These
include parents/guardians, children in placement who are age 14 and older, foster parents, group care providers,
parent, and child attorneys, DCF social workers and supervisors, family resource, adoption, and adolescent
outreach social workers. Young adults who turn 18 in foster care and continue to engage in supportive services
from the Department up through age 22 also receive and participate in FCRs. During FY2024, overall participation
increased significantly through the continued use of virtual reviews conducted via video conference technology—
for example, in the case of a child’s attorney participation, there was a 69.2% increase. (Table 10, p.6)
DCF Action Plan
When DCF begins working with a family, a comprehensive Family Assessment and Action Plan (FAAP) is jointly
completed with the family. The Family Assessment and subsequent Action Plan prioritizes child safety and parental
capacities and centers on engaging family members in an integrated and dynamic process of exploring their unique
strengths and needs for two important and related purposes:
1. Determining whether DCF must remain involved with the family to safeguard child safety and well-being,
and
2. For families who must stay involved with DCF, jointly developing a plan to support the family in
strengthening their capacity to meet the safety, permanency, and well-being of each child.
vi MA DCF Foster Care Review Report – FY2024

In 92.6% of the reviews, FCR panel members found that the Action Plan addressed all identified concerns to reduce
risk and achieve desired outcomes. DCF’s visits with family members were found to focus on the Action Plan in
82.4% of the reviews. Collateral contacts were used to assist in assessing the family’s progress in 85.9% of reviews.
The Action Plan was written in the primary language of the family/young adult in 97.9% of applicable reviews.
(Table 11, p. 8)
Placement Activities
Placement Activities is one of the domains explored and rated by the FCR panel during the FCR. DCF is required to
complete all tasks and activities recommended at the Initial Placement Review—also known as the 6-Week
Placement Review—for achieving child safety, permanency, and well-being. “Follow-up-activities” from the Initial
Placement Review were completed by DCF prior to the FCR meeting in 81.3% of applicable reviews. The
Department enhanced its Initial Placement Review process during FY2021 and focused on developing a
collaborative process for assessing the immediate needs of the child in placement and creating a plan to return
the child safely to their home. This process includes clear directives to identify follow up activities and develop
recommendations. In 92.6% of applicable reviews, FCR panels found that relatives were notified within 30-days of
a child’s placement. (Table 12, p.8)
Social Worker Contact and Parent-Child Visitation
The Foster Care Review process analyzes DCF social worker contact with placed children, families, and foster
parents/group care providers. DCF social workers were found to have maintained contact with 95.2% of assigned
children, youth, and young adults. Contact with parents/caregivers was maintained in 46.9% of reviews. Social
worker contact with foster parents and group care providers was maintained in 96.1% of reviews. Visits between
parents and their children were found to be maintained in 80.9% of reviews. (Tables 13-14, p.9)
DCF is anticipating that this measure will improve with the release of a revised Protective Case Practice Policy in
FY2025 which emphasizes the requirements for social workers to make collateral contacts in conjunction with
monthly visits and sets requirements for documenting case activities, including social worker dictation and
referrals to services in the community, in the electronic case record.
Health, Education, and Well-Being Needs
FCRs ascertain whether health, education and well-being needs are being met. Medical needs were met in 93.8%
of reviews, and dental needs in 85.9%. Rogers Guardianship Orders were found for 93.6% of children in DCF
custody placed on antipsychotic medications. (Table 15, p.10)
Of children under three years of age deemed eligible following an Early Intervention assessment, the FCR Panel
ascertained that 87.6% were receiving Early Intervention services. Of children, youth, and young adults
determined to be appropriate for enrollment in an educational program, 97.4% were enrolled in an educational
or vocational program. Of children, youth, and young adults determined to be appropriate for enrollment in an
educational program—based on available information at the review, 90.5% were found to have necessary
educational supports in place (e.g., appropriate Individualized Education Program (IEP) as needed, education
surrogate parent for support and advocacy as needed, stable educational setting, vocational training as
appropriate). (Table 15, p.10)
A permanent lifelong connection (i.e., an adult already known to the child/youth who has made a commitment to
be a permanent support) was in place for 96.4% of the reviewed children and youth. (Table 15, p.10)
MA DCF Foster Care Review Report – FY2024 vii

Youth/Young Adults
Of placed youth and young adults for whom employment was deemed appropriate, 39.7% were employed. Placed
youth and young adults should be receiving Preparing Adolescents for Young Adulthood (PAYA) training to assist
in developing the life skills needed to live independently and transition successfully to adulthood. This was found
to be the case for 76.2% of reviewed youth and young adults. In 64.5% of the reviews, youth and young adults
agreed with the FCR panel’s Permanency Plan determination. (Table 16, p.10)
Systemic Barriers Identified through the FCR
The FCR Panel identifies specific systemic barriers for addressing the areas of focus and achieving safety,
permanency, and well-being. Of the reviewed children, youth, and young adults, 13.6% were found to have one-
or-more systemic barriers. In 4.1% of the reviews, access to individual counseling was identified as a systemic
barrier for children. Of reviewed parents/caregivers, 20.1% were found to have one-or-more systemic barriers. In
8.0% of the reviews, access to housing was identified as a systemic barrier. (Tables 17-18, p.11)
FCR Determinations
Safety Concerns: At the completion of the FCR, the FCR Panel makes determinations (formal decisions) regarding
what is working well, what is not working, and what needs to change in order to achieve the child, youth, or young
adult’s Permanency Plan by a projected date. Determinations are binding on the Area Office and guide the next
period of action planning, decision-making, and casework with the child, youth, young adult, and family. Safety
concerns of varying degrees may be identified at a review. Safety concerns may be due to the child demonstrating
behaviors that are unsafe, parent/caregiver capacity concerns (e.g., substance use relapse by a parent/youth), or
that the foster parent/group care provider is not able to keep the child/youth safe.
If a safety concern is identified during the review, the Area Director/designee responsible for the case is
immediately notified. The Area Director is required to respond to a notice of safety concern within one working
day with the Office’s plan to resolve the safety concern. A safety concern was identified in 1.6% of the reviews
convened during FY2024. (Table 19a, p.12)
Action Plan Engagement: For FCRs convened in FY2024, 67.0% of reviewed parents/caregivers participated and/or
engaged in the actions, tasks, services, or supports outlined in the FAAP. Reviews further revealed that 56.4% of
parents/caregivers demonstrated the changes specified in their Action Plan for promoting the safety, permanency,
and well-being of their children—including demonstrable behavioral changes needed to reduce or eliminate the
identified dangers/risks. For reviewed youth aged 14 and older, 81.5% were determined to have participated in
the actions, tasks, services, or supports outlined in the Action Plan. Furthermore, 80.1% demonstrated the changes
specified in their Action Plan to achieve outcomes promoting their safety, permanency, and well-being. (Table
19b-c, p.13)
Placement Necessary: This determination of whether a placement is necessary is anchored by concerns of
imminent risk/danger. For 98.2% of children, youth, and young adults, their placement status—whether “in
placement” or “not in placement” on the day of the FCR—was determined to be appropriate. (Table 19d, p.14)
Appropriateness of Placement: The FCR Panel makes determinations regarding whether the approved placement
is designed to meet the specific needs of the child, youth, and young adult. For 94.6% of reviews, the foster
parent/group care provider was determined to be meeting the child/youth/young adult’s needs. (Table 19e, p.14)
Placement Expectations: The FCR Panel makes determinations regarding whether the foster parent/group care
provider adhered to the Child Placement Agreement and fulfilled all expectations for meeting the child, youth, or
viii MA DCF Foster Care Review Report – FY2024

young adult’s needs. For 99.1% of reviews, the foster parent/group care provider was determined to be meeting
their needs. (Table 19f, p.15)
Reasonable and Prudent Parent Standard: The FCR Panel makes determinations regarding whether the
Department took steps to ensure that the foster parent/group care provider followed the Reasonable and Prudent
Parent Standard. For 99.6% of reviews, the FCR Panel determined that DCF worked with the foster parent/group
care provider to ensure caregivers followed the Reasonable and Prudent Parent Standard. For 98.9% of reviews,
the FCR Panel determined that DCF made efforts to ascertain whether the foster parent offered the child, youth,
or young adult regular ongoing opportunities to engage in age or developmentally appropriate activities. (Tables
19g-h, p.15-16)
Addressing Family Needs: For 89.9% of reviews, the FCR Panel determined that DCF completed the tasks required
by policy to address the needs of the family in order to support the child, youth, or young adult’s safety and well‐
being and to achieve the Permanency Plan. (Table 19i, p.16)
Permanency Plan Progress: The FCR Panel makes determinations regarding whether necessary actions and
essential changes for achieving the Permanency Plan were demonstrated. These include consideration of the
federal Adoption and Safe Families Act (ASFA) guidelines. The FCR Panel determined that 90.8% of the reviewed
Permanency Plans should be maintained. Conversely, 9.2% of reviewed Permanency Plans received an Alternative
Permanency Plan determination requiring an Area Office review and/or a Permanency Planning Conference (PPC).
(Table 19j, p.17)
Minority Opinions
When an FCR is conducted by a three-party panel and there is lack of agreement among panel members on a given
determination, a majority of two prevails. The opinion of the FCR Panel member with a differing determination is
documented as a minority opinion.5 Of 11,375 FCRs approved in FY2024 (includes FCRs convened in late FY2023),
there were 543 FCRs with a minority opinion. (Table 20, p.18)
Foster Care Review Follow-Up Activities
The FCRU has three formal opportunities to follow up and address the findings of the FCR. Each opportunity serves
as a feedback mechanism for improving case-specific practice. The first is within the FCR meeting itself, including
the robust conversation about the case and what has happened since the last FCR. The second opportunity is
through the alert notice and FCR memo processes. All items flagged in the alert notice and FCR memo require
resolution by the Area Office. The feedback loop is closed once the FCRU or manager receives notification that the
issues have been resolved or a plan is in place for resolving the alert and memo. The third opportunity is through
the written FCR report which is transmitted to multiple parties including the Area Office. This memorializes the
identified strengths and areas needing improvement and serves as an additional opportunity for relevant parties
to address any concerns. This report is used at the subsequent FCR to identify areas that need to be reviewed or
assessed during the FCR. The Area Office is then charged with addressing any issues or determinations requiring
remedial action.
Please find additional information on FCR follow-up activities on p.18-19.
5 5 When a Foster Care Review is conducted by a two-party panel and there is lack of agreement among panel members on a
given determination, the case reviewer’s determination is entered into the electronic case record. The opinion of the Foster
Care review panel member with a differing determination is documented as a minority opinion.

I. DCF SERVED POPULATION
The Department strives to safely stabilize families at home. When this is not possible, children may be placed in
out-of-home care (foster care or group care) for their safety and well-being. If parental reunification is not
possible, the Department seeks to find new permanent families through kinship, guardianship, or adoption.
o Case Counts
As summarized in Table/Figure 1, at the start of FY2024, DCF had 22,913 open cases.
Of these, 90.3% (20,686) were clinical cases and 9.7% (2,227) were adoption cases.

II. FOSTER CARE REVIEW OVERVIEW
Federal law requires that DCF operate a system of Foster Care Review (FCR) dedicated to engaging key participants
in a timely and periodic review of all cases involving children, youth, and young adults in out-of-home care. The
purpose of FCR is to assess the progress being made to address the reason(s) for the Department’s involvement
with the family and to examine and make recommendations regarding efforts to safely achieve permanency for
the child, youth, or young adult. It complements the oversight role of the judiciary in individual cases.
Pursuant to MGL c. 18B, §6A, FCRs are conducted by the Foster Care Review Unit, a distinct and independent unit
within the Department that operates outside of DCF’s day-to-day delivery of casework services. The FCRU is
dedicated to quality oversight of the Department’s case decisions. It contributes aggregate data and information
that is needed to support the Department’s Continuous Quality Improvement (CQI) efforts.
• Foster Care Review Policy
The Department’s Foster Care Review Policy6 stipulates that:
o Cases involving children, youth, and young adults in out-of-home placement7 are reviewed by the FCRU no
less frequently than once every six months
o FCRs are conducted for families when at least one child, youth, or young adult in the family under the age

• Children/Youth/Young Adults in Placement with a Convened FCR
Notwithstanding the 9,297 children, youth, and young adults in out-of-home care at the start of FY2024 (Table 3,
p.1), there were new entries and exits from care throughout the year. Table 4 shows that there were 12,810
unique children, youth, and young adults in out-of-home care over the course of FY2024. Of these 10,886 were in
placement for sufficient duration to convene an initial or subsequent FCR. In total, the FCRU convened 11,242
FCRs in FY2024. FCRs are conducted at the family level and therefore may involve one or more children/youth.

- 2 - MA DCF Foster Care Review Report – FY2024

• Foster Care Review Considerations
Each review considers the following issues, as applicable:
o The necessity of the Department’s involvement with the family and the appropriateness of the child, youth,
or young adult’s placement—including a review of assessed needs for safety, permanency, and well-being
o Participation in the written Family Assessment and Action Plan (FAAP) and the observable changes the family
has made during the period under review, to reduce or alleviate the danger or need for placement or to
achieve desired outcomes
o The extent of progress made toward achievement of the child, youth, or young adult’s Permanency Plan,
which includes a review of any changes made to the child, youth, or young adult’s Permanency Plan and its
current status
o The child, youth, or young adult’s Permanency Plan and the projected date by which the child, youth or
young adult will achieve permanency
o Recommendations, when needed, for action planning during the next six months
The outcome of the FCR is a set of determinations and may include related recommendations that provide
guidance for the next period of action planning, decision-making, and casework. Parents, foster parents, youth,
and young adults may challenge determinations made by the Foster Care Review Panel if they disagree with the
decision, as can attorneys representing young adults and children ages 22 and under.

III. SCHEDULING
• Timeliness of Convened FCR Meetings
The initial FCR is scheduled to occur by the sixth calendar month following the date the first child, youth, or young
adult in the family enters placement. Subsequent FCRs are scheduled every six months from the initial FCR date,
as long as a child, youth, or young adult through age 22 remains in placement. The period under review (PUR) for
subsequent FCRs covers the period of time since the prior review.
In any given month, the FCRU convenes reviews carried over from prior months, reviews due in the current month,
and reviews coming due in the next month. As evidenced in Table 5, the FCRU convened 11,242 reviews during
FY2024, of which, 88.4% (9,937) were convened timely (i.e., initial review occurred within 6-months of entry into
foster care; if subsequent review, it occurred within 6-months of the last FCR). When a review cannot be convened
in the month it is due (e.g., illness or schedule conflicts such as court hearings for participating parties), the FCRU
makes every effort to schedule the review in the following month. As such, 1,305 of the 11,242 convened reviews
were carried over from prior months.
While the Department had been evidencing an increase in timeliness of convened FCRs (SFY2020 = 90.8%), the
COVID-19 pandemic impacted the scheduling and convening of FCRs (SFY2021 = 58.4%). This was most notable
early on in the pandemic. FCRs were not convened between 3/13-3/26/2020 while the FCRU developed and rolled
out a plan for convening videoconference reviews during the COVID-19 pandemic. Scheduling challenges
continued through early April of FY2020 as the FCRU shifted to virtual FCRs. The FCRU gradually ramped up to pre-
pandemic workflow but this resulted in a larger amount of convened FCRs that were actually due in prior months.
Shifting to a virtual platform for convening reviews removed many obstacles to convening reviews during the
pandemic and thereafter. Subsequently, workforce retention and recruitment challenges were exacerbated by
the pandemic-resulting in increased vacancies within the FCRU. Concurrent with concerted efforts to backfill
vacant FCR positions, the Department allocated funding for an additional FCR team. The FCRU now consists of 8
units (plus 1 volunteer recruitment/support unit), each staffed with a manager and 5-6 case reviewers. The
timeliness of convened FCRs is approaching pre-pandemic levels.

• Children/Youth/Young Adults Reviewed
The safety, permanency, and well-being of all children, youth, and young adults open in a DCF case are reviewed
at an FCR—not just those in out-of-home placement. As such, an FCR may involve one or more children within a
family/case. Table 6 shows that 9,372 children/youth (0-17), and 1,514 young adults (18-22) were reviewed by the
FCRU during FY2024.

While FCR meetings are generally convened within a one-hour window, FCR Case Reviewers hold many
responsibilities prior to, during, and after the review. These include:
o Pre-reviewing sufficient documentation in the electronic and physical case record
o Providing Panel members with a copy of the Action Plan(s) in effect during the period under review, and
when applicable, a copy of the last Foster Care Review report
o Chairing the FCR meeting
o Ensuring that all participants have the opportunity to have their views heard
o Facilitating alternative participation methods for invitees as needed (e.g., tele/videoconference)
o During the COVID-19 pandemic FCRs were convened utilizing videoconference technology
o Ensuring the Youth Readiness Assessment Tool, when applicable, is reviewed by the panel
o Sharing any materials or information received from invitees who are not able to be present at the FCR
o Documenting the FCR and forwarding Area Office alerts/memos/notifications as needed
• Timeliness of FCR Report Completion
Following the Foster Care Review, the FCR Case Reviewer is responsible for:
o Summarizing all determinations and recommendations
o Identifying each panel members agreement/disagreement with the determinations
o Documenting this information in the electronic case record within 10 working days of the review date
The FCR manager reviews/approves documentation of the FCR in the i-FamilyNet electronic case record within 30
working days of the review date. The FCRU manager notifies the assigned social worker when the report is
completed and forwards copies of the FCR report within 7 working days of approval to the following parties:
o Parents/guardians
o Adult guardian for an incapacitated person
o Youth 14 years of age and older, and young adults
o Child, youth, or young adult’s attorneys
o Parent’s attorneys
o Foster parents and group care providers
o Guardian ad litem, if assigned
The Department rolled-out an enhanced i-FamilyNet FCR module in 2019. As noted in Table 8, 64.2% (7,306) of
the 11,375 FCRs approved within FY2024 were approved on, or prior to the report due date.

IV. ATTENDANCE
• FCR Meeting Panel Composition
An FCR is conducted by a three-party panel whose members must not carry responsibility for case management,
oversight, or service delivery for the case under review. The panel consists of:
o Member of the FCRU (i.e., Case Reviewer) who convenes the meeting
o Second Party Case Reviewer, who is a manager or supervisor from the Area Office who is not the manager
or supervisor assigned to the case under review
o Volunteer Case Reviewer, a citizen who has been recruited and trained by the FCRU
▪ Volunteer Case Reviewers are recruited to represent, to the maximum extent feasible, the various
socio-economic, racial, and ethnic groups of the community served by the Department
Table 9 shows the FCR meeting panel composition for FY2020-24. While second party attendance was affected by
Area Office turnover and leaves, data reflects the impact of the Department’s concerted efforts to increase three-
party panels. The active ongoing recruitment of volunteer panel members has led to a 17.4% increase in volunteer
panel member attendance and 6.3% increase in three-party panels.
TABLE 9. FCR Meeting Panel Composition FY2020 FY2021 FY2022 FY2023 FY2024 Increase FY2020 to FY2024

V. REVIEW PROCESS
o DCF Action Plan
When the Department begins working with a family, a comprehensive Family Assessment and Action Plan (FAAP)
is jointly completed with the family. Family assessment and action planning prioritizes child safety and centers on
engaging family members in an integrated and dynamic process of exploring their unique strengths and needs for
two important and related purposes:
o Determining whether the Department must remain involved with the family to safeguard child safety and
well-being; and
o For families who must stay involved, jointly developing a plan to support the family in strengthening their
capacity to meet the safety, permanency, and well-being needs of each child.
Family assessment and action planning identifies and engages all family members who have a role to play in the
child/youth’s safety, permanency, and well-being. These include all parents, guardians, individuals residing in the
home (i.e., kin and non-kin), children/youth in DCF placement, minor siblings residing out of the home and/or
others identified by the family as important to them. When the FAAP involves a young adult who is sustaining
connection or re-engaging with the Department after leaving care or custody at age 18, the young adult is the
focus and other family members are involved only when the young adult agrees.
Family assessment is the Department’s family-focused, participatory process of gathering information about the
family’s history, functioning, strengths and needs, and about how well the safety, permanency, and well-being
needs are being met for the child/youth. The FAAP must identify each child/youth’s Permanency Plan. Based on
the information contained in the Family Assessment and the Permanency Plan for each child/youth, the Action
Plan specifies, at a minimum:
o Time period of the plan (usually 6 months)
o Area(s) of focus based on the findings of the Department’s Family Assessment of parental capacity and
child/youth safety, permanency, and well-being that indicate why continued DCF involvement is needed
o For each priority area of focus, the observable changes that are needed to maintain child/youth safety and
to achieve the jointly identified goals in the Action Plan
o Actions/tasks/services/supports identified to address the observable changes needed for each open
consumer, the Department, and any other identified participant(s) in the Action Plan (e.g., group care
provider, foster parent, Kin Collateral, etc.)
When the child/youth is in placement, the Action Plan includes the Parent-Child Visitation Plan and supplemental
placement-related information such as:
o Explanation of why the child/youth came into placement, the circumstances of the removal, and how the
child is adjusting in the placement
o Whether siblings are placed together, and if not, why not. Also, the specifics of the sibling visitation schedule
(when relevant)
o Whether the placement is with kin, and if not, why not. Also, what efforts were made to locate kin, including
to whom written notification was sent
o Plan for visitation with grandparent(s) and/or other kin (when relevant)
o Whether the school-age child/youth will remain in the school of origin and what options have been
considered with the Local Education Agency (LEA) to determine and support the child/youth’s educational
best interests
o Specific details regarding the child/youth’s Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA) status or tribal affiliation, race,
culture, placement history, health, and education information
MA DCF Foster Care Review Report – FY2024 - 7 -

If the Action Plan is for a youth aged 14 or older, the social worker may review the Youth Readiness Assessment
when applicable, which includes tasks, services, or supports to promote the youth’s life skill development and
readiness for transitioning to adulthood.
As summarized in Table 11, an Action Plan was in effect during the period under review for 99.0% of the reviews
convened during FY2024.
TABLE 11. DCF Action Plan… FY2020 FY2021 FY2022 FY2023 FY2024
Was there a DCF Action Plan in effect during the period under review? 99.2% 99.5% 98.9% 98.4% 99.0%
Does the Action Plan address all identified concerns to reduce risk(s) and achieve desired
outcomes?
o Per the DCF Family Assessment and Action Planning Policy (#2017-01), the Action Plan should:
o Address the reason(s) for the family’s involvement with the Department
o Include the areas of focus, as identified through the Family Assessment 91.6% 93.5% 88.6% 91.4% 92.6%
o Include the actions, tasks, services, and supports required to accomplish the goals identified
with the family in order to maintain child safety and well-being, achieve the child’s Permanency
Plan, and/or to close the case
o If all identified concerns are not included in the Action Plan, the FCR Panel recommends updating
the Action Plan.
Did DCF's visits with family members focus on the Action Plan?
o DCF social worker visits with family members should focus on the Action Plan actions, tasks,
86.0% 86.4% 82.3% 82.3% 82.4%
services, and supports that must be accomplished via the Action Plan in order to maintain child
safety and well-being, achieve the child’s Permanency Plan, and/or to close the case.
Is the Action Plan written in the primary language of the family/young adult?
o For bilingual family members, the ability to read and understand the Action Plan in English is
assessed through direct inquiry during the FCR. If the family does not understand the Action Plan in 97.4% 97.8% 97.5% 98.0% 97.9%
English, the FCR Panel recommends that the Action Plan be translated into the family’s primary
language.
Was collateral contact used to assist in assessing the family's progress?
o Sufficient contact with collaterals should be maintained and utilized for ongoing assessment of the 91.7% 89.4% 84.5% 84.7% 85.9%
family’s progress and emerging needs.
o Placement Activities
Placement Activities is one of the domains explored and rated by the FCR panel during the FCR. The Department
is required to complete all tasks and activities recommended at the Initial Placement Review— also known as the
6-Week Placement Review— for achieving child safety, permanency, and well-being. As summarized in Table 12,
81.3% of the “follow up activities” from the Initial Placement Review were completed by DCF prior to the FCR
meeting.
DCF policy specifies that relatives are to be notified within 30 days of a child’s placement. As evidenced in Table
12, in 92.6% of applicable reviews, relatives were notified within 30-days of a child’s placement in FY2024.
TABLE 12. Placement Activities… FY2020 FY2021 FY2022 FY2023 FY2024
Were “Follow Up Activities” from the Initial Placement Review completed by DCF?
o Along with mining the electronic case record for documentation, DCF’s completion of “follow-up
77.2% 76.7% 74.1% 76.2% 81.3%
activities” is assessed through direct inquiry of the social work team, family, and key participants during
the FCR meeting.
Were relatives notified of child/youth’s placement within 30-days?
o Pursuant to MGL c. 119, §23C: Whenever the Department places a child/youth in foster care, the
Department shall immediately commence a search to locate any relative of the child/youth, including
the parents of siblings who have custody of the siblings, or another adult who has played a significant
positive role in that child/ youth's life in order to determine whether the child/youth may be safely
91.5% 93.4% 92.1% 94.4% 92.6%
placed with that relative or adult if, in the judgment of the Department, that placement would be in the
best interest of the child/youth.
o Written notice is required within 30 days after the child/youth is removed from the parent's custody
unless the kin or other adult could not be approved as a foster parent due to known family or domestic
violence.

VI. FCR DETERMINATIONS
o Determinations
At the completion of the FCR, the FCR Panel makes determinations (formal decisions) regarding what is working
well, what is not, and what needs to change in order to achieve the child, youth, or young adult’s Permanency
Plan by a projected date. Determinations are binding on the Area Office and guide the next period of action
planning, decision-making, and casework with the child, youth, young adult, and family.
Determinations made by the Foster Care Review panel include:
o Whether concerns for the child, youth, or young adult’s safety were identified through the review process
o Whether the child, youth, or young adult’s placement is necessary as of the review date
o Whether the child, youth, or young adult’s current placement is appropriate
o Whether the placement resource (i.e., foster parent/group care provider) fulfilled expectations to meet the
child, youth, or young adult’s needs
o Whether the Department has taken steps to ensure the child, youth, or young adult’s placement resource
followed the Reasonable and Prudent Parent Standard
o Whether the Department has taken steps to ascertain whether the placement resource offered the child,
youth, or young adult regular ongoing opportunities to engage in age or developmentally appropriate
activities—working to help develop their special talent/interest/gift
o Whether the Department adequately addressed the needs of the family
o The participation of each individual as follows for the period under review:
▪ Did the parent/guardian, youth, or young adult participate in the Action Plan?
▪ Did the parent/caregiver demonstrate behavioral changes to reduce or alleviate danger, or need for
placement, or to achieve desired outcomes?
▪ Did the youth or young adult demonstrate observable changes to achieve desired outcomes for their
safety, permanency, and well-being?
o The extent of progress made toward achievement of the child, youth, or young adult’s Permanency Plan
o The child, youth, or young adult's most appropriate Permanency Plan determined by the FCR panel
o The projected date for achieving the child, youth, or young adult’s Permanency Plan
Safety concerns of varying degrees may be identified at an FCR meeting. Safety concerns may be due to the child
demonstrating unsafe behaviors, a reduction in parent/caregiver capacity (e.g., recent substance use relapse by a
parent/youth), or that the foster parent/group care provider is not able to keep the child/youth safe.
If a safety concern is identified during the FCR, the FCRU Case Reviewer immediately informs the FCRU manager,
who sends an alert notice to the Area Director/designee responsible for the case. This notice necessitates a
response by the Area Director within one working day. The FCRU manager also follows-up with the Area Director
/designee to ensure action is taken to secure the safety of the child/youth. Please see pp.18-19 for additional
details.
Table 19a indicates that a safety concern was identified in 1.6% of the reviews convened during FY2024.
TABLE 19a. Determinations… FY2020 FY2021 FY2022 FY2023 FY2024
19a. Were concerns for the child/youth/young adult’s safety identified through the review
process? 3.1% 2.1% 2.4% 2.1% 1.6%
o Safety concerns require an immediate alert notification to the Area Director.
- 12 - MA DCF Foster Care Review Report – FY2024

Table 19b indicates that for FY2024, 67.0% of reviewed parents/caregivers participated and/or engaged in the
actions, tasks, services, or supports outlined in the Action Plan. Reviews further revealed that 56.4% of parents
/caregivers demonstrated the changes specified in their Action Plan for promoting the safety, permanency, and
well-being of their children—including demonstrable behavioral changes needed to reduce or eliminate the
identified needs/dangers/risks.
TABLE 19b. Determinations… FY2020 FY2021 FY2022 FY2023 FY2024
19b1. Did the parent/caregiver participate/engage in the activities outlined in the Action Plan?
o For every child/youth (0-18) whose parent/caregiver maintains parental rights—based on available
information at the review—the FCR Panel determines whether the parent participated in the actions,
tasks, services, and supports, identified in the Action Plan. 72.5% 69.6% 67.5% 68.1% 67.0%
o This determination is not intended to be a rating of compliance with tasks.
o A determination is not made if the parent is incapacitated or has a disability status such that they are
unable to participate.
19b2. Did the parent/caregiver demonstrate observable changes that reduce or alleviate
danger, or the need for placement, or achieve the desired outcomes to improve the
child/youth’s safety and well-being?
o A “yes” is selected if the parent/caregiver demonstrated behavioral changes which support the
outcomes that promote the safety, permanency, and well-being of the child/youth. 59.1% 55.7% 54.3% 54.9% 56.4%
o A “yes” answer indicates that progress was made to increase parental capacities but does not
necessarily indicate that all areas of focus have been resolved.
o A determination is not made if the parent is incapacitated or has a disability status such that they are
unable to participate.
Table 19c indicates that for FY2024, 81.5% of reviewed youth aged 14 and older participated in the actions, tasks,
services, or supports outlined in the Action Plan. Furthermore, 80.1% demonstrated the changes specified in their
Action Plan for supporting the achievement of outcomes promoting their safety, permanency, and well-being.

Table 19d summarizes FCR Panel determinations regarding whether placement is necessary as of the date of the
FCR. This determination is anchored by concerns of imminent risk/danger. Table 19d indicates that for 98.2% of
children/youth/young adults, their placement status—whether “in placement” or “not in placement” on the day
of the FCR—was determined to be appropriate. Placement was determined not to be necessary for 0.1% of the
children/youth/young adults in placement. Placement was determined to be necessary, for 0.4% of the children
/youth/young adults not in placement at the time of the FCR.
On the FCR date, 1.3% of the reviewed children/youth/young adults were missing (0.7%, whereabouts unknown)
or absent (0.6%, whereabouts known) from an approved placement.
TABLE 19d. Determinations… FY2020 FY2021 FY2022 FY2023 FY2024
19d. IS PLACEMENT NECESSARY AS OF TODAY?
o For every child/youth/young adult reviewed—based on all available information at the review—the
FCR Panel determines whether placement is necessary as of the review date.
o Necessity of placement may be due to either concerns of imminent risk/danger related to the absence
of parental capacity, child/youth/young adult’s needs/behavior, or a permanency plan has not yet been
achieved.
Yes – child/youth/young adult is in placement. 83.8% 85.4% 85.1% 86.6% 85.7%
Not in placement – child/youth/young adult does not need placement.* 14.7% 13.5% 13.2% 12.2% 12.5%
PLACEMENT NEED AFFIRMED 98.6% 98.9% 98.3% 98.7% 98.2%
Child/youth/young adult in placement – placement not necessary. 0.1% 0.1% 0.2% 0.2% 0.1%
Child/youth/young adult not in placement – but should be in placement. 0.3% 0.3% 0.5% 0.4% 0.4%
Child/youth/young adult Missing (whereabouts unknown) from approved placement. 0.6% 0.5% 0.6% 0.6% 0.7%
Child/youth/young adult Absent (whereabouts known) from approved placement. 0.4% 0.3% 0.4% 0.5% 0.6%
*Reasons for potentially selecting this determination: FCRs convened for children/youth who recently attained permanency. Non-placed siblings of children/youth in placement. Young
adults who terminate their voluntary placement agreement invited to a Foster Care Review in an effort to ensure that they have necessary documents, services, and information.
Table 19e summarizes the FCR Panel’s determination regarding whether the approved placement is designed to
meet the specific needs of the child/youth/young adult. For 94.6% of reviews convened during FY2024, the foster
parent/group care provider was determined to be meeting the child/youth/young adult’s needs.
TABLE 19e. Determinations… FY2020 FY2021 FY2022 FY2023 FY2024
19e. Is current placement appropriate?
o For every child/youth/young adult in placement—based on all available information at the review—the
panel determines whether the child/youth/young adult’s current placement is appropriate.
o Factors to be considered in determining if a placement is appropriate:
o Child/youth/young adult’s best interests—including those related to safety, permanency, and well-
being 97.0% 96.9% 95.9% 95.4% 94.6%
o Continuity of significant relationships
o Least restrictive setting available to meet the child/youth/young adult’s individual needs
o If the FCR Panel determines a placement is inappropriate, documentation is provided as to why the
placement is inappropriate and whether the panel recommends that the child/youth/young adult
should remain in the current placement or be moved to an alternate placement.
NOTE: If the needs of the child/youth/young adult cannot be met by the foster parent/group care provider, or if these needs are not
addressed and/or resolved, the FCR Case Reviewer submits an FCR Memo to the Area Director/designee within one working day of the
review outlining the identified concerns.

Table 19f summarizes the FCR Panel’s determination regarding whether the foster parent/group care provider
adhered to the Child Placement Agreement and fulfilled all expectations for meeting child/youth/young adult
needs. For 99.1% of reviews convened during FY2024, the foster parent/group care provider was determined to
be meeting their needs.
TABLE 19f. Determinations… FY2020 FY2021 FY2022 FY2023 FY2024
19f. Has the foster parent/group care provider fulfilled all placement expectations to meet
the child/youth/young adult needs?
o For every child/youth/young adult in placement—based on all available information at the review—the
FCR Panel determines whether the foster parent/group care provider provided for the
child/youth/young adult’s safety, permanency, and well-being.
o Expectations of the foster parent/group care provider include but are not limited to:
o Providing a safe environment 98.7% 99.1% 99.0% 99.1% 99.1%
o Promoting physical, mental, and emotional well-being
o Assisting the child/youth/young adult in maximizing their potential
o Meeting the child/youth/young adult’s individual needs related to their racial, ethnic, linguistic,
cultural, and religious background
o Supporting reunification with the family, or an alternative permanent plan as indicated on the
Action Plan
Table 19g summarizes the FCR Panel’s determination regarding whether the Department took steps to ensure that
the foster parent/group care provider followed the Reasonable and Prudent Parent Standard.
o This standard is characterized by careful and sensible parental decisions that maintain the health, safety,
and best interests of a child/youth/young adult while at the same time encouraging their emotional and
developmental growth, that a caregiver shall use when determining whether to allow a child/youth/young
adult in foster care to participate in extracurricular, enrichment, cultural, and social activities (42 U.S. Code
§ 675).
For 99.6% of reviews convened during FY2024, the FCR Panel determined that DCF worked with the foster
parent/group care provider to ensure the resource followed the Reasonable and Prudent Parent Standard.
TABLE 19g. Determinations… FY2020 FY2021 FY2022 FY2023 FY2024
19g. Has DCF taken steps to ensure child/youth/young adult’s foster parent (1)
followed the Reasonable and Prudent Parent Standard?
o “Yes” is selected if DCF has worked with the foster parents to ensure that the Reasonable 99.1% 99.5% 99.3% 99.3% 99.6%
and Prudent Parent Standard was followed (i.e., careful and sensible parental decisions
that maintain the health, safety and best interest of children/youth/young adults while at
the same time encouraging their emotional and developmental growth).
(1) Reasonable and Prudent Parent Standard is presently limited to children/youth/young adults placed in a family setting
(i.e., departmental foster home or contracted foster care).

Table 19h indicates that for 98.9% of reviews convened during FY2024, the FCR Panel determined that DCF made
efforts to ascertain whether the foster parent offered the child/youth/young adult regular ongoing opportunities
to engage in age or developmentally appropriate activities.
TABLE 19h. Determinations… FY2020 FY2021 FY2022 FY2023 FY2024
19h. Has DCF taken steps to ascertain whether the foster parent offered the child/
youth/young adult regular opportunities to engage in age or developmentally
appropriate activities, working to help develop the child/youth/young adult’s
special talent/interest/gift?
o For every child/youth/young adult in foster care placement (including contracted foster 97.8% 98.0% 97.9% 98.4% 98.9%
care), the FCR Panel determines whether DCF took steps to ascertain whether the foster
parent offered the child/youth/young adult regular ongoing opportunities to engage in age
or developmentally appropriate activities, working to help develop this child/youth/young
adult's special talent/interest/gift.
Age or developmentally appropriate activities include:
o Activities or items that are generally accepted as suitable for children/youth/young adults of the same
chronological age or level of maturity, or that are determined to be developmentally‐appropriate for a
specific individual—based on the development of cognitive, emotional, physical, and behavioral capacities
that are typical for an age or age group (42 U.S. Code § 675).
Table 19i summarizes the FCR Panel’s determination regarding whether the Department completed tasks required
by policy, including but not limited to:
o Meeting with family members
o Assessing family needs
o Engaging the family in the development of an Action Plan that identifies what must be accomplished in order
to attain and maintain child/youth/young adult:
o Safety
o Permanency
o Well-Being
o Case closing
o Giving youth 14+ an opportunity to identify two persons to assist them in the development of the Action
Plan
o Ensuring a birth certificate has been secured for the child/youth/young adult
o Ensuring the father named on the birth certificate, and/or any named father is assessed and included in
Action Planning
o Recommending paternity testing as needed
o Completing needed referrals
For 88.9% of reviews convened during FY2024, the FCR Panel determined that DCF completed the tasks required
by policy to address the needs of the family in order to support child/youth/young adult safety and well‐being,
and the tasks related to achieving the Permanency Plan for the child/youth/young adult.

Table 19j summarizes FCR Panel determinations regarding whether necessary actions and essential changes for
achieving the Permanency Plan were demonstrated. These include consideration of federal ASFA guidelines such
as:
o Reasonable efforts provided in a timely manner to reunify the family
o Filing of a Termination of Parental Rights (TPR) for children/youth under age 18 who have been in care for
15 of the past 22 months—unless there is a documented exception
o Timely recruitment
Table 19j indicates that for FCRs convened during FY2024, the FCR Panel determined that 90.8% of the reviewed
Permanency Plans should be maintained. Conversely, 9.2% were determined to require an Area Office review
and/or a Permanency Planning Conference (PPC).

DETERMINATION – Maintain Permanency Plan (90.8%)
o Sufficient: Of the children/youth/young adults reviewed during FY2024, 0.1% had a Permanency Plan
determined to have been achieved and 42.3% had a Permanency Plan determined to be sufficient and
therefore should be maintained. A sufficient Permanency Plan is one in which the following criteria are met:
▪ most but not all of the essential changes have been achieved to accomplish the Permanency Plan
▪ tasks have been identified to achieve the remaining essential changes
▪ progress is being made toward reducing or eliminating identified needs/dangers/risk
o Insufficient: In 45.1% of reviews, the FCR determined that there was insufficient progress towards the
Permanency Plan but determined that circumstances warranted allowing additional time to complete tasks
and demonstrate change within the existing Permanency Plan.
o Of the Permanency Plans active at the time of the FCR, 3.3% were in effect for 45 calendar days or less. As
such, FCR Panel could not review progress and make a determination.
DETERMINATION – Change Permanency Plan (9.2%)
o The FCR Panel determined that 7.9% of the reviewed Permanency Plans should be changed.
▪ Though DCF provided services and despite allowing reasonable time, necessary or essential changes
for achieving the Permanency Plan were not made, or successfully completed, and a new Permanency
Plan is needed to meet the child/youth/young adult’s need for permanency.
o The FCR Panel determined that 0.6% of the reviewed Permanency Plans should be changed because the
Permanency Plans did not reflect casework direction.
o The FCR Panel determined that in 0.7% of the reviews convened during FY2024, circumstances had changed
and therefore the Permanency Plan was no longer relevant and should be changed.

VII. MINORITY OPINIONS
When an FCR is conducted by a three-party panel and there is lack of agreement among panel members on a given
determination, a majority of two prevails. The opinion of the FCR panel member with a differing determination is
documented as a minority opinion.8
Table 20 shows that there were 543 FCRs with a minority opinion in FY2024.

members with a minority opinion.
• FCR Case Reviewer held Minority Opinion 76 153 243 322 333
• Second Party held Minority Opinion 57 105 118 129 101
• Volunteer Panel Member held Minority Opinion 29 83 74 123 109
VIII. FOSTER CARE REVIEW FOLLOW-UP ACTIVITIES
The FCRU has three formal opportunities to follow up and address the findings of the FCR. Each opportunity serves
as a feedback mechanism for improving case-specific practice.
1. The first is within the FCR meeting itself, including the robust conversation about the case and what has
happened since the last FCR.
2. The second opportunity is through the alert notice and FCR memo processes. All Items flagged in the alert
notice and FCR memo require resolution by the Area Office. The feedback loop is closed once the FCRU or
manager receives notification that the issues have been resolved and/or a plan is in place for resolving the
alert and memo.
3. The third opportunity is through the written FCR report which is transmitted to multiple parties including
the Area Office. This memorializes the identified strengths and areas needing improvement and serves as
an additional opportunity for relevant parties to address any concerns. This report is used at the
subsequent FCR to identify areas that need to be reviewed or assessed during the FCR. The Area Office is
then charged with addressing any issues or determinations requiring remedial action.
FCR Documentation: Immediately following the FCR, the case reviewer is responsible for summarizing all
determinations and recommendations; identifying each panelist's agreement or disagreement with each of the
determinations; and documenting this information in the electronic case record. The FCR manager reviews and
approves the documentation of the FCR in the electronic case record and notifies and distributes the copies to the
assigned Social Worker, parent(s)/guardian(s); adult guardian for an incapacitated person; youth or young adult;
child, youth or young adult’s attorney; parent’s attorney; the placement resource; and the guardian ad litem, if
assigned. The assigned social worker is responsible for working with the family, youth, and young adult to update
the Action Plan for the next six months based on the FCR’s determinations.
8 When a Foster Care Review is conducted by a two-party panel and there is lack of agreement among panel members on a
given determination, the case reviewer’s determination is entered into the electronic case record. The opinion of the Foster
Care review panel member with a differing determination is documented as a minority opinion.
- 18 - MA DCF Foster Care Review Report – FY2024

Permanency Planning Conference: If the determination is made that a child, youth, or young adult’s Permanency
Plan be changed or when a majority opinion cannot be reached by a three-member panel, the Area Director
/designee coordinates with the regional counsel to convene a Permanency Planning Conference.
Alert Notice: If concerns for a child, youth, or young adult’s safety are identified during an FCR, the case reviewer
immediately notifies the FCRU manager of the concern. The FCRU manager sends an Alert Notice immediately to
the Area Director. The Area Director responsible for the case is required to document a response to the Alert
Notice within one working day. The feedback loop is considered closed once the FCRU manager receives
notification that the issues have been resolved and/or a plan is in place for resolving the alert. The FCRU is working
with IT to develop a systematic approach for automating the tracking of safety concern alert resolution. This will
permit the development and reporting of metrics. Until then, the FCRU is responsible for ensuring follow-up on
all safety concern alerts.
FCR Memo: For all other concerns identified during a Foster Care Review, the case reviewer completes a Foster
Care Review Memo (FCR Memo) that describes the concerns. Issues identified for an FCR Memo include, but are
not limited to:
• clinical issues regarding the child or youth’s placement that need immediate review;
• visitation issues, including insufficient visits to the child(ren), youth, or young adult by the social worker;
• concerns regarding medical needs;
• 51A filed by the case reviewer;
• significant delay/barrier to achieving permanency for the child(ren), youth or young adult;
• issues related to Interstate Compact;
• no legal custody of a child or youth in placement;
• no active Voluntary Placement Agreement for a young adult in placement; and

The FCR Memo is then sent within one working day to the Area Director responsible for the case and any other
agency manager who can assist in the resolution of the issue identified. The FCR Memo is also reviewed by an
FCRU manager to determine if an Alert Notice is needed. The Area Director responsible for the case must
document a response to the FCR Memo within 30 calendar days and indicate the action taken to resolve the issue.
For situations where concerns were identified at the last FCR and no action was taken, the FCRU Director sends a
notice to the Area Director or regional counsel based on the items identified by the FCR within 10 calendar days
after the Foster Care Review. The Area Director or regional counsel must then document a response to the notice
within 30 calendar days and indicate any new action taken to resolve the concern first identified and what barriers,
if any, are present that prevent the resolution of the concern.
