DPPC FY2025 Annual Report
A Message from Nancy A. Alterio, DPPC Executive Director
Dear Reader:
Thank you for taking the time to learn more about the important mission of the Disabled Persons
Protection Commission (DPPC). The DPPC is organized under Chapter 19C of the General Laws and is
charged with protecting adults with disabilities between the ages of 18 and 59 from the abusive acts or
omissions of their caregivers through investigation, oversight, public awareness, and prevention. In addition
to its own dedicated staff in the units detailed in this annual report, the DPPC relies on the support of our
referral agencies – the Department of Developmental Services (DDS), Department of Mental Health (DMH)
and MassAbility (MBY). The DPPC, our referral agencies, and other partners within the Executive Office of
Health and Human Services (EOHHS) comprise the adult protective service (APS) system in the
Commonwealth for adults with disabilities.
Fiscal Year 2025 (FY2025) was marked by transformational forward progress but bookended by fiscal
uncertainty. The DPPC’s Interagency Protective Services Integration System (IPSIS) initiative was at the
forefront of several major projects for the agency and its APS partners. Spearheaded by IPSIS, the DPPC
executed a data sharing agreement (DSA) with EOHHS and six of its constituent agencies, those being
DDS, DMH, MBY, the Departments of Public Health (DPH) and Children and Families (DCF), and the
Executive Office of Aging and Independence (AGE). The goal of the DSA is to enhance intra and
interagency data sharing via a data sharing spoke—known as the Master Data Management system or
MDM—for shared data collection, dissemination and case management during the APS intake, investigation
and oversight process. This coordinated approach will improve the provision of protective services and
associated risk response actions, particularly when the alleged victim is a common client of multiple
agencies. At the same time, IPSIS crafted a request for proposal for bids to overhaul the DPPC’s case
management system (CMS)—with an eye towards better data capture, workflows, and interface capabilities
to streamline internal processes and to strengthen external interoperability. Both projects are currently in
progress and will span into Fiscal Year 2026 (FY2026) and beyond.
With most of its staffing plan in place, the DPPC continued its staff enrichment program in FY2025. The
DPPC’s Learning and Development (L&D) unit offered multiple training opportunities for the DPPC and its
referral agencies related to abuse investigations, including its series focused on interviewing adults with
communication barriers or cognitive limitations. L&D also organized targeted media campaigns designed to
promote awareness of the role of APS and announced the release of three major initiatives supported by
the Administration for Community Living, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services: a new website,
three new training videos for investigators and first responders and a new app designed to help adults with
disabilities heal from the trauma of abuse. DPPC’s updated website, DPPCMass.gov, is centered around
accessibility and ease of use for members of the public looking for information and resources, including
reporting abuse against adults with disabilities in Massachusetts. The three training videos are instructional
on how to conduct a successful interview with adults with Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities
(IDD), Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias.

Run Date: 07.15.2025

DPPC FY2025 Annual Report
Through expert testimonials, survivor feedback and mock interviews that model real cases, each training
video informs and educates investigators on the necessity for effective, trauma-informed interviews and
guides them through proper interviewing techniques to elicit the most reliable information. DPPC’s
colleagues at the Building Partnerships for the Protection of Persons with Disabilities and Older Adults
Initiative (BPI) and the Executive Office of Aging and Independence (AGE) were key partners in creating
these videos. In addition, DPPC launched the S2 Self-Care for Survivors app, created in partnership with
adults with disabilities. The S2 app follows the launch of our R3 app that was designed to assist adults with
disabilities to Recognize, Report, and Respond to Abuse. The S2 app allows users to learn how to practice
self-care, embrace their emotions and benefit from interactive activities.
The DPPC’s Registry of Abusers of Persons with Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities (Registry)
continued to serve as a crucial safety measure in preventing recidivist abuser staff from remaining in human
services—adding 50 registered abusers to the existing list—and resulting in multiple instances of individuals
either being separated from existing positions or restricted from hire due to registry placement. The Registry
was also one aspect of a performance audit conducted by the Office of the State Auditor. After an
exhaustive, multi-year audit, no deficiencies were found in any of the areas reviewed. The DPPC is confident
in its organizational strength and thrilled to have it recognized by an outside entity after a detailed
assessment.
Unfortunately, FY2025 culminated with potential fiscal storm clouds on the horizon. With wide-scale
unease about federal revenue streams, the Commonwealth could not meet the optimal maintenance needs
of many agencies, including the DPPC. As such, the DPPC anticipates that in FY2026, the agency will need
to forgo backfilling positions lost to attrition, curtail future staff expansion, limit discretionary spending, and
potentially revisit some planned new initiatives.
Nevertheless, the DPPC is certain that the strength and fortitude of its core operations will be maintained,
thanks in no small part to the dedication of its staff and APS partners, who in FY2025, in addition to the
aforementioned, accomplished the following:
Received 19,083 hotline calls;
Received 16,973 abuse reports;
Responded to 2,421 informational and referral requests;
Recorded 1,449 death reports;
Assigned 3,234 investigations;
Completed 2,895 investigations;
Completed 86 petitions;
Responded to 733 record requests and record demands;
Oversaw protective services on 3,234 cases;
Maintained an Abuser Registry, adding 181 new Users and 14 new Employers for 34,667 Abuser
Registry searches in FY2025; and
Maintained operations 24 hours a day, seven days a week.

DPPC FY2025 Annual Report
The DPPC notes that it is not alone in its work. The DPPC and its staff heavily depend on broader APS
structure and our supporters, comprised of our referral agencies, law enforcement, the Healey
Administration, EOHHS, the Legislature, mandated reporters, and the friends and families of persons with
disabilities who share our commitment to combatting abuse in the Commonwealth. Each one of the facts
and figures reflected above represent a person—whose life was improved—because of the Commonwealth’s
robust APS family.
I appreciate your interest in our mission. And, despite some potential short-term challenges, I am confident
that the DPPC and the Commonwealth’s APS system will remain responsive and resilient in the year ahead.
Sincerely,
Nancy A. Alterio
Executive Director
Mission
The mission of the Disabled Persons Protection Commission (DPPC) is to protect adults with
disabilities from the abusive acts and omissions of their caregivers through independent
investigations, independent oversight, public awareness, and prevention.
Vision
All persons with disabilities can live their lives free from abuse and neglect.

DPPC FY2025 Annual Report
FINANCE
The Disabled Persons Protection Commission’s (DPPC) Finance Unit is primarily responsible for increasing
fiscal efficiency and enhancing the delivery of goods and services while ensuring a high level of transparency
and accountability. DPPC develops and submits annual budgets and spending plans to the Governor’s office
and Legislature to ensure the DPPC has adequate resources to receive abuse reports, investigate abuse of
persons with disabilities, and stipulate the provision of protective services. To ensure fiscal accountability,
monthly and annual fiscal reports are generated, reconciled, and reviewed by DPPC leadership. A system of
checks and balances is in place for internal controls to understand potential risks and ways to mitigate those
risks.
FY2025 Spending Summary
DPPC has proven time and time again that it is an effective and efficient organization. Every dollar received
is greatly appreciated, each one directly contributes to the protection of persons with disabilities who are
victims of abuse and neglect, and ultimately, each dollar helps save lives. As a result of the Administration’s
support of the FY2025 $12 million budget, DPPC was able to make meaningful progress in advancing its
mission and strengthening critical infrastructure.
The budget supported both strategic initiatives and increased day-to-day operating costs across all units,
ensuring the agency could meet growing demands and maintain high-quality service delivery. Key
accomplishments include the completion of the two-year hiring plan, resulting in fully staffed and trained
teams across DPPC Units. Capital investments supported a cost-effective buildout of new office space and
the expansion of the training/conference room at DPPC’s current location. These improvements, made in
collaboration with the Division of Capital Asset Management and Maintenance (DCAMM), were secured
under a new ten-year lease. Despite reductions in VOCA federal support, DPPC sustained funding for its
Sexual Assault Response (SAR) Team—now in its ninth year. This critical program continues to increase
access to trauma services for sexual assault victims with disabilities. DPPC also finalized spending from the
Coronavirus Response and Relief Supplemental Act (CRRSA) and American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) funds
from the federal Administration for Community Living to improve education and technology.
Finally, DPPC was awarded ARPA funding by the Legislature and Administration to lead an initiative
focused on improving coordination and information sharing between protective service agencies.
HUMAN RESOURCES
The Disabled Persons Protection Commission’s (DPPC) Human Resources Unit is responsible for managing
the employee life cycle, including recruiting, hiring, onboarding, and training of employees, and for
facilitating the administration of employee benefits. Services include payroll administration, benefits and
leave administration, labor and employee relations, handling of all Americans with Disabilities Act requests,
accommodations and processing, and approving all Family and Medical Leave Act requests.

HOTLINE AND INTAKE
The Disabled Persons Protection Commission’s (DPPC) Intake Unit operates a 24-hour Hotline by which
anyone can report suspected abuse of adults with disabilities by dialing 1-800-426-9009. People who are
mandated reporters are required by law to report suspected abuse to DPPC when they have a reasonable
cause to believe that a person with a disability is being abused or neglected. Mandated reporters, such as a
physician, schoolteacher or social worker, are persons whose professions make them more likely to be
aware of abuse or neglect of persons with disabilities. In August of 2021, a new online reporting system
was implemented for all Reporters both Mandated and non-Mandated. Reporters can now submit non-
emergency reports via an online reporting process 24 hours a day. The online reports are received,
reviewed, and processed by the Intake team by the next business day. State law requires caregivers to
notify the DPPC and local law enforcement of the death of any person with a disability under their care.
The DPPC Hotline, and the Intake Unit staff who operate it, are a vital part of DPPC’s efforts to protect
adults with disabilities from abuse and neglect. DPPC Intake staff, several of them bilingual, manage and
process the Hotline calls during business hours. A vendor agency which is contracted, trained, and
monitored by DPPC, answers the Hotline after hours and on weekends and holidays. DPPC staff members
are readily available to manage emergency or complicated situations 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
Additionally, all staff members are trained to communicate via Verizon’s Telecommunication Relay Service
for anyone calling in who is deaf or hard of hearing.
Staff members working on the DPPC Hotline are responsible for receiving, documenting, and evaluating
information provided by reporters. DPPC management reviews each report of abuse to determine the
response needed to ensure the safety of the individuals involved. Reports are also evaluated to determine
whether the situation meets the jurisdictional criteria for investigation under M.G.L. c. 19C.
For DPPC to investigate reported abuse committed against persons with disabilities, the enabling statute,
M.G.L. c. 19C, requires the following:
The alleged victim must be 18 to 59 years old;
The alleged victim must be disabled by means of mental illness, intellectual/developmental
disability, or physical impairment; and
The alleged victim must require the assistance of a caregiver to accomplish a daily living need because
of the disability.
Hotline staff must also examine the nature of the incident. DPPC’s enabling statute, M.G.L. c. 19C, and the
DPPC regulations, 118 CMR, require that the incident:
Include an act or omission by a caregiver; and
Result in a serious physical or serious emotional injury, or abuse per se.

DPPC FY2025 Annual Report
A member of the State Police Detective Unit (SPDU) assigned to the DPPC reviews every report made to
the DPPC Hotline. The SPDU reviews each report to determine whether the information suggests a crime
may have occurred. Suspected criminal activity is reported by the SPDU to the appropriate District
Attorney’s office for their review and determination of whether a criminal investigation is required.
Hotline Activity Reports
The chart below illustrates that during FY2025 the DPPC Hotline received 16,973 reports, not including
death reports and information and referral calls, resulting in 3,234 intakes being screened in for an abuse

Death Reports
The DPPC statute requires that any caregiver that is a state agency or an agency of any subdivision of the
Commonwealth or a private agency contracting with the Commonwealth shall immediately orally notify the
DPPC and local law enforcement of the death of any person with a disability under its care.
A written report of such deaths must also be forwarded to DPPC and local law enforcement officials within
24 hours of the death. This information is assessed to determine whether the cause of death may be
related to abuse, and if so, an investigation is conducted. Each report of a death is entered into a database
specifically for this purpose.
INVESTIGATIONS
Reports of alleged abuse that fall within the jurisdiction of the Disabled Persons Protection Commission
(DPPC), as established under M.G.L. c. 19C, are assigned to an Adult Protective Service (APS) investigator.
The APS investigator may be one of DPPC’s investigators or an investigator from the Department of
Developmental Services (DDS), Department of Mental Health (DMH) or MassAbility (MBY).
All investigators conduct DPPC abuse investigations under the authority of M.G.L. c. 19C. DPPC
regulations, 118 CMR, further clarify and operationalize the criteria established by the statute. Investigators
are at the center of DPPC’s efforts assisting in:
Assessing and remediating risk;
Collecting evidence;
Interviewing witnesses, alleged victims and abusers;
Reviewing documents;
Writing reports; and
Determining outcomes based on analysis of facts.
The most important goal of any DPPC investigation is to provide protection to anyone at risk of abuse or
neglect by their caregiver. The DPPC works collaboratively with DDS, DMH and MBY to achieve this goal
and to look for systemic issues that may contribute or lead to abuse.
On a newly assigned case, the investigator is responsible for:
Initiating contact and making an evaluation of risk;
Reporting any safety risks at the home, facility and/or program;
Assessing protective service needs;
Recommending and advocating for protective services if necessary; and
Responding appropriately to the alleged victim’s needs, for example, by contacting law enforcement,
family members, and other appropriate parties to further ensure safety.

Run Date: 07.15.2025

DPPC FY2025 Annual Report
APS investigators conduct civil, not criminal, investigations. They work in cooperation with DPPC’s
oversight officers, outside service providers, law enforcement and others to ensure that victims of abuse
are protected. Investigators collect all information necessary to develop an appropriate course of action
and make a finding on a case.
Based upon the collected information, the investigator completes an investigation report. In the report, the
investigator documents their activities and presents conclusions based on the facts. When the facts
indicate that an abusive situation exists, the investigator must include specific recommendations in the
investigation report to resolve any circumstances that create ongoing risk to the victim and other adults
with disabilities who could be affected.
OVERSIGHT
The DPPC Oversight Unit oversees cases screened in for investigation. These cases are monitored
according to the statute and regulations. The type of monitoring/oversight necessary for each case is
dependent on the nature of the situation. The Oversight Unit also works in collaboration with the State
Police Detective Unit (SPDU) assigned to the DPPC, all 19C APS investigators and with the Sexual Assault
Response (SAR) team, specialized staff within the Oversight Unit.
The overall goal of the Oversight Unit is to ensure that individuals who are identified as victims or are at
risk of abuse or neglect are protected. The Oversight Officer is available to the investigator, service
providers and law enforcement as a resource, supplementing their work and providing another perspective.
An Oversight Officer may at times conduct site visits to ensure implementation of necessary protective
services.
The DPPC Oversight Unit is primarily responsible for:
Assessing risk to victims throughout the investigative process;
Reviewing relevant historical information regarding the alleged victim, alleged abuser, or location of the
alleged abuse, to inform decisions regarding necessary protective services;
Reviewing completed 19C investigation reports for compliance with DPPC’s governing statute and
regulations;
Evaluating recommendations and protective service actions made during and as a result of an
investigation;
Ensuring that appropriate and adequate protective service measures are put in place; and
Maintaining and entering data into the DPPC case management system.

Sexual Assault Response (SAR) Team
The Sexual Assault Response (SAR) team within the Oversight Unit at DPPC was created in July 2017 thanks
to funding from the Massachusetts Office for Victim Assistance (MOVA) through the Office for Victims of
Crime, Office of Justice Programs, U.S. Department of Justice Victims of Crime Act of 1984 (VOCA). This
specialized team helps victims with disabilities access trauma services. SAR provides navigation, peer
support and clinical matching services to victims of sexual abuse. SAR works with individuals with
disabilities, families, and support teams by providing information, resources, referrals and supports. The goal
of SAR is to increase access to services for persons with disabilities to aid in their recovery from sexual
abuse.
In addition to navigation, peer support and clinical matching, SAR also benefits from a robust and active
volunteer Advisory Council. The volunteer Advisory Council’s role is to advise the DPPC in its ongoing
development of SAR. The Advisory Council members share their professional/experiential wisdom to guide
and enhance SAR operations. Advisory Council members also serve as ambassadors for SAR within the
members’ spheres of influence by acting within their own organizations to prevent and effectively respond
to sexual violence against persons with disabilities. Further, the Advisory Council members are called upon
for assistance with introductions to stakeholders in the fields of disability services and advocacy, sexual
violence, law, mental health, criminal justice, law enforcement, medical health, education, and employment.
DPPC and SAR have benefited greatly from the collective experience offered by the individual members of
the volunteer Advisory Council.
LEGAL
The DPPC Legal Unit provides legal advice and guidance on a variety of matters pertaining to the core
functions of DPPC. This includes providing general advice and support to staff investigators from DPPC,
DDS, DMH and MBY who conduct investigations on behalf of DPPC.
DPPC attorneys work in coordination with legal counsel from DDS, DMH, MBY and other agencies,
including District Attorneys’ Offices (DA), the Office of the Attorney General (AG), Executive Office of
Aging and Independence (AGE), Department of Children and Families (DCF), Department of Public Health
(DPH), Division of Professional Licensure (DPL), Department of Corrections (DOC), and the Medical
Examiner’s Office (ME).
The DPPC Legal Unit also provides information to the public about DPPC’s functions and mandate and
handles record requests and court interventions when necessary. In addition, the Legal Unit performs the
following specific functions within DPPC:
Informs and assists other state agencies regarding protective services and guardianship of adults with
disabilities;
Provides advice, support and training regarding investigation issues and legal interpretation of the
terms and mandates contained in M.G.L. c. 19C and 118 CMR;

DPPC Abuser Registry
With the passage in February 2020 of what is commonly known as Nicky/Dana’s Law, the DPPC was
tasked by the Legislature with creating and maintaining an Abuser Registry of care providers against whom
the DPPC has made a substantiated finding of registrable abuse. The DPPC Abuser Registry became
effective July 31, 2021, and is intended to protect individuals with intellectual or developmental disabilities
(I/DD) by barring care providers who have a substantiated finding of registrable abuse from working with
other persons with intellectual or developmental disabilities. A substantiated finding of registrable abuse is
a finding by the DPPC, after investigation and opportunity to appeal, that a care provider abused a person
with I/DD.
The following are the FY2025 statistics for the Abuser Registry:
14 employers were added as authorized to access the DPPC Abuser Registry
181 Individual users created accounts to check the DPPC Abuser Registry

STATE POLICE DETECTIVE UNIT
The State Police Detective Unit (SPDU) assigned to the DPPC is comprised of a Sergeant and four troopers
and became fully operational on May 1, 1998. The SPDU provides a statewide mechanism to ensure an
effective and rapid response to potential criminal complaints of abuse and neglect against persons with
disabilities by coordinating the efforts of adult protective services (APS), human services, state and local
law enforcement and the Commonwealth’s District Attorneys.
The SPDU assigned to DPPC reviews 100% of all abuse reports to DPPC’s 24-Hour Hotline. Reports
identified as criminal by the SPDU are referred to the appropriate District Attorney’s Office. As defined in
each Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) executed in each of the eleven district attorney jurisdictions,
the SPDU assigned to DPPC, the state police liaisons within each of the eleven District Attorneys’ Offices,
and the municipal police are assigned to investigate crimes committed against persons with disabilities as
determined by the District Attorney.
Within Fiscal Year 2025, the SPDU reviewed 16,168 allegations of abuse. Of the 16,168 reports reviewed,
1,050 were referred by the SPDU to the District Attorneys for further review/assignment for a criminal
investigation.

In addition to investigating criminal complaints committed against persons with disabilities, the SPDU is
actively involved in training agency staff, law enforcement and other professionals. Training is provided on
recognizing and reporting abuse, and on what to do and what not to do when abuse or a crime committed
against a person with a disability is suspected. Training of recruits and seasoned officers throughout the
Commonwealth is provided at the request of the Municipal Police Training Committee (MPTC) and the

DPPC defines prevention as: “Any action taken to prevent abuse or neglect from occurring …or any action taken
to protect the individual from risk of further abuse, once it has already occurred.” DPPC is committed to
addressing abuse and neglect committed against adults with disabilities. To accomplish this, DPPC uses
education and awareness as primary tools in its effort to prevent, recognize, report, and effectively respond
to abuse committed against persons with disabilities.
Some of DPPC’s ongoing activities include:
Curricula development and trainings designed to educate Adult Protective Services (APS), law
enforcement, mandated reporters, caregivers, persons with disabilities and other professionals regarding
the identification and reporting of abuse of persons with disabilities;
Providing consultation or information to agencies interested in the development of training and abuse
prevention programs;
Collaboration with agencies to develop presentations, programs and services related to abuse
prevention and improving the quality of life of persons with disabilities;
Development and distribution of educational materials to introduce DPPC operations, the role of
mandated reporters and indicators of abuse and neglect; and
Participation in local, statewide and national conferences to increase knowledge and share information
related to the protection of persons with disabilities.
