Importance of the Commonwealth's Community First Policy
Massachusetts has a strong history of providing a robust set of home and community-based services aimed at rebalancing
services away from nursing facilities and toward community settings. The task force members all agreed that the
Commonwealth must ensure access to community-based services so that older adults and individuals with disabilities and
mental illness are served in the most appropriate and least restrictive settings.
This task force was charged with reviewing the viability and sustainability of long-term care facilities, its recommendations
do not negate or reduce the importance of ensuring access to long term services and supports in the community, including,
but not limited to, personal care, home health, day programs and Home and Community Based Waivers. Availability of and
access to community-based services have a direct impact on the demand for facility based care. The Commonwealth’s
continued commitment to community supports is critical to ensuring that available long-term care beds can meet demand,
given the current infrastructure. (see demand model on pages 7 and 8).
The task force expressed concern over the heavy reliance on MassHealth to fund long term care and agreed that there is a
need for additional long term care financing options. The group acknowledged the Long Term Services and Supports
Feasibility Study conducted by Milliman but did not opine on the merits of the various proposals discussed in the study.

Consensus recommendations:
As part of its deliberations, the Task Force reviewed and discussed the recommendations and work completed thus far by various other
task forces established in the LTC bill, including, the Rest Home Task Force, the Assisted Living Residence Commission, and the Transitions
from Acute Care to Post Acute Care Task Force. In making its recommendations, the Task Force avoided duplicating work that had already been
done.
Rates
Ensuring funds are appropriated to support adequate rates is the most important issue for the legislature to focus on to ensure quality care and
avoid further skilled nursing facility and rest home closures. A long-term care facility’s ability to invest in quality resident care and staff is directly
tied to adequate funding.
The Commonwealth has made significant investments in both skilled nursing facilities and rest homes in the past several years. The
Commonwealth has a significant amount of data that it can rely upon to determine the adequacy of rates based upon the level of care being
provided in a specific setting. The Commonwealth should utilize this rich data set to conduct a review of the adequacy of rates. The legislature
could direct EOHHS or CHIA to conduct this analysis, in consultation with independent researchers and stakeholders.
a) The Commonwealth should review its skilled nursing facility and rest home rate setting methodology to ensure that it is rewarding and
incentivizing quality improvement, efficient placement of complex members, and other important policy goals.
b) As statutorily required, the Commonwealth should fully fund the base year update requiring the Commonwealth to pay nursing
facilities based on allowable costs no more than 2 years from the rate year.
Quality
The Commonwealth should drive sustained improvements in long-term care quality by actively collaborating on and implementing evidence-
based quality improvement initiatives focused on areas such as, but not limited to, reducing avoidable hospital admissions, safe care transitions,
reducing antipsychotic medication use, implementing falls prevention strategies, and advancing person-centered care strategies that enhance
resident outcomes, elevate care experiences, and strengthen staff engagement and satisfaction.

Consensus recommendations:
Access to Capital
The Commonwealth has an aging long-term care infrastructure. The Commonwealth must be careful to ensure existing facilities are able to
invest in that infrastructure to continue to provide adequate care. See demand model on pages 7 and 8. Skilled nursing facilities and rest homes
report lack of access to capital funding in the market for critical maintenance and large capital investments, to address things such as roof
replacement, window replacement, heating and air conditioning, on this aging infrastructure. Facilities need access to capital to plan for capital
needs and to avoid emergency repairs, current rates do not allow for adequate capital reserves.Incentives in the rate-setting method and
staffing regulations encourage facilities to prioritize staffing and defer maintenance, given available resources. Numerous nursing facilities and
rest homes have closed over the past several years due to deferred maintenance issues.
a) The Commonwealth should implement policies to increase private and public access to capital funding for long term care facilities to
support planning for ongoing maintenance and large capital investments. This could be through grant programs or through zero
interest or low interest loans.

Consensus recommendations, continued:
Workforce
Frontline caregivers are the backbone of the state’s long-term care facilities, providing vital care and companionship to our residents. Long-term
care facilities continue to uniformly identify staffing as one of their biggest challenges, especially considering recent federal immigration policies.
Many Massachusetts nursing facilities today are not able to staff to their licensed bed capacity. Nursing facilities today urgently need to hire over
5,000 direct care workers to meet the growing demand for nursing facility care, and this may increase if there is further workforce loss.
Massachusetts rest homes also struggle with recruitment and retention and compete directly with nursing facilities for staff.
a) The Commonwealth should invest in Medicaid rates for nursing facilities and DTA rates for rest homes to allow facilities to pay a more
competitive wage for frontline staff, 90% of whom are women and more than 50% of whom are people of color. The Commonwealth
should fund the LTC Workforce and Capital fund established in chapter 197 of the Acts of 2024 to:
• Fund nursing career ladder advancement through non licensed and licensed nursing roles including resident care assistant,
certified nursing assistant, certified medication aide, licensed practical nurse and registered nurse.
• Implement supervisory and leadership training programs to improve accountability, employee retention and quality of care.
b) Staffing is important to providing high quality care. The Commonwealth should consider how it can financially support and incentivize
facilities to reduce reliance on overtime and reduce use of temporary nursing staff.
c) As the Commonwealth works to address childcare, transportation, and housing issues, LTC direct care workers need to be a focus in
these broader conversations. These barriers contribute to the significant workforce challenges in the LTC industry.

Summary of data reviewed in producing recommendations
• The task force reviewed the UMass Donahue Institute demographic projections as well as a demand model for skilled nursing facility
(SNF) beds.
• The task force was interested in reviewing a demand model for rest home beds but was unable to do so given that occupancy data
is not available for rest homes
• While the demand model based on actual licensed beds demonstrated that EOHHS estimates that there will be sufficient overall
statewide SNF capacity until 2034, there was extensive discussion about drivers that would cause a bed shortage to occur earlier or later
than 2034.
• Staffing challenges resulting from new immigration or other policies, as well as an overall decline in eligible caregivers (e.g.,
available family members or paid caregivers) in the next decade and beyond, could significantly reduce the availability of beds
forcing a bed shortage earlier.
• Further skilled nursing facility (SNF) closures and full implementation of the state's dedensification regulations would cause a bed
shortage to occur earlier.
• Certain parts of the state could face a bed shortage earlier than other parts of the state. Resulting in consumer access challenges in
certain regions of the state. For example, an open bed in the Berkshires does not address the need of a patient in Haverhill.
• To maintain and balance acute to post acute flow and allow for isolation space for infectious illness, nursing facilities consistently
maintain 3 to 5 empty beds, which is equal to a facility ideally operating at 95 to 97% occupancy and not 100%.
• The Commonwealth’s continued and ongoing investment in Home and Community Based Supports and waiver programs could
cause the bed shortage to occur later, if more individuals are able to remain in the Community.
• Delivery care model shifts, such as a move towards SNF at home and increases in enrollment with Program for All -inclusive Care
for the Elderly (PACE), could cause the bed shortage to occur later or not at all.
• Delivery care model shifts in the way the Commonwealth cares for individuals, such as creating more flexibility in populations
eligible for outpatient cardiac rehabilitation or expanding clinical competency in other residential settings like substance use disorder
care could change the crossover point where supply falls short of assessed need.

• Nursing Facilities served approximately 55k residents over the course of Q1 2025 – this includes long-stay (29k) and short-stay (26k) residents
• Using UMass Population projection data and assuming no other policy changes:
• By 2030, NF are projected to serve 61k residents within a quarter
• By 2035, NF are projected to serve 67k residents within a quarter
• By 2050, NF are projected to serve 72k residents within a quarter
• The percent of NF population with BH needs is projected to remain flat – on average 22% of residents have BH needs. The commitments made
by the Commonwealth as part of the Marster's settlement will support BH residents in the community.
• Over the next 10 years there will be an increase in the number of individuals in need of dementia care. The Massachusetts
Alzheimer'sAssociation has indicated that Alzheimer's prevalence will increase by 25% in Massachusetts over the next decade

Health Professions Interactive Data Dashboards: RN and LPN
Coming
Soon!
• These dashboards provide an overview of Registered Nurse (RN) and Licensed Practical Nurse (LPN) re-licensure data from 2017 onward. Licenses are
renewed every other year and currently include data through 2023.
• These dashboards characterize the workforce from a supply perspective. They identify trends and patterns that impact access to health care professionals
and services. These tools can drill down into specific care settings, including long-term care, as well as geographic areas.
• The data helps inform long-term care health care workforce development, education, training, recruitment, and retention. It also monitors the diversity,
cultural, and linguistic competence of the workforce to meet state needs.
• The RN dashboard can be found at: https://www.mass.gov/lists/health-professions-data-series
• The LPN dashboard is anticipated to be publicly posted in fall of 2025

Facilities are currently unable to meet staffing minimums, RN staffing expected to worsen
Per 105 CMR 150, on and after April 1, 2021, sufficient staffing must include a minimum number of hours of care per resident per
day of 3.580 hours, of which at least 0.508 hours must be care provided to each resident by a registered nurse. The facility must
provide adequate nursing care to meet the needs of each resident, which may necessitate staffing that exceeds the minimum
required PPD.
Based on Q4 2024 reporting, in order for all facilities to meet
the state minimum staffing requirements, we would need to
add on average 744 nurses working 8 hours, of which 244
must be RNs, each day across Massachusetts. Note: total
nurses include RNs, LPNs, and CNAs.
Based on historical staffing trends, predictive modeling shows
an expected decline in the RN hours provided, while CNA and
LPN hours increase. Investments in nursing workforce
development pathways are critical to reversing this trend.

Summary of information discussed
• The task force discussed how difficult it is for nursing facilities and rest homes to access funding for
capital and maintenance projects given the high expenses related to accessing financing in the current
market
• Ron Pawelski, from MARCH, shared that cost of Capital rates are running as high as 9.2% for real
estate development
• Ron Pawelski shared that based on discussions with contacts in the REIT area, the strategy that most
companies are now following in the short term is to acquire distressed properties, make them more
efficient and turn a profit. Bottom line, in private equity, no one will take the risk to build in long term
care based on the cost of capital on new build.

Summary of data reviewed in producing recommendations
• The task force reviewed cost report data reported by nursing facilities on transportation costs related
to recreational/therapy activity transportation, motor vehicle depreciation expenses and motor vehicle
operation expenses
• The task forced reviewed a transportation presentation on non-emergency medical transportation
• The task force discussed that while transportation can be a friction point, it is not a significant barrier
to residents receiving care. To mitigate the issues:
• Some rest home and skilled nursing facility providers report purchasing vans that can augment
the PT-1 system
• Some rest homes reported utilizing Uber or Lyft to support members
• The group noted that should the broader financial outlook improve a grant program to support LTC
facilities’ purchase of vans would be helpful.

Memorandum
To: Massachusetts Task Force to Review the Viability and Sustainability of Long-Term Care Facilities
From: Ronald J. Pawelski, President
Massachusetts Association of Residential Care Homes
Date: July 2, 2025
Re: Proposed Recommendations
Background:
THE single biggest challenge facing Rest Homes and other LTC facilities in the Commonwealth from a viability and sustainability standpoint is addressing the decades old issue of rate adequacy.
Since 1998, 107 Rest Homes have closed (over 60% of the total population) due to financial concerns directly related to rate adequacy in payments made by the Commonwealth for caring for their
public assistance residents. Over 4,000 aged, infirm and indigents residents, many who had previously been homeless, lost their homes and were faced with the traumas associated with involuntary
transfer.
In 2019 a Nursing Facility Task Force was convened to address critical issues challenging LTC facilities in the Commonwealth. Rest Homes cited Rate Adequacy as the number one priority and
challenge to address, citing a series of proposed regulatory reforms.. Those proposed changes were never adopted. MARCH convened a Rate Committee comprised on owners, executive directors,
CPA’s and members of Clifton Larsen Allen to compile a set of recommendations. (See enclosed list of proposed regulatory reforms.)
Fast forward to today and we find, based on a survey of Rest Homes in the Commonwealth, that payments for public assistance residents lag actual Rest Home care costs by over $20 per day per
resident. In Skilled Nursing Facilities that number approaches close to $40 per day per patient. This shortfall in the rates results in organizations go before the Massachusetts legislature annually
seeking incremental funding directly competing for healthcare dollars that are in constant need by in short supply. Sadly, we have another MARCH member home that has declared their intent to
close, citing inadequate reimbursement and the inability to address required capital improvements
Rate Adequacy/ Operational Definition- Owners and executive directors of LTC facilities view rate adequacy as receiving sufficient reimbursement from the Commonwealth for their public assisted
residents where there is the ability to meet their operations responsibilities in caring for their residents, recruit and adequately pay staff to be retained, address administrative costs and have
sufficient funds to make capital Improvements to the physical plant. When the current rate does not meet the stated requirements, it will have direct implications from an operational, procedural and
regulatory standpoint in the operating of a LTC facility.
To address the issue of the rate adequacy MARCH is recommending the following regulatory, procedural and process changes.
Allocate funding (refer to the LTC insurance analysis where money was appropriated for the study) to hire an independent industry expert organization to review the existing reimbursement
regulations 101 CMR 204.00 to determine what changes would require ensuring rates are adequately and accurately developed in the staffing, other expenses and capital areas. Regulations short
of RCC-Q being enacted have not been updated in decades and do not address the issue of denied costs in rate determinations.
JULY 2025 DRAFT & Confidential – for policy development purposes only | 54
Ron Pawelski, MARCH
CHIA, dating back to the Rate Setting Commission is NOT an independent objective organization and is currently directed by the former Undersecretary of EOHHS, who in mandating RCC-Q
implementation against industry requests, was no friend to Rest Homes. A company like Clifton Larsen Allen has more employees and CPA’s with more knowledge and background (many
employed by CLA today wrote the regulations) than the current staff at CHIA.
The reimbursement regulations concerning staffing should be updated to allocate and address staff recruitment and retainment
The core issue driving this shortage is the inadequate state reimbursement rate, which places rest homes at a significant disadvantage compared to nursing homes and private duty home
health agencies.
While nursing homes receive substantially higher reimbursement and additional federal and state financial support, rest homes continue to operate under outdated and insufficient rates that
no longer reflect the true cost of care. This has severely limited our ability to offer competitive wages to direct care staff, making it nearly impossible to attract and retain qualified caregivers in
an already tight labor market.
Moreover, private duty home health agencies—many of which are unlicensed or minimally regulated—can charge premium rates for services while offering higher pay and flexible schedules
to their staff. This further drains the pool of available workers and leaves rest homes struggling to provide consistent and reliable care for some of our most vulnerable residents.
The result is a critical staffing shortage that threatens the sustainability of the rest home model—a model that fills an essential gap in the continuum of elder care by providing safe, dignified,
and cost-effective services for residents who do not meet the clinical threshold for nursing homes but are no longer able to live independently.
We urge the Commonwealth to immediately review and increase the reimbursement rates for rest homes to a level that allows us to remain viable and competitive in today’s healthcare labor
market. Without swift action, many rest homes will be forced to reduce services or close altogether, leading to displacement of residents and increased strain on other parts of the healthcare
system.
Adding to the strain is the fact that hospitals are increasingly hiring "sitters" or one-on-one companions—often without requiring certification—for behavioral support and patient supervision.
These positions offer caregivers substantially higher hourly rates than any rest homes can afford. As a result, the already limited pool of available caregivers is further depleted, leaving rest
homes unable to staff appropriately and putting the quality of resident care at risk. Our facility lost few staff members in recent week for hospital sitter at a rate that we cannot touch.
Furthermore, to counter the ever -growing aging in place population in Rest Homes, the increases incurred to hire additional RN’s LPN’s and CNA’s should be immediately reimbursable
requiring immediate rate increases
▪ Capital Improvement:
o Allow for immediate rate increases when DPH orders capital improvements per their surveys.
▪ Base Year Calculation:
o Modify the cost report process to reimburse based on most current and actual costs as opposed to a two year + delay in promulgating new rates.
▪ Prospective vs. Retrospective Rate Determinations.
o Review option of reverting back to a prospective vs retrospective rate process Refer to process prior to 2006.
▪ Incorporate recommendations presented to the NF Task Force – see below
▪ Suspend RCC-Q functions until independent auditor report weights in on fiscal impact and benefit.
▪ Rate Appeals
o Incorporate DALA appeal process into mainstream where rate changes can be enacted in a timely fashion. (Timely defined as 6 months or less)

Proposed Policy Changes to Rest Home Rates and Reimbursement
Submitted by the Massachusetts Association of Residential Care Homes (MARCH) to the
Executive Office of Health and Human Services (EOHHS)
The purpose of this document is to propose changes to regulation 101CMR 204.00 that detail rules and regulations governing allowable costs and formulas used in setting rest home
reimbursement rates.The submission is in response to an invitation by representatives of EOHHS and the Executive Office of Elder Affairs (EOEA) to submit proposed changes pursuant to a
meeting held to discuss the future of Rest Homes in the Commonwealth. MARCH formed a Rate and Reimbursement Committee to develop the following response to EOHHS and EOEA:
Introduction: The overarching goals for the suggested changes are to ensure Rest Homes are compensated adequately by the Commonwealth for the care they provide to the aged, infirm and
indigent population of Massachusetts and to preserve people’s HOMES. MARCH’s mandate is to ensure that no additional Rest Home is forced to close purely for financial reasons, resulting in
residents losing their homes. Since 1998, 102 Rest Homes have closed displacing over 4,000 residents, subjecting them to the trauma associated with involuntary transfer.
Proposed Change #1 - Reimburse based on current and actual costs: MARCH advocates rolling the base year annually to ensure rates reflect a better determination of costs. Rolling the base year
annually also provides the industry will a predictable revenue stream to more effectively manage their businesses. When reimbursement trails actual costs, Rest Homes are forced and expected to
absorb these costs until the base year is rolled. The current process promotes instability in the industry. We are seeking a process that is predictable and promotes the reimbursement of current
costs.
Proposed Change Number #2- Recognize financial impact of Federal and State Regulatory Changes: EMAC, Minimum wage, Family Leave Act: The introduction of mandated changes in the form
of taxes and fees places an unfair and undue burden on these small businesses. Rest Homes are forced to comply with these mandated changes without any regard to the financial impact they will
have with their operations. MARCH advocates that there be provisions in the regulations to apply for immediate rate increases to comply with these required changes. These unplanned taxes
represent the single largest concern voiced by MARCH members.
Proposed Change Number #3- Reimburse for incremental staffing requirements to address the Aging-In-Place issues and homes with increasing dementia care populations: To address an ever -
increasing aging-in-place population, Rest Homes hire licensed nursing staff to address the increased direct care needs of their residents. MARCH is requesting that these increased payroll costs
are addressed as immediate adjustments to a rest home’s rate, rather than wait to be compensated as part of a base year roll. The same case can be made for those homes that have a dementia
population that require more direct care needs.
JULY 2025 DRAFT & Confidential – for policy development purposes only | 56
Ron Pawelski, MARCH
Proposed Change Number #4 Provide immediate rate relief for mandated changes per Department of Public Health Survey: Based on DPH licensure surveys, Rest Homes are required to submit
plans of correction and implement said plans of correction within 90 days. Given the extent and nature of the required compliance actions, some homes have not been able to secure the finances to
make the required changes. Several homes have been forced to close as a result. MARCH is proposing that immediate rate relief and rate adjustments be made to facilitate implementing required
plans of correction and thereby ensuring rest homes are not forced to close.
Proposed Change #5 Create Direct Care Add-On Provision: Unlike the nursing facility industry, Rest Homes have not received a direct care add to their rates. However, like nursing facilities, Rest
Homes have the same challenges with recruitment and retention. MARCH is requesting that provisions in the rate and reimbursement policies recognize this need and create a direct care add-on
provision for Rest Homes
Proposed Change #6 Change Occupancy Requirement from 94% to actual patient days: The patient day utilization factor should be the actual patient days, not the 94% that is imputed for the
rate calculations. Facilities that have a census that is lower than the 94% as indicated, are negatively impacted by this step-up in the use of this calculation. There are many reasons that a census
could be low in any given year. This could happen by a large turnover possibly due to death and/or renovations that temporarily prevent admissions etc... which creates open census days. The
result is that facilities are financially penalized by this variable cost divisor that has a major impact on the ability to successfully operate. The variable cost divisor should be the actual census days to
determine the variable cost allowance per diem
Proposed Change #7 Change the reimbursable basis in the sale of a Rest Home: Another major issue for the survival of the industry is the ability to sell a facility to a non-related individual or
entity and have these costs for the new owner reimbursable. The current regulation stipulates that the new owner inherits the adjusted basis from the previous owner. In most cases, there is minimal
or no basis to be recognized for reimbursement by the new owner. There would be no reimbursement for the purchase price of the facility as well as the debt service related to this. This discourages
the future continuation of many facilities as the real estate is sold as such and not for residential care.
Proposed Change #8 Increase rest home bed rate for SNFs with rest home Beds- When Skilled Nursing Facilities and free- standing Rest Homes receive rate increases, these 23+ facilities have
not received rate increases. Provisions should be made to have this small group received adjusted rate increases.
Proposed Change #9 High Percentage of Publicly Assisted Residents- Provide a slightly higher rate increase for those Rest Homes with a high, (defined as greater than 95% of their resident
population) public assistance census.
Other: Availability of no interest- low interest loans: While not regulatory based, a major financial concern is the ability to secure loans to make required capital improvements and/or hire additional
staffing to care for the residents. MARCH can point to a series of homes that would still be operating if they were able to secure the needed capital.
MARCH would welcome the opportunity to review this document with all concerned parties. It is also our intent to bring these proposed changes to the Stabilization Task Force established by the
legislature.

MARCH believes that monies should be allocated to complete a more detailed supply and demand analysis rather than relying on one data source.
Segment II: Current State vs. Future State This is the analytical segment designed to identify the current supply of Acute Hospital beds, SNF Beds, Rest
Home Beds and Assisted Living and current utilization by HSA area. Suggested analysis would includenumber patients awaiting placement in acute settings
current occupancy levels in the LTC settings and current demographics. The Future State would be an analysis and projections of where LTC services will be
required and in what amount
For "Current State":
- For the HSA areas, suggest using the American Community Survey (ACS - gov't data; free) to understand the current population, incomes, etc. for demographic
underpinnings. This data comes in at an extremely micro level geographic level - with ability I believe to roll it up to HSAs
- For AL+ NC communities: NIC is for existing communities as well as the upcoming supply pipeline (https://www.nic.org/) While not full MA coverage - they have
10 out of 14 counties, the more rural ones tend to lack data. Asuggested approach is to request a custom study from LivingPath (https://www.livingpath.com/)
which would probably be pricey but should be considered.
NIC has County-level and MSA level data on occupancy and rate across the major groups - IL, AL, NC. They also have a time series of closures / unit reductions
available in their data. (I don’t think RH data shows up anywhere, but we have a listing by city/town geographic area that could be added)
The approachwould be to do a baseline overlay by HSA that shows the Hospitals, SNF;s, Rest Homes and ALRs showing their current occupancy levels, the
2000 patients in hospitals awaiting placement, plotting out the locations, unit counts, year built, etc. Hospital data probably exist somewhere but not sure where.
JULY 2025 DRAFT & Confidential – for policy development purposes only | 58
Ron Pawelski, MARCH
For "Future State"
- Demographics: Companies like Experian and Claritas have 5 year forward looking estimates at the same ACS micro level. They may have population by age
projections and incomes. Other sources could be Moody's or Oxford Economics if state/county level outlooks are suggested. Should have 65+ population
- New Supply: NIC + Dodge Data & Analytics (fka McGraw-Hill Construction -have the supply pipelines. Dodge is included in an NIC subscription, but
I don’t know if the state has a subscription. If not, this might be a suggested and required addition..
- Demand: Penetration Rate (80+ pop / occupied units)? usually 10-12% is the number. So, for every ten 80+ people, 1 new unit is required.
Would see these all as key indicators in trying to determine demand by HSA area by LTC discipline.
As it relates to Rest Homes, we know the occupancy level hovers around 90% and we know the total capacity of the industry. Our demographic information
provided in the RH Task Force shows our average age is 75.
Note: Supply and Demand analysis that is presented for SNF’s was NOT included in the Rest Home Task Force reporting. As such, time and attention should have
been allocated to complete the same analysis that is provided for SNF’s. It does not duplicate information. L
In listing the closure information for Rest Homes, I think it is important to show the % of the industry that has closed, over 60 % of the total, based on rate adequacy.

Christine Bishop, Brandeis University
Christine Bishop further recommended that the rate setting method and regulatory actions should avoid
overly penalizing high-Medicaid facilities that are making a good-faith effort to respond to the incentives of
the system, but face challenges due to long-term underfunding for capital projects and other infrastructure.

Key Definitions
Rest Home: a residential care facility that provides 24-hour supervision and supportive services for aged, infirm, and at times
indigent populations, who may have difficulty in caring for themselves, but do not routinely require nursing care. Rest homes
provide housing, meals, activities, and arrange and coordinate medical services for individuals who need a supportive living
arrangement. Rest homes are licensed by the Massachusetts Department of Public Health (DPH).
– Some rest home beds, classified as “Level IV” beds, are located within skilled nursing facilities (SNFs), which are
considered “multi-level” or “hybrid” facilities.
– Per 105 CMR 150.00 Standards for Long Term Care Facilities, religious order homes do not require a license from DPH
to operate. These homes must meet all local health and safety requirements.
Nursing Facility: alternatively known as “skilled nursing facilities” (SNFs), nursing facilities are supportive living environments
for aged or infirm residents that provides a wide range of health and personal care services. Services at nursing facilities focus
more on medical care than most rest home or assisted living facilities, and may include rehabilitation services, such as
physical, occupational, and speech therapy. Similar to rest homes, nursing facilities are licensed by DPH.
Assisted Living Residence: private residences that offer housing, meals, and personal care services to aging adults who live
independently. Assisted living residences (ALRs) are certified by the Executive Office of Aging & Independence (AGE) and are
designed for adults who can live independently in a home-like environment but may need help with daily activities such as
housekeeping, meal preparation, bathing, dressing, and/or medication assistance. ALRs do not provide medical or nursing
services and are not designed for people who need serious medical care. Most assisted living residents pay fees privately, and
the cost for each ALR can vary depending on the size, services, and location of the residence.

Key Definitions (cont.)
RCC-Q: the Resident Care Cost Quotient (RCC-Q) is a methodology for tracking spending across rest homes, including
investments in direct care staff, infection control, and other resident care related expenditures that have a direct and
meaningful impact on overall resident quality of life, health, and wellbeing. The RCC-Q serves as a mechanism to
strengthen resident quality of care by holding rest homes financially accountable for managing their revenue and investing
in resident care related costs, including direct care staffing.
DCC-Q: similar to the RCC-Q for rest homes, the Direct Care Cost Quotient (DCC-Q) is a methodology for tracking
spending at nursing facilities, the key difference being that nursing facilities are not permitted to include the salaries for
administrators, executive directors, and responsible parties (RPs) in their reporting as direct care staff.

Sustainability and Viability of
Long-Term Care Report
Executive Office of Health and Human Services
July 2025
DRAFT & CONFIDENTIAL; FOR POLICY DEVELOPMENT PURPOSES ONLY

Legislative Language, Section 31 of Chapter 197 of the acts of 2024
• Review the viability and sustainability of long-term care facilities in the commonwealth. Report due
July 31, 2025.
In making recommendations, the task force shall consider issues including, but not limited to:
• (i) the demand for long-term care facilities over the next 5 and 10 years and the ability to meet that
demand in a cost-effective manner;
• (ii) the geographic accessibility of such facilities;
• (iii) staffing challenges and workforce initiatives to support such facilities including, but not limited
to, childcare;
• (iv) the utilization of pharmacists and other health care providers in long-term care;
• (v) any policy reforms to strengthen long-term care in the commonwealth including, but not limited
to, maintaining quality of care;
• (vi) the adequacy of payor rates;
• (vii) costs and impacts of financing for facility construction and maintenance including, but not
limited to, private equity and real estate investment trusts;
• (viii) costs associated with transportation options to and from facilities for individuals

Importance of the Commonwealth's Community First Policy
Massachusetts has a strong history of providing a robust set of home and community-based services aimed at rebalancing
services away from nursing facilities and toward community settings. The task force members all agreed that the
Commonwealth must ensure access to community-based services so that older adults and individuals with disabilities and
mental illness are served in the most appropriate and least restrictive settings.
This task force was charged with reviewing the viability and sustainability of long-term care facilities, its recommendations
do not negate or reduce the importance of ensuring access to long term services and supports in the community, including,
but not limited to, personal care, home health, day programs and Home and Community Based Waivers. Availability of and
access to community-based services have a direct impact on the demand for facility based care. The Commonwealth’s
continued commitment to community supports is critical to ensuring that available long-term care beds can meet demand,
given the current infrastructure. (see demand model on pages 7 and 8).
The task force expressed concern over the heavy reliance on MassHealth to fund long term care and agreed that there is a
need for additional long term care financing options. The group acknowledged the Long Term Services and Supports
Feasibility Study conducted by Milliman but did not opine on the merits of the various proposals discussed in the study.

Consensus recommendations:
As part of its deliberations, the Task Force reviewed and discussed the recommendations and work completed thus far by various other
task forces established in the LTC bill, including, the Rest Home Task Force, the Assisted Living Residence Commission, and the Transitions
from Acute Care to Post Acute Care Task Force. In making its recommendations, the Task Force avoided duplicating work that had already been
done.
Rates
Ensuring funds are appropriated to support adequate rates is the most important issue for the legislature to focus on to ensure quality care and
avoid further skilled nursing facility and rest home closures. A long-term care facility’s ability to invest in quality resident care and staff is directly
tied to adequate funding.
The Commonwealth has made significant investments in both skilled nursing facilities and rest homes in the past several years. The
Commonwealth has a significant amount of data that it can rely upon to determine the adequacy of rates based upon the level of care being
provided in a specific setting. The Commonwealth should utilize this rich data set to conduct a review of the adequacy of rates. The legislature
could direct EOHHS or CHIA to conduct this analysis, in consultation with independent researchers and stakeholders.
a) The Commonwealth should review its skilled nursing facility and rest home rate setting methodology to ensure that it is rewarding and
incentivizing quality improvement, efficient placement of complex members, and other important policy goals.
b) As statutorily required, the Commonwealth should fully fund the base year update requiring the Commonwealth to pay nursing
facilities based on allowable costs no more than 2 years from the rate year.
Quality
The Commonwealth should drive sustained improvements in long-term care quality by actively collaborating on and implementing evidence-
based quality improvement initiatives focused on areas such as, but not limited to, reducing avoidable hospital admissions, safe care transitions,
reducing antipsychotic medication use, implementing falls prevention strategies, and advancing person-centered care strategies that enhance
resident outcomes, elevate care experiences, and strengthen staff engagement and satisfaction.
JULY 2025 DRAFT & Confidential – for policy development purposes only | 3

Consensus recommendations:
Access to Capital
The Commonwealth has an aging long-term care infrastructure. The Commonwealth must be careful to ensure existing facilities are able to
invest in that infrastructure to continue to provide adequate care. See demand model on pages 7 and 8. Skilled nursing facilities and rest homes
report lack of access to capital funding in the market for critical maintenance and large capital investments, to address things such as roof
replacement, window replacement, heating and air conditioning, on this aging infrastructure. Facilities need access to capital to plan for capital
needs and to avoid emergency repairs, current rates do not allow for adequate capital reserves.Incentives in the rate-setting method and
staffing regulations encourage facilities to prioritize staffing and defer maintenance, given available resources. Numerous nursing facilities and
rest homes have closed over the past several years due to deferred maintenance issues.
a) The Commonwealth should implement policies to increase private and public access to capital funding for long term care facilities to
support planning for ongoing maintenance and large capital investments. This could be through grant programs or through zero
interest or low interest loans.
JULY 2025 DRAFT & Confidential – for policy development purposes only | 4

Consensus recommendations, continued:
Workforce
Frontline caregivers are the backbone of the state’s long-term care facilities, providing vital care and companionship to our residents. Long-term
care facilities continue to uniformly identify staffing as one of their biggest challenges, especially considering recent federal immigration policies.
Many Massachusetts nursing facilities today are not able to staff to their licensed bed capacity. Nursing facilities today urgently need to hire over
5,000 direct care workers to meet the growing demand for nursing facility care, and this may increase if there is further workforce loss.
Massachusetts rest homes also struggle with recruitment and retention and compete directly with nursing facilities for staff.
a) The Commonwealth should invest in Medicaid rates for nursing facilities and DTA rates for rest homes to allow facilities to pay a more
competitive wage for frontline staff, 90% of whom are women and more than 50% of whom are people of color. The Commonwealth
should fund the LTC Workforce and Capital fund established in chapter 197 of the Acts of 2024 to:
• Fund nursing career ladder advancement through non licensed and licensed nursing roles including resident care assistant,
certified nursing assistant, certified medication aide, licensed practical nurse and registered nurse.
• Implement supervisory and leadership training programs to improve accountability, employee retention and quality of care.
b) Staffing is important to providing high quality care. The Commonwealth should consider how it can financially support and incentivize
facilities to reduce reliance on overtime and reduce use of temporary nursing staff.
c) As the Commonwealth works to address childcare, transportation, and housing issues, LTC direct care workers need to be a focus in
these broader conversations. These barriers contribute to the significant workforce challenges in the LTC industry.

in a cost-effective manner
JULY 2025 DRAFT & Confidential – for policy development purposes only | 6

Summary of data reviewed in producing recommendations
• The task force reviewed the UMass Donahue Institute demographic projections as well as a demand model for skilled nursing facility
(SNF) beds.
• The task force was interested in reviewing a demand model for rest home beds but was unable to do so given that occupancy data
is not available for rest homes
• While the demand model based on actual licensed beds demonstrated that EOHHS estimates that there will be sufficient overall
statewide SNF capacity until 2034, there was extensive discussion about drivers that would cause a bed shortage to occur earlier or later
than 2034.
• Staffing challenges resulting from new immigration or other policies, as well as an overall decline in eligible caregivers (e.g.,
available family members or paid caregivers) in the next decade and beyond, could significantly reduce the availability of beds
forcing a bed shortage earlier.
• Further skilled nursing facility (SNF) closures and full implementation of the state's dedensification regulations would cause a bed
shortage to occur earlier.
• Certain parts of the state could face a bed shortage earlier than other parts of the state. Resulting in consumer access challenges in
certain regions of the state. For example, an open bed in the Berkshires does not address the need of a patient in Haverhill.
• To maintain and balance acute to post acute flow and allow for isolation space for infectious illness, nursing facilities consistently
maintain 3 to 5 empty beds, which is equal to a facility ideally operating at 95 to 97% occupancy and not 100%.
• The Commonwealth’s continued and ongoing investment in Home and Community Based Supports and waiver programs could
cause the bed shortage to occur later, if more individuals are able to remain in the Community.
• Delivery care model shifts, such as a move towards SNF at home and increases in enrollment with Program for All -inclusive Care
for the Elderly (PACE), could cause the bed shortage to occur later or not at all.
• Delivery care model shifts in the way the Commonwealth cares for individuals, such as creating more flexibility in populations
eligible for outpatient cardiac rehabilitation or expanding clinical competency in other residential settings like substance use disorder
care could change the crossover point where supply falls short of assessed need.

residents BH population
• Nursing Facilities served approximately 55k residents over the course of Q1 2025 – this includes long-stay (29k) and short-stay (26k) residents
• Using UMass Population projection data and assuming no other policy changes:
• By 2030, NF are projected to serve 61k residents within a quarter
• By 2035, NF are projected to serve 67k residents within a quarter
• By 2050, NF are projected to serve 72k residents within a quarter
• The percent of NF population with BH needs is projected to remain flat – on average 22% of residents have BH needs. The commitments made
by the Commonwealth as part of the Marster's settlement will support BH residents in the community.
• Over the next 10 years there will be an increase in the number of individuals in need of dementia care. The Massachusetts
Alzheimer'sAssociation has indicated that Alzheimer's prevalence will increase by 25% in Massachusetts over the next decade

Nursing Facility Bed Projection
• As Q1 2025, Nursing Facilities had 39,899 staffed beds – model assumes no change to bed count Key Considerations:
• On average, a single NF bed will see approximately 1.6 residents within a quarter due to turnover and
This projection is based on assuming the
short-stay residents
following key considerations remain the same
• This is based on occupancy and residents per bed data over time.
• This does not account for any changes in the average duration of stay If they do change over time each could move
the red line (indicating the bed availability
• Given the NF population projections, EOHHS estimates that there will be sufficient capacity until 2034

Health Professions Interactive Data Dashboards: RN and LPN
Coming
Soon!
• These dashboards provide an overview of Registered Nurse (RN) and Licensed Practical Nurse (LPN) re-licensure data from 2017 onward. Licenses are
renewed every other year and currently include data through 2023.
• These dashboards characterize the workforce from a supply perspective. They identify trends and patterns that impact access to health care professionals
and services. These tools can drill down into specific care settings, including long-term care, as well as geographic areas.
• The data helps inform long-term care health care workforce development, education, training, recruitment, and retention. It also monitors the diversity,
cultural, and linguistic competence of the workforce to meet state needs.
• The RN dashboard can be found at: https://www.mass.gov/lists/health-professions-data-series
• The LPN dashboard is anticipated to be publicly posted in fall of 2025

Facilities are currently unable to meet staffing minimums, RN staffing expected to worsen
Per 105 CMR 150, on and after April 1, 2021, sufficient staffing must include a minimum number of hours of care per resident per
day of 3.580 hours, of which at least 0.508 hours must be care provided to each resident by a registered nurse. The facility must
provide adequate nursing care to meet the needs of each resident, which may necessitate staffing that exceeds the minimum
required PPD.
Based on Q4 2024 reporting, in order for all facilities to meet
the state minimum staffing requirements, we would need to
add on average 744 nurses working 8 hours, of which 244
must be RNs, each day across Massachusetts. Note: total
nurses include RNs, LPNs, and CNAs.
Based on historical staffing trends, predictive modeling shows
an expected decline in the RN hours provided, while CNA and
LPN hours increase. Investments in nursing workforce
development pathways are critical to reversing this trend.

Summary of information discussed
• The task force discussed how difficult it is for nursing facilities and rest homes to access funding for
capital and maintenance projects given the high expenses related to accessing financing in the current
market
• Ron Pawelski, from MARCH, shared that cost of Capital rates are running as high as 9.2% for real
estate development
• Ron Pawelski shared that based on discussions with contacts in the REIT area, the strategy that most
companies are now following in the short term is to acquire distressed properties, make them more
efficient and turn a profit. Bottom line, in private equity, no one will take the risk to build in long term
care based on the cost of capital on new build.

Summary of data reviewed in producing recommendations
• The task force reviewed cost report data reported by nursing facilities on transportation costs related
to recreational/therapy activity transportation, motor vehicle depreciation expenses and motor vehicle
operation expenses
• The task forced reviewed a transportation presentation on non-emergency medical transportation
• The task force discussed that while transportation can be a friction point, it is not a significant barrier
to residents receiving care. To mitigate the issues:
• Some rest home and skilled nursing facility providers report purchasing vans that can augment
the PT-1 system
• Some rest homes reported utilizing Uber or Lyft to support members
• The group noted that should the broader financial outlook improve a grant program to support LTC
facilities’ purchase of vans would be helpful.

Ron Pawelski, MARCH
Memorandum
To: Massachusetts Task Force to Review the Viability and Sustainability of Long-Term Care Facilities
From: Ronald J. Pawelski, President
Massachusetts Association of Residential Care Homes
Date: July 2, 2025
Re: Proposed Recommendations
Background:
THE single biggest challenge facing Rest Homes and other LTC facilities in the Commonwealth from a viability and sustainability standpoint is addressing the decades old issue of rate adequacy.
Since 1998, 107 Rest Homes have closed (over 60% of the total population) due to financial concerns directly related to rate adequacy in payments made by the Commonwealth for caring for their
public assistance residents. Over 4,000 aged, infirm and indigents residents, many who had previously been homeless, lost their homes and were faced with the traumas associated with involuntary
transfer.
In 2019 a Nursing Facility Task Force was convened to address critical issues challenging LTC facilities in the Commonwealth. Rest Homes cited Rate Adequacy as the number one priority and
challenge to address, citing a series of proposed regulatory reforms.. Those proposed changes were never adopted. MARCH convened a Rate Committee comprised on owners, executive directors,
CPA’s and members of Clifton Larsen Allen to compile a set of recommendations. (See enclosed list of proposed regulatory reforms.)
Fast forward to today and we find, based on a survey of Rest Homes in the Commonwealth, that payments for public assistance residents lag actual Rest Home care costs by over $20 per day per
resident. In Skilled Nursing Facilities that number approaches close to $40 per day per patient. This shortfall in the rates results in organizations go before the Massachusetts legislature annually
seeking incremental funding directly competing for healthcare dollars that are in constant need by in short supply. Sadly, we have another MARCH member home that has declared their intent to
close, citing inadequate reimbursement and the inability to address required capital improvements
Rate Adequacy/ Operational Definition- Owners and executive directors of LTC facilities view rate adequacy as receiving sufficient reimbursement from the Commonwealth for their public assisted
residents where there is the ability to meet their operations responsibilities in caring for their residents, recruit and adequately pay staff to be retained, address administrative costs and have
sufficient funds to make capital Improvements to the physical plant. When the current rate does not meet the stated requirements, it will have direct implications from an operational, procedural and
regulatory standpoint in the operating of a LTC facility.
To address the issue of the rate adequacy MARCH is recommending the following regulatory, procedural and process changes.
Allocate funding (refer to the LTC insurance analysis where money was appropriated for the study) to hire an independent industry expert organization to review the existing reimbursement
regulations 101 CMR 204.00 to determine what changes would require ensuring rates are adequately and accurately developed in the staffing, other expenses and capital areas. Regulations short
of RCC-Q being enacted have not been updated in decades and do not address the issue of denied costs in rate determinations.
JULY 2025 DRAFT & Confidential – for policy development purposes only | 54

Ron Pawelski, MARCH
CHIA, dating back to the Rate Setting Commission is NOT an independent objective organization and is currently directed by the former Undersecretary of EOHHS, who in mandating RCC-Q
implementation against industry requests, was no friend to Rest Homes. A company like Clifton Larsen Allen has more employees and CPA’s with more knowledge and background (many
employed by CLA today wrote the regulations) than the current staff at CHIA.
The reimbursement regulations concerning staffing should be updated to allocate and address staff recruitment and retainment
The core issue driving this shortage is the inadequate state reimbursement rate, which places rest homes at a significant disadvantage compared to nursing homes and private duty home
health agencies.
While nursing homes receive substantially higher reimbursement and additional federal and state financial support, rest homes continue to operate under outdated and insufficient rates that
no longer reflect the true cost of care. This has severely limited our ability to offer competitive wages to direct care staff, making it nearly impossible to attract and retain qualified caregivers in
an already tight labor market.
Moreover, private duty home health agencies—many of which are unlicensed or minimally regulated—can charge premium rates for services while offering higher pay and flexible schedules
to their staff. This further drains the pool of available workers and leaves rest homes struggling to provide consistent and reliable care for some of our most vulnerable residents.
The result is a critical staffing shortage that threatens the sustainability of the rest home model—a model that fills an essential gap in the continuum of elder care by providing safe, dignified,
and cost-effective services for residents who do not meet the clinical threshold for nursing homes but are no longer able to live independently.
We urge the Commonwealth to immediately review and increase the reimbursement rates for rest homes to a level that allows us to remain viable and competitive in today’s healthcare labor
market. Without swift action, many rest homes will be forced to reduce services or close altogether, leading to displacement of residents and increased strain on other parts of the healthcare
system.
Adding to the strain is the fact that hospitals are increasingly hiring "sitters" or one-on-one companions—often without requiring certification—for behavioral support and patient supervision.
These positions offer caregivers substantially higher hourly rates than any rest homes can afford. As a result, the already limited pool of available caregivers is further depleted, leaving rest
homes unable to staff appropriately and putting the quality of resident care at risk. Our facility lost few staff members in recent week for hospital sitter at a rate that we cannot touch.
Furthermore, to counter the ever -growing aging in place population in Rest Homes, the increases incurred to hire additional RN’s LPN’s and CNA’s should be immediately reimbursable
requiring immediate rate increases
▪ Capital Improvement:
o Allow for immediate rate increases when DPH orders capital improvements per their surveys.
▪ Base Year Calculation:
o Modify the cost report process to reimburse based on most current and actual costs as opposed to a two year + delay in promulgating new rates.
▪ Prospective vs. Retrospective Rate Determinations.
o Review option of reverting back to a prospective vs retrospective rate process Refer to process prior to 2006.
▪ Incorporate recommendations presented to the NF Task Force – see below
▪ Suspend RCC-Q functions until independent auditor report weights in on fiscal impact and benefit.
▪ Rate Appeals
o Incorporate DALA appeal process into mainstream where rate changes can be enacted in a timely fashion. (Timely defined as 6 months or less)

Proposed Policy Changes to Rest Home Rates and Reimbursement
Submitted by the Massachusetts Association of Residential Care Homes (MARCH) to the
Executive Office of Health and Human Services (EOHHS)
The purpose of this document is to propose changes to regulation 101CMR 204.00 that detail rules and regulations governing allowable costs and formulas used in setting rest home
reimbursement rates.The submission is in response to an invitation by representatives of EOHHS and the Executive Office of Elder Affairs (EOEA) to submit proposed changes pursuant to a
meeting held to discuss the future of Rest Homes in the Commonwealth. MARCH formed a Rate and Reimbursement Committee to develop the following response to EOHHS and EOEA:
Introduction: The overarching goals for the suggested changes are to ensure Rest Homes are compensated adequately by the Commonwealth for the care they provide to the aged, infirm and
indigent population of Massachusetts and to preserve people’s HOMES. MARCH’s mandate is to ensure that no additional Rest Home is forced to close purely for financial reasons, resulting in
residents losing their homes. Since 1998, 102 Rest Homes have closed displacing over 4,000 residents, subjecting them to the trauma associated with involuntary transfer.
Proposed Change #1 - Reimburse based on current and actual costs: MARCH advocates rolling the base year annually to ensure rates reflect a better determination of costs. Rolling the base year
annually also provides the industry will a predictable revenue stream to more effectively manage their businesses. When reimbursement trails actual costs, Rest Homes are forced and expected to
absorb these costs until the base year is rolled. The current process promotes instability in the industry. We are seeking a process that is predictable and promotes the reimbursement of current
costs.
Proposed Change Number #2- Recognize financial impact of Federal and State Regulatory Changes: EMAC, Minimum wage, Family Leave Act: The introduction of mandated changes in the form
of taxes and fees places an unfair and undue burden on these small businesses. Rest Homes are forced to comply with these mandated changes without any regard to the financial impact they will
have with their operations. MARCH advocates that there be provisions in the regulations to apply for immediate rate increases to comply with these required changes. These unplanned taxes
represent the single largest concern voiced by MARCH members.
Proposed Change Number #3- Reimburse for incremental staffing requirements to address the Aging-In-Place issues and homes with increasing dementia care populations: To address an ever -
increasing aging-in-place population, Rest Homes hire licensed nursing staff to address the increased direct care needs of their residents. MARCH is requesting that these increased payroll costs
are addressed as immediate adjustments to a rest home’s rate, rather than wait to be compensated as part of a base year roll. The same case can be made for those homes that have a dementia
population that require more direct care needs.

Ron Pawelski, MARCH
Proposed Change Number #4 Provide immediate rate relief for mandated changes per Department of Public Health Survey: Based on DPH licensure surveys, Rest Homes are required to submit
plans of correction and implement said plans of correction within 90 days. Given the extent and nature of the required compliance actions, some homes have not been able to secure the finances to
make the required changes. Several homes have been forced to close as a result. MARCH is proposing that immediate rate relief and rate adjustments be made to facilitate implementing required
plans of correction and thereby ensuring rest homes are not forced to close.
Proposed Change #5 Create Direct Care Add-On Provision: Unlike the nursing facility industry, Rest Homes have not received a direct care add to their rates. However, like nursing facilities, Rest
Homes have the same challenges with recruitment and retention. MARCH is requesting that provisions in the rate and reimbursement policies recognize this need and create a direct care add-on
provision for Rest Homes
Proposed Change #6 Change Occupancy Requirement from 94% to actual patient days: The patient day utilization factor should be the actual patient days, not the 94% that is imputed for the
rate calculations. Facilities that have a census that is lower than the 94% as indicated, are negatively impacted by this step-up in the use of this calculation. There are many reasons that a census
could be low in any given year. This could happen by a large turnover possibly due to death and/or renovations that temporarily prevent admissions etc... which creates open census days. The
result is that facilities are financially penalized by this variable cost divisor that has a major impact on the ability to successfully operate. The variable cost divisor should be the actual census days to
determine the variable cost allowance per diem
Proposed Change #7 Change the reimbursable basis in the sale of a Rest Home: Another major issue for the survival of the industry is the ability to sell a facility to a non-related individual or
entity and have these costs for the new owner reimbursable. The current regulation stipulates that the new owner inherits the adjusted basis from the previous owner. In most cases, there is minimal
or no basis to be recognized for reimbursement by the new owner. There would be no reimbursement for the purchase price of the facility as well as the debt service related to this. This discourages
the future continuation of many facilities as the real estate is sold as such and not for residential care.
Proposed Change #8 Increase rest home bed rate for SNFs with rest home Beds- When Skilled Nursing Facilities and free- standing Rest Homes receive rate increases, these 23+ facilities have
not received rate increases. Provisions should be made to have this small group received adjusted rate increases.
Proposed Change #9 High Percentage of Publicly Assisted Residents- Provide a slightly higher rate increase for those Rest Homes with a high, (defined as greater than 95% of their resident
population) public assistance census.
Other: Availability of no interest- low interest loans: While not regulatory based, a major financial concern is the ability to secure loans to make required capital improvements and/or hire additional
staffing to care for the residents. MARCH can point to a series of homes that would still be operating if they were able to secure the needed capital.
MARCH would welcome the opportunity to review this document with all concerned parties. It is also our intent to bring these proposed changes to the Stabilization Task Force established by the
legislature.

Ron Pawelski, MARCH
MARCH believes that monies should be allocated to complete a more detailed supply and demand analysis rather than relying on one data source.
Segment II: Current State vs. Future State This is the analytical segment designed to identify the current supply of Acute Hospital beds, SNF Beds, Rest
Home Beds and Assisted Living and current utilization by HSA area. Suggested analysis would includenumber patients awaiting placement in acute settings
current occupancy levels in the LTC settings and current demographics. The Future State would be an analysis and projections of where LTC services will be
required and in what amount
For "Current State":
- For the HSA areas, suggest using the American Community Survey (ACS - gov't data; free) to understand the current population, incomes, etc. for demographic
underpinnings. This data comes in at an extremely micro level geographic level - with ability I believe to roll it up to HSAs
- For AL+ NC communities: NIC is for existing communities as well as the upcoming supply pipeline (https://www.nic.org/) While not full MA coverage - they have
10 out of 14 counties, the more rural ones tend to lack data. Asuggested approach is to request a custom study from LivingPath (https://www.livingpath.com/)
which would probably be pricey but should be considered.
NIC has County-level and MSA level data on occupancy and rate across the major groups - IL, AL, NC. They also have a time series of closures / unit reductions
available in their data. (I don’t think RH data shows up anywhere, but we have a listing by city/town geographic area that could be added)
The approachwould be to do a baseline overlay by HSA that shows the Hospitals, SNF;s, Rest Homes and ALRs showing their current occupancy levels, the
2000 patients in hospitals awaiting placement, plotting out the locations, unit counts, year built, etc. Hospital data probably exist somewhere but not sure where.

Ron Pawelski, MARCH
For "Future State"
- Demographics: Companies like Experian and Claritas have 5 year forward looking estimates at the same ACS micro level. They may have population by age
projections and incomes. Other sources could be Moody's or Oxford Economics if state/county level outlooks are suggested. Should have 65+ population
- New Supply: NIC + Dodge Data & Analytics (fka McGraw-Hill Construction -have the supply pipelines. Dodge is included in an NIC subscription, but
I don’t know if the state has a subscription. If not, this might be a suggested and required addition..
- Demand: Penetration Rate (80+ pop / occupied units)? usually 10-12% is the number. So, for every ten 80+ people, 1 new unit is required.
Would see these all as key indicators in trying to determine demand by HSA area by LTC discipline.
As it relates to Rest Homes, we know the occupancy level hovers around 90% and we know the total capacity of the industry. Our demographic information
provided in the RH Task Force shows our average age is 75.
Note: Supply and Demand analysis that is presented for SNF’s was NOT included in the Rest Home Task Force reporting. As such, time and attention should have
been allocated to complete the same analysis that is provided for SNF’s. It does not duplicate information. L
In listing the closure information for Rest Homes, I think it is important to show the % of the industry that has closed, over 60 % of the total, based on rate adequacy.

Christine Bishop, Brandeis University
Christine Bishop further recommended that the rate setting method and regulatory actions should avoid
overly penalizing high-Medicaid facilities that are making a good-faith effort to respond to the incentives of
the system, but face challenges due to long-term underfunding for capital projects and other infrastructure.

Key Definitions
Rest Home: a residential care facility that provides 24-hour supervision and supportive services for aged, infirm, and at times
indigent populations, who may have difficulty in caring for themselves, but do not routinely require nursing care. Rest homes
provide housing, meals, activities, and arrange and coordinate medical services for individuals who need a supportive living
arrangement. Rest homes are licensed by the Massachusetts Department of Public Health (DPH).
– Some rest home beds, classified as “Level IV” beds, are located within skilled nursing facilities (SNFs), which are
considered “multi-level” or “hybrid” facilities.
– Per 105 CMR 150.00 Standards for Long Term Care Facilities, religious order homes do not require a license from DPH
to operate. These homes must meet all local health and safety requirements.
Nursing Facility: alternatively known as “skilled nursing facilities” (SNFs), nursing facilities are supportive living environments
for aged or infirm residents that provides a wide range of health and personal care services. Services at nursing facilities focus
more on medical care than most rest home or assisted living facilities, and may include rehabilitation services, such as
physical, occupational, and speech therapy. Similar to rest homes, nursing facilities are licensed by DPH.
Assisted Living Residence: private residences that offer housing, meals, and personal care services to aging adults who live
independently. Assisted living residences (ALRs) are certified by the Executive Office of Aging & Independence (AGE) and are
designed for adults who can live independently in a home-like environment but may need help with daily activities such as
housekeeping, meal preparation, bathing, dressing, and/or medication assistance. ALRs do not provide medical or nursing
services and are not designed for people who need serious medical care. Most assisted living residents pay fees privately, and
the cost for each ALR can vary depending on the size, services, and location of the residence.

Key Definitions (cont.)
RCC-Q: the Resident Care Cost Quotient (RCC-Q) is a methodology for tracking spending across rest homes, including
investments in direct care staff, infection control, and other resident care related expenditures that have a direct and
meaningful impact on overall resident quality of life, health, and wellbeing. The RCC-Q serves as a mechanism to
strengthen resident quality of care by holding rest homes financially accountable for managing their revenue and investing
in resident care related costs, including direct care staffing.
DCC-Q: similar to the RCC-Q for rest homes, the Direct Care Cost Quotient (DCC-Q) is a methodology for tracking
spending at nursing facilities, the key difference being that nursing facilities are not permitted to include the salaries for
administrators, executive directors, and responsible parties (RPs) in their reporting as direct care staff.
