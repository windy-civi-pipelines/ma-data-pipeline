HOUSE . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . No. 4688
By Representatives Hawkins of Attleboro and Pease of Westfield, a petition (subject to Joint
Rule 12) of James K. Hawkins, Kelly W. Pease and others for legislation to designate August
10th as Agent Orange awareness day. State Administration and Regulatory Oversight.
The Commonwealth of Massachusetts
_______________
In the One Hundred and Ninety-Fourth General Court
(2025-2026)
_______________
An Act making August 10th Agent Orange Awareness Day in Massachusetts.
Whereas, The deferred operation of this act would tend to defeat its purpose, which is to
designate forthwith August 10th Agent Orange Awareness Day, therefore it is hereby declared to
be an emergency law, necessary for the immediate preservation of the public convenience.
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives in General Court assembled, and by the authority
of the same, as follows:
1 Part I, Title II, Chapter 6, of the Massachusetts General Laws (M.G.L.) Section
2 15XXXXX: "The governor shall annually issue a proclamation setting apart August 10th as
3 Agent Orange Awareness Day and recommending that the day be observed in an appropriate
4 manner by the people."
5 WHEREAS, our nation was conceived by individuals who were willing to sacrifice their
6 safety and concerns to ensure our individual and collective freedom, and the Commonwealth is
7 especially proud to be the home of so many valiant men and women who have performed above
8 and beyond the call of duty. The citizens of the United States have, throughout the years, been
9 called upon to take up arms against the enemies of this great nation, risking their lives and
1 of 3
10 leaving their loved ones behind to honorably safeguard the freedoms and liberties guaranteed to
11 all Americans and vanquishing those who threaten our way of life; and
12 WHEREAS, more than eight million citizens of this country honorably served during the
13 Vietnam War, during which time Agent Orange was widely used in Vietnam by the United
14 States Armed Forces as part of the herbicidal warfare program Operation Ranch Hand from 1961
15 until 1971. Nearly 20 million gallons of the orange powder were sprayed over the land from
16 helicopters or low-flying aircraft, destroying vegetation and crops to deprive enemy guerrillas of
17 food and cover for their activities and exposing 2.6 million American soldiers to the herbicide
18 and defoliant chemical; and
19 WHEREAS, Agent Orange is a dioxin and cancer-causing chemical that enters the body
20 through physical contact or ingestion and moves into the human cell nucleus, where it attacks the
21 genes and causes a number of serious illnesses, including leukemia, lymphoma, myeloma,
22 ischemic heart disease, soft tissue sarcoma, amyloidosis, diabetes, and cancers of the throat,
23 prostate, lung, and colon. Agent Orange also causes genetic damage, and in some cases, the
24 children and grandchildren of veterans exposed to Agent Orange have been born with spina
25 bifida and other abnormalities. Today, only 800,000 Vietnam veterans exposed to Agent Orange
26 are alive, and approximately 300 deaths occur among them every day; and
27 WHEREAS, while fallen comrades are memorialized on The Wall at the Vietnam
28 Veterans Memorial in Washington, D.C., those veterans who are victims of Agent Orange are
29 not recognized as fatalities of the Vietnam War; and
30 WHEREAS, it is most appropriate that we should honor these veterans to the full extent
31 of our ability, as they have made untold and innumerable sacrifices to preserve the liberties we
2 of 3
32 enjoy today and that our progeny will hopefully continue to cherish for generations to come;
33 now, therefore,
34 WHEREAS, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts honors and recognizes the victims of
35 Agent Orange during the Vietnam War for their courageous service to our nation as some of
36 America's most heroic citizens.
37 THEREFORE, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts officially declares August 10th as
38 Agent Orange Awareness Day and recognizes it as such.
