August 13, 2025
Dear Chairs Rodrigues, Michlewitz, Collins, Cabral and Auditor DiZoglio,
Pursuant to Chapter 9 of the Acts of 2025 (FY26 General Appropriations Act), the Executive Office of Technology
Services and Security (TSS) is pleased to provide you with the enclosed report detailing an account of IT-related
project expenditures over the previous 12-month period.
Due to the reporting deadline, amounts reported in the enclosed report are actuals through June 14, 2025, and TSS
forecasts through June 30th since final FY25 numbers will not be known with certainty until after the
Massachusetts Management, Accounting and Reporting System (MMARS) Accounts Payable period at the end of
August.
The FY25 amount is an increase of $16.0M over the FY25 cap of $158.8M, which, when taken with the additional
FY25 capacity we were able to create, amounts to an effective increase over cap of $23.2M. These numbers
exclude the BEST program, which while included in our oversight, has a separate source of funding.
The Executive Office of Health and Human Services (EOHHS) and The Executive Office of Technology Services
and Security (TSS) remain the principal investors in IT, accounting for 65% of total investment dollars in FY25, a
very similar total compared with 65% in FY24. I am grateful for your continued partnership with TSS. Please feel

free to contact Christopher Smith at Christopher.t.smith@mass.gov should you have any questions about this
report.
Sincerely,
Jason Snyder
Secretary and Commonwealth Chief Information Officer

Executive Branch Information Technology Projects in FY25
The Executive Office of Technology Services and Security (TSS) has collaborated with agencies across state
government to improve the delivery of digital services for constituents, schools, businesses, government agencies,
and municipalities. EOTSS is focused on modernizing the Commonwealth’s Information Technology (IT)
landscape while prioritizing security, leveraging technology across multiple agencies, and investing in high-impact
projects that can be efficiently supported over their useful lives. In FY25, the focus has been on leveraging
investments that modernize our technology infrastructure and networks and strengthen our cybersecurity
capabilities, but with a renewed emphasis on improving the delivery of services to citizens and enhancing
government performance.
Investing in State Service Access and Equity
Expenditures in FY25 invested $782.8MM in 24 projects across nine Secretariats that address service equity and
resident access to government services. The Commonwealth Digital Roadmap is a $110M program at TSS ($18M
in FY25) to standardize the user experience across state agencies with a single identity that proactively connects
users to relevant information and services.
The Integrated Eligibility and Enrollment program within the Executive Office of Health and Human Services
(HHS) will eliminate duplicative documentation while streamlining the application and onboarding processes for
benefits administered by HHS, while making residents aware of overlapping eligibility for services.
The Childcare Financial Assistance Modernization (CCFA) project at the Executive Office of Education (EOE) will
update the business processes within CCFA to align with an updated user experience and update or replace the core
technology systems managing the waitlist, application and eligibility determination, and payments. Updating the
overall user experience will reduce barriers to families seeking assistance from the Commonwealth, ease
administrative burdens on childcare providers, and create greater operational efficiencies for the Department.
FY25 will see the completion of the implementation of an Electronic Medical Records system (EMR) at the
Executive Office of Veterans’ Services Veterans’ Homes in Chelsea and Holyoke which offer critical services to
veterans in Massachusetts.
Improving Government Performance
$92.3M has been allocated to 11 Secretariats and Agencies to support 16 projects that will enable more efficient
government operations. This includes the completion of phase 1 of the Employment Modernization Transformation
(EMT), the Tax and Benefits modules, and seed funding for Phase 2--Career Services. This project is a key driver
of the increased project investment within the Executive Office of Labor and Workforce Development (LWD) from
FY24 to FY25.
The Commonwealth's Legal Case Management System consortium will complete the pilot program rollout of a
best-in-class statewide Legal Case Management Platform to five agencies. The platform is a single framework that
is scalable across the Commonwealth that includes various management capabilities spanning across case
management practices.
Further, the Business Enterprise Systems Transformation (BEST) project within the Office of the Comptroller to
replace two core administrative systems used across the Executive Branch to manage financial, payroll, and human
resource functions, continues apace.
Technology Services and Cybersecurity
3

The FY25 CIP allocates $42.2MM to continue to improve the Commonwealth’s Information Technology
infrastructure and cybersecurity assets. The goal of this enterprise program is to continuously modernize the
technical infrastructure that government service delivery depends on.
This program continues an ongoing initiative to modernize the Commonwealth’s core networks, including the One
Network program at HHS, EOE and EOED, and supports the continuous upgrades of our End User services
capabilities with Group File Share migrations to more secure platforms. We will continue the migration of end-of-
life server infrastructure to our centralized services and will invest in operational intelligence capabilities to more
effectively monitor our technical infrastructure. Funding is also included to continue the operation of the
Commonwealth's cybersecurity Vulnerability Management Program, which includes automated web application
scanning, professional grade penetration testing, and a threat analysis and data sharing capability. There is a
remediation capability to support all Executive Branch repair vulnerabilities identified because of our penetration
testing program.
We enable Mass.gov to respond to new constituent (end-user) and customer (agency content editor) needs. This
includes multilingual and search feature enhancements to help state agencies present their content in ways that will
best serve their agency missions, employees, and the residents they serve. We will also make content-type
enhancements, pilot a multi-channel feedback solution, and continue decommissioning custom solutions in favor of
available SaaS solutions.
At the Executive Office of Public Safety, the Criminal Justice Information Services (CJIS) modernization program
is designed to implement a more advanced and maintainable platform for applications used by both the Department
of Criminal Justice Information Services and law enforcement agencies in the Commonwealth. The current CJIS
Broker/Message Switch platform is obsolete, requiring action to design and develop a replacement solution. New
workflows will ensure compliance with TSS standards including Continuity of Service, Business Resiliency,
Cybersecurity and Accessibility.
Executive Office of Health and Human Services
Health Insurance Exchange (HIX) Integrated Eligibility System (IES)
The MA HIX/IES was implemented and now maintains and enhances the Commonwealth MAGI eligibility system
to support both MassHealth and the Health Connector. The System manages the eligibility of approximately 2
million Commonwealth residents at any given time. In addition, the system allows for health plan shopping for
300,000 Health Connector eligible individuals. In the coming fiscal years, MA HIX/IES will begin integration with
the Integrated Eligibility and Enrollment (IE&E) systems and begin the transition to One Health. $82,447,084
Medicaid Management Information System (MMIS) Modernization
MMIS Modernization seeks to improve services for vulnerable populations (such as Behavioral Health) and
improve member and provider experience through mobile applications, online self-service options and a provider
portal. Automating current manual processes will improve service delivery and make it more efficient and
responsive. Continuation of the MassHealth Payment Reform (ACO full implementation) will improve health care
quality for Medicaid population and reduce costs by converting the FFS based structure to one of the three types of
ACO models and enhance collaboration between traditional health providers and behavioral health providers
through the Community Partners program. Implementing LTSS Data Repository and Behavioral Health Redesign
will improve services to vulnerable and underserved populations. The technological enhancements to MMIS are
following both industry and the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services’ (CMS) guidance to leverage existing
resources or implement modular resources that are system agnostic. An example is the Business Rules Engine that
MMIS has implemented to support the cost sharing initiative. $40,000,000
Enhanced Analytics
Enhanced analytics will provide improved and more timely reporting to enable ACOs to forecast financials,
improve population health management and be accountable for quality outcomes. ACOs directly impact 1.2M
MassHealth members and their access to programs. This project will replace outdated and near-end-of-life data

related delivery enhancements to constituents of the Commonwealth. Complete, accurate and timely information
reported by T-MSIS to CMS and the Commonwealth's Data Warehouse will be provided to make better decisions
and determinations regarding Medicaid costs and services statewide. Data stored in the EOHHS Data Warehouse
and reported by TMSIS to CMS is used by MassHealth, Commonwealth Constituents, CMS and States nationwide
to reduce Medicaid costs and improve services statewide. The T-MSIS Common Solution software implemented
by the contracted vendor provides a standard reporting solution and is used by many other States nationwide. Also,
