Guidance on Public Health, Safety and Environmental Impacts of Electric Battery Storage
and Electric Vehicle Chargers

Section 2:
Section 122 of Chapter 239 of the Acts of 2024, An Act promoting a clean energy grid,
advancing equity, and protecting ratepayers (“2024 Climate Act”), directed the Massachusetts
Department of Environmental Protection (“MassDEP”), in consultation with the Board of Fire
Prevention Regulations (“BFPR”) and the Department of Energy Resources (“DOER”), to issue
guidance on the public health, safety, and environmental impacts of electric battery storage and
electric vehicle chargers.
This Guidance provides an overview of stationary battery energy storage systems, including their
role in increasing reliability of the electric grid and storing energy from renewable sources such
as wind and solar, their different sizes and uses, and the most common types of battery energy
storage technology. The Guidance identifies the applicable regulations, codes, and guidelines
that govern the safe installation, operation, and decommissioning of battery energy storage
systems and protection of public health and the environment.
This Guidance also provides an overview of electric vehicle (“EV”) charger equipment,
including the role of EV chargers in electrifying and decarbonizing the transportation sector, and
the different types of chargers. The Guidance identifies the applicable requirements that govern
the safe installation and use of EV chargers.
BATTERY ENERGY STORAGE
I. Introduction to Battery Energy Storage
The term “energy storage” applies to many different technologies, including electrochemical
storage (batteries), flywheels, thermal storage, and pumped hydroelectric storage. All of these
technologies can store energy and then make the energy available later.
This Guidance focuses on stationary battery energy storage systems (“BESS”) used to provide
electricity to a home, building, or the electric grid. BESS may be co-located with an energy
generation source, such as a solar array, or be a standalone facility. BESS are distinct from the
batteries that power consumer electronics, electric vehicles, or other electric mobility devices.
BESS are important for the Commonwealth to meet its decarbonization goals. The Global
Warming Solutions Act, as amended by the 2021 Climate Roadmap Act (“GWSA”), requires
Massachusetts to reach economy wide, Net Zero greenhouse gas emissions (“GHG”) by 2050.1
To meet this requirement, the Massachusetts Clean Energy and Climate Plan for 2050 (“2050
CECP”) identifies the role of clean, emissions-free energy generation, particularly onshore and
offshore wind and solar photovoltaics resources, which together are expected to comprise about
75% of New England’s electric capacity by 2050.2
In order to integrate this buildout of solar and wind generation capacity, energy storage will be
essential. Solar and wind are key to meeting our decarbonization goals in a cost-effective
manner. However, they are intermittent resources that only generate power when the sun is
1 St. 2008 c. 298 (GWSA); St. 2021 c. 8 (Climate Roadmap Act).
2 The 2050 CECP Phased scenario allows for the clean energy transition to be gradually “phased-in” over the next
three decades. See: https://www.mass.gov/doc/2050-clean-energy-and-climate-plan/download

shining or the wind is blowing. While expected generation from solar and wind resources can be
easily and accurately forecasted, BESS of varying sizes deployed throughout the electric grid
will be necessary to integrate solar and wind generation resources and fill in gaps when these and
other resources are incapable of meeting systemwide demand on their own.
During times when the supply of renewable electricity from resources like solar and wind
exceeds customer demand, energy storage can absorb and store that excess supply, augmenting
the supply and demand balance required by the electric grid. Then, when demand for electricity
exceeds renewable electricity supply, for example after the sun sets and solar panels are no
longer generating electricity, energy storage can discharge the excess electricity to meet
customer demand.
Without energy storage in place during periods of high electricity demand where there are
limited resources generating electricity, fossil fuel plants known as “peaker” plants must come
online. Peaker plants, when used, are typically large emitters of both GHG and other emissions
that negatively impact local air quality. The ability for energy storage to displace peaker plants is
critical for Massachusetts to meet Net Zero by 2050 and to improve public health outcomes.
The deployment of BESS also yields significant economic benefits as they help to optimize
electric grid operations, reducing the cost of meeting peak demand, avoiding the need for
additional transmission and distribution investments, balancing the electric grid during times
when supply and demand are not aligned, and improving the resilience of the electric grid, all of
which benefit ratepayers and the economy at large by reducing electricity costs. Energy storage
also creates opportunities for new job growth and can be a significant source of increased local
property tax revenues in communities where it is deployed.
To achieve these economic benefits as well as the GWSA’s 2050 power sector decarbonization
requirements, Massachusetts will likely need to deploy 5.6 gigawatts (GW) or more of energy
storage capacity.3
- Energy storage has different uses and different scales
BESS technologies can be categorized based on scale and technology type. The scale of BESS
generally includes two categories: utility scale and non-utility scale. Utility scale BESS refers to
larger systems that serve and benefit the electric grid as a whole. Non-utility scale BESS are
smaller, and while they too can serve and benefit the electric grid, they primarily serve individual
or small groups of end use customers such as a home, apartment building, or commercial
building.
The energy in a BESS is measured in power capacity and energy capacity. A BESS’s power
capacity refers to the system’s maximum ability to deliver instantaneous power to the grid to
meet customers’ real-time demand. Power capacity for BESS is typically expressed in terms of
kilowatts (“kW”) or megawatts (“MW”). Energy capacity refers to the cumulative amount of
power over time that a BESS can deliver and is typically expressed in terms of kilowatt-hours
(“kWh”) or megawatt-hours (“MWh”). For example, a BESS that is rated as 1 MW/4 MWh has a
3 2050 CECP Workbook of Energy Modeling Results. See spreadsheet tab “8. Electric Capacity,” cell W21 which
shows energy storage capacity for Massachusetts under the Phased scenario.
3
power capacity of 1 MW and can meet 1 MW of instantaneous customer demand, and can do so
for a total of 4 hours before it is fully discharged, giving the BESS an energy capacity of 4
MWh.
- Utility Scale Energy Storage
Utility scale BESS are typically sized from several hundred kW to several hundred MW, with
smaller systems typically serving the electric distribution system and larger systems typically
serving the electric transmission system.
The primary purpose of the electric transmission system is to transmit large amounts of
electricity over long distances to meet demand. The electric transmission system that serves
Massachusetts also serves the other New England states and is managed by ISO New England
(“ISO-NE”). Utility scale BESS is key to reducing costs and emissions associated with
transmission system services because a BESS at that scale can be charged from low-cost
renewable resources like solar and wind and can be deployed to reduce the overall peak demand
of the system and the large associated costs.4 In other words, it can charge when costs are low
and discharge when costs are high, helping to reduce electricity costs for all customers during
periods of high demand.
The electric distribution system in the Commonwealth, which connects to the transmission
system and distributes electricity to customers, is owned and operated by either an Electric
Distribution Company (“EDC”) or a Municipal Electric Department (“MED”), depending on the
municipality.5 Utility scale energy storage at this level can both serve the transmission system
and help the EDCs and MEDs provide safe and reliable electric distribution system service to
customers while lowering customer bills and integrating renewable energy into the electrical
grid. One example of unique distribution level services that a utility scale BESS can provide is
deferring or avoiding the need for distribution system upgrades by reducing local peaks and
providing local power capacity and reliability. They can also provide local energy resilience by
being strategically located to help avoid power outages.6
Utility scale BESS at the transmission and distribution levels can help reduce the need for fossil
fuel peaker plants and therefore improve local air quality.
- Commercial and Residential (Non-Utility Scale)
Non-utility scale storage is commonly owned and operated by building- and home-owners
looking for a way to reduce electricity bills and have backup power. These battery systems are
smaller than utility scale, and are typically located on a customer’s premises and sized based on
the electric demand of the building. Non-utility scale BESS can provide all of the same services
4 For example, Massachusetts State of Charge Report found that the top 10% of peak demand hours represented
about 40% of annual electricity spend. See: ESI: State of Charge Report, pg. i-ii.
5 Massachusetts municipally-owned electric companies. https://www.mass.gov/info-details/massachusetts-
municipally-owned-electric-companies
6 For example, Eversource Energy’s Outer Cape Battery Energy Storage System is designed to provide backup
power to 11,000 customers that live on Outer Cape Cod, avoiding both frequent outages and the need for a second
distribution line along the same route through the Cape Cod National Seashore as the existing distribution line.

as utility scale resources, though typically to a smaller degree; however, they can also uniquely
provide end use customer services such as bill savings through building peak demand
management and site-specific resilience to power outages. In addition, non-utility scale energy
storage can provide local air quality benefits if it is replacing a fossil fuel-based backup
generator.
- Battery Storage Technologies and Makeup
There are many technological approaches to BESS. Nearly all recent and current battery energy
storage deployments are lithium-ion-based electrochemical energy storage technologies
(“lithium-ion batteries”).7,8 In Massachusetts, about 97% of installed BESS in EDC
municipalities are lithium-ion batteries.9
Lithium-ion batteries dominate the current energy storage market for several reasons. Lithium-
ion batteries are generally less expensive than other energy storage technologies. Because
lithium-ion batteries are also the predominant energy storage technology in consumer electronics
and electric vehicles, the technology benefits from large scale manufacturing and a robust supply
chain, leading to dramatic cost declines over the past decade.10 Second, lithium-ion batteries
have favorable energy storage properties, such as high energy density, long lifetime, fast
response time, fast recharging time, and low losses in energy storage capacity when sitting idle
(also known as low self-discharge).
Lithium-ion batteries comprise a family of batteries which differ in their specific chemistries.
More recently, energy storage project developers have transitioned from a high nickel content
lithium-ion battery chemistry (known as nickel manganese cobalt or “NMC”) to a chemistry high
in iron (known as lithium iron phosphate or “LFP”).11 Even though LFP is less energy dense than
NMC, LFP has advantages over NMC of lower cost, lower flammability, and longer lifetime. In
2023, LFP comprised 80% of new energy storage installations worldwide.12
Batteries such as lithium-ion batteries start with a building block, called a cell, where energy is
stored for future use. Multiple cells are electrically connected into modules, and multiple
modules are then electrically connected to form the BESS. Through this scaling process, a BESS
can be designed to meet the customer’s particular power and energy needs. BESS are typically

integrated into enclosures, which can include HVAC to keep the BESS at the appropriate
operating temperature, and various safety systems and designs discussed in more detail in this
guidance. A battery management system acts like the brain of the BESS and continuously
monitors the BESS to ensure it is operating according to design standards and can adjust the
BESS’s operation or trigger safety systems as necessary.13
Lithium-ion batteries, like all technologies, will continue to see innovations to improve their
performance, safety, longevity, cost, and reliability. The energy storage market as a whole will
also continue to see innovations and evolve, with non-lithium-ion approaches likely to take more
significant market share sometime in the future.
- Siting and Permitting Reform for Clean Energy, Including Energy Storage Systems
The 2024 Climate Act required changes to the way clean energy projects, including BESS, are
sited and permitted in the Commonwealth. Beginning on July 1, 2026, the Energy Facilities
Siting Board (“EFSB”) will have exclusive authority to review and permit all proposed BESS
projects with a rated capacity of 100 MWh or greater, referred to as a “large clean energy storage
facility.”14 The EFSB will issue a single consolidated permit that comprises all state, regional,
and local permits that a large clean energy storage facility would otherwise need to commence
construction and operation.15
A BESS with a rated capacity of less than 100 MWh, referred to in the Act as a “small clean
energy storage facility,” will be subject to all local permits, but the local permitting authorities
will be required to issue a single, consolidated permit in 12 months or less.16
The 2024 Climate Act requires the EFSB and DOER to promulgate a uniform set of health,
safety, environmental and other standards, including zoning criteria in DOER’s case, governing
the siting and permitting of eligible clean energy projects within their respective jurisdictions.
The EFSB and DOER each must promulgate such standards by March 1, 2026. These new
standards may incorporate by reference, supersede, or be in addition to any or all of the
requirements addressed in this Guidance.
II. Fire Safety
The safety of BESS has improved significantly in recent years. One comprehensive analysis
found that the failure rate of utility-scale BESS decreased by 97% between 2018 and 2023 as the
deployment of BESS greatly increased.17 Lessons learned from earlier incidents when this
technology was nascent have led to new and robust requirements and improved industry
practices. BESS that are designed with sufficient safety protections and are installed, operated,
and maintained in a manner that maintains the system safety can be operated without incident as
demonstrated by the many systems currently operating safely in the field.

In Massachusetts, several layers of coordinated standards apply to BESS. Stationary BESS must
comply with the requirements of 527 CMR 1.00: The Massachusetts Comprehensive Fire Safety
Code (“the Massachusetts Fire Code”). The Board of Fire Prevention Regulations (“BFPR”)
promulgates the Massachusetts Fire Code, which adopts NFPA 1: Fire Code, with some state-
specific modifications. NFPA 1 is the national model fire code developed by the National Fire
Protection Association (“NFPA”).18 The Massachusetts Fire Code, Chapter 52, references the
2020 NFPA 855: Standard for the Installation of Stationary Energy Storage Systems.
A table of relevant fire safety regulations, codes, standards and certifications is appended to this
Guidance.
NFPA 1 outlines requirements that provide a reasonable level of fire and life safety, as well as
property protection from the hazards created by fire, explosion, and dangerous conditions. NFPA
1 addresses fire protection systems such as sprinklers and alarms, emergency planning and
evacuation, providing fire departments with site access, water supplies and flow requirements,
and minimizing risks of handling, using or storing hazardous materials.
NFPA 855 was first issued in 2019 in response to the increasing use of energy storage systems,
including BESS. It sets comprehensive criteria for the fire protection of BESS and other energy
storage installations based on the technology used, the setting where the system is being
installed, the size and separation of the installations, and the fire suppression and control systems
in place. NFPA 855 also reflects the current best practice for preventing explosions and safely
containing fires.
The requirements of NFPA 855 address design, installation, operation and decommissioning.
While the applicability of the requirements will vary based on the specifics of a project such as
size, location, and system, the following are examples of criteria in NFPA 855:
- Location of the project: NFPA 855 Chapter 4.4 provides detailed requirements addressing
both indoor and outdoor installations. Location requirements for outdoor BESS include
providing minimum distances from exposures like buildings or public ways; vegetation
control; ensuring electrical circuitry is housed within weatherproof enclosures; and
requiring that fire department access roads be provided in accordance with local fire
codes. Indoor BESS requirements address different criteria for buildings dedicated to
BESS versus non-dedicated-use buildings.
- Equipment: NFPA 855 Chapter 4.2 requires BESS equipment to be listed in accordance
with UL 9540 - Standard for Energy Storage Systems and Equipment, unless specifically
exempted. UL 9540 is a certification that evaluates the entire battery system, verifying
that it meets fire, electrical, and functional safety requirements. UL 9540 also requires
that the major battery components be qualified to their own standards, such as UL 1741,
18 The NFPA is a U.S.-based non-profit organization dedicated to reducing fire and related hazards. The NFPA
develops model safety standards through a public, consensus-driven process drawing on the expertise of thousands
of volunteers from relevant industries. States may adopt all or parts of NFPA codes as requirements, as
Massachusetts has done by adopting NFPA 1 with certain state amendments. NFPA model codes are revised
regularly to reflect the most current practices. In Massachusetts, the BFPR regularly reviews and adopts updated
code editions.

which certifies a battery’s power conversion system, and UL 1973, which certifies the
safety and performance of battery cells, modules, and packs, evaluating their ability to
withstand thermal runaway, mechanical stress, and electrical faults.19
- Installation: NFPA 855 Chapter 4.3 requires BESS to be installed in accordance with the
manufacturer’s requirements. Installation requirements also address signage, seismic
protection, impact protection, site security, and adequate egress, as appropriate.
- Emergency Planning and Training: NFPA 855 Chapter 4.1.3 requires BESS owners to
establish and maintain an emergency operations plan with procedures for the safe
shutdown, de-energizing or isolation of equipment and systems, inspection and testing,
responding to emergency notifications, and procedures to be followed in the case of fire,
explosion, release of liquids or vapors, damage to critical moving parts, or other
potentially dangerous conditions. Emergency training for facility staff is also required.
NFPA 855 also requires smoke detection systems on all BESS systems located within buildings
or structures, fire control and suppression systems, explosion control and spill control measures.
- Fire Safety Information and Documentation Expected for Permitting Energy Storage
Systems
A permit from the local fire department is required to install and operate lithium-ion BESS
greater than 20 kWh, or one (1) kWh for installations in one- or two-family dwellings or
townhouse units.20 At these thresholds, the vast majority of BESS installations, both residential,
commercial, and utility scale, in indoor or outdoor locations, are required to obtain such a permit.
BESS Scale Threshold For Fire Department Permitting
(kWH)
One- or two-family dwellings or townhouse 1 kWh
units
Commercial and utility-scale 20 kWh
For BESS installations exceeding 1 kWh in one- or two-family dwellings or townhouse units, the
plans and specifications associated with the installation shall be submitted to the local fire
department for approval and include the following:
- the location and layout diagram of the room or area in which the BESS is to be installed;
- details on wall construction for rooms or areas where BESS are installed;
- the quantities and types of BESS units;
- manufacturer’s specifications, ratings, and listings of BESS;
19 Underwriters Laboratory, or “UL”, is an independent testing and certification organization. Manufacturers submit
their products to UL for evaluation. UL assesses the product’s safety, performance, and compliance with applicable
standards. This may include electrical, mechanical, environmental, and other specific tests depending on the nature
of the product.
20 Beginning July 1, 2026, proposed BESS facilities with a rated capacity of 100 MWh will be within the sole
jurisdiction of the EFSB for purposes of all state, local and regional permits, including permits typically issued by
local fire departments.

- description of energy storage management systems and their operation;
- location and content of required signage;
- details on fire suppression, smoke or fire detection, gas detection, thermal management,
ventilation, exhaust, and deflagration venting systems, if provided;
- support arrangement associated with the installation, including any required seismic
support; and
- description of scope of work for retrofit or repairs of BESS.
Applicants proposing a BESS project exceeding 20 kWh are required to submit detailed
information for review by local fire officials. The information includes, but is not limited to, the
following:
- the quantities and types of BESS units;
- manufacturer’s specifications, ratings, and listings of BESS;
- emergency operations plan;
- hazard mitigation analysis;
- details of all safety systems, including fire suppression, smoke or fire detection, gas
detection, thermal management, ventilation, exhaust, and deflagration venting systems, as
applicable;
- results of fire and explosion testing to UL 9540A or equivalent;
- location and layout diagram of the room or area in which the BESS is to be installed;
- details on hourly fire-resistant-rated assemblies provided or relied upon in relation to the
BESS;
- location and content of required signage;
- support arrangement associated with the installation, including any seismic support.
This information allows for fire departments, and local and state regulators, to assess the
individual safety characteristics of a particular project and ensure that the proposed project
complies with all of the applicable code requirements prior to issuing a permit.
- In the Event of a Fire
Lithium-ion batteries can experience thermal runaway. Thermal runaway is defined in NFPA
855 as “The condition when an electrochemical cell increases its temperature through self-
heating in an uncontrollable fashion and progresses when the cell’s heat generation is at a higher
rate than it can dissipate, potentially leading to off-gassing, fire, or explosion.” Lithium-ion
BESS are required to include a listed device or other approved method to preclude, detect, and
minimize the impact of thermal runaway. NFPA 855, Chapter 9.3.
Water is considered the preferred agent for suppressing lithium-ion battery fires. Water has
superior cooling capacity and is easy to transport to the seat of the fire. Fire-fighting foams, such
as those containing per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (“PFAS”), are not considered to be
effective for these chemistries because they lack the ability to cool sufficiently and can conduct
electricity. Fire-fighting dry chemical powders can eliminate visible flame, but they also lack the
ability to cool burning battery components as water can do.21
21 NFPA 855 – 2020 Edition, Annex C.

III. Protecting Public Health and the Environment
BESS must comply with all applicable laws and regulations, including federal, state and local
requirements protective of public health and the environment. These legal frameworks govern all
aspects of a BESS project, including, but not limited to, siting, zoning, wetlands impacts,
stormwater management and impacts, drinking water protection, release(s) or threat(s) of release
of oil or hazardous materials to the environment, and noise levels. Any local zoning by-law or
ordinance must comply with M.G.L. c. 40A § 3, which prohibits the unreasonable regulation of
BESS.22
The permits and approvals required for a given BESS project will depend on the specific
circumstances of the proposal. Key environmental permitting and approval considerations
include, but are not limited to, the following, particularly for utility-scale BESS which have a
larger footprint:
Wetlands: BESS projects involving activities in jurisdictional wetlands resource areas and
corresponding buffer zones must comply with the Wetlands Protection Act (“WPA”), M.G.L. c.
131, § 40, and the WPA regulations at 310 CMR 10.00. Projects that result in a discharge of
dredged or fill material to waters of the United States and require a Section 401 Water Quality
Certification are subject to the regulations at 314 CMR 9.00. Local jurisdictions may also have
wetlands protection bylaws.23
Stormwater: BESS developments may be required to comply with MassDEP’s
Stormwater Management Standards provided in 310 CMR 10.05(6)(k)-(q), if the development is
subject to the jurisdiction of the Wetlands Protection Act, and 314 CMR 9.06(6)(a), if the
development requires a Section 401 water quality certification for discharges of dredged or fill
material. The Stormwater Management Standards encourage stormwater recharge to
groundwater, require measures to control surface water runoff that may contribute to
downstream flooding, and prevent stormwater discharges from causing or contributing to the
pollution of the surface waters and groundwaters of the Commonwealth. The standards require
the implementation of a wide variety of stormwater management strategies, depending on
specific site characteristics, including environmentally sensitive site design and low impact
development (LID) techniques to minimize impervious surface and land disturbance, source
control and pollution prevention, structural and non-structural best management practices,
construction period erosion and sedimentation control, and the long-term operation and
maintenance of stormwater management systems.
Compliance with the Stormwater Management Standards may require remote shut-off
valves, lined conveyances and basins, or other measures designed to intercept and contain
surface water runoff during a failure event such as a fire. More information about the Stormwater
22 M.G.L 40A § 3 provides “No zoning ordinance or by-law shall prohibit or unreasonably regulate the installation
of solar energy systems or the building of structures that facilitate the collection of solar energy, except where
necessary to protect the public health, safety or welfare.” Battery energy storage systems qualify as “structures that
facilitate the collection of solar energy.” Massachusetts Office of the Attorney General, Decision re: Carver Annual
Town Meeting of April 12, 2022, p.6 note 8, issued November 14, 2022.
23 Beginning July 1, 2026, proposed BESS facilities with a rated capacity of 100 MWh will be within the sole
jurisdiction of the EFSB for purposes of all state, local and regional permits.

Management Standards is available at https://www.mass.gov/guides/massachusetts-stormwater-
handbook-and-stormwater-standards.
Drinking Water: MassDEP regulates public water systems pursuant to M.G.L. c. 111, §
160 and 310 CMR 22.00, the Drinking Water Regulations. The Drinking Water Regulations
impose requirements on public water systems to prevent the pollution of drinking water by
protecting both surface water (310 CMR 22.20B, et seq.) and groundwater (310 CMR 22.21)
sources.
Public water suppliers and BESS project applicants should consult the MassDEP
Drinking Water Program’s guidance on the siting of BESS around sources of public drinking
water, titled Information to be Submitted to MassDEP for Proposed Solar and Wind Energy
Projects on Lands Owned or Controlled by Public Water Systems for Drinking Water Purposes
(available at https://www.mass.gov/doc/pwss-and-windsolar-energy-projects-guidance). BESS is
prohibited within the area immediately surrounding a public water supply well or wellfield,
known as Zone I (defined at 310 CMR 22.02). Outside of Zone I, (e.g., Zone II for groundwater
sources or Zone A for surface water sources) on land owned or controlled by the public water
system for drinking water purposes, BESS require MassDEP approval and should meet the
conditions specified in the guideline. Example conditions include locating BESS above the 100-
year floodplain and within a self-containment area so that in the event of a fire, fire extinguishing
chemicals will be completely contained.
Public water sources designed to withdraw more than 100,000 gallons per day must
protect the MassDEP approved Zone II or Zone A recharge areas. Protection must be in the form
of municipal bylaws/ordinances, general bylaws/ordinances or Board of Health Regulations.
Protection controls must prohibit the activities cited in 310 CMR 22.20B(2) for Zone A and 310
CMR 22.21(2) for Zone II. Other municipal controls may also apply.24
Waterways / Chapter 91: If a BESS project requires construction, filling, or dredging in
filled or flowed tidelands, great ponds, and the navigable portions of non-tidal rivers and streams
on which public funds have been expended, then the project proponent would need to obtain a
license from MassDEP pursuant to M.G.L. c. 91 and 310 CMR 9.00.
Air Quality / Emissions: BESS do not emit air pollutants at levels requiring an air permit
from MassDEP.
Noise: BESS can generate significant levels of sound from cooling systems, inverters,
system electronics, and transformers, and can become a nuisance when located near residences
that can be as much as 40 decibels about background sound levels if not appropriately designed
to attenuate sound.
BESS must comply with any local noise bylaws, regulations or ordinances.25 They also must

comply with MassDEP’s noise regulations at 310 CMR 7.10.
MassDEP issued a Noise Policy (90-001) that states that a source of sound is considered to be
violating 310 CMR 7.10 if the source either increases the broadband sound level by more than 10
decibels above ambient or produces a “pure tone” condition – when any octave band center
frequency sound pressure level exceeds the two adjacent center frequency sound pressure levels
by 3 decibels or more. These criteria are measured both at the property line and at the nearest
inhabited residences or other sensitive receptors.
Sound suppression or mitigation measures may be implemented to achieve desired sound levels.
Examples of such measures include the use of lower noise equipment, sound attenuation barriers,
and operational restrictions such as limiting fan speeds and the number of active units during
quieter hours. Sound suppression measures should be designed to achieve the lowest sound level
increase above background that is technologically feasible.
- Environmental Considerations in the Event of a Fire or Other Release
Any fire occurring in the built environment is likely to contribute to environmental
contamination, including air contamination from the fire plume and possible subsequent
deposition to land and water, contamination from suppression water runoff, and other potential
environmental discharges from burned materials. Like all energy technologies, batteries can
present chemistry-specific hazards under faulty conditions. Lithium-ion batteries could leak or
spill chemicals, so these systems are typically required to provide spill containment.
In the event of a fire or spill at a BESS facility, the local fire department should be called
immediately. After the local fire department has been notified, MassDEP’s Emergency Response
(ER) must be notified via the ER Hot Line (888-304-1133) within 2 hours of a release or spill of
oil or hazardous materials that meet MassDEP’s 2-hour reporting thresholds requirements.
MassDEP Emergency Response personnel are available 24/7 to respond and help contain and
assess spills/releases of oil or hazardous chemicals.
Once the battery components and site have been rendered safe, the owner of the BESS facility
should hire a hazardous materials response contractor for proper assessment, transport and
disposal. Pursuant to regulations known as the Massachusetts Contingency Plan (“MCP”, 310
CMR 40.0000), following a battery fire or other release to the environment, the owner of the
BESS is required to hire a Licensed Site Professional/response contractor to implement
immediate response actions. This could include, for example, immediate containment or spill
cleanup and sampling of nearby soils, surface waters and groundwater for residual
contamination. If contamination is found above regulatory limits, then further cleanup is required
according to MCP requirements. If the owner/potentially responsible party is unwilling or unable
to hire a contractor, MassDEP has the ability to activate one, and pursue cost recovery from the
potentially responsible party (i.e. owner).26 MassDEP also maintains on its website a list of
26 Source: DFS Memorandum, Dangers of Lithium Batteries, Feb. 6, 2023, https://www.mass.gov/doc/advisory-
dangers-of-lithium-batteries-2023/download.

licensed hazardous waste transporters who can provide transport and disposal services.27
- End-of-Life and Decommissioning
Pursuant to the Massachusetts Fire Code and NFPA 855, BESS facility owners must provide a
decommissioning plan to the fire department for approval prior to decommissioning the system.
In accordance with Chapter 8 of NFPA 855, the decommissioning plan must include steps for the
safe shut down, disassembly and removal of the battery components.
Most lithium-ion batteries meet the definition of hazardous waste pursuant to the Massachusetts
Hazardous Waste Regulations, 310 CMR 30.000. However, lithium-ion batteries may be
managed in compliance with the streamlined standards for universal waste management (e.g., a
manifest is not required) at 310 CMR 30.1000, provided that the batteries are managed at the site
of generation in a way that prevents releases to the environment and the batteries are sent to
another universal waste “handler” or a “destination facility” that is authorized to recycle lithium-
ion batteries.
In addition to existing requirements, a special commission known as the Extended Producer
Responsibility Commission has been established pursuant to the 2024 Climate Act.28 The
Commission is charged with making policy recommendations for handling lithium-ion batteries
and other products when they reach the end of their useful life. The Commission is chaired by
the MassDEP Commissioner and comprises a diverse set of stakeholders. The Commission’s
recommendations are due to the Legislature by January 15, 2026.

ELECTRIC VEHICLE CHARGERS
I. Introduction to Electric Vehicle Chargers
The electrification of the transportation sector in Massachusetts is critical to achieving the
Commonwealth’s greenhouse gas (“GHG”) reduction goals. The transportation sector is
responsible for 38% of GHG emissions in Massachusetts, making it the largest source of
emissions by sector from the combustion of gasoline, diesel, and aviation fuel in cars, buses,
trucks, ships, and airplanes.29
As the use of electric vehicles (EVs) has grown, so has the need for EV charging infrastructure.
EV charging infrastructure needs to be installed throughout the state for drivers and business
owners to feel comfortable switching to EVs. Massachusetts has a number of programs that
provide incentives and grant funding for EV chargers, one of which is MassDEP’s Electric
Vehicle Incentive Program (“MassEVIP”) which supports charging stations for the general
public, employees and fleets, and multi-unit dwellings and educational campuses.
There are three main drivers of MassDEP’s MassEVIP programs:

Section 3:
1. Transportation emissions contribute to the formation of ground-level ozone, a key
component of smog. This pollution can exacerbate respiratory conditions such as
asthma and bronchitis, particularly affecting children, older adults, and people with
pre-existing health issues. Additionally, exposure to nitrogen dioxide (NO₂), a
byproduct of vehicle emissions, can irritate the respiratory system and increase
susceptibility to infections.

Section 4:
2. The transportation sector is a significant source of GHG emissions in Massachusetts,
accounting for approximately 38% of the state's total emissions.30 These emissions
contribute to global warming and climate change, posing long-term risks to the
environment and public health.

Section 5:
3. Communities located near high-traffic areas, such as highways and industrial zones,
often experience cumulative pollution from multiple sources. This compounded
exposure can lead to higher rates of respiratory and cardiovascular diseases among
residents, disproportionately impacting low-income and minority populations.31
EV chargers come in three types based on the power output of the charger: Level 1, Level 2, and
direct current (DC) fast chargers, also known as Level 3.

Section 6:
1. Level 1 chargers use standard 120-volt (V) alternating current (AC). There are hardwired
units that are most commonly used in commercial settings as well as cords that can be
plugged into a standard 3-prong outlet. Hardwired units should be installed by a licensed

electrician. A Level 1 charging cord may be provided by the manufacturer32 with the
purchase of a new EV, or can be purchased separately, and can be used to charge the
vehicle at home using a standard outlet without the need for special installation or wiring.

Section 7:
2. Level 2 chargers use 240-volts AC, the level commonly used for clothes dryers and other
large household appliances. Level 2 chargers may be installed at single family homes (in
a garage or near the driveway), as well as in public areas like parking lots, parking
garages and rest stops. Level 2 chargers should be installed by a licensed electrician.

Section 8:
3. DC fast chargers can charge a vehicle significantly faster than other charger types, but are
also significantly more expensive. They also often require significant upgrades to the
existing electrical infrastructure, depending on the amount of power already available and
how many charging stations are installed and how many kW of power they can supply.
Fast chargers can range in power from 50 kW to 350 kW, with even faster charging
speeds coming in the near future. Fast chargers are often located along highways or major
thoroughfares similar to traditional gas stations. Fast chargers should be installed by a
licensed electrician.
II. Safety Considerations for EV Chargers
EV chargers in Massachusetts must comply with the requirements of 527 CMR 12.00, the
Massachusetts Electrical Code. The Massachusetts Electrical Code adopts the 2023 edition of
NFPA 70: National Electrical Code.33 All EV charging equipment should be installed by
licensed electricians.
NFPA 70 includes requirements regarding the type of equipment associated with an EV charger,
such as the type and length of both the cord connecting the EV charging equipment to the power
supply and the cord connecting the EV charger to the vehicle. Weatherproof enclosures are
required if the EV charger is installed in an exposed location. NFPA 70 also outlines
requirements regarding the appropriate wiring, voltage, and overcurrent protection for EV
charger installation.
Only EV charger equipment listed to a UL certification or other qualified testing laboratory
should be used. Additionally, since 2023, certain EV chargers installed in Massachusetts must
meet federal Energy Star standards and be listed in the State Appliance Standards Database.34
32 Beginning in model year 2026, each electric vehicle sold in Massachusetts must be supplied with a charging cord
of at least 20 feet in length, compatible with Level 1 and Level 2 charging. 13 CCR 1962.3(c)(3) as required by 310
CMR 7.40 Low Emission Vehicle Program.
33 NFPA 70 refers to EV chargers of all types as electric vehicle supply equipment, or “EVSE”.

Guidance on Public Health, Safety and Environmental Impacts of Electric Battery Storage
and Electric Vehicle Chargers
Section 122 of Chapter 239 of the Acts of 2024, An Act promoting a clean energy grid,
advancing equity, and protecting ratepayers (“2024 Climate Act”), directed the Massachusetts
Department of Environmental Protection (“MassDEP”), in consultation with the Board of Fire
Prevention Regulations (“BFPR”) and the Department of Energy Resources (“DOER”), to issue
guidance on the public health, safety, and environmental impacts of electric battery storage and
electric vehicle chargers.
This Guidance provides an overview of stationary battery energy storage systems, including their
role in increasing reliability of the electric grid and storing energy from renewable sources such
as wind and solar, their different sizes and uses, and the most common types of battery energy
storage technology. The Guidance identifies the applicable regulations, codes, and guidelines
that govern the safe installation, operation, and decommissioning of battery energy storage
systems and protection of public health and the environment.
This Guidance also provides an overview of electric vehicle (“EV”) charger equipment,
including the role of EV chargers in electrifying and decarbonizing the transportation sector, and
the different types of chargers. The Guidance identifies the applicable requirements that govern
the safe installation and use of EV chargers.
BATTERY ENERGY STORAGE
I. Introduction to Battery Energy Storage
The term “energy storage” applies to many different technologies, including electrochemical
storage (batteries), flywheels, thermal storage, and pumped hydroelectric storage. All of these
technologies can store energy and then make the energy available later.
This Guidance focuses on stationary battery energy storage systems (“BESS”) used to provide
electricity to a home, building, or the electric grid. BESS may be co-located with an energy
generation source, such as a solar array, or be a standalone facility. BESS are distinct from the
batteries that power consumer electronics, electric vehicles, or other electric mobility devices.
BESS are important for the Commonwealth to meet its decarbonization goals. The Global
Warming Solutions Act, as amended by the 2021 Climate Roadmap Act (“GWSA”), requires
Massachusetts to reach economy wide, Net Zero greenhouse gas emissions (“GHG”) by 2050.1
To meet this requirement, the Massachusetts Clean Energy and Climate Plan for 2050 (“2050
CECP”) identifies the role of clean, emissions-free energy generation, particularly onshore and
offshore wind and solar photovoltaics resources, which together are expected to comprise about
75% of New England’s electric capacity by 2050.2
In order to integrate this buildout of solar and wind generation capacity, energy storage will be
essential. Solar and wind are key to meeting our decarbonization goals in a cost-effective
manner. However, they are intermittent resources that only generate power when the sun is
1 St. 2008 c. 298 (GWSA); St. 2021 c. 8 (Climate Roadmap Act).
2 The 2050 CECP Phased scenario allows for the clean energy transition to be gradually “phased-in” over the next
three decades. See: https://www.mass.gov/doc/2050-clean-energy-and-climate-plan/download
2

shining or the wind is blowing. While expected generation from solar and wind resources can be
easily and accurately forecasted, BESS of varying sizes deployed throughout the electric grid
will be necessary to integrate solar and wind generation resources and fill in gaps when these and
other resources are incapable of meeting systemwide demand on their own.
During times when the supply of renewable electricity from resources like solar and wind
exceeds customer demand, energy storage can absorb and store that excess supply, augmenting
the supply and demand balance required by the electric grid. Then, when demand for electricity
exceeds renewable electricity supply, for example after the sun sets and solar panels are no
longer generating electricity, energy storage can discharge the excess electricity to meet
customer demand.
Without energy storage in place during periods of high electricity demand where there are
limited resources generating electricity, fossil fuel plants known as “peaker” plants must come
online. Peaker plants, when used, are typically large emitters of both GHG and other emissions
that negatively impact local air quality. The ability for energy storage to displace peaker plants is
critical for Massachusetts to meet Net Zero by 2050 and to improve public health outcomes.
The deployment of BESS also yields significant economic benefits as they help to optimize
electric grid operations, reducing the cost of meeting peak demand, avoiding the need for
additional transmission and distribution investments, balancing the electric grid during times
when supply and demand are not aligned, and improving the resilience of the electric grid, all of
which benefit ratepayers and the economy at large by reducing electricity costs. Energy storage
also creates opportunities for new job growth and can be a significant source of increased local
property tax revenues in communities where it is deployed.
To achieve these economic benefits as well as the GWSA’s 2050 power sector decarbonization
requirements, Massachusetts will likely need to deploy 5.6 gigawatts (GW) or more of energy
storage capacity.3
- Energy storage has different uses and different scales
BESS technologies can be categorized based on scale and technology type. The scale of BESS
generally includes two categories: utility scale and non-utility scale. Utility scale BESS refers to
larger systems that serve and benefit the electric grid as a whole. Non-utility scale BESS are
smaller, and while they too can serve and benefit the electric grid, they primarily serve individual
or small groups of end use customers such as a home, apartment building, or commercial
building.
The energy in a BESS is measured in power capacity and energy capacity. A BESS’s power
capacity refers to the system’s maximum ability to deliver instantaneous power to the grid to
meet customers’ real-time demand. Power capacity for BESS is typically expressed in terms of
kilowatts (“kW”) or megawatts (“MW”). Energy capacity refers to the cumulative amount of
power over time that a BESS can deliver and is typically expressed in terms of kilowatt-hours
(“kWh”) or megawatt-hours (“MWh”). For example, a BESS that is rated as 1 MW/4 MWh has a
3 2050 CECP Workbook of Energy Modeling Results. See spreadsheet tab “8. Electric Capacity,” cell W21 which
shows energy storage capacity for Massachusetts under the Phased scenario.
3

power capacity of 1 MW and can meet 1 MW of instantaneous customer demand, and can do so
for a total of 4 hours before it is fully discharged, giving the BESS an energy capacity of 4
MWh.
- Utility Scale Energy Storage
Utility scale BESS are typically sized from several hundred kW to several hundred MW, with
smaller systems typically serving the electric distribution system and larger systems typically
serving the electric transmission system.
The primary purpose of the electric transmission system is to transmit large amounts of
electricity over long distances to meet demand. The electric transmission system that serves
Massachusetts also serves the other New England states and is managed by ISO New England
(“ISO-NE”). Utility scale BESS is key to reducing costs and emissions associated with
transmission system services because a BESS at that scale can be charged from low-cost
renewable resources like solar and wind and can be deployed to reduce the overall peak demand
of the system and the large associated costs.4 In other words, it can charge when costs are low
and discharge when costs are high, helping to reduce electricity costs for all customers during
periods of high demand.
The electric distribution system in the Commonwealth, which connects to the transmission
system and distributes electricity to customers, is owned and operated by either an Electric
Distribution Company (“EDC”) or a Municipal Electric Department (“MED”), depending on the
municipality.5 Utility scale energy storage at this level can both serve the transmission system
and help the EDCs and MEDs provide safe and reliable electric distribution system service to
customers while lowering customer bills and integrating renewable energy into the electrical
grid. One example of unique distribution level services that a utility scale BESS can provide is
deferring or avoiding the need for distribution system upgrades by reducing local peaks and
providing local power capacity and reliability. They can also provide local energy resilience by
being strategically located to help avoid power outages.6
Utility scale BESS at the transmission and distribution levels can help reduce the need for fossil
fuel peaker plants and therefore improve local air quality.
- Commercial and Residential (Non-Utility Scale)
Non-utility scale storage is commonly owned and operated by building- and home-owners
looking for a way to reduce electricity bills and have backup power. These battery systems are
smaller than utility scale, and are typically located on a customer’s premises and sized based on
the electric demand of the building. Non-utility scale BESS can provide all of the same services
4 For example, Massachusetts State of Charge Report found that the top 10% of peak demand hours represented
about 40% of annual electricity spend. See: ESI: State of Charge Report, pg. i-ii.
5 Massachusetts municipally-owned electric companies. https://www.mass.gov/info-details/massachusetts-
municipally-owned-electric-companies
6 For example, Eversource Energy’s Outer Cape Battery Energy Storage System is designed to provide backup
power to 11,000 customers that live on Outer Cape Cod, avoiding both frequent outages and the need for a second
distribution line along the same route through the Cape Cod National Seashore as the existing distribution line.
4

as utility scale resources, though typically to a smaller degree; however, they can also uniquely
provide end use customer services such as bill savings through building peak demand
management and site-specific resilience to power outages. In addition, non-utility scale energy
storage can provide local air quality benefits if it is replacing a fossil fuel-based backup
generator.
- Battery Storage Technologies and Makeup
There are many technological approaches to BESS. Nearly all recent and current battery energy
storage deployments are lithium-ion-based electrochemical energy storage technologies
(“lithium-ion batteries”).7,8 In Massachusetts, about 97% of installed BESS in EDC
municipalities are lithium-ion batteries.9
Lithium-ion batteries dominate the current energy storage market for several reasons. Lithium-
ion batteries are generally less expensive than other energy storage technologies. Because
lithium-ion batteries are also the predominant energy storage technology in consumer electronics
and electric vehicles, the technology benefits from large scale manufacturing and a robust supply
chain, leading to dramatic cost declines over the past decade.10 Second, lithium-ion batteries
have favorable energy storage properties, such as high energy density, long lifetime, fast
response time, fast recharging time, and low losses in energy storage capacity when sitting idle
(also known as low self-discharge).
Lithium-ion batteries comprise a family of batteries which differ in their specific chemistries.
More recently, energy storage project developers have transitioned from a high nickel content
lithium-ion battery chemistry (known as nickel manganese cobalt or “NMC”) to a chemistry high
in iron (known as lithium iron phosphate or “LFP”).11 Even though LFP is less energy dense than
NMC, LFP has advantages over NMC of lower cost, lower flammability, and longer lifetime. In
2023, LFP comprised 80% of new energy storage installations worldwide.12
Batteries such as lithium-ion batteries start with a building block, called a cell, where energy is
stored for future use. Multiple cells are electrically connected into modules, and multiple
modules are then electrically connected to form the BESS. Through this scaling process, a BESS
can be designed to meet the customer’s particular power and energy needs. BESS are typically

integrated into enclosures, which can include HVAC to keep the BESS at the appropriate
operating temperature, and various safety systems and designs discussed in more detail in this
guidance. A battery management system acts like the brain of the BESS and continuously
monitors the BESS to ensure it is operating according to design standards and can adjust the
BESS’s operation or trigger safety systems as necessary.13
Lithium-ion batteries, like all technologies, will continue to see innovations to improve their
performance, safety, longevity, cost, and reliability. The energy storage market as a whole will
also continue to see innovations and evolve, with non-lithium-ion approaches likely to take more
significant market share sometime in the future.

The 2024 Climate Act required changes to the way clean energy projects, including BESS, are
sited and permitted in the Commonwealth. Beginning on July 1, 2026, the Energy Facilities
Siting Board (“EFSB”) will have exclusive authority to review and permit all proposed BESS
projects with a rated capacity of 100 MWh or greater, referred to as a “large clean energy storage
facility.”14 The EFSB will issue a single consolidated permit that comprises all state, regional,
and local permits that a large clean energy storage facility would otherwise need to commence
construction and operation.15
A BESS with a rated capacity of less than 100 MWh, referred to in the Act as a “small clean
energy storage facility,” will be subject to all local permits, but the local permitting authorities
will be required to issue a single, consolidated permit in 12 months or less.16
The 2024 Climate Act requires the EFSB and DOER to promulgate a uniform set of health,
safety, environmental and other standards, including zoning criteria in DOER’s case, governing
the siting and permitting of eligible clean energy projects within their respective jurisdictions.
The EFSB and DOER each must promulgate such standards by March 1, 2026. These new
standards may incorporate by reference, supersede, or be in addition to any or all of the
requirements addressed in this Guidance.
II. Fire Safety
The safety of BESS has improved significantly in recent years. One comprehensive analysis
found that the failure rate of utility-scale BESS decreased by 97% between 2018 and 2023 as the
deployment of BESS greatly increased.17 Lessons learned from earlier incidents when this
technology was nascent have led to new and robust requirements and improved industry
practices. BESS that are designed with sufficient safety protections and are installed, operated,
and maintained in a manner that maintains the system safety can be operated without incident as
demonstrated by the many systems currently operating safely in the field.

In Massachusetts, several layers of coordinated standards apply to BESS. Stationary BESS must
comply with the requirements of 527 CMR 1.00: The Massachusetts Comprehensive Fire Safety
Code (“the Massachusetts Fire Code”). The Board of Fire Prevention Regulations (“BFPR”)
promulgates the Massachusetts Fire Code, which adopts NFPA 1: Fire Code, with some state-
specific modifications. NFPA 1 is the national model fire code developed by the National Fire
Protection Association (“NFPA”).18 The Massachusetts Fire Code, Chapter 52, references the
2020 NFPA 855: Standard for the Installation of Stationary Energy Storage Systems.
A table of relevant fire safety regulations, codes, standards and certifications is appended to this
Guidance.
NFPA 1 outlines requirements that provide a reasonable level of fire and life safety, as well as
property protection from the hazards created by fire, explosion, and dangerous conditions. NFPA
1 addresses fire protection systems such as sprinklers and alarms, emergency planning and
evacuation, providing fire departments with site access, water supplies and flow requirements,
and minimizing risks of handling, using or storing hazardous materials.
NFPA 855 was first issued in 2019 in response to the increasing use of energy storage systems,
including BESS. It sets comprehensive criteria for the fire protection of BESS and other energy
storage installations based on the technology used, the setting where the system is being
installed, the size and separation of the installations, and the fire suppression and control systems
in place. NFPA 855 also reflects the current best practice for preventing explosions and safely
containing fires.
The requirements of NFPA 855 address design, installation, operation and decommissioning.
While the applicability of the requirements will vary based on the specifics of a project such as
size, location, and system, the following are examples of criteria in NFPA 855:
- Location of the project: NFPA 855 Chapter 4.4 provides detailed requirements addressing
both indoor and outdoor installations. Location requirements for outdoor BESS include
providing minimum distances from exposures like buildings or public ways; vegetation
control; ensuring electrical circuitry is housed within weatherproof enclosures; and
requiring that fire department access roads be provided in accordance with local fire
codes. Indoor BESS requirements address different criteria for buildings dedicated to
BESS versus non-dedicated-use buildings.
- Equipment: NFPA 855 Chapter 4.2 requires BESS equipment to be listed in accordance
with UL 9540 - Standard for Energy Storage Systems and Equipment, unless specifically
exempted. UL 9540 is a certification that evaluates the entire battery system, verifying
that it meets fire, electrical, and functional safety requirements. UL 9540 also requires
that the major battery components be qualified to their own standards, such as UL 1741,
18 The NFPA is a U.S.-based non-profit organization dedicated to reducing fire and related hazards. The NFPA
develops model safety standards through a public, consensus-driven process drawing on the expertise of thousands
of volunteers from relevant industries. States may adopt all or parts of NFPA codes as requirements, as
Massachusetts has done by adopting NFPA 1 with certain state amendments. NFPA model codes are revised
regularly to reflect the most current practices. In Massachusetts, the BFPR regularly reviews and adopts updated
code editions.

which certifies a battery’s power conversion system, and UL 1973, which certifies the
safety and performance of battery cells, modules, and packs, evaluating their ability to
withstand thermal runaway, mechanical stress, and electrical faults.19
- Installation: NFPA 855 Chapter 4.3 requires BESS to be installed in accordance with the
manufacturer’s requirements. Installation requirements also address signage, seismic
protection, impact protection, site security, and adequate egress, as appropriate.
- Emergency Planning and Training: NFPA 855 Chapter 4.1.3 requires BESS owners to
establish and maintain an emergency operations plan with procedures for the safe
shutdown, de-energizing or isolation of equipment and systems, inspection and testing,
responding to emergency notifications, and procedures to be followed in the case of fire,
explosion, release of liquids or vapors, damage to critical moving parts, or other
potentially dangerous conditions. Emergency training for facility staff is also required.
NFPA 855 also requires smoke detection systems on all BESS systems located within buildings
or structures, fire control and suppression systems, explosion control and spill control measures.
- Fire Safety Information and Documentation Expected for Permitting Energy Storage
Systems
A permit from the local fire department is required to install and operate lithium-ion BESS
greater than 20 kWh, or one (1) kWh for installations in one- or two-family dwellings or
townhouse units.20 At these thresholds, the vast majority of BESS installations, both residential,
commercial, and utility scale, in indoor or outdoor locations, are required to obtain such a permit.
BESS Scale Threshold For Fire Department Permitting
(kWH)
One- or two-family dwellings or townhouse 1 kWh
units
Commercial and utility-scale 20 kWh
For BESS installations exceeding 1 kWh in one- or two-family dwellings or townhouse units, the
plans and specifications associated with the installation shall be submitted to the local fire
department for approval and include the following:
- the location and layout diagram of the room or area in which the BESS is to be installed;
- details on wall construction for rooms or areas where BESS are installed;
- the quantities and types of BESS units;
- manufacturer’s specifications, ratings, and listings of BESS;
19 Underwriters Laboratory, or “UL”, is an independent testing and certification organization. Manufacturers submit
their products to UL for evaluation. UL assesses the product’s safety, performance, and compliance with applicable
standards. This may include electrical, mechanical, environmental, and other specific tests depending on the nature
of the product.
20 Beginning July 1, 2026, proposed BESS facilities with a rated capacity of 100 MWh will be within the sole
jurisdiction of the EFSB for purposes of all state, local and regional permits, including permits typically issued by
local fire departments.

- description of energy storage management systems and their operation;
- location and content of required signage;
- details on fire suppression, smoke or fire detection, gas detection, thermal management,
ventilation, exhaust, and deflagration venting systems, if provided;
- support arrangement associated with the installation, including any required seismic
support; and
- description of scope of work for retrofit or repairs of BESS.
Applicants proposing a BESS project exceeding 20 kWh are required to submit detailed
information for review by local fire officials. The information includes, but is not limited to, the
following:
- the quantities and types of BESS units;
- manufacturer’s specifications, ratings, and listings of BESS;
- emergency operations plan;
- hazard mitigation analysis;
- details of all safety systems, including fire suppression, smoke or fire detection, gas
detection, thermal management, ventilation, exhaust, and deflagration venting systems, as
applicable;
- results of fire and explosion testing to UL 9540A or equivalent;
- location and layout diagram of the room or area in which the BESS is to be installed;
- details on hourly fire-resistant-rated assemblies provided or relied upon in relation to the
BESS;
- location and content of required signage;
- support arrangement associated with the installation, including any seismic support.
This information allows for fire departments, and local and state regulators, to assess the
individual safety characteristics of a particular project and ensure that the proposed project
complies with all of the applicable code requirements prior to issuing a permit.
- In the Event of a Fire
Lithium-ion batteries can experience thermal runaway. Thermal runaway is defined in NFPA
855 as “The condition when an electrochemical cell increases its temperature through self-
heating in an uncontrollable fashion and progresses when the cell’s heat generation is at a higher
rate than it can dissipate, potentially leading to off-gassing, fire, or explosion.” Lithium-ion
BESS are required to include a listed device or other approved method to preclude, detect, and
minimize the impact of thermal runaway. NFPA 855, Chapter 9.3.
Water is considered the preferred agent for suppressing lithium-ion battery fires. Water has
superior cooling capacity and is easy to transport to the seat of the fire. Fire-fighting foams, such
as those containing per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (“PFAS”), are not considered to be
effective for these chemistries because they lack the ability to cool sufficiently and can conduct
electricity. Fire-fighting dry chemical powders can eliminate visible flame, but they also lack the
ability to cool burning battery components as water can do.21
21 NFPA 855 – 2020 Edition, Annex C.

III. Protecting Public Health and the Environment
BESS must comply with all applicable laws and regulations, including federal, state and local
requirements protective of public health and the environment. These legal frameworks govern all
aspects of a BESS project, including, but not limited to, siting, zoning, wetlands impacts,
stormwater management and impacts, drinking water protection, release(s) or threat(s) of release
of oil or hazardous materials to the environment, and noise levels. Any local zoning by-law or
ordinance must comply with M.G.L. c. 40A § 3, which prohibits the unreasonable regulation of
BESS.22
The permits and approvals required for a given BESS project will depend on the specific
circumstances of the proposal. Key environmental permitting and approval considerations
include, but are not limited to, the following, particularly for utility-scale BESS which have a
larger footprint:
Wetlands: BESS projects involving activities in jurisdictional wetlands resource areas and
corresponding buffer zones must comply with the Wetlands Protection Act (“WPA”), M.G.L. c.
131, § 40, and the WPA regulations at 310 CMR 10.00. Projects that result in a discharge of
dredged or fill material to waters of the United States and require a Section 401 Water Quality
Certification are subject to the regulations at 314 CMR 9.00. Local jurisdictions may also have
wetlands protection bylaws.23
Stormwater: BESS developments may be required to comply with MassDEP’s
Stormwater Management Standards provided in 310 CMR 10.05(6)(k)-(q), if the development is
subject to the jurisdiction of the Wetlands Protection Act, and 314 CMR 9.06(6)(a), if the
development requires a Section 401 water quality certification for discharges of dredged or fill
material. The Stormwater Management Standards encourage stormwater recharge to
groundwater, require measures to control surface water runoff that may contribute to
downstream flooding, and prevent stormwater discharges from causing or contributing to the
pollution of the surface waters and groundwaters of the Commonwealth. The standards require
the implementation of a wide variety of stormwater management strategies, depending on
specific site characteristics, including environmentally sensitive site design and low impact
development (LID) techniques to minimize impervious surface and land disturbance, source
control and pollution prevention, structural and non-structural best management practices,
construction period erosion and sedimentation control, and the long-term operation and
maintenance of stormwater management systems.
Compliance with the Stormwater Management Standards may require remote shut-off
valves, lined conveyances and basins, or other measures designed to intercept and contain
surface water runoff during a failure event such as a fire. More information about the Stormwater
22 M.G.L 40A § 3 provides “No zoning ordinance or by-law shall prohibit or unreasonably regulate the installation
of solar energy systems or the building of structures that facilitate the collection of solar energy, except where
necessary to protect the public health, safety or welfare.” Battery energy storage systems qualify as “structures that
facilitate the collection of solar energy.” Massachusetts Office of the Attorney General, Decision re: Carver Annual
Town Meeting of April 12, 2022, p.6 note 8, issued November 14, 2022.
23 Beginning July 1, 2026, proposed BESS facilities with a rated capacity of 100 MWh will be within the sole
jurisdiction of the EFSB for purposes of all state, local and regional permits.
10

Management Standards is available at https://www.mass.gov/guides/massachusetts-stormwater-
handbook-and-stormwater-standards.
Drinking Water: MassDEP regulates public water systems pursuant to M.G.L. c. 111, §
160 and 310 CMR 22.00, the Drinking Water Regulations. The Drinking Water Regulations
impose requirements on public water systems to prevent the pollution of drinking water by
protecting both surface water (310 CMR 22.20B, et seq.) and groundwater (310 CMR 22.21)
sources.
Public water suppliers and BESS project applicants should consult the MassDEP
Drinking Water Program’s guidance on the siting of BESS around sources of public drinking
water, titled Information to be Submitted to MassDEP for Proposed Solar and Wind Energy
Projects on Lands Owned or Controlled by Public Water Systems for Drinking Water Purposes
(available at https://www.mass.gov/doc/pwss-and-windsolar-energy-projects-guidance). BESS is
prohibited within the area immediately surrounding a public water supply well or wellfield,
known as Zone I (defined at 310 CMR 22.02). Outside of Zone I, (e.g., Zone II for groundwater
sources or Zone A for surface water sources) on land owned or controlled by the public water
system for drinking water purposes, BESS require MassDEP approval and should meet the
conditions specified in the guideline. Example conditions include locating BESS above the 100-
year floodplain and within a self-containment area so that in the event of a fire, fire extinguishing
chemicals will be completely contained.
Public water sources designed to withdraw more than 100,000 gallons per day must
protect the MassDEP approved Zone II or Zone A recharge areas. Protection must be in the form
of municipal bylaws/ordinances, general bylaws/ordinances or Board of Health Regulations.
Protection controls must prohibit the activities cited in 310 CMR 22.20B(2) for Zone A and 310
CMR 22.21(2) for Zone II. Other municipal controls may also apply.24
Waterways / Chapter 91: If a BESS project requires construction, filling, or dredging in
filled or flowed tidelands, great ponds, and the navigable portions of non-tidal rivers and streams
on which public funds have been expended, then the project proponent would need to obtain a
license from MassDEP pursuant to M.G.L. c. 91 and 310 CMR 9.00.
Air Quality / Emissions: BESS do not emit air pollutants at levels requiring an air permit
from MassDEP.
Noise: BESS can generate significant levels of sound from cooling systems, inverters,
system electronics, and transformers, and can become a nuisance when located near residences
that can be as much as 40 decibels about background sound levels if not appropriately designed
to attenuate sound.
BESS must comply with any local noise bylaws, regulations or ordinances.25 They also must
24 Beginning July 1, 2026, proposed BESS facilities with a rated capacity of 100 MWh will be within the sole
jurisdiction of the EFSB for purposes of all state, local and regional permits.
25 Beginning July 1, 2026, proposed BESS facilities with a rated capacity of 100 MWh will be within the sole
jurisdiction of the EFSB for purposes of all state, local and regional permits.
11

comply with MassDEP’s noise regulations at 310 CMR 7.10.
MassDEP issued a Noise Policy (90-001) that states that a source of sound is considered to be
violating 310 CMR 7.10 if the source either increases the broadband sound level by more than 10
decibels above ambient or produces a “pure tone” condition – when any octave band center
frequency sound pressure level exceeds the two adjacent center frequency sound pressure levels
by 3 decibels or more. These criteria are measured both at the property line and at the nearest
inhabited residences or other sensitive receptors.
Sound suppression or mitigation measures may be implemented to achieve desired sound levels.
Examples of such measures include the use of lower noise equipment, sound attenuation barriers,
and operational restrictions such as limiting fan speeds and the number of active units during
quieter hours. Sound suppression measures should be designed to achieve the lowest sound level
increase above background that is technologically feasible.
- Environmental Considerations in the Event of a Fire or Other Release
Any fire occurring in the built environment is likely to contribute to environmental
contamination, including air contamination from the fire plume and possible subsequent
deposition to land and water, contamination from suppression water runoff, and other potential
environmental discharges from burned materials. Like all energy technologies, batteries can
present chemistry-specific hazards under faulty conditions. Lithium-ion batteries could leak or
spill chemicals, so these systems are typically required to provide spill containment.
In the event of a fire or spill at a BESS facility, the local fire department should be called
immediately. After the local fire department has been notified, MassDEP’s Emergency Response
(ER) must be notified via the ER Hot Line (888-304-1133) within 2 hours of a release or spill of
oil or hazardous materials that meet MassDEP’s 2-hour reporting thresholds requirements.
MassDEP Emergency Response personnel are available 24/7 to respond and help contain and
assess spills/releases of oil or hazardous chemicals.
Once the battery components and site have been rendered safe, the owner of the BESS facility
should hire a hazardous materials response contractor for proper assessment, transport and
disposal. Pursuant to regulations known as the Massachusetts Contingency Plan (“MCP”, 310
CMR 40.0000), following a battery fire or other release to the environment, the owner of the
BESS is required to hire a Licensed Site Professional/response contractor to implement
immediate response actions. This could include, for example, immediate containment or spill
cleanup and sampling of nearby soils, surface waters and groundwater for residual
contamination. If contamination is found above regulatory limits, then further cleanup is required
according to MCP requirements. If the owner/potentially responsible party is unwilling or unable
to hire a contractor, MassDEP has the ability to activate one, and pursue cost recovery from the
potentially responsible party (i.e. owner).26 MassDEP also maintains on its website a list of
26 Source: DFS Memorandum, Dangers of Lithium Batteries, Feb. 6, 2023, https://www.mass.gov/doc/advisory-
dangers-of-lithium-batteries-2023/download.
12

licensed hazardous waste transporters who can provide transport and disposal services.27
- End-of-Life and Decommissioning
Pursuant to the Massachusetts Fire Code and NFPA 855, BESS facility owners must provide a
decommissioning plan to the fire department for approval prior to decommissioning the system.
In accordance with Chapter 8 of NFPA 855, the decommissioning plan must include steps for the
safe shut down, disassembly and removal of the battery components.
Most lithium-ion batteries meet the definition of hazardous waste pursuant to the Massachusetts
Hazardous Waste Regulations, 310 CMR 30.000. However, lithium-ion batteries may be
managed in compliance with the streamlined standards for universal waste management (e.g., a
manifest is not required) at 310 CMR 30.1000, provided that the batteries are managed at the site
of generation in a way that prevents releases to the environment and the batteries are sent to
another universal waste “handler” or a “destination facility” that is authorized to recycle lithium-
ion batteries.
In addition to existing requirements, a special commission known as the Extended Producer
Responsibility Commission has been established pursuant to the 2024 Climate Act.28 The
Commission is charged with making policy recommendations for handling lithium-ion batteries
and other products when they reach the end of their useful life. The Commission is chaired by
the MassDEP Commissioner and comprises a diverse set of stakeholders. The Commission’s
recommendations are due to the Legislature by January 15, 2026.

ELECTRIC VEHICLE CHARGERS
I. Introduction to Electric Vehicle Chargers
The electrification of the transportation sector in Massachusetts is critical to achieving the
Commonwealth’s greenhouse gas (“GHG”) reduction goals. The transportation sector is
responsible for 38% of GHG emissions in Massachusetts, making it the largest source of
emissions by sector from the combustion of gasoline, diesel, and aviation fuel in cars, buses,
trucks, ships, and airplanes.29
As the use of electric vehicles (EVs) has grown, so has the need for EV charging infrastructure.
EV charging infrastructure needs to be installed throughout the state for drivers and business
owners to feel comfortable switching to EVs. Massachusetts has a number of programs that
provide incentives and grant funding for EV chargers, one of which is MassDEP’s Electric
Vehicle Incentive Program (“MassEVIP”) which supports charging stations for the general
public, employees and fleets, and multi-unit dwellings and educational campuses.
There are three main drivers of MassDEP’s MassEVIP programs:
1. Transportation emissions contribute to the formation of ground-level ozone, a key
component of smog. This pollution can exacerbate respiratory conditions such as
asthma and bronchitis, particularly affecting children, older adults, and people with
pre-existing health issues. Additionally, exposure to nitrogen dioxide (NO₂), a
byproduct of vehicle emissions, can irritate the respiratory system and increase
susceptibility to infections.
2. The transportation sector is a significant source of GHG emissions in Massachusetts,
accounting for approximately 38% of the state's total emissions.30 These emissions
contribute to global warming and climate change, posing long-term risks to the
environment and public health.
3. Communities located near high-traffic areas, such as highways and industrial zones,
often experience cumulative pollution from multiple sources. This compounded
exposure can lead to higher rates of respiratory and cardiovascular diseases among
residents, disproportionately impacting low-income and minority populations.31
EV chargers come in three types based on the power output of the charger: Level 1, Level 2, and
direct current (DC) fast chargers, also known as Level 3.
1. Level 1 chargers use standard 120-volt (V) alternating current (AC). There are hardwired
units that are most commonly used in commercial settings as well as cords that can be
plugged into a standard 3-prong outlet. Hardwired units should be installed by a licensed

electrician. A Level 1 charging cord may be provided by the manufacturer32 with the
purchase of a new EV, or can be purchased separately, and can be used to charge the
vehicle at home using a standard outlet without the need for special installation or wiring.
2. Level 2 chargers use 240-volts AC, the level commonly used for clothes dryers and other
large household appliances. Level 2 chargers may be installed at single family homes (in
a garage or near the driveway), as well as in public areas like parking lots, parking
garages and rest stops. Level 2 chargers should be installed by a licensed electrician.
3. DC fast chargers can charge a vehicle significantly faster than other charger types, but are
also significantly more expensive. They also often require significant upgrades to the
existing electrical infrastructure, depending on the amount of power already available and
how many charging stations are installed and how many kW of power they can supply.
Fast chargers can range in power from 50 kW to 350 kW, with even faster charging
speeds coming in the near future. Fast chargers are often located along highways or major
thoroughfares similar to traditional gas stations. Fast chargers should be installed by a
licensed electrician.
II. Safety Considerations for EV Chargers
EV chargers in Massachusetts must comply with the requirements of 527 CMR 12.00, the
Massachusetts Electrical Code. The Massachusetts Electrical Code adopts the 2023 edition of
NFPA 70: National Electrical Code.33 All EV charging equipment should be installed by
licensed electricians.
NFPA 70 includes requirements regarding the type of equipment associated with an EV charger,
such as the type and length of both the cord connecting the EV charging equipment to the power
supply and the cord connecting the EV charger to the vehicle. Weatherproof enclosures are
required if the EV charger is installed in an exposed location. NFPA 70 also outlines
requirements regarding the appropriate wiring, voltage, and overcurrent protection for EV
charger installation.
Only EV charger equipment listed to a UL certification or other qualified testing laboratory
should be used. Additionally, since 2023, certain EV chargers installed in Massachusetts must
meet federal Energy Star standards and be listed in the State Appliance Standards Database.34
32 Beginning in model year 2026, each electric vehicle sold in Massachusetts must be supplied with a charging cord
of at least 20 feet in length, compatible with Level 1 and Level 2 charging. 13 CCR 1962.3(c)(3) as required by 310
CMR 7.40 Low Emission Vehicle Program.
33 NFPA 70 refers to EV chargers of all types as electric vehicle supply equipment, or “EVSE”.
