Section 2:
Section 63 of Chapter 42 of the Acts of 2022 dictates that the Division of Capital Asset
Management and Maintenance (DCAMM) shall prepare and submit an annual report on projects
utilizing Job Order Contracts (JOC), including analysis of the cost effectiveness and any other
benefits of the JOC pilot program.
Background
The five-year JOC pilot program established by Section 49 of Chapter 9 of the Acts of 2011 has
been extended several times pursuant to Sections 23 and 24 of Chapter 119 of the Acts of 2015;

Section 3:
Sections 22-24 of Chapter 113 of the Acts of 2018; Sections 22 -23 of Chapter 34 of the Acts of
2019; and Section 63 of Chapter 42 of the Acts of 2022. The JOC authority granted by Section 63
of Chapter 42 of the Acts of 2022 expires on January 1, 2027, but any job order contract awarded
before that date may be executed and continue in effect for a maximum of 2 years from the date of
execution and delivery.
Description of Job Order Contracting
Job Order Contracting is a procurement method resulting in "a contract for the performance of
maintenance, repair, alteration, and conversion projects, or a subset thereof: (i) that is limited to a
specified term; (ii) in which the contract specifications consist of technical descriptions of various
tasks, materials and equipment at stated unit prices but do not specify the specific projects to be
performed by the contractor; (iii) which contains a fixed contractor's mark up over the unit prices
stated in the specifications; and (iv) in accordance with which at least 1 specified state agency may
enter into fixed price job orders with the contractor for the performance of specific projects,
consisting solely of combinations of the tasks, materials and equipment specified in the contract, at
the unit prices specified therein plus the contractor's mark-up.” 1
Job Order Contracting Program Requirements
Job Order Contracting "contracts shall be limited to job orders estimated to cost not more than
$150,000 each and shall be procured though the procedures specified in section 39M of Chapter
30 of the General Laws except that: (i) the amount of the bid deposit shall be $5,000; (ii)
contractors who are awarded job orders under any job order contract shall be certified by the
division of capital asset management and maintenance for the category of work specified in the
contract; and (iii) the amounts of surety bonds required by the contract may be satisfied with
respect to each particular job order before the commencement of any work under that job order." 2

JOC REPORT FY24 and FY25 3
Job Order Contract Pilot Program Implementation
During fiscal year 2024, 19 tasks were assigned and completed (see table below). The average
cost of a FY24 JOC project was $90,500.48.
In fiscal year 2025, 13 tasks were assigned and completed (see table below). The average cost of
a FY25 JOC project was $79,115.82.
Tasks rarely have a duration greater than 2-3 weeks, due to the maximum allowable estimated cost
of $150,000/per task, and the critical nature of the required work.
Benefits of Using Job Order Contracting
DCAMM uses JOC to rapidly undertake required maintenance, repair, and replacement work at
facilities under DCAMM's care and control, while adhering to Massachusetts State Finance laws.
Facilities under DCAMMs care and control are typically occupied and must continue to be safe and
operational during the completion of maintenance work. JOC enables DCAMM to respond in a
timely manner while maintaining safety and continuity of operations.
The ability to address maintenance needs immediately with certified general contractors already
under contract (procured via standard public procurement) allows DCAMM to address issues that
arise for facility managers who are facing deferred maintenance, aged systems, and
emergency/unexpected failures that could result in building shutdowns.
The main cost savings from the JOC program come from the reduction of administrative costs.
JOC reduces procurement administrative time and project management support time for DCAMM
staff. The JOC project delivery method also results in minimized administrative transactions, fewer
change orders than those associated with conventional project delivery, reduced contracts
management and payment/accounting support.
In addition to enabling expedited project delivery at occupied facilities and reducing costs, JOC
facilitates an effective working environment between DCAMM and contractors. Using a pool of
vendors to perform tasks allows the vendors to become "experts" in DCAMM processes. As the
pool of contractors becomes more familiar with DCAMM’s procedures, staff spend less time
addressing incorrectly submitted proposals, supporting documents, and invoices. While it is difficult
to quantify these savings, this improved efficiency allows DCAMM administrative staff to perform
other tasks instead of managing contractors who are unfamiliar with DCAMM's processes. And for
contractors, this system allows for more time to focus on their expertise rather than addressing
bureaucracy.
Conclusion
In FY24 and FY25, the Job Order Contracting pilot program continued to enable DCAMM to
complete critical maintenance and repairs to Commonwealth-controlled facilities in a timely and
cost-effective fashion while reducing duplicative or unnecessary work for both the Commonwealth
and our vendors.
JOC REPORT FY24 and FY25 4
DCAMM thanks the legislature for the success of the pilot program in streamlining the process of
addressing high-priority, time-sensitive repair projects without compromising safety, operational
continuity, or fiscal responsibility.
