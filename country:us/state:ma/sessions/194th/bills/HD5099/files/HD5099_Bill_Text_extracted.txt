Committee for Public Counsel Services
Staffing Expansion Plan: FY26–FY27
Pursuant to Line Item 0321-1599 of Chapter 14 of the Acts of 2025, An Act making appropriations for
the fiscal year 2025 to provide for supplementing certain existing appropriations and for certain other
activities and projects, the Committee for Public Counsel respectfully submits the following plan.
As required, this submission includes:
• An update on hiring activity undertaken under this line item to date, and
• A detailed plan to hire attorneys in a manner that ensures clients are timely represented by
counsel, consistent with the mandates of the Sixth Amendment and the goals of equitable,
constitutionally adequate public defense.
The Committee appreciates the Legislature’s support and attention to this critical need. The following

Section 2:
sections outline the progress made, strategies for continued recruitment, and implementation plans for
expanding and sustaining the indigent defense workforce across the Commonwealth.
Introduction
At the Legislature’s direction, the Committee for Public Counsel Services (CPCS) is undertaking the
largest staffing expansion in the agency’s history. This plan reflects the urgent need to expand
representation for indigent clients across the Commonwealth while ensuring that attorneys and support
staff are adequately supervised, trained, and retained. The expansion plan is designed to be implemented
in two stages, FY26 and FY27, and is supported by significant investment in training infrastructure,
supervisory structures, and recruitment strategies.
For clarity, NAT (New Attorney Training) refers to CPCS’s intensive multi-week training program for
new attorneys, paired with our Zealous Advocacy program, which emphasizes client-centered
representation. NAT sessions will be offered multiple times per year to align with law school graduation
and bar admission cycles.
FTE (Full-Time Equivalent) is a standard measure of staffing, used here to capture both full- and part-
time positions.
Background
Prior to the legislative expansion mandate of 2025, CPCS had already hired 20 attorneys for its Fall 2025
class. Following the enactment of the mandate, that number has increased to 38 confirmed hires, with
the final count expected to slightly exceed 42 attorneys by mid-September. Nearly 80 percent of these
expansion hires are being assigned to offices in Middlesex and Suffolk counties, which are among the
most impacted areas and where the need for counsel is most urgent. The remainder hires are being
assigned to other high volume and impacted counties, including Barnstable and Worcester, to ensure
broader statewide coverage in regions facing higher demand and capacity challenges.
Initial Steps Towards Compliance with Legislative Mandate
2
On August 5, 2025, the Governor signed legislation requiring the CPCS Public Defender Division
to hire 320 attorneys over two fiscal years. To comply with this mandate, we have taken the
following concrete and immediate steps:
• Candidate Outreach and Recruitment:
We developed and launched an attorney referral form to collect names and contact information
of prospective candidates through our professional and academic networks.
• Law School Engagement:
We reached out to approximately 50 law schools throughout New England and beyond to inform
them of the expansion initiative. We have also begun meeting directly with clinical faculty at
local law schools to build strategic recruitment partnerships.
• Campus and Public Interest Recruitment Events:
We have scheduled on-campus interviews at all local law schools and will participate in the Equal
Justice Works Conference and Career Fair, the largest public interest legal career fare in the
country, in October to further broaden our candidate pool.
• Streamlining the Hiring Process:
To expedite recruitment, we are streamlining our internal hiring workflow. For example, we have
moved key elements—such as written essays—earlier in the application process to accelerate
interviews and offer decisions. We have formed multiple interviewing teams and staff have
foregone vacations to assist in securing new staff.
• Early Hiring Success:
Between August 5 and August 22, 2025, within just 17 days, we successfully hired 22 new
attorneys, all of whom are scheduled to begin training on September 8, 2025.
• Facilities Expansion Planning:
We have met with DCAM to secure appropriate assistance and guidance to secure appropriate
space to increase the staff.
• Technology and Operational Support:
We are assessing the equipment and operational needs associated with onboarding staff and
includes procuring necessary computer equipment and other resources to support both temporary
and long-term placements.

FY26 Expansion
Attorney Hiring
In Fiscal Year 2026, CPCS will implement a phased attorney hiring strategy aligned with its New
Attorney Training (NAT) schedule. This includes three distinct hiring waves:
September 2025 NAT & Zealous: Up to 44 public defender attorneys and 26 bar advocates, a maximum
of 74 attendees. To date, 36 new PDD attorneys have been confirmed, including 14 fall class recruits and
22 expansion hires.
• December 2025 Accelerated NAT: 30 attorneys through a condensed three-week program
tailored to December law graduates and bar passers.
• March 2026 NAT: 50 attorneys and up to 20 bar advocates, focusing on both new graduates and
experienced candidates.
• June 2026 NAT: Up to 20 New Lawyer hires.
In total, CPCS expects roughly 120 new attorneys on board in FY26 across staff counsel and private bar
advocates.
Support Staff and Supervision
To support the anticipated attorney expansion in FY26 and ensure successful operational and supervisory
capacity, CPCS will implement a coordinated increase in support professionals across key functional
areas. This includes:
• Supervisors to maintain the mandated 1:5 attorney-to-supervisor ratio, ensuring robust
oversight and mentorship.
• Investigators at a ratio of 1 per 10 attorneys, with higher ratios in larger offices, supporting
effective trial preparation and evidence development.
• Paralegals and Administrative Assistants at approximately 1 per 5–6 attorneys, to maintain a
consistent staffing ratio and support the expanding caseload and operational needs.
• Social Service Advocates at a ratio of 1 per 10 attorneys, supporting legal outcomes through case
management, sentencing advocacy, and mitigation.

FY27 Expansion
Attorney Hiring
FY27 builds on FY26’s foundation with a single, large-scale hiring initiative:
• September 2026 NAT & Zealous: 100 new attorneys, the largest incoming class in CPCS
history. This ambitious effort will require a nationwide recruitment campaign targeting law
schools and public interest networks across the country. The September 2026 class will also
include bar advocates, who will train alongside staff counsel to ensure alignment in practice
standards and enhance continuity across CPCS’s dual-delivery model.
Support Staff and Supervision
To sustain this unprecedented growth, CPCS will add proportional expansion in supervisory and
operational support roles:
• Supervisors expanded in line with the 1:5 ratio
• Investigators increased as attorney headcount rises
• Paralegals and Administrative Assistants scaled accordingly
The total projected expansion in FY27 is between 120 and 160 full-time equivalents (FTEs) across all
roles, including attorneys, supervisors, investigators, and administrative staff.
Training and Professional Development Infrastructure
CPCS recognizes that expansion is not solely a matter of increasing headcount. Without comprehensive
training and supervision, new hires face a heightened risk of burnout or ineffective advocacy. To mitigate
these risks and support long-term professional growth, CPCS has made significant investments in a
layered and scalable training infrastructure, including:
• NAT & Zealous Advocacy: This is CPCS’s core onboarding and skills development
program, designed to immerse new attorneys in both the legal and practical aspects of public
defense. The program has been expanded and scaled to accommodate incoming classes of up to
100 attorneys, ensuring consistent, high-quality preparation for all new hires.
• Supervisor Development: CPCS has enhanced its supervisor training curriculum to ensure
leadership staff are prepared to guide large numbers of new attorneys. Many will serve as
Zealous coaches, reinforcing best practices and building mentoring relationships from day one.
• Accelerated Courses: Tailored programs will be established to be in place to meet the unique
needs of candidates entering CPCS outside the traditional hiring cycle:
December 2025: A three-week NAT session specifically for winter law graduates.
o
May 2026: A one-week intensive onboarding program designed for experienced
o
lateral hires, including attorneys transitioning from other jurisdictions.
5
This multi-layered training approach ensures that both new and experienced attorneys enter CPCS
practice with the tools, supervision and support needed to succeed in a demanding public defense
environment. By investing in training infrastructure at scale, CPCS is safeguarding the quality of
representation and building a strong foundation for sustainable workforce growth.
Commentary
This expansion represents a transformational investment in the public defense system. It provides not
only a significant number of additional attorneys but also the supervisory, investigative, and
administrative infrastructure to sustain a modern and effective indigent defense practice. By structuring
growth around proportional staffing ratios and investing in training, CPCS is helping to build a
sustainable, system designed for long-term stability and long-term impact for the communities we serve.
