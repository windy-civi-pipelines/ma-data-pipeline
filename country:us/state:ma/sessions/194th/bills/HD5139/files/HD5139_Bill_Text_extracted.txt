On behalf of the Children’s Behavioral Health Knowledge Center, established
under the provisions of Chapter 321 of the Acts of 2008, I am pleased to submit
its 2024 Annual Report.
The mission of the Children’s Behavioral Health (CBH) Knowledge Center is to
ensure that:
• The workforce of clinicians and direct care staff providing children’s
behavioral health services are highly skilled and well-trained;
• The services provided to children in the Commonwealth are cost-effective
and evidence-based; and
• The Commonwealth continues to develop and evaluate new models of
service delivery.
The Knowledge Center serves as an information hub, through its learning
communities, website, workshops, and webinars. The Center’s activities facilitate
connection among the rich array of children’s behavioral health researchers,
program developers, providers, practitioners, and parent advocates in
Massachusetts.
From its unique vantage point within the mental health authority, the Center is
well positioned to further the work of the state’s publicly funded behavioral health
services across Executive Office of Health and Human Services agencies. As
you will see in the enclosed report, the Center has supported a variety of projects
that cut-across the various service systems to support the development of
practices, programs, and service delivery models that are based on the best
available evidence about what works to improve outcomes for young people and
their families.
Sincerely,
Brooke Doyle, M.Ed., LMHC

FY 2024 Annual Report
MASSACHUSETTS DEPARTMENT
OF MENTAL HEALTH
Overview
Established in Chapter 321 of the Acts of 2008 the mission of the Children’s Behavioral Health (CBH) Knowledge
Center is to ensure that:
• The workforce of clinicians and direct care staff providing children’s behavioral health services are
highly skilled and well-trained.
• The services provided to children in the Commonwealth are cost-effective and evidence based.
• The Commonwealth continues to develop and evaluate new models of service delivery.
The Children’s Behavioral Health Knowledge Center is located at the Department of Mental Health in the Child,
Youth, and Family Services Division. As part of the state’s mental health authority, The Center's purview is the
entire children’s behavioral health system, across Executive Office of Health and Human Services (EOHHS)
agencies and public and private payers.
The Center fills a gap in the children’s behavioral health system, serving as an information hub across providers
and public and private payers. Through its tools, Center staff members work with colleagues who are
developing, implementing, and advocating for practices, programs, and service delivery models that are based
on the best available evidence about what works to improve outcomes for young people. As an intermediary
organization, The Center’s activities facilitate connection among the rich array of children’s behavioral health
researchers, program developers, providers, practitioners, and consumer advocates in Massachusetts. The
Center’s projects generally focus on the application of research knowledge, not the production of it.
Strategic Vision
Areas of focus – FY 2024
• Developing a practice profile for Family Partners who support caregivers of children with behavioral
health challenges.
• Developing the skills of staff who work with young children and their families on family engagement,
reflective practice and intervention.
• Supporting the development, evaluation, and dissemination of an innovative group program for the
prevention of anxiety, depression and suicidality in adolescents.
• Supporting the professional development of early career BIPOC behavioral health professionals.
• Developing educational videos to support the Reflective Supervision training that can be accessed by
agencies to implement the practice of high-quality supervision.
• Developing and launching a redesigned Knowledge Center website.
Key partnerships
Located within the state mental health authority, The Center is well positioned to establish partnerships with
other Executive Office of Health and Human Services agencies. This includes co-sponsoring of training and
other workforce initiatives, braiding funding for shared projects and activities, and better alignment of
workforce priorities and communication across agencies. Collaborations in 2024 included:
• MassHealth - As the largest payer of publicly funded children’s behavioral health services in the
Commonwealth, MassHealth provides children with behavioral, emotional, and mental health needs
and their families with integrated behavioral health services and a comprehensive, community-based
system of care.
• Office of the Child Advocate (OCA) -The Office of the Child Advocate (OCA) provides independent
oversight of state services for children to ensure that children receive appropriate, timely and quality
services. The OCA also serves as a resource for families who are receiving, or are eligible to receive,
services from the Commonwealth.
• Department of Public Health (DPH)- The Pregnancy, Infancy and Early Childhood (PIE) Division of DPH
promotes physical, social and emotional well-being and resilience. The Division fosters healthy
environments during pregnancy, infancy, and through early childhood. Using the life course approach
PIE offers direct services, connections and referrals. It conducts research and evaluation; and supports
policy and systems development.
• Children’s Trust Fund-The Children's Trust is a public-private organization working toward a
Massachusetts free from child abuse and neglect. Theye partner with organizations and communities
to drive systemic change to address the root causes of abuse and neglect so that all children can grow
up in thriving families.
Additionally, this year The Center began a partnership with the:
• Hispanic/Latino Behavioral Health Center of Excellence
Through funding from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Substance Abuse and Mental
Health Services Administration's Office of Behavioral Health Equity, The Hispanic/Latino Behavioral
Health Center of Excellence is established to advance the behavioral health equity of Latino
communities through the development and dissemination of culturally-informed, behavioral health
information, provision of training and technical assistance and directed support to expand the
behavioral health workforce that serves Latino communities. The Center serves as a resource for
mental health and substance use providers, primary care providers, community-based and faith-based
organizations, research institutions, Hispanic and Latino-Serving Institutions (HSIs) of higher education,
peer and recovery support service providers, as well as state, regional, local, and federal entities.
Center Infrastructure
The Center has several dissemination vehicles for its work including its website, trainings, listserv, and
webinars. The Center also has established relationships with researchers, skilled trainers in topics such as early
childhood mental health, prevention, and reflective supervision, e-learning designers, and consultants with
expertise in implementation science and design thinking. In FY 2024:
• The Center’s website which had over 13,700 unique visitors.
• The Center provided training and coaching support using evidence-based teaching approaches to
hundreds of behavioral health professionals. The Center does not deliver or support one-time training
events as they have little support for their effectiveness in changing behavior or enhancing skills.
Rather, The Center’s training initiatives tend to be multi-day trainings that are paired with coaching
and organizational consultation to reinforce and support what trainees are learning in the classroom.
Major Activities and Accomplishments
• Development of Innovative Programs and Practices
Living in Families with our Emotions (LIFE): A behavioral intervention for at-risk adolescents and their
families that aims to improve resilience and long-term positive outcomes
In light of the worsening mental health crisis that has emerged in adolescents during the past decade, and the
severe shortage of mental health providers who are trained to care for this population, there is a tremendous
need for alternative, innovative ways to deliver mental health care to adolescents, especially to those with
limited access to mental health support. At the end of 2022, with funding from the American Rescue Plan
(ARPA), The Center partnered with the Massachusetts General Hospital’s Resilience and Prevention Program
(RAPP) to adapt, implement and evaluate Living in Families with Emotions (LIFE), a group-based behavioral
intervention, that teaches resilience-boosting skills to adolescents and their caregivers to be delivered by non-
clinical staff, such as after-school coordinators and youth support staff.
The program, originally designed to be delivered by clinical behavioral health staff had been tested in a highly
diverse sample of middle school students, in three Latinx immigrant cohorts in Chelsea, MA and four cohorts in
Medford, MA. Adolescent participants showed significant improvements in aspects of functioning, such as
school achievement (t=2.45, p=.026). Additionally, LIFE is associated with significant pre vs post reductions in a
range of symptoms, including suicidality (t=4.82, p<.001), depression (t=2.5, p=.05), and subclinical psychotic
symptoms (t=3.1, p=.005).
During FY24, the second year of the program, RAPP offered the LIFE training trainees from The GIFT Program,
The NAN Project, the Ohrenberger School in Boston, Children’s Cove in Cape Cod, Esperanza Academy in
Lawrence, Connections Family Resource Center in Brockton, MGH- Chelsea Healthcare, and the Boys and Girls
Club in Roxbury. Trainees include teachers, parents, peer coordinators, school counselors, and program
developers. Following the training RAPP staff provided weekly supervision of facilitators including observation
of select sessions (25%) and assessment of fidelity.
Based on feedback from community partners, RAPP further adapted the LIFE manual, most importantly dividing
each of the eight 90-minute sessions into two sessions, creating a sixteen 45-minute session manual, to
accommodate a typical school day schedule. They created additional videos to accompany the LIFE trainings
and replace some of the didactic portions of the training and adapted the LIFE training for virtual delivery to
make the training more accessible to communities across the State. They also translated the parent sessions
into Spanish for deployment in Latinx populations.
The program has been well received by participants. For example, in June 2024, RAPP ran a two-day training
workshop with 45 members of the Roxbury Boys and Girls Club. The trainees were diverse demographically,
with an age range spanning 19-71 years, with 56.3% identifying as female gender, 90.6% African American,

Section 2:
9.4% White, 21.8% Hispanic/Latino, and 78.2% Non-Hispanic/Latino. 75.0% had not received previous mental
health training. After the training, confidence in teaching general mental health skills increased from 69.4% to

Section 3:
82.1% (p=0.0001) and confidence in teaching LIFE-specific mental health skills increased from 60.6% to 81.0%
(p=0.0001). Post-assessment feedback surveys indicated that the trainees found LIFE to be “highly relevant to
the mental health needs of the adolescents they work with” and “useful in dealing with youth mental health
challenges at work”. Additionally, 88.3% of these trainees would recommend the training to a colleague, with
an average satisfaction rating of 4.41/5, and 81.7% of trainees said they would continue to use LIFE educational
and resource materials in their work.
• Workforce Initiatives
Family Partner Practice Profile Development
Peer support is the process of using one’s personal experience - or “lived experience” - to help someone in a
similar life situation. It includes activities such as coaching, education, skills training, and emotional support.
Research1 has shown that peer support is a valuable resource that improves people’s engagement in services,
resilience, and self-determination, leading to better health outcomes. In the “family peer support” approach
people who are parenting a child with a mental health condition receive support from others who share this life
experience.
A Family Partner is a person who has the lived experience of raising and parenting a child with significant
mental health needs and has been trained to provide a range of supports to caregivers of youth with similar
needs. To succeed, a Family Partner must have extensive knowledge and a deep understanding of behavioral
health service systems for youth. This knowledge is gained through the Family Partner’s own experience
navigating service systems for their child, as well as through training and knowledge gained on the job.
The National Implementation Research Network defines a “practice profile” as a tool to help programs put the
core elements of a service or practice in place. It breaks down large concepts, such as “engagement,” into
separate skills and activities that can be taught, learned, and observed. This Family Partner Practice Profile
describes the main practices that Family Partners use in their work with caregivers. Each practice is broken down
into the skills and activities that are required to effectively implement the practice, i.e., what they are saying and
doing when delivering Family Partner services. This Practice Profile describes the best or ideal practice for Family
Partners — that is, what a Family Partner should aspire to in their work with caregivers and families.
This Practice Profile focuses on best practices for Family Partners’ direct work with caregivers, in any context or
setting. Family Partners use their lived experience with purpose and intent. They offer services that are family-

driven, youth-guided, strengths-based, equitable, and culturally responsive, while also helping to elevate these
principles more broadly.
The Family Partner Practice Profile was developed through a collaboration between the DMH, the MassHealth
Office of Accountable Care and Behavioral Health, and stakeholders including family partners, family partner
supervisors and trainers, caregivers, leaders in agencies that employ family partners, and DMH and MassHealth
staff. At a series of stakeholder meetings held between January and April 2024, we received input, guidance, and
feedback on the development of the Practice Profile. The practice profile will be available on The Center website
in Spring 2025.
Infant and Early Childhood Mental Health (IECMH) Workforce Development Initiatives
“Infancy and early childhood present a prime opportunity to nurture positive mental health for children and parents
alike, enhancing wellbeing and saving costs from mental health problems down the road”.2
An estimated 10 to 16 percent of young kids experience mental health issues; kids living in poverty, at a higher
rate of 22%. According to Nancy Kelly, the Mental Health Promotion Branch Chief at the federal government’s
Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) when young children do not live in a
nurturing and a nurturing setting and lack intervention, the impacts of trauma and stress can be immediate and
long-lasting”.3
• Reflective Supervision Training for Non-Clinical Infant and Early Childhood Workforce
Reflective supervision/consultation (RS/C) is widely recognized as best practice in the provision of infant mental
health services including but not limited to early education and care, behavioral health, home visiting,
pediatrics, etc. The primary goal of RS/C is to promote high quality services and positive outcomes in children
and families. And yet, this type of supervision and consultation is not easily available or equitably accessible to
the diverse Infant and Early Childhood workforce.
The Center offered a 12 month-Reflective Consultation Training in FY23 open at no-cost to any individual
involved in Infant and Early Childhood Mental Health promotion or prevention work with the goal of
diversifying and strengthen the early childhood workforce by creating equitable access to reflective
consultation training and practice. Four groups of 8 people each met for 10 months and a total of 30 hours and
reported an increase in confidence providing Reflective Supervision to employees at their respective agencies.
The offering provides ongoing support to integrate skills learned in training in infant and early childhood mental
health, to support the workforce through ongoing coaching; and to build the capacity of Reflective Supervisors
in the field to continue this coaching in their settings.
• Early Relational Health Fellowship for BIPOC Clinicians

Families.

23, 2023, from https://www.edsurge.com/news/2023-02-28-who-s-looking-out-for-the-mental-health-ofinfants-and-toddlers
With ARPA funding The Center supported two groups of 5 fellows each in the Early Relational Health Fellowship
Program at UMass Chan Medical School. Fellowships were awarded to clinical professionals from Black, Indigenous,
and People of Color (BIPOC) backgrounds looking to gain in-depth knowledge in Infant and Early Childhood Mental
Health and become leaders in the field, hence supporting the dissemination of this much-needed specialty service.
This program is a comprehensive, part-time, hybrid, 18-month training program in early relational health research,
theory, assessment, and relationship-based interventions. The first cohort of 5 fellows graduated from this program
and three of them have already moved on to positions of leadership, including in Early Relational Health, core faculty
in higher education, and director of psychiatry programs and systems.
• Trainings for Work with Infants and Young Children and their Caregivers
The Center supported training for staff who work with infants and young children in a variety of settings on
family engagement, observation, child development, and reflective supervision.
The Center partnered with the Children’s Trust to deliver two virtual trainings in Facilitating Attuned
Interactions (FAN), in March and May 2024. FAN’s goal is strengthening the provider-parent relationship,
resulting in parents who are “attuned to their infants and ready to try new ways of relating to them”. This
training consists of three half-day training sessions for teams, followed by a year of monthly meetings with the
teams’ supervisors to support implementation of the model in the agencies, as well as growing and supporting
reflective supervision with staff. All regions of the State were represented in these trainings, 32% of
participants identified as BIPOC. Participants worked in diverse fields such as clinical mental health services,
early intervention, homeless shelters, occupational therapy, and child protective services. During FY’25, with
braided funding from MassHealth and DPH, The Center will provide four virtual training sessions, including a
train-the-trainer model, which will increase the State’s capacity to deliver this training with four new trainers.
The Center offered training in Theraplay, an evidence-based dyadic attachment-based child and family therapy
intervention to 30 clinical staff in April 2024. Nineteen (19%) percent of participants self-identified as BIPOC.
We were able to have participants from the entire state, but due to underrepresentation of Western MA and
Cape and Islands, our goal for FY’25 is to offer two smaller trainings in those locations.
BIPOC Clinician Early Career Learning Collaborative: The Legacy Project
In September 2023, The Center began offering an early career development learning community in response to
reports from behavioral health organizations that they were having difficulty hiring and retaining diverse staff
and not having the necessary skills and training to support BIPOC staff in their career trajectories. The goal of
the learning community was to increase retention of BIPOC early career behavioral health professionals in
public sector settings by engaging them in a peer learning community and enhancing their knowledge and skills
to successfully practice and make progress in their careers, with special emphasis in serving communities of
color and providing organizational leadership regarding racial equity and inclusion.
A total of thirty masters’ level unlicensed behavioral health clinicians participated in three separate cohorts
that met for nine monthly sessions facilitated by Dr. Phillip Laidlaw, PsyD and/or Alexa Fenton, LMFT, former
Assistant Director of The Center. Topics discussed included: best practices for working in community behavioral
health settings, strategies to get the most out of supervision, strategies for addressing racism in the workplace,
skills for managing work stress and burnout and career development phases and processes, including
credentialing, becoming clinical supervisors. Additionally, participants had access to up to three individual
mentoring sessions.
In a survey of 2023-24 participants, 90% of respondents indicated that their participation in the learning
community increased the likelihood of their continuing their careers in the public sector, 75% affirmed that
they had learned a great deal or a lot of useful strategies to deal with racism in the workplace, and 80%
indicated that they had learned a great deal or a lot of strategies to deal with stress and burnout. When asked
how their participation had contributed to their personal and professional growth, respondents mentioned
feeling part of a community, becoming aware of their needs, feeling supported, less alone as well as feeling
strengthened, empowered, more confident. When asked what they found most valuable, they said they
particularly appreciated having a safe space to share their experiences without judgement, meeting with others
going through similar experiences and learning from others how to navigate similar challenges.
Strengthening Supervision
A key aspect of the Center’s workforce development strategy is to focus on the competency development and
support of supervisors who oversee service delivery in the publicly funded children’s behavioral system.
Supervisors have considerable influence over their supervisees and play a critical role in teaching, coaching, and
supporting behavioral health staff members that are working directly with youth and families. Many
supervisors are promoted based on their performance serving as direct care workers but often do not receive
specialized training on how to be a supervisor.
• Reflective Supervision Training and Coaching
The Center worked with Dr. Elizabeth McEnany to train and coach supervisors in Reflective Supervision (RS).
The practice of RS has its roots in infant and early childhood mental health but is applicable for those working
with older youth and families, particularly those who have experienced trauma. RS strengthens the practice of
trauma-informed care through its model of collaboration with and support of clinicians and other providers.
The Center has offered RS training yearly since 2015. The five session, 3-hour training is followed by six monthly
coaching sessions where participants receive coaching from the trainers as they apply the skills learned in their
work with supervisees. Each year a group of teams of supervisors from several agencies join the training, for a
total of approximately 40 participants. In recent years emphasis has been placed on supporting each agency
team in developing a plan for implementation and maintenance of reflective supervision practices throughout
their program and/or agency.
• Addressing Secondary Traumatic Stress in Supervision
In response to the workforce crisis associated with the COVID-19 pandemic and to bolster existing supervision
efforts, The Center, in collaboration with Dr. Elizabeth McEnany developed a curriculum focused on addressing
secondary traumatic stress in supervision (STS). Secondary traumatic stress (STS) is characterized by the
manifestation of PTSD symptoms in people working with trauma survivors resulting from at least one indirect
exposure to traumatic content and is a common experience among behavioral health providers. This
comprehensive four-part training series is designed in conjunction with Reflective Supervision training and
delves into supervisory practices at both individual and organizational levels.
The Center has offered the training series three times since 2023. Learning objectives include enhancing
supervisors' abilities to address their supervisees' responses to secondary stress, with a focus on recognizing
and addressing the varying impact based on racial, ethnic, and cultural identities. In addition to this
comprehensive training, STS incorporates an extra component wherein an executive sponsor (such as a Senior
Leader or HR Manager) is encouraged to attend, fostering actionable strategies throughout all levels of an
organization. Ninety-two percent of the FY 24 participants who evaluated the course indicated that they were
satisfied or very satisfied with its content and that they would make some or many changes to their supervisory
practices as a result of participating in the training.
Family Therapy Intensive Training
The DMH CYF Division, The Center, and MassHealth’s Children’s Behavioral Health Initiative supported
scholarships for 28 clinicians working in the publicly funded mental health system to attend the Intensive
Certificate Program in Family Systems Therapy provided by Therapy Training Boston. Our publicly funded
treatment systems work to ensure full family engagement in treatment and seek to prepare families to support
their children successfully at home. This course supports beginning and intermediate level clinicians to become
more skilled, self-aware, and confident family-centered clinicians and supervisors. It teaches family systems
ideas and practices, addressing complex family and individual needs through approaches that are practical,
empowering and collaborative for both families and providers. The course provides 81 hours of training,
including approximately one full day of training a month and one two-day-long retreat. Over the past five years,
the program has trained 140 clinicians. Another cohort of 28 clinicians began in July 2024 and is expected to
complete the course in June 2025. The program offers a second year of monthly coaching sessions to anyone
who has taken the training to help clinicians deepen their practice. This project is the result of cross-agency
collaboration and alignment of training approaches across systems.
Young Adult Peer Mentoring Workforce Training
Young Adult Peer Mentors (YAPM) play an emerging and an increasingly vital role in the Commonwealth’s
behavioral healthcare delivery system. YAPMs are professionals who share their personal experience of living
with and overcoming a behavioral health challenge(s) to provide hope and support to youth and young adult
facing similar challenges. Additionally, YAPMs serve as guides to other youth and young adults by offering their
invaluable experience with navigating the behavioral healthcare system. Research on the use of peers has
found they help promote engagement in care, reduce utilization of restrictive and costly services such as
inpatient hospitals and emergency departments, and improve quality of life.
• Core Elements of Young Adult Peer Mentoring Training
In 2024, The Center sponsored two virtual Core Elements of Young Adult Peer Mentoring trainings. The content
of this training is based on the YAPM Practice Profile that was released in 2017. The training is conducted
virtually to enhance accessibility across the state. Additionally, a sign language interpreter provided ASL
translation for the Spring Session for two deaf participants. The training is conducted over the course of three
days, two Core Elements for each section. In 2024, 34 YAPMs completed the Core Elements trainings hosted by
The Center. In FY 24, The Center launched the Young Adult Peer Mentor Resource Network. This monthly
meeting provides an opportunity for YAPMs across the state to provide mutual support regarding their unique
role and to share best practices in engaging youth and young adults in services and supports focused on their
mental health and wellness. The YAPM Resource Network had consistent participation throughout the year
with approximately 10-15 participants per month.
• Young Adult Peer Mentoring Research and Publication
In 2024, the Massachusetts Young Adult Peer Mentoring model was recognized in a national publication. The
article, Relational Complexity of the Near‑Age Peer Support Provider Role in Youth and Young Adult Community
Mental Health Settings, was published in the Journal of Behavioral Health Services and Research.
In 2024, The Center also supported training for supervisors of Young Adult Peer Mentors. Twenty-five
supervisors participated in a full-day training session in June where they focused on a strength-based
supervision model that is attuned to the specific needs of young adult peers.
Best Practice Psychiatric Care in Group and Residential Treatment for Youth and Families Learning
Collaborative
In the context of facilitating and supporting best practice psychiatric care in group and residential treatment
settings for youth in the Commonwealth, the Learning Collaborative was launched in January 2023 and occurs
monthly for 90 minutes meetings. The Learning Collaborative is organized and conducted by two child
psychiatrists, Joel Goldstein MD (DMH) and Kerry Ann Williams MD (Medical Director, Justice Resource
Institute). Participants are child psychiatric care providers (psychiatrists, advanced practice nurses and
developmental pediatricians) practicing at residential and congregate care program sites throughout
Massachusetts. Some of the topics addressed during 2024 were:
• Differential diagnosis of psychosis and autism as well as consideration of treatment approaches
• Best practice psychopharmacologic strategies in the treatment of aggression for youth in congregate
care, residential and hospital-based settings.
• Focus on Pediatric Sleep
• Residential Milieu Management
• Occupational Therapy
Support for Paid Internships for Behavioral Health Students
The Center manages a two-year, 7 million dollar grant program (September 2023 to August 2025) supported
with COVID and ARPA funds that provides four universities around the state: Westfield State University, Salem
State University, Bridgewater State University and Boston College with funds to provide payment for students
completing required internships in behavioral health fields. BIPOC and other marginalized students completing
degree required internships, which are typically unpaid were prioritized within this grant. Internship
placements are limited to public sector settings to increase interest and a pathway to careers in public sector
mental health. In addition, the program supports that cost of training and supervision incurred by the
organizations that host the interns.
An unduplicated total of 191 students received paid internships during the 2023-2024 academic year. The
students were in bachelor’s level social work or psychology programs; master’s level social work, psychology or
counseling programs; and masters level psychiatric mental health nurse practitioners. In addition, 30 physician
assistant students were paid for their time in a behavioral health rotation.
Many students mentioned being able to focus more on their schoolwork and on their internships because of
the compensation, as well as feeling an alleviation of stress, engaging more with their school communities, and,
perhaps most importantly, having the resources needed to prevent them from dropping out of the internship
experience because of other financial requirements. Additionally, students said that they were able to choose
an internship based on their career aspirations, rather than choosing an internship solely on the internship
site’s ability to pay. Interns were also able to use the extra time they had from not having to work extra jobs to
plan activities for clients or spend more time with their children.
Universities saw the effect of the benefits that students described. It was evident to them that the paid
internships significantly relieved students’ financial stress. Several reported that it has allowed a greater focus
on learning. One stated that “Students are relieved and grateful for the paid internship. For many, it is the first
time they can concentrate on being a student without juggling multiple jobs to support themselves and their
families. As a result, they are enjoying classes and taking the time to go deep into their readings. They have
time to process information and concentrate on their assignments. Learning, not just passing classes, has
become the focus.” Faculty also reported a decline in urgent financial situations (requests for additional
financial aid to cover rent or transportation expenses, assistance with purchasing books, assistance with
technology, etc.). According to faculty, the ability to focus on school translates, for instance, to students not
having to request extensions for assignments. Professors have also noticed an improvement in students’ quality
of work.
Toward the end of the Fall 2023 and Spring 2024 semesters, on average interns are most interested in working
in organizations that serve specific marginalized groups, who are BIPOC or LGBTQIA+, followed by behavioral
health organizations serving people on MassHealth or who are uninsured or people with serious mental illness.
Knowledge Dissemination Activities
Insurance Resource Center for Autism and Behavioral Health
Understanding insurance coverage and accessing treatments continues to be a significant challenge for families
seeking behavioral health services. Despite strong laws mandating coverage, the complexities of navigating
insurance, affording coverage, as well as systemic barriers, remain high and continue to prevent some families
from accessing needed care.
The Center continues its partnership with the Insurance Resource Center for Autism and Behavioral Health
(IRC), a program of the Eunice Kennedy Shriver Center at UMass Chan Medical School to assist state agency
staff, families, and providers with navigating behavioral health commercial insurance benefits for children and
adolescents. The IRC provides a range of resources including:
• Information and technical assistance by phone/e-mail
• Assistance with issues related to navigating insurance
• Access to documents including legislation, FAQ’s, agency bulletins, etc.
• Trainings and webinars for families and providers
• Fact Sheet Library on topics relevant to Behavioral Health. These are available as accessible pdf
documents, with translated versions in Spanish, Brazilian Portuguese, Simplified Chinese, and
Vietnamese.
During FY 24, the IRC:
• Received approximately 5,847 calls, representing a 70% increase from the prior year.
• Established a language line to expand capability to assist families in many languages, and the
community has been very appreciative of the resource.
• Provided training for 3,081 people, relatively consistent with the prior year. Presentations ranged from
small groups of families to larger groups of professionals, depending on the specific topic, forum, etc.
Spanish and Portuguese translation is offered for all the IRC’s Lunch and Learn presentations.
• Participated in 10 outreach events, such as conferences, resource fairs and community events
throughout the state. Three outreach events were focused on cultural, linguistically diverse, and
underserved communities.
• Organized an Autism Diagnosis Summit in May of 2024 bringing together professionals to discuss ways
to expand access to diagnostic services, which is a significant barrier/delay to accessing services for
many families.
Of the requests for assistance the IRC receives, cases related to BH remain amongst the most challenging cases,
relative to both insurance coverage, access to treatment, and severity of need. The IRC continues to partner
with DMH, MSPCC, PPAL, clinicians, and other organizations to provide insurance support and resources. IRC,
like many others, receives requests for assistance with cases where individuals are “stuck” in ED’s and/or
encountering other barriers. While many of the needs are outside of the scope of our insurance-related
technical assistance, the IRC provides support and referrals to others in their networks for assistance.
Website and Listserv
The Center launched a redesigned website packed with new resources, training opportunities, and a rich
archive of learning materials in October 2024. The website provides a forum for policy makers, providers,
advocates, and youth and families to locate information about local and national training events, learn about
evidence-based and promising practices in Massachusetts, and share relevant information and resources for
individuals working in the children’s behavioral health field. In FY 2024, the site had over 13,700 unique visitors.
We are excited to unveil a fully renovated site.
Conclusion
The Children’s Behavioral Health Knowledge Center contributes to the advancement of many of the aims of the
Roadmap for Behavioral Health Reform to:

Section 4:
1. Deliver more effective treatment by training the workforce to address the mental health needs of
infants and young children and their families, to tackle them early before challenges escalate requiring
higher levels of care; and by supporting the peer workforce by developing the Family Partner Practice
Profile.

Section 5:
2. Improve health equity by increasing training, mentoring and financial support of BIPOC clinicians in
training or entering the behavioral health field in the public sector; and by increasing attention to the
needs of racial and ethnic groups in all The Center’s programs.

Section 6:
3. Support the peer workforce by developing the Family Partner Practice Profile and training tools to
support the practice.

Section 7:
4. Ease the burden of families in accessing behavioral health services through programs such the
Insurance Resource Center for Autism and Behavioral Health.

Section 8:
5. Develop more options to treatment by supporting the development of innovative easily accessible
options that can be delivered by non-clinical staff such as Living in Families with Our Emotions (LIFE)
Project.

Section 9:
6. Increase collaboration among state agencies and provider organizations.

Section 10:
7. Continue to develop programs to address identified gaps in the behavioral health service array by
offering training opportunities for the behavioral health workforce. For example, in response to the
crisis of access to assessment of Autism Spectrum Disorders, especially for children who speak
languages other than English, The Center approached the Hispanic/Latino Behavioral Health Center of
Excellence and established a collaboration to offer training for Spanish-speaking psychologists in
Massachusetts in assessment of Autism Spectrum Disorders to be offered in 2025.

FY 2024 Annual Report
MASSACHUSETTS DEPARTMENT
OF MENTAL HEALTH

Overview
Established in Chapter 321 of the Acts of 2008 the mission of the Children’s Behavioral Health (CBH) Knowledge
Center is to ensure that:
• The workforce of clinicians and direct care staff providing children’s behavioral health services are
highly skilled and well-trained.
• The services provided to children in the Commonwealth are cost-effective and evidence based.
• The Commonwealth continues to develop and evaluate new models of service delivery.
The Children’s Behavioral Health Knowledge Center is located at the Department of Mental Health in the Child,
Youth, and Family Services Division. As part of the state’s mental health authority, The Center's purview is the
entire children’s behavioral health system, across Executive Office of Health and Human Services (EOHHS)
agencies and public and private payers.
The Center fills a gap in the children’s behavioral health system, serving as an information hub across providers
and public and private payers. Through its tools, Center staff members work with colleagues who are
developing, implementing, and advocating for practices, programs, and service delivery models that are based
on the best available evidence about what works to improve outcomes for young people. As an intermediary
organization, The Center’s activities facilitate connection among the rich array of children’s behavioral health
researchers, program developers, providers, practitioners, and consumer advocates in Massachusetts. The
Center’s projects generally focus on the application of research knowledge, not the production of it.
Strategic Vision
Areas of focus – FY 2024
• Developing a practice profile for Family Partners who support caregivers of children with behavioral
health challenges.
• Developing the skills of staff who work with young children and their families on family engagement,
reflective practice and intervention.
• Supporting the development, evaluation, and dissemination of an innovative group program for the
prevention of anxiety, depression and suicidality in adolescents.
• Supporting the professional development of early career BIPOC behavioral health professionals.
• Developing educational videos to support the Reflective Supervision training that can be accessed by
agencies to implement the practice of high-quality supervision.
• Developing and launching a redesigned Knowledge Center website.
Key partnerships
Located within the state mental health authority, The Center is well positioned to establish partnerships with
other Executive Office of Health and Human Services agencies. This includes co-sponsoring of training and
other workforce initiatives, braiding funding for shared projects and activities, and better alignment of
workforce priorities and communication across agencies. Collaborations in 2024 included:

• MassHealth - As the largest payer of publicly funded children’s behavioral health services in the
Commonwealth, MassHealth provides children with behavioral, emotional, and mental health needs
and their families with integrated behavioral health services and a comprehensive, community-based
system of care.
• Office of the Child Advocate (OCA) -The Office of the Child Advocate (OCA) provides independent
oversight of state services for children to ensure that children receive appropriate, timely and quality
services. The OCA also serves as a resource for families who are receiving, or are eligible to receive,
services from the Commonwealth.
• Department of Public Health (DPH)- The Pregnancy, Infancy and Early Childhood (PIE) Division of DPH
promotes physical, social and emotional well-being and resilience. The Division fosters healthy
environments during pregnancy, infancy, and through early childhood. Using the life course approach
PIE offers direct services, connections and referrals. It conducts research and evaluation; and supports
policy and systems development.
• Children’s Trust Fund-The Children's Trust is a public-private organization working toward a
Massachusetts free from child abuse and neglect. Theye partner with organizations and communities
to drive systemic change to address the root causes of abuse and neglect so that all children can grow
up in thriving families.
Additionally, this year The Center began a partnership with the:
• Hispanic/Latino Behavioral Health Center of Excellence
Through funding from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Substance Abuse and Mental
Health Services Administration's Office of Behavioral Health Equity, The Hispanic/Latino Behavioral
Health Center of Excellence is established to advance the behavioral health equity of Latino
communities through the development and dissemination of culturally-informed, behavioral health
information, provision of training and technical assistance and directed support to expand the
behavioral health workforce that serves Latino communities. The Center serves as a resource for
mental health and substance use providers, primary care providers, community-based and faith-based
organizations, research institutions, Hispanic and Latino-Serving Institutions (HSIs) of higher education,
peer and recovery support service providers, as well as state, regional, local, and federal entities.
Center Infrastructure
The Center has several dissemination vehicles for its work including its website, trainings, listserv, and
webinars. The Center also has established relationships with researchers, skilled trainers in topics such as early
childhood mental health, prevention, and reflective supervision, e-learning designers, and consultants with
expertise in implementation science and design thinking. In FY 2024:
• The Center’s website which had over 13,700 unique visitors.
• The Center provided training and coaching support using evidence-based teaching approaches to
hundreds of behavioral health professionals. The Center does not deliver or support one-time training
events as they have little support for their effectiveness in changing behavior or enhancing skills.

Rather, The Center’s training initiatives tend to be multi-day trainings that are paired with coaching
and organizational consultation to reinforce and support what trainees are learning in the classroom.
Major Activities and Accomplishments
• Development of Innovative Programs and Practices
Living in Families with our Emotions (LIFE): A behavioral intervention for at-risk adolescents and their
families that aims to improve resilience and long-term positive outcomes
In light of the worsening mental health crisis that has emerged in adolescents during the past decade, and the
severe shortage of mental health providers who are trained to care for this population, there is a tremendous
need for alternative, innovative ways to deliver mental health care to adolescents, especially to those with
limited access to mental health support. At the end of 2022, with funding from the American Rescue Plan
(ARPA), The Center partnered with the Massachusetts General Hospital’s Resilience and Prevention Program
(RAPP) to adapt, implement and evaluate Living in Families with Emotions (LIFE), a group-based behavioral
intervention, that teaches resilience-boosting skills to adolescents and their caregivers to be delivered by non-
clinical staff, such as after-school coordinators and youth support staff.
The program, originally designed to be delivered by clinical behavioral health staff had been tested in a highly
diverse sample of middle school students, in three Latinx immigrant cohorts in Chelsea, MA and four cohorts in
Medford, MA. Adolescent participants showed significant improvements in aspects of functioning, such as
school achievement (t=2.45, p=.026). Additionally, LIFE is associated with significant pre vs post reductions in a
range of symptoms, including suicidality (t=4.82, p<.001), depression (t=2.5, p=.05), and subclinical psychotic
symptoms (t=3.1, p=.005).
During FY24, the second year of the program, RAPP offered the LIFE training trainees from The GIFT Program,
The NAN Project, the Ohrenberger School in Boston, Children’s Cove in Cape Cod, Esperanza Academy in
Lawrence, Connections Family Resource Center in Brockton, MGH- Chelsea Healthcare, and the Boys and Girls
Club in Roxbury. Trainees include teachers, parents, peer coordinators, school counselors, and program
developers. Following the training RAPP staff provided weekly supervision of facilitators including observation
of select sessions (25%) and assessment of fidelity.
Based on feedback from community partners, RAPP further adapted the LIFE manual, most importantly dividing
each of the eight 90-minute sessions into two sessions, creating a sixteen 45-minute session manual, to
accommodate a typical school day schedule. They created additional videos to accompany the LIFE trainings
and replace some of the didactic portions of the training and adapted the LIFE training for virtual delivery to
make the training more accessible to communities across the State. They also translated the parent sessions
into Spanish for deployment in Latinx populations.
The program has been well received by participants. For example, in June 2024, RAPP ran a two-day training
workshop with 45 members of the Roxbury Boys and Girls Club. The trainees were diverse demographically,
with an age range spanning 19-71 years, with 56.3% identifying as female gender, 90.6% African American,
9.4% White, 21.8% Hispanic/Latino, and 78.2% Non-Hispanic/Latino. 75.0% had not received previous mental

health training. After the training, confidence in teaching general mental health skills increased from 69.4% to
82.1% (p=0.0001) and confidence in teaching LIFE-specific mental health skills increased from 60.6% to 81.0%
(p=0.0001). Post-assessment feedback surveys indicated that the trainees found LIFE to be “highly relevant to
the mental health needs of the adolescents they work with” and “useful in dealing with youth mental health
challenges at work”. Additionally, 88.3% of these trainees would recommend the training to a colleague, with
an average satisfaction rating of 4.41/5, and 81.7% of trainees said they would continue to use LIFE educational
and resource materials in their work.
• Workforce Initiatives
Family Partner Practice Profile Development
Peer support is the process of using one’s personal experience - or “lived experience” - to help someone in a
similar life situation. It includes activities such as coaching, education, skills training, and emotional support.
Research1 has shown that peer support is a valuable resource that improves people’s engagement in services,
resilience, and self-determination, leading to better health outcomes. In the “family peer support” approach
people who are parenting a child with a mental health condition receive support from others who share this life
experience.
A Family Partner is a person who has the lived experience of raising and parenting a child with significant
mental health needs and has been trained to provide a range of supports to caregivers of youth with similar
needs. To succeed, a Family Partner must have extensive knowledge and a deep understanding of behavioral
health service systems for youth. This knowledge is gained through the Family Partner’s own experience
navigating service systems for their child, as well as through training and knowledge gained on the job.
The National Implementation Research Network defines a “practice profile” as a tool to help programs put the
core elements of a service or practice in place. It breaks down large concepts, such as “engagement,” into
separate skills and activities that can be taught, learned, and observed. This Family Partner Practice Profile
describes the main practices that Family Partners use in their work with caregivers. Each practice is broken down
into the skills and activities that are required to effectively implement the practice, i.e., what they are saying and
doing when delivering Family Partner services. This Practice Profile describes the best or ideal practice for Family
Partners — that is, what a Family Partner should aspire to in their work with caregivers and families.
This Practice Profile focuses on best practices for Family Partners’ direct work with caregivers, in any context or
setting. Family Partners use their lived experience with purpose and intent. They offer services that are family-

driven, youth-guided, strengths-based, equitable, and culturally responsive, while also helping to elevate these
principles more broadly.
The Family Partner Practice Profile was developed through a collaboration between the DMH, the MassHealth
Office of Accountable Care and Behavioral Health, and stakeholders including family partners, family partner
supervisors and trainers, caregivers, leaders in agencies that employ family partners, and DMH and MassHealth
staff. At a series of stakeholder meetings held between January and April 2024, we received input, guidance, and
feedback on the development of the Practice Profile. The practice profile will be available on The Center website
in Spring 2025.
Infant and Early Childhood Mental Health (IECMH) Workforce Development Initiatives
“Infancy and early childhood present a prime opportunity to nurture positive mental health for children and parents
alike, enhancing wellbeing and saving costs from mental health problems down the road”.2
An estimated 10 to 16 percent of young kids experience mental health issues; kids living in poverty, at a higher
rate of 22%. According to Nancy Kelly, the Mental Health Promotion Branch Chief at the federal government’s
Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) when young children do not live in a
nurturing and a nurturing setting and lack intervention, the impacts of trauma and stress can be immediate and
long-lasting”.3
• Reflective Supervision Training for Non-Clinical Infant and Early Childhood Workforce
Reflective supervision/consultation (RS/C) is widely recognized as best practice in the provision of infant mental
health services including but not limited to early education and care, behavioral health, home visiting,
pediatrics, etc. The primary goal of RS/C is to promote high quality services and positive outcomes in children
and families. And yet, this type of supervision and consultation is not easily available or equitably accessible to
the diverse Infant and Early Childhood workforce.
The Center offered a 12 month-Reflective Consultation Training in FY23 open at no-cost to any individual
involved in Infant and Early Childhood Mental Health promotion or prevention work with the goal of
diversifying and strengthen the early childhood workforce by creating equitable access to reflective
consultation training and practice. Four groups of 8 people each met for 10 months and a total of 30 hours and
reported an increase in confidence providing Reflective Supervision to employees at their respective agencies.
The offering provides ongoing support to integrate skills learned in training in infant and early childhood mental
health, to support the workforce through ongoing coaching; and to build the capacity of Reflective Supervisors
in the field to continue this coaching in their settings.
• Early Relational Health Fellowship for BIPOC Clinicians
2 Cole, P., Gebhard, B., Ullrich, R., & Schmit, S. (2017, October). Mental Health Services: Critical Supports for Infants, Toddlers, and
Families.
3 Sullivan, E. T. (2023, February 28). Who’s Looking Out for the Mental Health of Infants and Toddlers? EDSURGE. Retrieved December
23, 2023, from https://www.edsurge.com/news/2023-02-28-who-s-looking-out-for-the-mental-health-ofinfants-and-toddlers

With ARPA funding The Center supported two groups of 5 fellows each in the Early Relational Health Fellowship
Program at UMass Chan Medical School. Fellowships were awarded to clinical professionals from Black, Indigenous,
and People of Color (BIPOC) backgrounds looking to gain in-depth knowledge in Infant and Early Childhood Mental
Health and become leaders in the field, hence supporting the dissemination of this much-needed specialty service.
This program is a comprehensive, part-time, hybrid, 18-month training program in early relational health research,
theory, assessment, and relationship-based interventions. The first cohort of 5 fellows graduated from this program
and three of them have already moved on to positions of leadership, including in Early Relational Health, core faculty
in higher education, and director of psychiatry programs and systems.
• Trainings for Work with Infants and Young Children and their Caregivers
The Center supported training for staff who work with infants and young children in a variety of settings on
family engagement, observation, child development, and reflective supervision.
The Center partnered with the Children’s Trust to deliver two virtual trainings in Facilitating Attuned
Interactions (FAN), in March and May 2024. FAN’s goal is strengthening the provider-parent relationship,
resulting in parents who are “attuned to their infants and ready to try new ways of relating to them”. This
training consists of three half-day training sessions for teams, followed by a year of monthly meetings with the
teams’ supervisors to support implementation of the model in the agencies, as well as growing and supporting
reflective supervision with staff. All regions of the State were represented in these trainings, 32% of
participants identified as BIPOC. Participants worked in diverse fields such as clinical mental health services,
early intervention, homeless shelters, occupational therapy, and child protective services. During FY’25, with
braided funding from MassHealth and DPH, The Center will provide four virtual training sessions, including a
train-the-trainer model, which will increase the State’s capacity to deliver this training with four new trainers.
The Center offered training in Theraplay, an evidence-based dyadic attachment-based child and family therapy
intervention to 30 clinical staff in April 2024. Nineteen (19%) percent of participants self-identified as BIPOC.
We were able to have participants from the entire state, but due to underrepresentation of Western MA and
Cape and Islands, our goal for FY’25 is to offer two smaller trainings in those locations.
BIPOC Clinician Early Career Learning Collaborative: The Legacy Project
In September 2023, The Center began offering an early career development learning community in response to
reports from behavioral health organizations that they were having difficulty hiring and retaining diverse staff
and not having the necessary skills and training to support BIPOC staff in their career trajectories. The goal of
the learning community was to increase retention of BIPOC early career behavioral health professionals in
public sector settings by engaging them in a peer learning community and enhancing their knowledge and skills
to successfully practice and make progress in their careers, with special emphasis in serving communities of
color and providing organizational leadership regarding racial equity and inclusion.
A total of thirty masters’ level unlicensed behavioral health clinicians participated in three separate cohorts
that met for nine monthly sessions facilitated by Dr. Phillip Laidlaw, PsyD and/or Alexa Fenton, LMFT, former
Assistant Director of The Center. Topics discussed included: best practices for working in community behavioral
health settings, strategies to get the most out of supervision, strategies for addressing racism in the workplace,

skills for managing work stress and burnout and career development phases and processes, including
credentialing, becoming clinical supervisors. Additionally, participants had access to up to three individual
mentoring sessions.
In a survey of 2023-24 participants, 90% of respondents indicated that their participation in the learning
community increased the likelihood of their continuing their careers in the public sector, 75% affirmed that
they had learned a great deal or a lot of useful strategies to deal with racism in the workplace, and 80%
indicated that they had learned a great deal or a lot of strategies to deal with stress and burnout. When asked
how their participation had contributed to their personal and professional growth, respondents mentioned
feeling part of a community, becoming aware of their needs, feeling supported, less alone as well as feeling
strengthened, empowered, more confident. When asked what they found most valuable, they said they
particularly appreciated having a safe space to share their experiences without judgement, meeting with others
going through similar experiences and learning from others how to navigate similar challenges.
Strengthening Supervision
A key aspect of the Center’s workforce development strategy is to focus on the competency development and
support of supervisors who oversee service delivery in the publicly funded children’s behavioral system.
Supervisors have considerable influence over their supervisees and play a critical role in teaching, coaching, and
supporting behavioral health staff members that are working directly with youth and families. Many
supervisors are promoted based on their performance serving as direct care workers but often do not receive
specialized training on how to be a supervisor.
• Reflective Supervision Training and Coaching
The Center worked with Dr. Elizabeth McEnany to train and coach supervisors in Reflective Supervision (RS).
The practice of RS has its roots in infant and early childhood mental health but is applicable for those working
with older youth and families, particularly those who have experienced trauma. RS strengthens the practice of
trauma-informed care through its model of collaboration with and support of clinicians and other providers.
The Center has offered RS training yearly since 2015. The five session, 3-hour training is followed by six monthly
coaching sessions where participants receive coaching from the trainers as they apply the skills learned in their
work with supervisees. Each year a group of teams of supervisors from several agencies join the training, for a
total of approximately 40 participants. In recent years emphasis has been placed on supporting each agency
team in developing a plan for implementation and maintenance of reflective supervision practices throughout
their program and/or agency.
• Addressing Secondary Traumatic Stress in Supervision
In response to the workforce crisis associated with the COVID-19 pandemic and to bolster existing supervision
efforts, The Center, in collaboration with Dr. Elizabeth McEnany developed a curriculum focused on addressing
secondary traumatic stress in supervision (STS). Secondary traumatic stress (STS) is characterized by the
manifestation of PTSD symptoms in people working with trauma survivors resulting from at least one indirect

exposure to traumatic content and is a common experience among behavioral health providers. This
comprehensive four-part training series is designed in conjunction with Reflective Supervision training and
delves into supervisory practices at both individual and organizational levels.
The Center has offered the training series three times since 2023. Learning objectives include enhancing
supervisors' abilities to address their supervisees' responses to secondary stress, with a focus on recognizing
and addressing the varying impact based on racial, ethnic, and cultural identities. In addition to this
comprehensive training, STS incorporates an extra component wherein an executive sponsor (such as a Senior
Leader or HR Manager) is encouraged to attend, fostering actionable strategies throughout all levels of an
organization. Ninety-two percent of the FY 24 participants who evaluated the course indicated that they were
satisfied or very satisfied with its content and that they would make some or many changes to their supervisory
practices as a result of participating in the training.
Family Therapy Intensive Training
The DMH CYF Division, The Center, and MassHealth’s Children’s Behavioral Health Initiative supported
scholarships for 28 clinicians working in the publicly funded mental health system to attend the Intensive
Certificate Program in Family Systems Therapy provided by Therapy Training Boston. Our publicly funded
treatment systems work to ensure full family engagement in treatment and seek to prepare families to support
their children successfully at home. This course supports beginning and intermediate level clinicians to become
more skilled, self-aware, and confident family-centered clinicians and supervisors. It teaches family systems
ideas and practices, addressing complex family and individual needs through approaches that are practical,
empowering and collaborative for both families and providers. The course provides 81 hours of training,
including approximately one full day of training a month and one two-day-long retreat. Over the past five years,
the program has trained 140 clinicians. Another cohort of 28 clinicians began in July 2024 and is expected to
complete the course in June 2025. The program offers a second year of monthly coaching sessions to anyone
who has taken the training to help clinicians deepen their practice. This project is the result of cross-agency
collaboration and alignment of training approaches across systems.
Young Adult Peer Mentoring Workforce Training
Young Adult Peer Mentors (YAPM) play an emerging and an increasingly vital role in the Commonwealth’s
behavioral healthcare delivery system. YAPMs are professionals who share their personal experience of living
with and overcoming a behavioral health challenge(s) to provide hope and support to youth and young adult
facing similar challenges. Additionally, YAPMs serve as guides to other youth and young adults by offering their
invaluable experience with navigating the behavioral healthcare system. Research on the use of peers has
found they help promote engagement in care, reduce utilization of restrictive and costly services such as
inpatient hospitals and emergency departments, and improve quality of life.

• Core Elements of Young Adult Peer Mentoring Training
In 2024, The Center sponsored two virtual Core Elements of Young Adult Peer Mentoring trainings. The content
of this training is based on the YAPM Practice Profile that was released in 2017. The training is conducted
virtually to enhance accessibility across the state. Additionally, a sign language interpreter provided ASL
translation for the Spring Session for two deaf participants. The training is conducted over the course of three
days, two Core Elements for each section. In 2024, 34 YAPMs completed the Core Elements trainings hosted by
The Center. In FY 24, The Center launched the Young Adult Peer Mentor Resource Network. This monthly
meeting provides an opportunity for YAPMs across the state to provide mutual support regarding their unique
role and to share best practices in engaging youth and young adults in services and supports focused on their
mental health and wellness. The YAPM Resource Network had consistent participation throughout the year
with approximately 10-15 participants per month.
• Young Adult Peer Mentoring Research and Publication
In 2024, the Massachusetts Young Adult Peer Mentoring model was recognized in a national publication. The
article, Relational Complexity of the Near‑Age Peer Support Provider Role in Youth and Young Adult Community
Mental Health Settings, was published in the Journal of Behavioral Health Services and Research.
In 2024, The Center also supported training for supervisors of Young Adult Peer Mentors. Twenty-five
supervisors participated in a full-day training session in June where they focused on a strength-based
supervision model that is attuned to the specific needs of young adult peers.
Best Practice Psychiatric Care in Group and Residential Treatment for Youth and Families Learning
Collaborative
In the context of facilitating and supporting best practice psychiatric care in group and residential treatment
settings for youth in the Commonwealth, the Learning Collaborative was launched in January 2023 and occurs
monthly for 90 minutes meetings. The Learning Collaborative is organized and conducted by two child
psychiatrists, Joel Goldstein MD (DMH) and Kerry Ann Williams MD (Medical Director, Justice Resource
Institute). Participants are child psychiatric care providers (psychiatrists, advanced practice nurses and
developmental pediatricians) practicing at residential and congregate care program sites throughout
Massachusetts. Some of the topics addressed during 2024 were:
• Differential diagnosis of psychosis and autism as well as consideration of treatment approaches
• Best practice psychopharmacologic strategies in the treatment of aggression for youth in congregate
care, residential and hospital-based settings.
• Focus on Pediatric Sleep
• Residential Milieu Management
• Occupational Therapy
Support for Paid Internships for Behavioral Health Students

The Center manages a two-year, 7 million dollar grant program (September 2023 to August 2025) supported
with COVID and ARPA funds that provides four universities around the state: Westfield State University, Salem
State University, Bridgewater State University and Boston College with funds to provide payment for students
completing required internships in behavioral health fields. BIPOC and other marginalized students completing
degree required internships, which are typically unpaid were prioritized within this grant. Internship
placements are limited to public sector settings to increase interest and a pathway to careers in public sector
mental health. In addition, the program supports that cost of training and supervision incurred by the
organizations that host the interns.
An unduplicated total of 191 students received paid internships during the 2023-2024 academic year. The
students were in bachelor’s level social work or psychology programs; master’s level social work, psychology or
counseling programs; and masters level psychiatric mental health nurse practitioners. In addition, 30 physician
assistant students were paid for their time in a behavioral health rotation.
Many students mentioned being able to focus more on their schoolwork and on their internships because of
the compensation, as well as feeling an alleviation of stress, engaging more with their school communities, and,
perhaps most importantly, having the resources needed to prevent them from dropping out of the internship
experience because of other financial requirements. Additionally, students said that they were able to choose
an internship based on their career aspirations, rather than choosing an internship solely on the internship
site’s ability to pay. Interns were also able to use the extra time they had from not having to work extra jobs to
plan activities for clients or spend more time with their children.
Universities saw the effect of the benefits that students described. It was evident to them that the paid
internships significantly relieved students’ financial stress. Several reported that it has allowed a greater focus
on learning. One stated that “Students are relieved and grateful for the paid internship. For many, it is the first
time they can concentrate on being a student without juggling multiple jobs to support themselves and their
families. As a result, they are enjoying classes and taking the time to go deep into their readings. They have
time to process information and concentrate on their assignments. Learning, not just passing classes, has
become the focus.” Faculty also reported a decline in urgent financial situations (requests for additional
financial aid to cover rent or transportation expenses, assistance with purchasing books, assistance with
technology, etc.). According to faculty, the ability to focus on school translates, for instance, to students not
having to request extensions for assignments. Professors have also noticed an improvement in students’ quality
of work.
Toward the end of the Fall 2023 and Spring 2024 semesters, on average interns are most interested in working
in organizations that serve specific marginalized groups, who are BIPOC or LGBTQIA+, followed by behavioral
health organizations serving people on MassHealth or who are uninsured or people with serious mental illness.
Knowledge Dissemination Activities
Insurance Resource Center for Autism and Behavioral Health
Understanding insurance coverage and accessing treatments continues to be a significant challenge for families
seeking behavioral health services. Despite strong laws mandating coverage, the complexities of navigating

insurance, affording coverage, as well as systemic barriers, remain high and continue to prevent some families
from accessing needed care.
The Center continues its partnership with the Insurance Resource Center for Autism and Behavioral Health
(IRC), a program of the Eunice Kennedy Shriver Center at UMass Chan Medical School to assist state agency
staff, families, and providers with navigating behavioral health commercial insurance benefits for children and
adolescents. The IRC provides a range of resources including:
• Information and technical assistance by phone/e-mail
• Assistance with issues related to navigating insurance
• Access to documents including legislation, FAQ’s, agency bulletins, etc.
• Trainings and webinars for families and providers
• Fact Sheet Library on topics relevant to Behavioral Health. These are available as accessible pdf
documents, with translated versions in Spanish, Brazilian Portuguese, Simplified Chinese, and
Vietnamese.
During FY 24, the IRC:
• Received approximately 5,847 calls, representing a 70% increase from the prior year.
• Established a language line to expand capability to assist families in many languages, and the
community has been very appreciative of the resource.
• Provided training for 3,081 people, relatively consistent with the prior year. Presentations ranged from
small groups of families to larger groups of professionals, depending on the specific topic, forum, etc.
Spanish and Portuguese translation is offered for all the IRC’s Lunch and Learn presentations.
• Participated in 10 outreach events, such as conferences, resource fairs and community events
throughout the state. Three outreach events were focused on cultural, linguistically diverse, and
underserved communities.
• Organized an Autism Diagnosis Summit in May of 2024 bringing together professionals to discuss ways
to expand access to diagnostic services, which is a significant barrier/delay to accessing services for
many families.
Of the requests for assistance the IRC receives, cases related to BH remain amongst the most challenging cases,
relative to both insurance coverage, access to treatment, and severity of need. The IRC continues to partner
with DMH, MSPCC, PPAL, clinicians, and other organizations to provide insurance support and resources. IRC,
like many others, receives requests for assistance with cases where individuals are “stuck” in ED’s and/or
encountering other barriers. While many of the needs are outside of the scope of our insurance-related
technical assistance, the IRC provides support and referrals to others in their networks for assistance.
Website and Listserv
The Center launched a redesigned website packed with new resources, training opportunities, and a rich
archive of learning materials in October 2024. The website provides a forum for policy makers, providers,
advocates, and youth and families to locate information about local and national training events, learn about
evidence-based and promising practices in Massachusetts, and share relevant information and resources for
individuals working in the children’s behavioral health field. In FY 2024, the site had over 13,700 unique visitors.
We are excited to unveil a fully renovated site.

Conclusion
The Children’s Behavioral Health Knowledge Center contributes to the advancement of many of the aims of the
Roadmap for Behavioral Health Reform to:
1. Deliver more effective treatment by training the workforce to address the mental health needs of
infants and young children and their families, to tackle them early before challenges escalate requiring
higher levels of care; and by supporting the peer workforce by developing the Family Partner Practice
Profile.
2. Improve health equity by increasing training, mentoring and financial support of BIPOC clinicians in
training or entering the behavioral health field in the public sector; and by increasing attention to the
needs of racial and ethnic groups in all The Center’s programs.
3. Support the peer workforce by developing the Family Partner Practice Profile and training tools to
support the practice.
4. Ease the burden of families in accessing behavioral health services through programs such the
Insurance Resource Center for Autism and Behavioral Health.
5. Develop more options to treatment by supporting the development of innovative easily accessible
options that can be delivered by non-clinical staff such as Living in Families with Our Emotions (LIFE)
Project.
6. Increase collaboration among state agencies and provider organizations.
7. Continue to develop programs to address identified gaps in the behavioral health service array by
offering training opportunities for the behavioral health workforce. For example, in response to the
crisis of access to assessment of Autism Spectrum Disorders, especially for children who speak
languages other than English, The Center approached the Hispanic/Latino Behavioral Health Center of
Excellence and established a collaboration to offer training for Spanish-speaking psychologists in
Massachusetts in assessment of Autism Spectrum Disorders to be offered in 2025.
