On behalf of the Children’s Behavioral Health (BH) Advisory Council (Council), established under the
provisions of Chapter 321 of the Acts of 2008, I am pleased to transmit its 2024 Annual Report.
The Council comprises a diverse and interdisciplinary assembly, encompassing members from
professional guilds, trade organizations, state agencies, families, young adult leaders, advocates, and
other essential stakeholders. Appendix A of this report provides a comprehensive list of the Council's
membership. In its deliberations, the Council consistently integrates children’s behavioral health reform
within the framework of the Commonwealth’s overarching health policy reforms. Moving forward, the
Council is committed to advancing the Roadmap for Behavioral Health Reform and upholding children’s
behavioral health as a core principle.
In FY24, the Council’s focus has been on providing recommendations for Infant and Early Childhood
Mental Health (IECMH) and Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). These areas are critical in shaping the
behavioral health landscape for our youngest citizens and ensuring early and effective interventions. The
Council has dedicated significant efforts to review current systems, identifying gaps, and proposing
strategic initiatives to enhance services and supports for these populations. Appendix B of this report
outlines these efforts and offers recommendations to assist youth and their families.
Collaboration among policymakers, educators, healthcare providers, and communities is essential for
creating an environment that prioritizes children's behavioral health and ensures accessible mental
health services for all children in need. This collaborative effort aims to empower children to reach their
full potential and build a more resilient future together. The Council is committed to these goals and
looks forward to continued collaboration in these critical areas.
Sincerely,
Brooke Doyle, M.Ed, LMHC
Commissioner
On behalf of the Children’s Behavioral Health Advisory Council

I. Council’s Activities
The Children's Behavioral Health Advisory Council continues to be concerned about persistent
disparities in access to behavioral health services for children, particularly in underserved
communities. This year the Council’s focus and recommendations are on two specific areas of high
need: children in infancy and early childhood with mental health (IECMH) needs, and children
with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). The Council’s findings and recommendations are detailed
in Appendix B of this report.
The Council identified key themes, including significant service gaps in rural areas exacerbated
by behavioral health workforce shortages, fragmented care systems, and poor coordination
between providers, particularly affecting youth with complex mental health needs. This
highlighted the need for a more integrated and equitable approach to children's behavioral
health care across Massachusetts.
These service gaps in Massachusetts are consistent with those identified by other researchers.
For1 found that rural areas are in critical need of more healthcare providers than urban areas
while Counts (2023)2 highlights the significant shortage in the behavioral health workforce and
its impact on the delivery of mental health services. In addition, like in Massachusetts,
navigating complex service systems, delays and fragmented care were also identified as
significant challenges for families, compounded by high costs and insurance coverage
complexities (Collins et al., 2018)3. Nooteboom et al., (2020).4 found that families and youth
care professionals face many barriers when dealing with fragmented care and interprofessional
collaboration, which results in service inefficiencies and reduced quality of care
In October and December 2023, the Council initiated its work by harnessing the experiences
and knowledge of council members to develop an inventory list of existing services and
systematically identify areas of significant need within the realm of children's behavioral health.
Based on this expertise, two specific areas showed persistent disparities, particularly regarding
access to specialized therapies and interventions, and were selected as focus areas by the
group: children in infancy and early childhood with mental health (IECMH) needs, and children
with ASD.
In February 2024, the Council’s expert members compiled a list of promising and best practices
in behavioral health interventions, aiming to outline effective strategies that could be scaled

and/or implemented to bridge identified gaps in services to infants and young children, and to
children with ASD.
In March and April 2024, the Council prioritized recommendations based on the identified gaps
and promising practices. Recommendations were formulated to enhance services, proposing
policy changes and programmatic improvements tailored to improve outcomes for children and
families. Attention was particularly directed towards addressing disparities in access to ASD and
IECMH services, including accessibility, screenings, and comprehensive family support.
During our final meeting in June 2024, Kelly English, PhD, LICSW and Julie Welch, MSW, LCSW
presented on the Children’s Mental Health Campaign’s efforts to address the complexity of ASD
and mental health in Massachusetts. In addition, the Council concluded its efforts by finalizing
and approving recommendations for inclusion in this FY24 Annual Report. The Council’s final
report underscored the critical need for targeted interventions and systemic improvements to
better support children with ASD and infants/early childhood mental health. These efforts aim
to mitigate disparities, promote early intervention, and foster optimal developmental outcomes
for all children.
Overall, the work of the Children's Behavioral Health Advisory Council in 2023-2024 reflected a
dedicated commitment to addressing complex challenges in children's behavioral health, laying
a foundation for impactful change and improved service delivery across identified focus areas.
We would like to extend a special note of appreciation to all members of the Council for their
invaluable contributions throughout the year. In particular, we formally recognize the members
of the summer workgroup, whose dedication and focused efforts were instrumental in the
timely completion of this report. Their commitment to advancing the Council’s objectives and
addressing critical gaps in services for children’s behavioral health is especially noteworthy. We
extend our deepest thanks to Katherine Engel, Chip Wilder, Margaret Hannah, Carisa Pajak,
Amudha Subramaniam, Danna Mauch, Margarita O’Neill-Arana, Andrea Goncalves-Oliveira,
Lauren Almeida, Manny Oppong, and Laura Prager for their exceptional work and collaborative
spirit. Their contributions were crucial to shaping the recommendations outlined in this report,
and their efforts will have a lasting impact on our collective mission to improve access to
behavioral health services for children across the Commonwealth.
The Summary of the CBHAC Workgroup Recommendations can be found in Appendix B.
II. The Year Ahead
Looking ahead to the upcoming year, the Children's Behavioral Health Advisory Council is poised
to build upon the foundational work of 2023-2024 with a focused approach on making
recommendations for actionable steps toward achieving significant outcomes. Building from our
inventory and gap review conducted last year, our next steps will include refining
recommendations aimed at addressing critical disparities for youth experiencing complex
needs. The Council plans to continue to prioritize 2-4 key focus areas, with the intention of
1
identifying and recommending promising practices, enhancement of service coordination,
expansion of access to specialized services, and improvements in early intervention strategies.
Moreover, we are committed to advocating for changes that support equitable access to
affordable, high-quality services and developmental screenings, crucial for marginalized
communities. By fostering collaboration among stakeholders and driving systemic
improvements, we aim to ensure that every child receives the necessary support for optimal
behavioral health and developmental outcomes in the year ahead. The Council will convene a
summer workgroup to begin planning for another productive and effective year of work ahead
in 2025.

APPENDIX B
Summary of the CBHAC Workgroup Recommendations:
Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)
Workgroup Co-Chairs & Lead Facilitators: Katherine Engel (Boston Children’s) and
Omar Irizarry (DMH)
An overarching challenge that caregivers of youth with ASD face is that there isn’t a specific
state agency that manages services for this population across the lifespan. Furthermore, many
individuals with ASD present complex needs in medical, developmental, educational, mental
health, language, and behavioral realms that, in Massachusetts, are managed by various state
agencies such as: DDS, DESE, DPH, DMH, EEC, MRC. Not having one designated entity
responsible for assisting individuals who carry an ASD diagnosis, makes the process of accessing
services exceedingly difficult and lengthy.
Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a complex neurodevelopmental condition characterized by
challenges in social communication and interaction, alongside repetitive behaviors, or intense
interests. As outlined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (5th ed.), the
spectrum encompasses a wide range of symptoms and severity levels, necessitating tailored
approaches to support affected individuals. The developmental stages of early childhood, school
age, and transition into adulthood present distinct challenges and gaps in service delivery for
individuals with ASD as follows.
• Early Childhood (0-5 years old): Navigating the evaluation and diagnosis process for ASD
remains a formidable challenge for families. Issues include delays in accessing
evaluations and disparities in insurance coverage, which hinder timely interventions
crucial for developmental support. There is a recognized need for improved training
among pediatricians and providers on documenting and assessing the needs of young
children with ASD. Moreover, gaps persist in coordinating early intervention services
effectively, exacerbating the disconnect between assessment and service provision. All
these challenges are compounded for children and families for whom English is not their
primary language.
• School Age Children (Pre-K through High School): Ensuring inclusive evaluation
processes that accommodate ASD alongside behavioral health needs is paramount.
Collaboration with the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education (DESE) to
enhance resources within educational settings is essential. Improved coordination
among schools, community providers, and families is critical to bridge gaps in services
and support structures for school-aged children with ASD. This collaboration seeks to
align educational initiatives with comprehensive care strategies that meet the diverse
needs of students with ASD.
5
• Transition Age Youth - Early Adulthood (16-26 years old): Transitioning into adulthood
poses significant challenges for youth with ASD, particularly in coordinating care
between pediatric and adult service providers. There is a pressing need to integrate
services and supports across systems to ensure continuity of care and address gaps in
adult-focused interventions. Expanding the scope of wrap-around services, such as those
provided by the Department of Developmental Services (DDS) and Department of
Mental Health (DMH), is crucial to supporting young adults with ASD through
community-based initiatives.
The CBHAC used the framework that emerged out of the COVID Impact on Children’s Behavioral
Health Study Report (2022) to focus on the following four specific areas when looking at
behavioral health needs for youth with ASD.
CBH Advisory Council Focus Areas:

Section 2:
1. Promotion & Prevention

Section 3:
2. Intervention & Treatment

Section 4:
3. Collaboration Across Sector Providers

Section 5:
4. Workforce Development:
CBH Advisory Council ASD Recommendations:
The CBHAC acknowledges that there are already established groups in the Commonwealth
working on addressing the needs of individuals with ASD, such as the Autism Commission,
charged with making recommendations on policies impacting individuals with autism spectrum
disorders (ASD). The following recommendations do not suggest the need to establish yet
another group to address those needs but rather to elevate the Council’s collective observations
and share them with those in positions to implement them.
Three overarching recommendations for all focus areas are:
Prioritize Linguistic and Cultural Competence: Build linguistic capacity and cultural best
practices to better serve diverse communities.
Address Equity Challenges: Recognize and mitigate equity issues that exacerbate family stress
and impact child outcomes. Prioritize recommendations made by, led by, and driven by families
and youth to ensure inclusivity and relevance.
Include Individuals with Lived Experience and Cultural Brokers: Incorporate individuals with
lived experience, and cultural brokers in policy discussions, program development, decision-
making processes, and service provision to foster informed and culturally responsive initiatives.
Other specific recommendations are as follows:
6

Section 6:
1. Engage ASD Experts for Guidance in the Development of Policies and Services:
• Provide resources to implement the recommendations of the Autism
Commission and other groups such as the Children’s Mental Health Campaign for
development of ASD training and skill building opportunities for child serving
providers, inclusive of primary care. 5

Section 7:
2. Support family advocacy and community services:
• Provide resources for family advocacy and other community programs to
increase socialization and support networks. This includes expanding and
implementing Universal Precautions for ASD.

Section 8:
3. Increase access to early ASD screening and assessment:
Early identification and treatment of ASD greatly improves the efficacy of interventions
with youth with ASD. Currently only physicians and psychologists can make an ASD
diagnoses necessary to be eligible for some treatment services. The relative scarcity of
professionals available to make those diagnoses has resulted in long waiting lists for
assessments, which delays treatment, sometimes for well over a year.
• The CBHAC strongly recommends revising those regulations to allow other
qualified/trained health, mental health and educational professionals to perform
those assessments and make those diagnoses.

Section 9:
4. Expand Access to a wider range of Behavioral Health Interventions:
• Acknowledging the importance of Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA), as an
evidence-based model, increase awareness and access to complementary
community-level approaches, such as relationship-based models that integrate
caregiver-child relational supports with dyadic play, sensory-based work, and
other supportive therapies. These options are particularly crucial for families
facing long waitlists and barriers to accessing evaluations.
• Train staff in best practices to treat individuals with ASD.

Section 10:
5. Increase ASD Expertise in Children’s Human Service Organizations:
Knowledge regarding the specific needs, available services and best practices for
individuals with ASD is sorely lacking in the majority of the current array of human
services in the State, due in part to the minimal training on ASD in most education and
7
human service academic programs. This gap often results in inadequate
responsiveness and effectiveness in meeting the complex needs of these youth and
families. Therefore, we recommend:
• Increasing staff with specialized ASD knowledge and expertise, and/or supporting
the development of this expertise within existing staff at child-serving
organizations, including primary care.
• Hiring individuals with lived experience with ASD or caregivers of youth with ASD,
and cultural brokers6 in to improve effectiveness and cultural responsiveness in
programs.

Section 11:
6. Incorporate BCBA and In-Home Behavioral Clinicians into service programs:
• Support treatment models that include Board-Certified Behavior Analysts
(BCBAs) and In-Home Behavioral Clinicians in future procurements for service
delivery for youth with ASD. BCBAs bring specialized expertise complementary to
ABA treatment, offering valuable insights into behavioral interventions and
support strategies. In-Home Behavioral Clinicians provide essential, tailored
support within the home environment that addresses the unique needs of youth
with ASD.
• Support the inclusion of Occupational Therapists (OTs), Behavioral Health (BH)
clinicians, and other specialists to create a comprehensive support system.
Together, these roles can significantly bridge the gaps in services and enrich our
understanding of approaches to best support individuals with ASD across various
care settings.

Section 12:
7. Support Families During School Transitions:
Transitions from Early Intervention to Special Education mark significant changes for
families of children with ASD. These transitions often represent a move toward
integrated and inclusive support within the school system, which can constitute a
large portion of a child’s ASD services. While we recognize that the Department of
Elementary and Secondary Education (DESE) may already have some measures in
place, we believe it is important to emphasize the need for comprehensive, family-
centered transition support to promote continuity of care and inclusive educational
environments.9
• Expand support for families as they navigate these transitions to ensure they
have the resources and guidance needed for successful integration into the
school system.
6 Cultural brokering is the act of bridging, linking, or mediating between groups or persons of different cultural
backgrounds for the purpose of reducing conflict or producing change (Jezewski, 1990).
8
These recommendations are based on the experience and knowledge of our Council Members
and aim to address systemic barriers and enhance support structures for individuals with ASD,
emphasizing cultural competence, family-led initiatives, and the integration of diverse expertise
in care delivery.
It is also critically important for us to collaborate with established subject matter experts and
existing councils and workgroups, such as the Autism Commission. In addition, it is our
understanding that the Children’s Mental Health Campaign is also completing a high-level
service landscape and journey map to identify feasible policy and practice solutions to better
serve youth with ASD. By aligning with these groups, their expertise, objectives, and shared
vision can be leveraged to create a more effective and coordinated system of care for youth with
ASD.
In conclusion, the year ahead for the Children's Behavioral Health Advisory Council focuses on
disseminating and promoting these recommendations to address systemic barriers and enhance
support structures for individuals with ASD across their lifespan. By supporting legislative
reforms, fostering interagency collaboration, and prioritizing workforce development, the
Council aims to promote and support the development of comprehensive and equitable care for
all individuals affected by ASD in Massachusetts.
Infant and Early Childhood Mental Health (IECMH)
Workgroup Co-Chairs & Lead Facilitators: Margarita O’Neill-Arana and Andrea
Goncalves Oliveira (DMH)
Infant and Early Childhood Mental Health (IECMH) is the developing capacity of the child from
birth to 5 years-old to form close and secure adult and peer relationships; experience, express
and manage a full range of emotions; and explore the environment and learn all in the context
of family, community, and culture. The ranges of IECMH services can and should begin in the
prenatal stage and can encompass promotion, prevention, and intervention relationship-based
services. Although Autism Spectrum Disorder is being presented separately in this report, it is a
crucial part of IECMH and should not be seen as separate. Children first show symptoms in the
early childhood years and initial screening, assessment and intervention should occur during
those years, as early as possible, in order to provide the best outcomes for children and families.
Infant and Early Childhood Mental Health (IECMH) must happen through a Diversity, Equity, and
Inclusion lens emphasizing the need for culturally sensitive and equitable practices. It recognizes
the impact of racial trauma and systemic oppression on access to care and diagnoses,
particularly for BIPOC children. It advocates for early intervention and prevention through
promoting relational health over behavioral health, and stresses the importance of a diverse,
and culturally and linguistic competent workforce. The approach advocates for a holistic view of
child development, involving families and communities and empowering family voice, not only
in service delivery but in program design and implementation. Centering the work on the
9
Diversity-Informed Tenets1 helps stride towards these goals and emphasizes the need for self-
awareness and reflective capacity to combat bias and racism.
Furthermore, working with existing subject-matter experts and collaborating with existing
workgroups that have been focusing exclusively on IECMH since 2019, is imperative in moving
this work forward with common goals, objectives, shared language and vision. DMH has
convened the IECMH Policy Workgroup and IECMH Integration into Primary Care Workgroup
and MSPCC/Children’s Mental Health Campaign have facilitated an IECMH Advocacy Workgroup
since 2019. A new IECMH Strategic Plan from these groups is currently in the process of being
developed and should be taken in to account, alongside these recommendations.
CBH Advisory Council Focus Areas:

Section 13:
1. Promotion & Prevention: Increase awareness and education about the importance of
infant and early childhood mental health and early relational health starting prenatally
and explore and collaborate with the Office of Behavioral Health Promotion and
Prevention on these goals.

Section 14:
2. Intervention & Treatment: Address issues with cost, access and long waitlists, when
looking for providers who specialize in serving this age-range. Increase awareness and
destigmatization of mental health needs in young children (10-14% of children meet
criteria for diagnosis in 3-5 age range) and train-up the workforce in developmental,
relational, 2-generational (caregiver-child), and culturally responsive screening,
assessment, and intervention models.

Section 15:
3. Collaboration Across Sector Providers: Stride towards a common language and shared
understanding when talking about IECMH for all systems that work with families and
young children. Incentivize best practices that include warm handoffs and closed-loop
referrals between healthcare, education, and social service sectors.

Section 16:
4. Workforce Development: Enhance the whole workforce by providing training on IECMH
competencies across diverse roles and professions and incorporate IECMH into core
training curricula for all professionals touching the lives of young children and families.
CBH Advisory Council IECMH Recommendations:
Support and enhance a Diverse Workforce: Ensure that all recommendations prioritize building
a diverse, linguistic, and culturally competent workforce, capable of serving families in their
native languages, reducing reliance on interpreter services. In order to prevent burnout and
losing the workforce, we need to provide reflective spaces, realistic caseloads, and adequate
pay. We need to revise licensing requirements and find pathways for bilingual, bicultural
providers with degrees from other countries, to be able to get licensed and practice in the
Massachusetts.
Address Equity Challenges: We strive to recognize the impact of racial trauma and systemic
oppression on access to care, over and mis diagnosis of BIPOC children and center on the
10
Diversity-Informed Tenets and family voice. Focus on policies that create safe communities that
are more supportive and uplifting for families, as system and community changes can greatly
impact the health and well-being of its individuals. Understand the trauma related to foster care
and invest in prevention and promotion programs that offer more stable and long-term
placements, preferably with family members, frequent visitations with biological family that do
not burden the caregiver with cost and transportation and provides resources and parenting
support to biological and foster families alike (see Infant-Toddler Court Programs).
Include Lived Experience and Cultural Brokers: Incorporate individuals with lived experience
and cultural brokers in policy discussions and decision-making processes to foster informed and
culturally responsive initiatives. Another area of opportunity is to look more into practice-based
evidence vs evidenced-based practice, as these tend to be standardized without a diverse
representation of the population and cultures.
The early years are crucial for a healthy development and life trajectory. In order for a child to
grow into their full potential, they need to be held in safe, supportive, and empowering
relationships, not only by their caregivers, but also by their educators, service providers and
communities. Investing in early childhood is investing in the children of today, but also in the
adults of tomorrow, who in turn, will also become the caregivers of the future. With this mind,
these are some of the recommendations from the CBHAC members:

Section 17:
1. Policy and Systematic Changes
• Find pathways for sustainable funding streams for IECMH initiatives to be created
and expanded, particularly those that are typically not reimbursable or are sustained
by federal grants and explore strategies that would facilitate braided funding and
expand promotion and preventive service billing.
• Investments in addressing social determinants of (mental) health can produce better
outcomes and decrease spending in more intensive services downstream.
• Expand on existing efforts so there is access to more widespread prevention and
promotion services. For example, expand the Medicaid Prevention and Promotion
Memo to allow individual services to be provided in schools and in the community,
not just in primary care and allow promotion services to be provided without a
positive screening tool.
• Encourage private insurance to cover prevention and promotion services, particularly
in prenatal and early childhood services.
• Ensure consistency on how social-emotional needs qualify children for IEP or 504
plans, especially when transitioning from Early Intervention into the Public School
System, so supportive services are not lost at this crucial developmental stage.
• Reevaluate payment structures, exploring ways to compensate a highly specialized
workforce, for time spent in specialized training, for time spent providing/receiving
reflective supervision, and for time consulting with care team and providing high-
quality care coordination.
11

Section 18:
2. Increase Public Awareness
• Invest in public awareness campaigns that promote the important of early
relationships starting at the prenatal stage, both in the medical and community
settings, and destigmatize mental health needs of young children.
• Increase early screening practices both for the caregivers (starting prenatally) and
the baby/child.
• Educate caregivers and professionals about the importance of early identification
and intervention and promoting awareness of available resources.
• Expand and create universal approaches and 2- generation model, in which both
children and caregivers are screened for social-emotional needs while provided with
in-home supports around parenting, child development, and relational health.
• Ensure sustainability, funding and reimbursement for prevention and promotion
services.

Section 19:
3. Increase Access to Services7
• Expand integration of IECMH practices within primary care, pediatric settings, Ob-
Gyn offices, as well as at the community mental health level, to ensure early
identification and a 2-generation model of support. This includes increasing the
number of SUD recovery programs that allow children to be with their parents, while
providing a 2-generational approach to care.
• Incentivize co-located maternal and child health care models and flexibility of times
and locations of services to meet families where they are.
• Develop strategies that offer Occupational Therapy, Physical Therapy and Speech and
Language Therapy services within a Behavioral Health model, offering more
opportunity for coordination and a continuum of services delivered.
• Ensure IECMH expertise in existing referral, family support, clinical and crisis support
services for babies, toddlers, and their families and infuse IECMH principles in adult
services when they are also caregivers to young children.
• Promote the utilization of the DC: 0-5 assessment, crosswalk and billing codes when
working with children under the age of 6, which is already recommended as a best
practice by MassHealth.
• Create efficient communication and engagement with professionals to ensure
awareness of changes, opportunities and resources, like the Medicaid Prevention
and Promotion Memo that could be used to expand access for infants and young
children.
• Foster community involvement and family voice in planning and implementing
IECMH services to ensure they meet local needs and cultural contexts.
7 MSPCC is currently engaged in an IECMH systems mapping.
12

Section 20:
4. Well-Trained and Diverse Workforce
• Commit to a diverse and well-trained and supported workforce by creating
sustainable funding for ongoing professional development and training
opportunities, as well as ongoing communities of practice that can support IECMH
professionals.
• Train the entire workforce that delivers services to young children and their families
in culturally responsive, developmentally appropriate, trauma-informed and
relationship-based principles and competencies and models. This applies to home
visitors, peer professionals, shelter staff, educators, etc., not only clinicians.
• Sustainable funding and resources to have systems integrate the internationally
recognized Endorsement for Culturally Sensitive, Relationship-Focused Practice
Promoting Infant and Early Childhood Mental Health® competencies needed for
credentialing, that equip professionals with the skills needed to deliver IECMH
services across various fields (e.g., healthcare, education, social services, home-
visiting, etc.). In MA, MassAIMH Endorsement® credential has been implemented
since 2019.
• Develop and support access to training, billing and use of reflective practice and/or
supervision.
• Collaborate with Higher Education to infuse IECMH into social work and mental
health programs, so students graduate ready to work with younger children.

Section 21:
5. Centralized Coordination Hubs
• Revisit the possibility of establishing IECMH regional central hubs or centers of
excellence for coordinating services across sectors involved in early childhood, that
can facilitate seamless transitions and referrals through standardized protocols and
shared information systems, while providing individualized and supportive care
coordination and create a continuum of care for IECMH services.
• Explore the possibility of expanding current services, like Family Resource Centers,
that address the entire family and social determinants of health but are isolated
from other systems, not specialized in early childhood needs or have the capacity for
individualized high-quality and supportive care coordination.
By adopting a DEI lens and focusing on early relational health, the recommendations aim to
enhance the accessibility, quality, and equity of IECMH services. These actions can mitigate the
overdiagnosis and misdiagnosis of BIPOC children, improve early intervention outcomes, and
build a more diverse and culturally sensitive workforce capable of addressing the needs of
families. Through coordinated efforts and shared commitment, Massachusetts can lead the way
in promoting mental health from infancy through early childhood, ensuring that every child and
family receives the support they need to thrive. At the same time, it is essential to recognize
and fairly compensate the professionals who work with young children and families every day.

On behalf of the Children’s Behavioral Health (BH) Advisory Council (Council), established under the
provisions of Chapter 321 of the Acts of 2008, I am pleased to transmit its 2024 Annual Report.
The Council comprises a diverse and interdisciplinary assembly, encompassing members from
professional guilds, trade organizations, state agencies, families, young adult leaders, advocates, and
other essential stakeholders. Appendix A of this report provides a comprehensive list of the Council's
membership. In its deliberations, the Council consistently integrates children’s behavioral health reform
within the framework of the Commonwealth’s overarching health policy reforms. Moving forward, the
Council is committed to advancing the Roadmap for Behavioral Health Reform and upholding children’s
behavioral health as a core principle.
In FY24, the Council’s focus has been on providing recommendations for Infant and Early Childhood
Mental Health (IECMH) and Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). These areas are critical in shaping the
behavioral health landscape for our youngest citizens and ensuring early and effective interventions. The
Council has dedicated significant efforts to review current systems, identifying gaps, and proposing
strategic initiatives to enhance services and supports for these populations. Appendix B of this report
outlines these efforts and offers recommendations to assist youth and their families.

Collaboration among policymakers, educators, healthcare providers, and communities is essential for
creating an environment that prioritizes children's behavioral health and ensures accessible mental
health services for all children in need. This collaborative effort aims to empower children to reach their
full potential and build a more resilient future together. The Council is committed to these goals and
looks forward to continued collaboration in these critical areas.
Sincerely,
Brooke Doyle, M.Ed, LMHC
Commissioner
On behalf of the Children’s Behavioral Health Advisory Council

I. Council’s Activities
The Children's Behavioral Health Advisory Council continues to be concerned about persistent
disparities in access to behavioral health services for children, particularly in underserved
communities. This year the Council’s focus and recommendations are on two specific areas of high
need: children in infancy and early childhood with mental health (IECMH) needs, and children
with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). The Council’s findings and recommendations are detailed
in Appendix B of this report.
The Council identified key themes, including significant service gaps in rural areas exacerbated
by behavioral health workforce shortages, fragmented care systems, and poor coordination
between providers, particularly affecting youth with complex mental health needs. This
highlighted the need for a more integrated and equitable approach to children's behavioral
health care across Massachusetts.
These service gaps in Massachusetts are consistent with those identified by other researchers.
For1 found that rural areas are in critical need of more healthcare providers than urban areas
while Counts (2023)2 highlights the significant shortage in the behavioral health workforce and
its impact on the delivery of mental health services. In addition, like in Massachusetts,
navigating complex service systems, delays and fragmented care were also identified as
significant challenges for families, compounded by high costs and insurance coverage
complexities (Collins et al., 2018)3. Nooteboom et al., (2020).4 found that families and youth
care professionals face many barriers when dealing with fragmented care and interprofessional
collaboration, which results in service inefficiencies and reduced quality of care
In October and December 2023, the Council initiated its work by harnessing the experiences
and knowledge of council members to develop an inventory list of existing services and
systematically identify areas of significant need within the realm of children's behavioral health.
Based on this expertise, two specific areas showed persistent disparities, particularly regarding
access to specialized therapies and interventions, and were selected as focus areas by the
group: children in infancy and early childhood with mental health (IECMH) needs, and children
with ASD.
In February 2024, the Council’s expert members compiled a list of promising and best practices
in behavioral health interventions, aiming to outline effective strategies that could be scaled

and/or implemented to bridge identified gaps in services to infants and young children, and to
children with ASD.
In March and April 2024, the Council prioritized recommendations based on the identified gaps
and promising practices. Recommendations were formulated to enhance services, proposing
policy changes and programmatic improvements tailored to improve outcomes for children and
families. Attention was particularly directed towards addressing disparities in access to ASD and
IECMH services, including accessibility, screenings, and comprehensive family support.
During our final meeting in June 2024, Kelly English, PhD, LICSW and Julie Welch, MSW, LCSW
presented on the Children’s Mental Health Campaign’s efforts to address the complexity of ASD
and mental health in Massachusetts. In addition, the Council concluded its efforts by finalizing
and approving recommendations for inclusion in this FY24 Annual Report. The Council’s final
report underscored the critical need for targeted interventions and systemic improvements to
better support children with ASD and infants/early childhood mental health. These efforts aim
to mitigate disparities, promote early intervention, and foster optimal developmental outcomes
for all children.
Overall, the work of the Children's Behavioral Health Advisory Council in 2023-2024 reflected a
dedicated commitment to addressing complex challenges in children's behavioral health, laying
a foundation for impactful change and improved service delivery across identified focus areas.
We would like to extend a special note of appreciation to all members of the Council for their
invaluable contributions throughout the year. In particular, we formally recognize the members
of the summer workgroup, whose dedication and focused efforts were instrumental in the
timely completion of this report. Their commitment to advancing the Council’s objectives and
addressing critical gaps in services for children’s behavioral health is especially noteworthy. We
extend our deepest thanks to Katherine Engel, Chip Wilder, Margaret Hannah, Carisa Pajak,
Amudha Subramaniam, Danna Mauch, Margarita O’Neill-Arana, Andrea Goncalves-Oliveira,
Lauren Almeida, Manny Oppong, and Laura Prager for their exceptional work and collaborative
spirit. Their contributions were crucial to shaping the recommendations outlined in this report,
and their efforts will have a lasting impact on our collective mission to improve access to
behavioral health services for children across the Commonwealth.
The Summary of the CBHAC Workgroup Recommendations can be found in Appendix B.
II. The Year Ahead
Looking ahead to the upcoming year, the Children's Behavioral Health Advisory Council is poised
to build upon the foundational work of 2023-2024 with a focused approach on making
recommendations for actionable steps toward achieving significant outcomes. Building from our
inventory and gap review conducted last year, our next steps will include refining
recommendations aimed at addressing critical disparities for youth experiencing complex
needs. The Council plans to continue to prioritize 2-4 key focus areas, with the intention of
1

identifying and recommending promising practices, enhancement of service coordination,
expansion of access to specialized services, and improvements in early intervention strategies.
Moreover, we are committed to advocating for changes that support equitable access to
affordable, high-quality services and developmental screenings, crucial for marginalized
communities. By fostering collaboration among stakeholders and driving systemic
improvements, we aim to ensure that every child receives the necessary support for optimal
behavioral health and developmental outcomes in the year ahead. The Council will convene a
summer workgroup to begin planning for another productive and effective year of work ahead
in 2025.

APPENDIX B
Summary of the CBHAC Workgroup Recommendations:
Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)
Workgroup Co-Chairs & Lead Facilitators: Katherine Engel (Boston Children’s) and
Omar Irizarry (DMH)
An overarching challenge that caregivers of youth with ASD face is that there isn’t a specific
state agency that manages services for this population across the lifespan. Furthermore, many
individuals with ASD present complex needs in medical, developmental, educational, mental
health, language, and behavioral realms that, in Massachusetts, are managed by various state
agencies such as: DDS, DESE, DPH, DMH, EEC, MRC. Not having one designated entity
responsible for assisting individuals who carry an ASD diagnosis, makes the process of accessing
services exceedingly difficult and lengthy.
Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a complex neurodevelopmental condition characterized by
challenges in social communication and interaction, alongside repetitive behaviors, or intense
interests. As outlined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (5th ed.), the
spectrum encompasses a wide range of symptoms and severity levels, necessitating tailored
approaches to support affected individuals. The developmental stages of early childhood, school
age, and transition into adulthood present distinct challenges and gaps in service delivery for
individuals with ASD as follows.
• Early Childhood (0-5 years old): Navigating the evaluation and diagnosis process for ASD
remains a formidable challenge for families. Issues include delays in accessing
evaluations and disparities in insurance coverage, which hinder timely interventions
crucial for developmental support. There is a recognized need for improved training
among pediatricians and providers on documenting and assessing the needs of young
children with ASD. Moreover, gaps persist in coordinating early intervention services
effectively, exacerbating the disconnect between assessment and service provision. All
these challenges are compounded for children and families for whom English is not their
primary language.
• School Age Children (Pre-K through High School): Ensuring inclusive evaluation
processes that accommodate ASD alongside behavioral health needs is paramount.
Collaboration with the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education (DESE) to
enhance resources within educational settings is essential. Improved coordination
among schools, community providers, and families is critical to bridge gaps in services
and support structures for school-aged children with ASD. This collaboration seeks to
align educational initiatives with comprehensive care strategies that meet the diverse
needs of students with ASD.
5

• Transition Age Youth - Early Adulthood (16-26 years old): Transitioning into adulthood
poses significant challenges for youth with ASD, particularly in coordinating care
between pediatric and adult service providers. There is a pressing need to integrate
services and supports across systems to ensure continuity of care and address gaps in
adult-focused interventions. Expanding the scope of wrap-around services, such as those
provided by the Department of Developmental Services (DDS) and Department of
Mental Health (DMH), is crucial to supporting young adults with ASD through
community-based initiatives.
The CBHAC used the framework that emerged out of the COVID Impact on Children’s Behavioral
Health Study Report (2022) to focus on the following four specific areas when looking at
behavioral health needs for youth with ASD.
CBH Advisory Council Focus Areas:
1. Promotion & Prevention
2. Intervention & Treatment
3. Collaboration Across Sector Providers
4. Workforce Development:
CBH Advisory Council ASD Recommendations:
The CBHAC acknowledges that there are already established groups in the Commonwealth
working on addressing the needs of individuals with ASD, such as the Autism Commission,
charged with making recommendations on policies impacting individuals with autism spectrum
disorders (ASD). The following recommendations do not suggest the need to establish yet
another group to address those needs but rather to elevate the Council’s collective observations
and share them with those in positions to implement them.
Three overarching recommendations for all focus areas are:
Prioritize Linguistic and Cultural Competence: Build linguistic capacity and cultural best
practices to better serve diverse communities.
Address Equity Challenges: Recognize and mitigate equity issues that exacerbate family stress
and impact child outcomes. Prioritize recommendations made by, led by, and driven by families
and youth to ensure inclusivity and relevance.
Include Individuals with Lived Experience and Cultural Brokers: Incorporate individuals with
lived experience, and cultural brokers in policy discussions, program development, decision-
making processes, and service provision to foster informed and culturally responsive initiatives.
Other specific recommendations are as follows:
6

1. Engage ASD Experts for Guidance in the Development of Policies and Services:
• Provide resources to implement the recommendations of the Autism
Commission and other groups such as the Children’s Mental Health Campaign for
development of ASD training and skill building opportunities for child serving
providers, inclusive of primary care. 5
2. Support family advocacy and community services:
• Provide resources for family advocacy and other community programs to
increase socialization and support networks. This includes expanding and
implementing Universal Precautions for ASD.
3. Increase access to early ASD screening and assessment:
Early identification and treatment of ASD greatly improves the efficacy of interventions
with youth with ASD. Currently only physicians and psychologists can make an ASD
diagnoses necessary to be eligible for some treatment services. The relative scarcity of
professionals available to make those diagnoses has resulted in long waiting lists for
assessments, which delays treatment, sometimes for well over a year.
• The CBHAC strongly recommends revising those regulations to allow other
qualified/trained health, mental health and educational professionals to perform
those assessments and make those diagnoses.
4. Expand Access to a wider range of Behavioral Health Interventions:
• Acknowledging the importance of Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA), as an
evidence-based model, increase awareness and access to complementary
community-level approaches, such as relationship-based models that integrate
caregiver-child relational supports with dyadic play, sensory-based work, and
other supportive therapies. These options are particularly crucial for families
facing long waitlists and barriers to accessing evaluations.
• Train staff in best practices to treat individuals with ASD.
5. Increase ASD Expertise in Children’s Human Service Organizations:
Knowledge regarding the specific needs, available services and best practices for
individuals with ASD is sorely lacking in the majority of the current array of human
services in the State, due in part to the minimal training on ASD in most education and
7

human service academic programs. This gap often results in inadequate
responsiveness and effectiveness in meeting the complex needs of these youth and
families. Therefore, we recommend:
• Increasing staff with specialized ASD knowledge and expertise, and/or supporting
the development of this expertise within existing staff at child-serving
organizations, including primary care.
• Hiring individuals with lived experience with ASD or caregivers of youth with ASD,
and cultural brokers6 in to improve effectiveness and cultural responsiveness in
programs.
6. Incorporate BCBA and In-Home Behavioral Clinicians into service programs:
• Support treatment models that include Board-Certified Behavior Analysts
(BCBAs) and In-Home Behavioral Clinicians in future procurements for service
delivery for youth with ASD. BCBAs bring specialized expertise complementary to
ABA treatment, offering valuable insights into behavioral interventions and
support strategies. In-Home Behavioral Clinicians provide essential, tailored
support within the home environment that addresses the unique needs of youth
with ASD.
• Support the inclusion of Occupational Therapists (OTs), Behavioral Health (BH)
clinicians, and other specialists to create a comprehensive support system.
Together, these roles can significantly bridge the gaps in services and enrich our
understanding of approaches to best support individuals with ASD across various
care settings.
7. Support Families During School Transitions:
Transitions from Early Intervention to Special Education mark significant changes for
families of children with ASD. These transitions often represent a move toward
integrated and inclusive support within the school system, which can constitute a
large portion of a child’s ASD services. While we recognize that the Department of
Elementary and Secondary Education (DESE) may already have some measures in
place, we believe it is important to emphasize the need for comprehensive, family-
centered transition support to promote continuity of care and inclusive educational
environments.9
• Expand support for families as they navigate these transitions to ensure they
have the resources and guidance needed for successful integration into the
school system.
6 Cultural brokering is the act of bridging, linking, or mediating between groups or persons of different cultural
backgrounds for the purpose of reducing conflict or producing change (Jezewski, 1990).
8

These recommendations are based on the experience and knowledge of our Council Members
and aim to address systemic barriers and enhance support structures for individuals with ASD,
emphasizing cultural competence, family-led initiatives, and the integration of diverse expertise
in care delivery.
It is also critically important for us to collaborate with established subject matter experts and
existing councils and workgroups, such as the Autism Commission. In addition, it is our
understanding that the Children’s Mental Health Campaign is also completing a high-level
service landscape and journey map to identify feasible policy and practice solutions to better
serve youth with ASD. By aligning with these groups, their expertise, objectives, and shared
vision can be leveraged to create a more effective and coordinated system of care for youth with
ASD.
In conclusion, the year ahead for the Children's Behavioral Health Advisory Council focuses on
disseminating and promoting these recommendations to address systemic barriers and enhance
support structures for individuals with ASD across their lifespan. By supporting legislative
reforms, fostering interagency collaboration, and prioritizing workforce development, the
Council aims to promote and support the development of comprehensive and equitable care for
all individuals affected by ASD in Massachusetts.
Infant and Early Childhood Mental Health (IECMH)
Workgroup Co-Chairs & Lead Facilitators: Margarita O’Neill-Arana and Andrea
Goncalves Oliveira (DMH)
Infant and Early Childhood Mental Health (IECMH) is the developing capacity of the child from
birth to 5 years-old to form close and secure adult and peer relationships; experience, express
and manage a full range of emotions; and explore the environment and learn all in the context
of family, community, and culture. The ranges of IECMH services can and should begin in the
prenatal stage and can encompass promotion, prevention, and intervention relationship-based
services. Although Autism Spectrum Disorder is being presented separately in this report, it is a
crucial part of IECMH and should not be seen as separate. Children first show symptoms in the
early childhood years and initial screening, assessment and intervention should occur during
those years, as early as possible, in order to provide the best outcomes for children and families.
Infant and Early Childhood Mental Health (IECMH) must happen through a Diversity, Equity, and
Inclusion lens emphasizing the need for culturally sensitive and equitable practices. It recognizes
the impact of racial trauma and systemic oppression on access to care and diagnoses,
particularly for BIPOC children. It advocates for early intervention and prevention through
promoting relational health over behavioral health, and stresses the importance of a diverse,
and culturally and linguistic competent workforce. The approach advocates for a holistic view of
child development, involving families and communities and empowering family voice, not only
in service delivery but in program design and implementation. Centering the work on the
9

Diversity-Informed Tenets1 helps stride towards these goals and emphasizes the need for self-
awareness and reflective capacity to combat bias and racism.
Furthermore, working with existing subject-matter experts and collaborating with existing
workgroups that have been focusing exclusively on IECMH since 2019, is imperative in moving
this work forward with common goals, objectives, shared language and vision. DMH has
convened the IECMH Policy Workgroup and IECMH Integration into Primary Care Workgroup
and MSPCC/Children’s Mental Health Campaign have facilitated an IECMH Advocacy Workgroup
since 2019. A new IECMH Strategic Plan from these groups is currently in the process of being
developed and should be taken in to account, alongside these recommendations.
CBH Advisory Council Focus Areas:
1. Promotion & Prevention: Increase awareness and education about the importance of
infant and early childhood mental health and early relational health starting prenatally
and explore and collaborate with the Office of Behavioral Health Promotion and
Prevention on these goals.
2. Intervention & Treatment: Address issues with cost, access and long waitlists, when
looking for providers who specialize in serving this age-range. Increase awareness and
destigmatization of mental health needs in young children (10-14% of children meet
criteria for diagnosis in 3-5 age range) and train-up the workforce in developmental,
relational, 2-generational (caregiver-child), and culturally responsive screening,
assessment, and intervention models.
3. Collaboration Across Sector Providers: Stride towards a common language and shared
understanding when talking about IECMH for all systems that work with families and
young children. Incentivize best practices that include warm handoffs and closed-loop
referrals between healthcare, education, and social service sectors.
4. Workforce Development: Enhance the whole workforce by providing training on IECMH
competencies across diverse roles and professions and incorporate IECMH into core
training curricula for all professionals touching the lives of young children and families.
CBH Advisory Council IECMH Recommendations:
Support and enhance a Diverse Workforce: Ensure that all recommendations prioritize building
a diverse, linguistic, and culturally competent workforce, capable of serving families in their
native languages, reducing reliance on interpreter services. In order to prevent burnout and
losing the workforce, we need to provide reflective spaces, realistic caseloads, and adequate
pay. We need to revise licensing requirements and find pathways for bilingual, bicultural
providers with degrees from other countries, to be able to get licensed and practice in the
Massachusetts.
Address Equity Challenges: We strive to recognize the impact of racial trauma and systemic
oppression on access to care, over and mis diagnosis of BIPOC children and center on the
10

Diversity-Informed Tenets and family voice. Focus on policies that create safe communities that
are more supportive and uplifting for families, as system and community changes can greatly
impact the health and well-being of its individuals. Understand the trauma related to foster care
and invest in prevention and promotion programs that offer more stable and long-term
placements, preferably with family members, frequent visitations with biological family that do
not burden the caregiver with cost and transportation and provides resources and parenting
support to biological and foster families alike (see Infant-Toddler Court Programs).
Include Lived Experience and Cultural Brokers: Incorporate individuals with lived experience
and cultural brokers in policy discussions and decision-making processes to foster informed and
culturally responsive initiatives. Another area of opportunity is to look more into practice-based
evidence vs evidenced-based practice, as these tend to be standardized without a diverse
representation of the population and cultures.
The early years are crucial for a healthy development and life trajectory. In order for a child to
grow into their full potential, they need to be held in safe, supportive, and empowering
relationships, not only by their caregivers, but also by their educators, service providers and
communities. Investing in early childhood is investing in the children of today, but also in the
adults of tomorrow, who in turn, will also become the caregivers of the future. With this mind,
these are some of the recommendations from the CBHAC members:
1. Policy and Systematic Changes
• Find pathways for sustainable funding streams for IECMH initiatives to be created
and expanded, particularly those that are typically not reimbursable or are sustained
by federal grants and explore strategies that would facilitate braided funding and
expand promotion and preventive service billing.
• Investments in addressing social determinants of (mental) health can produce better
outcomes and decrease spending in more intensive services downstream.
• Expand on existing efforts so there is access to more widespread prevention and
promotion services. For example, expand the Medicaid Prevention and Promotion
Memo to allow individual services to be provided in schools and in the community,
not just in primary care and allow promotion services to be provided without a
positive screening tool.
• Encourage private insurance to cover prevention and promotion services, particularly
in prenatal and early childhood services.
• Ensure consistency on how social-emotional needs qualify children for IEP or 504
plans, especially when transitioning from Early Intervention into the Public School
System, so supportive services are not lost at this crucial developmental stage.
• Reevaluate payment structures, exploring ways to compensate a highly specialized
workforce, for time spent in specialized training, for time spent providing/receiving
reflective supervision, and for time consulting with care team and providing high-
quality care coordination.
11

2. Increase Public Awareness
• Invest in public awareness campaigns that promote the important of early
relationships starting at the prenatal stage, both in the medical and community
settings, and destigmatize mental health needs of young children.
• Increase early screening practices both for the caregivers (starting prenatally) and
the baby/child.
• Educate caregivers and professionals about the importance of early identification
and intervention and promoting awareness of available resources.
• Expand and create universal approaches and 2- generation model, in which both
children and caregivers are screened for social-emotional needs while provided with
in-home supports around parenting, child development, and relational health.
• Ensure sustainability, funding and reimbursement for prevention and promotion
services.
3. Increase Access to Services7
• Expand integration of IECMH practices within primary care, pediatric settings, Ob-
Gyn offices, as well as at the community mental health level, to ensure early
identification and a 2-generation model of support. This includes increasing the
number of SUD recovery programs that allow children to be with their parents, while
providing a 2-generational approach to care.
• Incentivize co-located maternal and child health care models and flexibility of times
and locations of services to meet families where they are.
• Develop strategies that offer Occupational Therapy, Physical Therapy and Speech and
Language Therapy services within a Behavioral Health model, offering more
opportunity for coordination and a continuum of services delivered.
• Ensure IECMH expertise in existing referral, family support, clinical and crisis support
services for babies, toddlers, and their families and infuse IECMH principles in adult
services when they are also caregivers to young children.
• Promote the utilization of the DC: 0-5 assessment, crosswalk and billing codes when
working with children under the age of 6, which is already recommended as a best
practice by MassHealth.
• Create efficient communication and engagement with professionals to ensure
awareness of changes, opportunities and resources, like the Medicaid Prevention
and Promotion Memo that could be used to expand access for infants and young
children.
• Foster community involvement and family voice in planning and implementing
IECMH services to ensure they meet local needs and cultural contexts.
7 MSPCC is currently engaged in an IECMH systems mapping.
12

4. Well-Trained and Diverse Workforce
• Commit to a diverse and well-trained and supported workforce by creating
sustainable funding for ongoing professional development and training
opportunities, as well as ongoing communities of practice that can support IECMH
professionals.
• Train the entire workforce that delivers services to young children and their families
in culturally responsive, developmentally appropriate, trauma-informed and
relationship-based principles and competencies and models. This applies to home
visitors, peer professionals, shelter staff, educators, etc., not only clinicians.
• Sustainable funding and resources to have systems integrate the internationally
recognized Endorsement for Culturally Sensitive, Relationship-Focused Practice
Promoting Infant and Early Childhood Mental Health® competencies needed for
credentialing, that equip professionals with the skills needed to deliver IECMH
services across various fields (e.g., healthcare, education, social services, home-
visiting, etc.). In MA, MassAIMH Endorsement® credential has been implemented
since 2019.
• Develop and support access to training, billing and use of reflective practice and/or
supervision.
• Collaborate with Higher Education to infuse IECMH into social work and mental
health programs, so students graduate ready to work with younger children.
5. Centralized Coordination Hubs
• Revisit the possibility of establishing IECMH regional central hubs or centers of
excellence for coordinating services across sectors involved in early childhood, that
can facilitate seamless transitions and referrals through standardized protocols and
shared information systems, while providing individualized and supportive care
coordination and create a continuum of care for IECMH services.
• Explore the possibility of expanding current services, like Family Resource Centers,
that address the entire family and social determinants of health but are isolated
from other systems, not specialized in early childhood needs or have the capacity for
individualized high-quality and supportive care coordination.
By adopting a DEI lens and focusing on early relational health, the recommendations aim to
enhance the accessibility, quality, and equity of IECMH services. These actions can mitigate the
overdiagnosis and misdiagnosis of BIPOC children, improve early intervention outcomes, and
build a more diverse and culturally sensitive workforce capable of addressing the needs of
families. Through coordinated efforts and shared commitment, Massachusetts can lead the way
in promoting mental health from infancy through early childhood, ensuring that every child and
family receives the support they need to thrive. At the same time, it is essential to recognize
and fairly compensate the professionals who work with young children and families every day.
