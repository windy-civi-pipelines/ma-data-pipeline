1 Chapter 150E of the General Laws is hereby amended by adding the following section:-
2 Section 16. (a) For the purposes of this section the following words shall, unless the
3 context clearly requires otherwise, have the following meanings:
4 “Political matters”, matters relating to elections for political office, political parties,
5 proposals to change legislation, proposals to change regulation and the decision to join or
6 support any political party or political, civic, community, fraternal or labor organization.
7 “Religious matters”, matters relating to religious affiliation and practice and the decision
8 to join or support any religious organization or association.
9 (b) Except as provided in subsections (c) and (d) of this section, any employer, including

11 threatens to subject any employee to discipline or discharge on account of:
1 of 3

12 (i) the exercise by such employee of rights guaranteed by the first amendment to the
13 United States Constitution; provided, that such activity does not substantially or materially
14 interfere with the employee's bona fide job performance or the working relationship between the
15 employee and the employer, shall be liable to such employee for damages caused by such
16 discipline or discharge, including punitive damages and for reasonable attorney's fees as part of
17 the costs of any such action for damages; or
18 (ii) such employee's refusal to: (A) attend an employer sponsored meeting with the
19 employer or its agent, representative or designee, the primary purpose of which is to
20 communicate the employer's opinion concerning religious or political matters or (B) listen to
21 speech or view communications, the primary purpose of which is to communicate the employer's
22 opinion concerning religious or political matters, shall be liable to such employee for the full
23 amount of gross loss of wages or compensation, with costs and such reasonable attorney's fees as
24 may be allowed by the court. If the court determines that such action for damages was brought
25 without substantial justification, the court may award costs and reasonable attorney's fees to the
26 employer.
