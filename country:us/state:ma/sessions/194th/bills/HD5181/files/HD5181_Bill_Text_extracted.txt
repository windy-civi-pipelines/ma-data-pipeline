I. INTRODUCTION
The purpose of this report is to review and identify the most recent advances in services and
research on variations in case management in mental health practice. This report is filed in
accordance with a legislative directive included in the Fiscal Year 2026 Appropriations Act
(Chapter 9 of the Acts of 2025), line-item 5011-0100, which requires the Department of Mental
Health (DMH) “…not less than 90 days prior to a change in the case management delivery
model, the department of mental health shall submit a report and a catalogue of best practices for
publicly-operated case management services to the house and senate committees on ways and
means, the joint committee on health care financing and the joint committee on mental health,
substance use and recovery.”
DMH’s current case management delivery model has been in existence for several decades.
During this time, the field of behavioral health has advanced tremendously with greater focus on
research and the development of evidence-based treatments and interventions. Case management
is a valued and important DMH service, as further highlighted within this report, and DMH is
adjusting its case management delivery model to align with current evidence on best practice,
that address the unique challenges of individuals who often present with comorbidity and social
determinants of health. This evidence supports DMH’s plan to adjust its case management to a
more flexible, critical needs approach to improve health outcomes for the individuals and
families DMH serves. The model is designed to facilitate greater engagement with individuals
and families at critical transitions in care and at times when individuals need support the most.
This report includes a summary description of case management services, including traditional
case management, other best practice service delivery models, and case management models
utilized at DMH.
II. CASE MANAGEMENT OVERVIEW
Case management has emerged as an intervention designed to support individuals and their
families, particularly those navigating complex health and service needs, in obtaining rapid, easy
access to healthcare and to other resources and supports from difficult to navigate and often
fragmented systems of medical and psychosocial services.
The Case Management Society of America defines Case Management as “the collaborative
process of assessment, planning, facilitation, care coordination, evaluation and advocacy for
options and services to meet an individual’s and family’s comprehensive health needs.”1
Case management is intended to improve health outcomes, optimize use of available resources
based on individual needs, and reduce use of high-cost services through timely access to
effective support and services.

Purpose of Case Management:
• To improve client outcomes:
By ensuring access to appropriate services, case management can help individuals
improve their mental health, develop skills, and achieve their goals.
• To reduce hospitalizations:
By providing support in the community, case management can help prevent
unnecessary hospitalizations and support individuals' recovery.
• To improve quality of life:
By addressing the client's overall needs, case management can help individuals lead
more fulfilling and independent lives.
• To enhance recovery:
By providing the necessary support, resources, and tools, case management aims to
assist individuals in their recovery from mental health challenges.
• To promote social reintegration:
By helping individuals access resources and build skills, case management can support
their reintegration into the community.

III. PRIMARY MODELS OF CASE MANAGEMENT
As Case Management has been deployed across care settings to meet the needs of diverse
populations, variations have emerged with regard to the scope of services provided (stand-alone
case vs team-based clinical; short-term vs extended), the intensity (e.g. daily, weekly), and
duration (e.g. one month, multiple months, multiple years)

Section 11:
1. Standard Case Management (SCM)
Traditional psychiatric case management, also known as brokerage case
management, focuses on assessing needs, making referrals to appropriate services, and
coordinating and monitoring ongoing treatment. It involves linking clients to necessary
resources, developing care plans, and ensuring effective support.

Section 12:
2. Critical Time Intervention
Critical Time Intervention (CTI) is a time-limited, intensive case management approach
focused on supporting individuals with serious mental illness during critical transitions. It
2 De Vet R, Van Luijtelaar MJA, Brilleslijper-Kater SN, Vanderplasschen W, Beijersbergen M, Wolf J. Effectiveness of case
management for homeless persons: A systematic review. Am J Public Health. 2013;103(10):e13-e26.
2
aims to prevent homelessness and other negative outcomes by providing targeted support and
connecting individuals to needed services and resources. CTI is often used for individuals
transitioning from inpatient psychiatric settings, correctional facilities, highly structured
residential care to independent living, or from homelessness to housing. CTI approaches
includes drop-in or open access options.

Section 13:
3. Intensive Case Management (see DMH ACCS services and/or MassHealth BHCP)
Intensive Case Management (ICM) consists of management of the mental health problem and
the rehabilitation and social support needs of the person concerned, over an indefinite period of
time, by a team of people who have a small group of clients (fewer than 20). ICM aims to help
people with severe mental illness acquire material resources (such as food, shelter, clothing,
and medical care) and to improve their psychosocial functioning; to provide sufficient
support to help the individual to be engaged in community life and to encourage growth
towards greater autonomy; to develop coping skills to meet the demands of community life;
and to ensure continuity of care among treatment agencies. People are seen 1-3 times per
week over an indefinite period of time; and the range of services are provided through a
collaborative approach with other community providers rather than through the one team. Twenty-
four-hour help is offered, and clients are seen in a non-clinical setting.

Section 14:
4. Assertive Community Treatment (PACT, PACT-Y)
Assertive Community Treatment (ACT) is an intensive, community-based service delivery
model for individuals with serious mental illness who have difficulty engaging in traditional
outpatient treatment. It involves a multidisciplinary team providing comprehensive,
individualized, and integrated psychiatric treatment, rehabilitation, and support services in
the community (see Appendix B for more information).
Evidence for Positive Impact of Case Management:
The extent of the outcomes varies across different studies and models of case management, depending
on individual program design/factors.

Key Features of CTI:
• Time-limited:
CTI interventions are typically focused on a specific time period, often 3-9 months,
with a clear plan for transitioning to ongoing supports.
• Intensive:
CTI involves frequent contact and support, including home visits and collaboration with
other professionals and support networks.
• Focused:
CTI prioritizes addressing the most critical needs related to the transition, such as
housing, employment, and access to mental health services.
• Community-based:
CTI emphasizes connecting individuals to community resources and building their
support network, including family, friends, and community organizations.
• Phased Approach:
CTI often uses a phased approach to intervention, with each phase focusing on specific
goals and activities.
How CTI Helps Individuals:
• Stable Housing:
Supports individuals in securing and maintaining stable housing, which is a critical
factor in their recovery.
• Access to Services:
Helps individuals access and navigate mental health services, primary care, and other
support services.
• Increased Independence:
Empowers individuals to develop the skills and resources they need to live
independently and manage their own lives.
• Improved Relationships:
Strengthens connections with family, friends, and community organizations, which can
be a source of support and encouragement.
• Reduced Relapse:
Through intensive support during critical transitions, CTI can help reduce the risk of
relapses and other negative outcomes.
Drop-In Case Management (Open Access)
Drop-in case management, also known as Open Access case management, is a variation of
Critical Time Intervention which aims to make support more accessible and responsive to the
needs of individuals seeking help. Drop-in case management has emerged in response to
challenges hard-to-reach communities (e.g., drug users, people living with HIV, people from
sexual minority communities, asylum seekers, refugees, people from ethnocultural communities,
and homeless people) face when seeking needed care and support and, as a result, are often
alienated from health and social services. Open Access offers vital case management services
without formal intake or pre-screening, allowing individuals to access support based on their

immediate needs. It focuses on building connections, offering assistance, and ensuring
individuals have access to necessary resources without the need for extensive paperwork or
lengthy wait times.
Key Features of Drop-In Case Management:
• Open Access: Individuals can access services without formal intake processes.
• Immediate Support: Services are readily available to address immediate needs.
• Flexibility: Focuses on adapting to the individual's needs and circumstances.
• Building Connections: Emphasis on forming strong relationships with individuals and
building trust.
• Resource Navigation: Helping individuals navigate the complex systems of support and
access resources.
Benefits of Drop-In Case Management:
• Increased Accessibility: Reduces barriers to accessing services, making support more
readily available.
• Improved Engagement: Allows individuals to engage with services when they are ready
and able.
• Reduced Wait Times: Eliminates the need for extended waiting periods for services.
• Personalized Support: Allows case managers to tailor services to the individual's
specific needs.
How Drop-In Case Management Work
• Initial Contact: Individuals can approach a drop-in center or service provider without
a formal appointment.
• Needs Assessment: A case manager or other staff member assesses the individual's
needs and circumstances.
• Service Provision: Case managers provide immediate support, connect individuals
with resources, and develop a service plan if needed.
• Ongoing Support: Case managers offer ongoing support and guidance as needed.

Case Management is both a core service for Massachusetts Department of Mental Health and is a
critical component of Massachusetts behavioral health community services, some of which are
directly overseen by DMH. People seeking DMH services typically experience challenges in addition
to their severe mental illness because of factors like poverty, food insecurity, housing insecurity,
systemic stigma and complexity of their condition. DMH service users often require dedicated or
team-based case management to collaborate and coordinate with many other care providers and
supports, to address needs including personal care, housekeeping, rent supplements/subsidies, assistance
with food, and more. DMH Case Management services are long standing and well-established.
Consistent with the DMH mission to facilitate access and reduce barriers to services, DMH

continuously engages in a continuous quality improvement process and over time DMH has
implemented the full continuum of Case Management models across child, youth and family
services.

APPENDIX A
6 Key Elements of all Case Management models:

Section 25:
1. Intake (engagement)

Section 26:
2. Needs assessments are crucial for understanding a client's unique challenges and goals,
and for developing a tailored plan of care. They involve gathering information to identify
the gaps between the client's current situation and their desired outcomes, often focusing
on areas like mental health, housing, employment, and social support.
Purpose:
Needs assessments help case managers identify specific areas where clients need
assistance, understand the reasons for those needs, and develop a plan to address
them.
Focus Areas:
In psychiatric case management, needs assessments typically cover a wide range of
areas, including:
• Mental Health: This includes identifying the severity, type, and specific
symptoms of a client's mental health condition, as well as their access to and
satisfaction with mental health services.
• Housing: Assessing the client's living situation, including the stability and
safety of their housing, and identifying needs related to housing supports like
finding affordable housing or accessing transitional housing.
• Employment: Evaluating the client's employment history, skills, and training
needs, and identifying resources to help them find and maintain employment.
• Social Support: Assessing the client's social network, support systems, and the
availability of informal support, as well as identifying the need for formal
support services like therapy or peer support groups.
• Other Needs: Needs assessments may also address other critical areas like
financial needs, transportation, education, legal issues, and substance use.
Methods:
Various methods can be used to conduct needs assessments, including:
• Direct Interviews: Talking to the client directly to gather information about
their experiences, challenges, and goals.
• Client Records: Reviewing existing client records, such as medical records,
court documents, or previous case management reports.
• Referrals: Gathering information from other professionals or agencies that have
worked with the client.
• Surveys: Administering standardized questionnaires to assess specific areas of
need.
• Assessments: Using standardized tools to assess the client's mental health status
or other relevant areas.
9
Impact on Case Management:
A comprehensive needs assessment forms the foundation for developing a
personalized and effective case management plan. It helps case managers:
• Set Realistic Goals: By understanding the client's specific needs and resources,
case managers can help them set realistic and achievable goals.
• Develop a Tailored Plan: The needs assessment informs the development of a
case management plan that addresses the client's unique needs and challenges.
• Access Appropriate Resources: Case managers can identify and connect
clients with the appropriate resources and services to meet their needs.
• Monitor Progress and Evaluate Outcomes: Needs assessments can be used as
a baseline to track progress and evaluate the effectiveness of the case
management plan.

Section 27:
3. Care planning along with goal setting:
Developing a personalized plan that outlines the services and supports needed to meet
the client's goals.

Section 28:
4. Plan implementation (linkage to services):
Connecting clients with appropriate resources, such as therapists, psychiatrists, support
groups, and community services.

Section 29:
5. Monitoring and Evaluation
Regularly tracking progress, adjusting the care plan as needed, and ensuring the client
is receiving effective support.

Section 30:
6. Client advocacy
Client advocacy is an integral element of a case manager's practice and is considered a
critical function. Case managers, for example, assist clients in gaining access to necessary
health care services, speak for themselves and own their voice, advocate for their rights,
participate in making decisions about their care options, gain awareness of their health
insurance benefits, and become empowered as owners of their health status and well-
being.

APPENDIX B
Assertive Community Treatment Case Management
Assertive Community Treatment (ACT) is an intensive, community-based service delivery
model for individuals with serious mental illness who have difficulty engaging in traditional
outpatient treatment. It involves a multidisciplinary team providing comprehensive,
individualized, and integrated psychiatric treatment, rehabilitation, and support services in the
community.
Key Features of Assertive Community Treatment:

Section 31:
1. Intensive and Assertive:
ACT teams are proactive in their outreach and engagement, actively working
with individuals in their homes and communities.

Section 32:
2. Multidisciplinary:
Teams typically include psychiatrists, nurses, social workers, case managers,
and other professionals with expertise in mental health, substance use, and other
related areas.

Section 33:
3. Community-Based:
Services are delivered in the community rather than in a traditional hospital or
clinic setting, allowing individuals to maintain their independence and integrate
into their lives.

Section 34:
4. Holistic and Individualized:
ACT services address a wide range of needs, including mental health treatment,
housing, financial assistance, vocational support, and social integration.

Section 35:
5. Focus on Recovery:
ACT emphasizes a person-centered, recovery-based approach, aiming to help
individuals regain control over their lives and achieve their personal goals.
How Assertive Community Treatment Works:

Section 36:
1. Assessment and Planning:
Individuals are assessed to determine their needs and goals, and a treatment plan
is developed that is tailored to their individual circumstances.

Section 37:
2. Service Delivery:
The ACT team provides a range of services, including medication management,
counseling, crisis intervention, and support for housing, employment, and social
activities.

Section 38:
3. Follow-Up and Monitoring:
ACT teams actively monitor individuals' progress and provide ongoing support,
ensuring that they remain engaged in treatment and maintain their stability.

Section 39:
4. Collaboration and Communication:
ACT teams work closely with other professionals, such as primary care
physicians, social workers, and vocational rehabilitation counselors, to provide a
coordinated and comprehensive approach to care.
Benefits of Assertive Community Treatment:

Section 40:
1. Reduced Hospitalization Rates:
ACT has been shown to reduce the need for psychiatric hospitalization by
providing intensive, community-based support.
11

Section 41:
2. Improved Quality of Life:
ACT can help individuals with serious mental illness improve their functioning
in various areas of life, including housing, employment, and social relationships.

Section 42:
3. Increased Engagement in Treatment:
ACT's assertive outreach and personalized approach can help individuals who
struggle to engage in traditional outpatient treatment remain connected to
services.

Section 43:
4. Reduced Stigma and Isolation:
ACT's community-based approach helps individuals feel less stigmatized and
isolated, promoting their sense of belonging and well-being.
Who is Assertive Community Treatment for?
ACT is typically offered to individuals with serious mental illness who have a history of
frequent hospitalizations, difficulties engaging in traditional treatment, and high service
needs. It can also be a beneficial option for individuals who are at risk of hospitalization,
those who have recently been discharged from an inpatient setting, or those who are
struggling to maintain their independence in the community.

I. INTRODUCTION
The purpose of this report is to review and identify the most recent advances in services and
research on variations in case management in mental health practice. This report is filed in
accordance with a legislative directive included in the Fiscal Year 2026 Appropriations Act
(Chapter 9 of the Acts of 2025), line-item 5011-0100, which requires the Department of Mental
Health (DMH) “…not less than 90 days prior to a change in the case management delivery
model, the department of mental health shall submit a report and a catalogue of best practices for
publicly-operated case management services to the house and senate committees on ways and
means, the joint committee on health care financing and the joint committee on mental health,
substance use and recovery.”
DMH’s current case management delivery model has been in existence for several decades.
During this time, the field of behavioral health has advanced tremendously with greater focus on
research and the development of evidence-based treatments and interventions. Case management
is a valued and important DMH service, as further highlighted within this report, and DMH is
adjusting its case management delivery model to align with current evidence on best practice,

the rehabilitation and social support needs of the person concerned, over an indefinite period of
time, by a team of people who have a small group of clients (fewer than 20). ICM aims to help
people with severe mental illness acquire material resources (such as food, shelter, clothing,
and medical care) and to improve their psychosocial functioning; to provide sufficient
support to help the individual to be engaged in community life and to encourage growth
towards greater autonomy; to develop coping skills to meet the demands of community life;
and to ensure continuity of care among treatment agencies. People are seen 1-3 times per
week over an indefinite period of time; and the range of services are provided through a
collaborative approach with other community providers rather than through the one team. Twenty-
four-hour help is offered, and clients are seen in a non-clinical setting.
4. Assertive Community Treatment (PACT, PACT-Y)
Assertive Community Treatment (ACT) is an intensive, community-based service delivery
model for individuals with serious mental illness who have difficulty engaging in traditional
outpatient treatment. It involves a multidisciplinary team providing comprehensive,
individualized, and integrated psychiatric treatment, rehabilitation, and support services in
the community (see Appendix B for more information).
Evidence for Positive Impact of Case Management:
The extent of the outcomes varies across different studies and models of case management, depending
on individual program design/factors.
1. Case management in Primary Care for frequent users of health care services was
associated with improvement in:
1. self-management skills,
2. care plan adherence,
3. satisfaction,
4. self-reported health status,
5. perceived quality of life.3
2. Case management for individuals experiencing homelessness is associated with:
• increased housing stability,
• increased engagement in medical and non- medical services,

• improved mental health status,
• improved quality of life,
• reduced use of drug and alcohol,
• reduced use of high-cost health system services.4
3. Individuals receiving Intensive Case Management (ICM) experienced reductions in
• substance use over 12 months,
• psychiatric symptoms over 12 months,
• number of days homeless,
• emergency department (ED) visits,
• length of hospitalization.5
4. For frequent ED users experiencing homelessness, Critical Time Intervention (CTI) was
successful in reducing:

• length of hospitalization.6
5. Team based drop-in case management was associated with
• Reduction in ED visits for individuals with complex behavioral health and medical
needs,7
• Reduced levels of psychological distress and substance abuse and improved social
situation for street children and youth,8
• Greater ease accessing emergency shelter when needed, attainment of permanent
supportive housing, and GED completion.9

Key Features of CTI:
• Time-limited:
CTI interventions are typically focused on a specific time period, often 3-9 months,
with a clear plan for transitioning to ongoing supports.
• Intensive:
CTI involves frequent contact and support, including home visits and collaboration with
other professionals and support networks.
• Focused:
CTI prioritizes addressing the most critical needs related to the transition, such as
housing, employment, and access to mental health services.
• Community-based:
CTI emphasizes connecting individuals to community resources and building their
support network, including family, friends, and community organizations.
• Phased Approach:
CTI often uses a phased approach to intervention, with each phase focusing on specific
goals and activities.
How CTI Helps Individuals:
• Stable Housing:
Supports individuals in securing and maintaining stable housing, which is a critical
factor in their recovery.
• Access to Services:
Helps individuals access and navigate mental health services, primary care, and other
support services.
• Increased Independence:
Empowers individuals to develop the skills and resources they need to live
independently and manage their own lives.
• Improved Relationships:
Strengthens connections with family, friends, and community organizations, which can
be a source of support and encouragement.
• Reduced Relapse:
Through intensive support during critical transitions, CTI can help reduce the risk of
relapses and other negative outcomes.
Drop-In Case Management (Open Access)
Drop-in case management, also known as Open Access case management, is a variation of
Critical Time Intervention which aims to make support more accessible and responsive to the
needs of individuals seeking help. Drop-in case management has emerged in response to
challenges hard-to-reach communities (e.g., drug users, people living with HIV, people from
sexual minority communities, asylum seekers, refugees, people from ethnocultural communities,
and homeless people) face when seeking needed care and support and, as a result, are often
alienated from health and social services. Open Access offers vital case management services
without formal intake or pre-screening, allowing individuals to access support based on their

individuals have access to necessary resources without the need for extensive paperwork or
lengthy wait times.
Key Features of Drop-In Case Management:
• Open Access: Individuals can access services without formal intake processes.
• Immediate Support: Services are readily available to address immediate needs.
• Flexibility: Focuses on adapting to the individual's needs and circumstances.
• Building Connections: Emphasis on forming strong relationships with individuals and
building trust.
• Resource Navigation: Helping individuals navigate the complex systems of support and
access resources.
Benefits of Drop-In Case Management:
• Increased Accessibility: Reduces barriers to accessing services, making support more
readily available.
• Improved Engagement: Allows individuals to engage with services when they are ready
and able.
• Reduced Wait Times: Eliminates the need for extended waiting periods for services.
• Personalized Support: Allows case managers to tailor services to the individual's
specific needs.
How Drop-In Case Management Work
• Initial Contact: Individuals can approach a drop-in center or service provider without
a formal appointment.
• Needs Assessment: A case manager or other staff member assesses the individual's
needs and circumstances.
• Service Provision: Case managers provide immediate support, connect individuals
with resources, and develop a service plan if needed.
• Ongoing Support: Case managers offer ongoing support and guidance as needed.

Case Management is both a core service for Massachusetts Department of Mental Health and is a
critical component of Massachusetts behavioral health community services, some of which are
directly overseen by DMH. People seeking DMH services typically experience challenges in addition
to their severe mental illness because of factors like poverty, food insecurity, housing insecurity,
systemic stigma and complexity of their condition. DMH service users often require dedicated or
team-based case management to collaborate and coordinate with many other care providers and
supports, to address needs including personal care, housekeeping, rent supplements/subsidies, assistance
with food, and more. DMH Case Management services are long standing and well-established.
Consistent with the DMH mission to facilitate access and reduce barriers to services, DMH

APPENDIX A
6 Key Elements of all Case Management models:
1. Intake (engagement)
2. Needs assessments are crucial for understanding a client's unique challenges and goals,
and for developing a tailored plan of care. They involve gathering information to identify
the gaps between the client's current situation and their desired outcomes, often focusing
on areas like mental health, housing, employment, and social support.
Purpose:
Needs assessments help case managers identify specific areas where clients need
assistance, understand the reasons for those needs, and develop a plan to address
them.
Focus Areas:
In psychiatric case management, needs assessments typically cover a wide range of
areas, including:
• Mental Health: This includes identifying the severity, type, and specific
symptoms of a client's mental health condition, as well as their access to and
satisfaction with mental health services.
• Housing: Assessing the client's living situation, including the stability and
safety of their housing, and identifying needs related to housing supports like
finding affordable housing or accessing transitional housing.
• Employment: Evaluating the client's employment history, skills, and training
needs, and identifying resources to help them find and maintain employment.
• Social Support: Assessing the client's social network, support systems, and the
availability of informal support, as well as identifying the need for formal
support services like therapy or peer support groups.
• Other Needs: Needs assessments may also address other critical areas like
financial needs, transportation, education, legal issues, and substance use.
Methods:
Various methods can be used to conduct needs assessments, including:
• Direct Interviews: Talking to the client directly to gather information about
their experiences, challenges, and goals.
• Client Records: Reviewing existing client records, such as medical records,
court documents, or previous case management reports.
• Referrals: Gathering information from other professionals or agencies that have
worked with the client.
• Surveys: Administering standardized questionnaires to assess specific areas of
need.
• Assessments: Using standardized tools to assess the client's mental health status
or other relevant areas.
9

Impact on Case Management:
A comprehensive needs assessment forms the foundation for developing a
personalized and effective case management plan. It helps case managers:
• Set Realistic Goals: By understanding the client's specific needs and resources,
case managers can help them set realistic and achievable goals.
• Develop a Tailored Plan: The needs assessment informs the development of a
case management plan that addresses the client's unique needs and challenges.
• Access Appropriate Resources: Case managers can identify and connect
clients with the appropriate resources and services to meet their needs.
• Monitor Progress and Evaluate Outcomes: Needs assessments can be used as
a baseline to track progress and evaluate the effectiveness of the case
management plan.
3. Care planning along with goal setting:
Developing a personalized plan that outlines the services and supports needed to meet
the client's goals.
4. Plan implementation (linkage to services):
Connecting clients with appropriate resources, such as therapists, psychiatrists, support
groups, and community services.
5. Monitoring and Evaluation
Regularly tracking progress, adjusting the care plan as needed, and ensuring the client
is receiving effective support.
6. Client advocacy
Client advocacy is an integral element of a case manager's practice and is considered a
critical function. Case managers, for example, assist clients in gaining access to necessary
health care services, speak for themselves and own their voice, advocate for their rights,
participate in making decisions about their care options, gain awareness of their health
insurance benefits, and become empowered as owners of their health status and well-
being.

APPENDIX B
Assertive Community Treatment Case Management
Assertive Community Treatment (ACT) is an intensive, community-based service delivery
model for individuals with serious mental illness who have difficulty engaging in traditional
outpatient treatment. It involves a multidisciplinary team providing comprehensive,
individualized, and integrated psychiatric treatment, rehabilitation, and support services in the
community.
Key Features of Assertive Community Treatment:
1. Intensive and Assertive:
ACT teams are proactive in their outreach and engagement, actively working
with individuals in their homes and communities.
2. Multidisciplinary:
Teams typically include psychiatrists, nurses, social workers, case managers,
and other professionals with expertise in mental health, substance use, and other
related areas.
3. Community-Based:
Services are delivered in the community rather than in a traditional hospital or
clinic setting, allowing individuals to maintain their independence and integrate
into their lives.
4. Holistic and Individualized:
ACT services address a wide range of needs, including mental health treatment,
housing, financial assistance, vocational support, and social integration.
5. Focus on Recovery:
ACT emphasizes a person-centered, recovery-based approach, aiming to help
individuals regain control over their lives and achieve their personal goals.
How Assertive Community Treatment Works:
1. Assessment and Planning:
Individuals are assessed to determine their needs and goals, and a treatment plan
is developed that is tailored to their individual circumstances.
2. Service Delivery:
The ACT team provides a range of services, including medication management,
counseling, crisis intervention, and support for housing, employment, and social
activities.
3. Follow-Up and Monitoring:
ACT teams actively monitor individuals' progress and provide ongoing support,
ensuring that they remain engaged in treatment and maintain their stability.
4. Collaboration and Communication:
ACT teams work closely with other professionals, such as primary care
physicians, social workers, and vocational rehabilitation counselors, to provide a
coordinated and comprehensive approach to care.
Benefits of Assertive Community Treatment:
1. Reduced Hospitalization Rates:
ACT has been shown to reduce the need for psychiatric hospitalization by
providing intensive, community-based support.
11

2. Improved Quality of Life:
ACT can help individuals with serious mental illness improve their functioning
in various areas of life, including housing, employment, and social relationships.
3. Increased Engagement in Treatment:
ACT's assertive outreach and personalized approach can help individuals who
struggle to engage in traditional outpatient treatment remain connected to
services.
4. Reduced Stigma and Isolation:
ACT's community-based approach helps individuals feel less stigmatized and
isolated, promoting their sense of belonging and well-being.
Who is Assertive Community Treatment for?
ACT is typically offered to individuals with serious mental illness who have a history of
frequent hospitalizations, difficulties engaging in traditional treatment, and high service
needs. It can also be a beneficial option for individuals who are at risk of hospitalization,
those who have recently been discharged from an inpatient setting, or those who are
struggling to maintain their independence in the community.
