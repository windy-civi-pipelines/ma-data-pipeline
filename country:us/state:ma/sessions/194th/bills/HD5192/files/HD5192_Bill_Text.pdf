Safe Drinking Water Act Assessment Program
Annual Report to the Massachusetts Legislature
Calendar Year 2024
31st Year of the Assessment Program
Introduction
Thirty-one years ago, the Massachusetts Legislature established the Safe Drinking Water Act
(SDWA) Assessment and a SDWA Assessment Advisory Committee to monitor the
Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection’s (MassDEP) Assessment Program. The
Advisory Committee is required to submit a yearly update to the legislature in the form of an
Annual Report.
The following Annual Report for calendar year 2024 provides an overview of the Assessment
Program and the Advisory Committee, and provides updates on several of MassDEP’s Drinking
Water Program (DWP) activities, including Lead Programs; the Water Smart Program;
Cybersecurity at Water Facilities; Per-and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS); Financial
Assistance Programs; the Surface Water Protection Program, and DWP’s new
Communication Hub.
The Safe Drinking Water Act Assessment Program
The Safe Drinking Water Act Assessment (Assessment) is paid each year by the 6.5 million
consumers of public water in Massachusetts and is collected by the more than 1,600 Public
Water Systems (PWS) across the state. The average cost to each consumer is 34 cents per year.
For the Fiscal Year (FY) 2024 billing cycle, the Assessment Program is expected to generate
over $2 million in revenue.
The Assessment revenue helps MassDEP’s Drinking Water Program manage and implement the
federal SDWA. The SDWA is implemented by MassDEP, including all enforcement
responsibilities, instead of by the federal government. Through the implementation of the SDWA
MassDEP ensures the safe production of drinking water at PWS while implementing state-
specific programs that save consumers millions of dollars. For example, the Water Quality
Monitoring Program saved consumers $4,712,914 in water quality monitoring costs for the last
monitoring cycle (2020-2022).
MassDEP is pleased to report that according to EPA statistics compiled for the fourth quarter of
2024, 97.2% of Community PWS met all applicable health-based standards and 90.9% of the
population served by Community PWS received drinking water that met all applicable health-
based standards.
The Safe Drinking Water Act Assessment Advisory Committee
1

In 1993, as part of the Assessment Program, the legislature formed a SDWA Assessment
Advisory Committee to:
• Recommend an annual Assessment rate to MassDEP’s Commissioner;
• Monitor the Assessment Program;
• Provide advice and recommendations on the Drinking Water Program’s technical and
compliance assistance and outreach programs to PWS and others;
• Produce an annual report to the legislature; and
• Conduct public meetings to discuss their work.
More information about the Committee is posted at https://www.mass.gov/service-details/safe-
drinking-water-act-assessment-advisory-committee-section-70-committee.
Assessment Program Rate Structure for FY26
Following the recommendation of the Advisory Committee, MassDEP has established the same
rate structure for FY26 as for FY25.
• $9.50 per million gallons of water used by PWS with meters;
Minimum bill for metered PWS is $50;
• Flat rate of $50 for unmetered PWS serving up to 101;
• Flat rate of $100 for unmetered PWS serving 101 through 200;
• Flat rate of $250 for unmetered PWS serving 201 through 899; and
• Unmetered PWS serving 900 or more pay a rate based on an average water use.
Drinking Water Program (DWP) Highlights for 2024
Lead and Copper Rule Revisions (LCCR)
All community (COM) and non-transient non-community (NTNC) public water systems in
Massachusetts that are required to comply with the Lead and Copper Rule (LCR) were required
to develop a Service Line Inventory (SLI) by October 16, 2024. This inventory must include
every service line that delivers water to water consumers within their system. The goal is to
identify all lead service lines still in use, which were installed before the U.S. banned lead
service lines. More information is posted at https://www.mass.gov/info-details/lead-and-copper-
rule-revisions.
Massachusetts consumers can learn more about the LCRR and its requirements, such as the
Service Line Inventory and how consumers will be notified if served by a service line that
contains or may contain lead by visiting https://www.mass.gov/info-details/consumers-
frequently-asked-questions-about-the-lcrr-service-line-inventory

Water-Smart offers eligible public and private schools and childcare facilities free and easy
drinking water lead testing, along with access to results, and solutions for elevated levels of lead.
After testing and consultation, participants will receive certification acknowledging that they
have tested their drinking water and taken any needed actions. Participants will also receive the
Water-Smart Seal of Approval to display at their school or facility. Water-Smart is funded
through the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Water Infrastructure Improvements for
the Nation (WIIN) Act Voluntary School and Child Care Lead Testing and Reduction Grant
Program and the Massachusetts Clean Water Trust and receives technical support from UMass
Amherst. More information, including a Story Map, is posted at https://www.mass.gov/water-
smart.
Cybersecurity Program
PWS may be targets for cyber-attacks that can disrupt public water supply operations and supply.
For cyber-related communication to PWS, the DWP uses the following tools:
• Routine Communication is provided to PWS on cybersecurity topics through
the biweekly “In The Main” electronic newsletter. There is a special section on
cybersecurity. More info here: https://www.mass.gov/info-details/in-the-
main#cybersecurity,-emergency-preparedness,-and-you!-
• Time-sensitive communications about emerging cybersecurity issues (e.g., national
alerts) are shared separately and on the same day of receipt of the communication via the
MassDEP/DWP Director email account.
• Direct emails for SDWA required notices including sanitary surveys, emergency
response and cyber inspection requirements.
• A cybersecurity resource hub to support PWS navigating cybersecurity challenges. The
purpose of this hub is to provide resources for public water systems to improve
cybersecurity defenses, mitigate cyber-attack risks, and enhance overall resiliency and
compliance: MassDEP Cybersecurity StoryMap
• MassDEP provides education materials and multiple training opportunities for PWS.
MassDEP hosts free webinars on topics such as basic cybersecurity, ransomware, and
incident response.
• Informational posters on various topics that are intended to be printed and posted at PWS
for continuous staff training. For example, Emergency Response for Public Water

Systems is available here: Click here: https://www.mass.gov/lists/emergency-response-
for-public-water systems.
• Self-paced online cybersecurity class for water and wastewater operators (offers one
training contact hour) https://classes.wateroperator.org/courses/cybersecurity
• Collaboration with other organizations for training, including the MassCyberCenter and
Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA).
• Technical assistance through several resources, including Technical Assistance Providers
(TAPS) and outside agencies (e.g., USEPA, CISA). TAPs are provided using USEPA
State Revolving Fund funding and our contracting partner, UMass Amherst:
https://www.mass.gov/info-details/public-water-system-capacity-development
Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS)
Public Water Suppliers (PWS)
• Currently there are 1,608 active PWS in the state of which 1,418 were required to test
for PFAS (have their own water source).
• 175 PWS (approx. 12%), including Community PWS, Non-transient Non-community
(NTNC) PWS, and Transient Non-community (TNC) PWS, detected PFAS6 above the
Maximum Contaminant Level of 20 ppt in one or more of their sources. TNCs are not
subject to the MCL but may require an individual health risk assessment depending on
the level of PFAS.
• 74 new water treatment facilities (WTFs) or additions to existing WTFs have been
constructed and activated by PWS since 2020 (temporary and permanent systems).
• 6 small PWS were connected to a municipal water system and declassified as PWS.
• PWS PFAS testing results are available to the public on the web in the EEA data portal.
Search under the chemical name: “PFAS6” or to see all the PFAS chemicals, search
under the contaminant group “PFAS”.
Federal PFAS MCLs
• On May 13, 2025, EPA announced changes to the National Primary Drinking Water
Regulations (NPDWR) and the Maximum Contaminant Levels (MCLs) for PFAS. EPA
announced it will keep the MCLs of 4 parts per trillion (ppt) for PFOA and PFOS that
were established in April 2024; however, EPA intends to rescind the regulations for
PFHxS, PFNA, HFPO-DA (commonly known as GenX), and the Hazard Index mixture
of these three compounds plus PFBS. EPA will provide additional time fr MCL
compliance, including a proposal to extend the compliance date from 2029 to 2031. EPA
plans to issue a proposed rule this fall and finalize this rule in the Spring of 2026.
• The vast majority of PFAS testing results in Massachusetts that have exceeded an EPA
MCL did so because the level of PFOS and/or PFOA exceeded 4 ppt. MassDEP does not
expect EPA’s rule proposal to significantly change the number of Public Water Suppliers
4

that will need to address PFAS by taking action such as installing treatment or using an
alternate source of drinking water.
• States are required to establish regulations that are no less stringent than the federal
standards within 2 years of the promulgation of the federal rule.
• Massachusetts will hold public hearings once EPA issues the new rule. In addition, PWS
should be preparing now to be in compliance with the MCLs when they take effect.
• The Massachusetts Drinking Water Regulations require that PWS have the technical,
managerial, and financial capacity to operate and maintain the system in compliance with
310 CMR 22.00, and each National Primary Drinking Water Regulation in effect at the
time and in the foreseeable future.

DWP's Surface Water Protection Program Turns 30
There are currently 76 Public Water Systems (PWS) in Massachusetts operating at least one
active reservoir and many with multiple active reservoirs. These PWS, which include the
Massachusetts Water Resources Authority (MWRA), serve a total population of 5.4 million. The
MWRA serves 2.6 million. The remaining 75 PWS serve 2.8 million.
In the mid-1990s, the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection's (MassDEP)
Drinking Water Program (DWP) was given a mandate by the Massachusetts legislature to
improve source water protection at public drinking water reservoirs.
A staff person was hired in the spring of 1995 to develop and implement a plan for
improvements and oversee its implementation. An internal advisory committee, composed of
MassDEP staff, and an external advisory committee, composed of public water suppliers, water
works associations, public health organizations, watershed groups and other state programs, were
formed.
In spring 2025 this program achieved 30 years of protecting surface water supplies. More
