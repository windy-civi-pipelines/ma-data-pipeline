In the One Hundred and Ninety-Fourth General Court
(2025-2026)

necessary for the immediate preservation of the public convenience.
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives in General Court assembled, and by the authority
of the same, as follows:
1 SECTION 1. Chapter 90 of the General Laws is hereby amended by adding the following

13 an Executive Order issued by the President of the United States and published in the Federal

15 “Tariff cost estimate”, a good-faith estimate of the increase, if any, in the price listed on
16 the Monroney label for a new motor vehicle that is directly or indirectly attributable to tariffs
17 imposed by the federal government, including tariffs on inputs used in the manufacture,
18 assembly or distribution of the vehicle.
19 (b) A manufacturer that ships a new motor vehicle for sale to a dealer in the
20 commonwealth shall affix to the vehicle a clear and conspicuous label presenting the tariff cost
21 estimate. Compliance with this subsection may be satisfied by inclusion of the tariff cost
22 estimate on the Monroney label or by a supplemental window label displayed immediately
23 adjacent to the Monroney label, to the maximum extent permitted by federal law and by posting
24 the tariff cost estimate on the manufacturer’s public facing website.
25 (c) A dealer shall not remove, obscure or alter the tariff cost estimate label prior to sale to
26 the retail purchaser.
27 (d) A manufacturer or dealer may rely in good faith on supplier or importer
28 documentation when preparing a tariff cost estimate. A good-faith estimate prepared in

40 promulgate regulations establishing: (i) a standardized method to calculate tariff cost estimates;
