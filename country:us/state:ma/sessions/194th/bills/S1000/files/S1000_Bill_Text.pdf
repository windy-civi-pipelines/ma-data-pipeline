44 governmental body.

46 statutory housing power to sell and an individual acquiring the premises subject to such a

138 statutory housing restriction. Such certificate shall be conclusive as to a mortgagee or other
139 person relying thereon and providing value to the owner within the affordable value or

146 and other lienholders according to the priority established by law, or such greater amount as is
147 payable under section 3 of chapter 244A, as to holders of conforming mortgages, the holder
148 alone shall be entitled to receive the difference between the affordable value of the statutory
149 housing premises immediately before termination, regardless of the remaining term of the
150 statutory housing restriction, and the fair market value of those premises immediately after
151 termination. Such amount shall be considered a first priority lien in the event that the statutory
152 housing restriction is terminated by judicial action in a bankruptcy proceeding.

154 power to sell shall not be subject to section 23 and sections 26 to 30, inclusive, of chapter 184

162 housing restriction, in addition to remaining restricted at the affordable value for eligible

165 housing restriction, and the statutory obligations of the holder to mortgagees holding conforming
166 mortgages, shall continue in effect, binding the statutory housing premises, and all other
167 provisions of the restriction shall be extinguished.

170 lienholder or its designee or by an entity eligible to be a holder of a statutory housing restriction,
171 pursuant to exercise of lawful remedies against the owner, shall not constitute a violation of the
172 statutory housing covenants or the statutory housing condition so long as the premises are being
173 held for resale to, and are resold to, an eligible household as statutory housing premises for an
174 amount not exceeding the affordable value or, in the case of a holder of a conforming mortgage,

340 mailed at least 14 days prior to the date of sale to each such person at the address of that person
341 as set forth in any document evidencing the interest or to the last address of such person known
342 to the holder. A person of record as of 30 days prior to the date of sale, holding an interest in the
343 property being foreclosed, may waive at any time, whether prior or subsequent to the date of
344 sale, the right to receive notice by mail under this section and such waiver shall constitute
345 compliance with this notice requirement for all purposes. If no newspaper is published in a town
346 or if there is no newspaper of general circulation published any such town where the statutory
347 housing premises are located, notice may be published in a newspaper published in the county in
348 which the statutory housing premises are located and this provision shall be implied in every
349 restriction containing the statutory housing power to sell in which it is not expressly set forth. A
350 newspaper which, by its title page, purports to be printed or published in such town, city or
351 county, and having a circulation therein, shall be sufficient for the purpose.
352 The following form of notice may be used and may be altered as circumstances require;
353 provided, however, that nothing herein shall be construed to prevent the use of other forms.

392 which will remain following such payment at sale, other than those included in the notice of sale,
393 which are not stated at the sale and included in the auctioneer's contract with the purchaser.
394 Exercise of the statutory housing power to sell may be by public auction or purchase as

413 mortgagees and other lienholders subordinate to the statutory housing restriction appearing of
414 record immediately prior to the exercise of the power according to their rights of priority and any

428 district where the land lies, with a note or reference thereto on the margin of the record of the
429 statutory housing restriction, if it is recorded in the same registry. If the affidavit shows that the
430 requirements of the statutory power to sell and of the statute have been complied with in all
431 respects, the affidavit or a certified copy of the record thereof, shall be admitted as evidence that
432 the power of sale was duly executed.
433 A holder conveying title to statutory housing premises under this chapter shall, within 30
434 days after conveying title, notify all residential tenants of the premises and the office of the
435 assessor or collector of taxes of the municipality in which the premises are located and any
436 persons, companies, districts, commissions or other entities of any kind which provide water or
437 sewer service to the premises, of such conveying of title.

439 may, after breach of the statutory housing condition, have redemption in the manner prescribed
440 in and subject to sections 18, 19, 22 to 27, inclusive, and 32 of chapter 244, substituting “owner”
441 for “mortgagor”, “holder” for “mortgagee”, “statutory housing power to sell” for “power of
442 sale”, “restriction or restricted” for “mortgage or mortgaged” and “performance under the
443 restriction” for “amount due on the mortgage”; provided, however, that (i) the person entitled to
21 of 22

444 redeem shall perform or tender performance of every condition contained in the restriction and,
445 if there has been an action to recover the property, shall pay or tender the costs of such action if
446 unpaid; (ii) the tender shall be made before a sale pursuant to the statutory power to sell
447 contained in the restriction and, if in compliance with the terms of the restriction, shall be
448 accepted by the holder; and (iii) following redemption the property shall continue to be subject to
449 the statutory housing restriction.
