6 gesture or any combination thereof, directed at a victim that: (i) causes physical or emotional
7 harm to the victim or damage to the victim's property; (ii) places the victim in reasonable fear of
8 harm to himself or of damage to his property; (iii) creates a hostile environment for the victim;
9 (iv) infringes on the rights of the victim at a covered residential community; or (v) materially and

17 “Cyber-bullying”, bullying through the use of technology or any electronic

23 which the creator assumes the identity of another person or (ii) the knowing impersonation of
24 another person as the author or posted content or messages, if the creation of impersonation
25 creates any of the conditions enumerated in clauses (i) to (v), inclusive, of the definition of
26 bullying. Cyber-bullying shall also include the distribution by electronic means of a
27 communication to more than one person or the posting of material on an electronic medium that
28 may be accessed by one or more persons, if the distribution or posting creates any of the
29 conditions enumerated in clauses (i) to (v), inclusive or the definition of bullying.

31 bullying conduct toward one or more victims by intentional, repeated, aggressive speech or
