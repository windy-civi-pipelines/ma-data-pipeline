6 Section 31. A. The General Court finds that every child in the Commonwealth has the
7 right to a safe, healthy and meaningful relationship with both parents, subject to the court’s
8 determination of each child’s best interest, and encourages shared parental responsibilities.
9 Parenting plans should prioritize the unique needs and evolving maturity of each child consistent
10 with the safety, best interest and well-being of the child. A parenting plan shall be incorporated
1 of 11
11 into every order, judgment of divorce and modification judgment involving parental
12 responsibility for minor children.
13 B. For purposes of this chapter, the following terms shall, unless the context dictates
14 otherwise, have the following meanings:-
15 1. “Decision-Making Responsibility”,
16 a. Shared: Both parents shall have mutual responsibility and involvement in major
17 decisions regarding the child’s welfare including matters of education, medical care, and
18 emotional, moral and religious development, in accordance with the best interest of the child.
19 b. Sole: A parent shall have the responsibility to make major decisions regarding the
20 child’s welfare including matters of education, medical care, or emotional, moral and religious
21 development, in accordance with the best interest of the child.
22 2. “Residential Responsibility”,
23 a. Shared: A child shall have periods of residing with and being under the care and
24 responsibility of each parent; provided, however, that such periods shall be shared by the parents
25 in such a way as to assure a child frequent, continued and developmentally appropriate contact
26 with both parents in accordance with the best interest of the child. Time with each parent may
27 but shall not necessarily be equal. The parenting plan shall be known as shared residential
28 responsibility only if the child’s period of residing with and being under the care and
29 responsibility of each parent amounts to one-third or more of the parenting time; provided,
30 however, that nothing in this paragraph establishes a presumption that a child shall spend a
31 minimum of one-third of the time or more with each parent.
2 of 11
32 b. Primary: A child shall reside with and be under the care and responsibility of one
33 parent, and have reasonable parenting time with the other parent, unless the court determines that
34 such time with the other parent would not be in the best interest of the child.
35 3. “Parental Responsibility”, this term shall encompass both decision-making and
36 residential responsibility.

43 written agreement concerning parental responsibilities or a court orders otherwise. A parenting
44 plan shall be included in any temporary order issued by the court involving parental
45 responsibility for minor children.
46 D. In determining parental responsibilities, both at the time of entry of orders and
47 judgment, the court shall at all times be guided by the best interest of the child, and shall

52 parenting time.
3 of 11
53 2. The reasonable wishes of the child, if the child is of sufficient age, capacity,
54 temperament and understanding. When considering the child’s wishes, the court may also give
55 due consideration to factors that have unduly influenced the child’s preference.
56 3. The ability for each parent to work together and communicate cooperatively with the
57 other regarding the child’s schedule, routine and physical and emotional needs and; the ability of

70 parent or child, including but not limited to, whether a parent has sexually assaulted or engaged
71 in a pattern or serious incident of abuse against the other parent or a child.
72 8. Whether a continuing relationship with the other parent may endanger the health,
73 safety or welfare of either the parent or the child.
4 of 11
74 9. Whether a parent’s abuse of drugs, alcohol or another substance interferes with that
75 parent’s ability to properly care for the child or exposes the child to physical or emotional harm

88 child, absent a reasonable, good-faith belief as to protecting the child, parent or household
89 member from physical or severe or persistent emotional harm by the other parent, and subject to
90 judicial findings as to any such reasonable, good-faith belief.
91 15. A parent’s conviction for a child-related sexual offense.
92 16. Any other additional factors that the court deems relevant.
