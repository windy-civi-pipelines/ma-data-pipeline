174 person acting as a parent continues to live in the commonwealth;
175 (2) a court of another state does not have jurisdiction under paragraph (1) or a court of the
176 home state of the child has declined to exercise jurisdiction on the ground that the
177 commonwealth is the more appropriate forum under section 2-207 or 2-208 and:
178 (i) the child and the child's parents, or the child and at least 1 parent or a person acting as
179 a parent, have a significant connection with the commonwealth other than mere physical

182 protection, training and personal relationships;
183 (3) all courts having jurisdiction under paragraphs (1) or (2) have declined to exercise

193 (a) Except as otherwise provided in section 2-204, a court of the commonwealth that has
194 made a child-custody determination consistent with section 2-201 or 2-203 shall have exclusive,
195 continuing jurisdiction over the determination until:
196 (1) a court of the commonwealth determines that neither the child nor a parent or any a
197 person acting as a parent have a significant connection with the commonwealth and that
198 substantial evidence is no longer available in the commonwealth concerning the child's care,
199 protection, training and personal relationships; or
200 (2) a court of the commonwealth or a court of another state determines that neither the
201 child nor a parent or any person acting as a parent presently resides in the commonwealth.
202 (b) a court of the commonwealth that has made a child-custody determination and does
203 not have exclusive, continuing jurisdiction under this section may modify that determination
204 only if it has jurisdiction to make an initial determination under section 2-201.
205 Section 2-203. JURISDICTION TO MODIFY DETERMINATION
206 Except as otherwise provided in section 2-204, a court of the commonwealth shall not
207 modify a child-custody determination made by a court of another state unless a court of the
208 commonwealth has jurisdiction to make an initial determination under paragraph (1) or (2) of
209 subsection (a) of section 2-201 and:
210 (1) the court of the other state determines it no longer has exclusive, continuing
211 jurisdiction under section 2-202 or that a court of the commonwealth would be a more
212 convenient forum under section 2-207; or
11 of 32

213 (2) a court of the commonwealth or a court of the other state determines that the child, the
214 child’s parents and any person acting as a parent do not presently reside in the other state.

216 (a) A court of the commonwealth shall have temporary emergency jurisdiction if the
217 child is present in the commonwealth and the child has been abandoned or it is necessary in an
218 emergency to protect the child because the child, or a sibling or parent of the child, is subjected
219 to or threatened with mistreatment or abuse as defined in section 1 of chapter 209A.
220 (b) If there is no previous child-custody determination that is entitled to be enforced
221 under this chapter and a child-custody proceeding has not been commenced in a court of a state
222 having jurisdiction under sections 2-201 to 2-203, inclusive, a child-custody determination made
223 under this section shall remain in effect until an order is obtained from a court of a state having
224 jurisdiction under said sections 2-201 to 2-203, inclusive. If a child-custody proceeding has not
225 been or is not commenced in a court of a state having jurisdiction under said sections 2-201 to 2-
226 203, inclusive, a child-custody determination made under this section shall become a final
227 determination if it so provides and the commonwealth becomes the home state of the child.
228 (c) If there is a previous child-custody determination that is entitled to be enforced under
229 this chapter or a child-custody proceeding has been commenced in a court of a state having
230 jurisdiction under sections 2-201 to 2-203, inclusive, any order issued by a court of the
231 commonwealth under this section shall specify in the order a period that the court considers
232 adequate to allow the person seeking an order to obtain an order from the state having
233 jurisdiction under said sections 2-201 to 2-203, inclusive. The order issued in the commonwealth
12 of 32

234 shall remain in effect until an order is obtained from the other state within the period specified or
235 said period expires.
236 (d) A court of the commonwealth that has been asked to make a child-custody
237 determination under this section, upon being informed that a child-custody proceeding has been
238 commenced in, or a child-custody determination has been made by, a court of a state having
239 jurisdiction under sections 2-201 to 2-203, inclusive, shall immediately communicate with the
240 other court. A court of the commonwealth that is exercising jurisdiction pursuant to said sections
241 2-201 to 2-203, inclusive, upon being informed that a child-custody proceeding has been
242 commenced in, or a child-custody determination has been made by, a court of another state under
243 a statute similar to this section, shall immediately communicate with the court of that state to
244 resolve the emergency, protect the safety of the parties and the child and determine a period for
245 the duration of the temporary order.
246 Section 2-205. NOTICE; OPPORTUNITY TO BE HEARD; JOINDER
247 (a) Before a child-custody determination is made under this chapter, notice and an
248 opportunity to be heard in accordance with the standards of section 1-108 shall be given to all

250 between residents of the commonwealth, any parent whose parental rights have not been

253 made without notice and an opportunity to be heard.
13 of 32

254 (c) The obligation to join a party and the right to intervene as a party in a child-custody
255 proceeding under this chapter are governed by the law of the commonwealth as in child-custody
256 proceedings between residents of the commonwealth.
257 Section 2-206. SIMULTANEOUS PROCEEDINGS
258 (a) Except as otherwise provided in section 2-204, a court of the commonwealth shall not
259 exercise its jurisdiction under article 2 if, at the time of the commencement of the proceeding, a
260 proceeding concerning the custody of the child has been commenced in a court of another state
261 having jurisdiction substantially in conformity with this chapter, unless the proceeding has been
262 terminated or is stayed by the court of the other state because a court of the commonwealth is a
263 more convenient forum under section 2-207.
264 (b) Except as otherwise provided in section 2-204, a court of the commonwealth, before
265 hearing a child-custody proceeding, shall examine the court documents and other information
266 supplied by the parties pursuant to section 2-209. If the court determines that a child-custody
267 proceeding has been commenced in a court in another state having jurisdiction substantially in
268 conformity with this chapter, the court of the commonwealth shall stay its proceeding and
269 communicate with the court of the other state. If the court of the state having jurisdiction
270 substantially in conformity with this chapter does not determine that the court of the
271 commonwealth is a more appropriate forum, the court of the commonwealth shall dismiss the
272 proceeding.
273 (c) In a proceeding to modify a child-custody determination, a court of the
274 commonwealth shall determine whether a proceeding to enforce the determination has been
14 of 32

275 commenced in another state. If a proceeding to enforce a child-custody determination has been
276 commenced in another state, the court may:
277 (1) stay the proceeding for modification pending the entry of an order of a court of the
278 other state enforcing, staying, denying or dismissing the proceeding for enforcement;
279 (2) enjoin the parties from continuing with the proceeding for enforcement; or
280 (3) proceed with the modification under conditions it considers appropriate.
281 SECTION 2-207. INCONVENIENT FORUM
282 (a) A court of the commonwealth that has jurisdiction under this chapter to make a child-
283 custody determination may decline to exercise its jurisdiction at any time if the court determines
284 that it is an inconvenient forum under the circumstances and that a court of another state is a
285 more appropriate forum. The issue of inconvenient forum may be raised upon motion of a party,
286 the court's own motion or request of another court.
287 (b) Before determining whether it is an inconvenient forum, a court of the commonwealth
288 shall consider whether it is appropriate for a court of another state to exercise jurisdiction. For
289 this purpose, the court shall allow the parties to submit information and shall consider all
290 relevant factors including:
291 (1) whether domestic violence has occurred and is likely to continue in the future and
292 which state could best protect the parties and the child;
293 (2) the length of time the child has resided outside the commonwealth;
15 of 32

294 (3) the distance between the court in the commonwealth and the court in the state that
295 would assume jurisdiction;
296 (4) the relative financial circumstances of the parties;
297 (5) an agreement of the parties as to which state should assume jurisdiction;
298 (6) the nature and location of the evidence required to resolve the pending litigation,
299 including testimony of the child;
300 (7) the ability of the court of each state to decide the issue expeditiously and the
301 procedures necessary to present the evidence; and
302 (8) the familiarity of the court of each state with the facts and issues of the pending
303 litigation.
304 (c) If a court of the commonwealth determines that it is an inconvenient forum and that a
305 court of another state is a more appropriate forum, the court shall stay the proceedings upon
306 condition that a child-custody proceeding be promptly commenced in another designated state
307 and may impose any other condition the court considers just and proper.
308 (d) A court of the commonwealth may decline to exercise its jurisdiction under this
309 chapter if a child-custody determination is incidental to an action for divorce or another
310 proceeding while still retaining jurisdiction over the divorce or other proceeding.
311 Section 2-208. JURISDICTION DECLINED BY REASON OF CONDUCT
312 (a) Except as otherwise provided in section 2-204 or by another law of the
313 commonwealth, if a court of the commonwealth has jurisdiction under this chapter because a
16 of 32

314 person seeking to invoke its jurisdiction has engaged in unjustifiable conduct, the court shall
315 decline to exercise its jurisdiction unless:
316 (1) the parents and all persons acting as parents have acquiesced to the exercise of
317 jurisdiction;
318 (2) a court of the state otherwise having jurisdiction under sections 2-201 to 2-203,
319 inclusive, determines that the commonwealth is a more appropriate forum under section 2-207;
320 or
321 (3) no court of another state would have jurisdiction under the criteria specified in
322 sections 2-201 to 2-203, inclusive.
323 (b) If a court of the commonwealth declines to exercise its jurisdiction pursuant to
324 subsection (a), the court may fashion an appropriate remedy to ensure the safety of the child and
325 prevent a repetition of the unjustifiable conduct, including staying the proceeding until a child-
326 custody proceeding is commenced in a court having jurisdiction under sections 2-201 to 2-203,
327 inclusive.
328 (c) If a court dismisses a complaint or a petition or stays a proceeding because it declines
329 to exercise its jurisdiction under subsection (a), the court shall assess against the party seeking to
330 invoke its jurisdiction necessary and reasonable expenses including costs, communication
331 expenses, attorney's fees, investigative fees, expenses for witnesses, travel expenses and child
332 care during the course of the proceedings, unless the party from whom fees are sought
333 establishes that the assessment would be clearly inappropriate. The court shall not assess fees,
334 costs or expenses against the commonwealth unless authorized by law other than this chapter.

339 child's present address or whereabouts, the places where the child has lived during the last 5
340 years and the names and present addresses of the persons with whom the child has lived during
341 that period. The pleading or affidavit shall state whether the party:

349 (3) knows the names and addresses of any person not a party to the proceeding who has
350 physical custody of the child or claims rights of legal custody or physical custody of, parenting
351 time of or visitation with the child and, if so, the names and addresses of those persons.
352 (b) If the information required by subsection (a) is not furnished, the court, upon motion
353 of a party or its own motion, may stay the proceeding until the information is furnished.
354 (c) If the declaration as to any of the items described in paragraphs (1) to (3), inclusive,
355 of subsection (a) is in the affirmative, the declarant shall give additional information under oath
18 of 32

356 as required by the court. The court may examine the parties under oath as to details of the
357 information furnished and other matters pertinent to the court's jurisdiction and the disposition of
358 the case.

362 liberty of a party or child would be jeopardized by disclosure of identifying information, the
363 information shall be sealed and shall not be disclosed to the other party or the public unless the
364 court orders the disclosure to be made after a hearing in which the court takes into consideration
365 the health, safety or liberty of the party or child and determines that the disclosure is in the
366 interest of justice.
367 Section 2-210. APPEARANCE OF PARTIES AND CHILD
368 (a) In a child-custody proceeding in the commonwealth, the court may order a party to

371 and who has physical custody or control of the child to appear in person with the child.
372 (b) If a party to a child-custody proceeding whose presence is desired by the court is
373 outside the commonwealth, the court may order that a notice given pursuant to section 1-108

375 informing the party that failure to appear may result in a decision adverse to that party.
19 of 32

20 of 32

396 Section 3-303. DUTY TO ENFORCE
397 (a) A court of the commonwealth shall recognize and enforce a child-custody
398 determination of a court of another state if the latter court exercised jurisdiction in substantial

401 accordance with this chapter.
402 (b) A court of the commonwealth may utilize any remedy available under the law of the
403 commonwealth to enforce a child-custody determination made by a court of another state. The

406 Section 3-304. TEMPORARY VISITATION
407 (a) A court of the commonwealth that does not have jurisdiction to modify a child-
408 custody determination may issue a temporary order enforcing:

415 remains in effect until an order is obtained from the other state or the period expires.
416 Section 3-305. REGISTRATION OF CHILD-CUSTODY DETERMINATION
21 of 32

417 (a) A child-custody determination issued by a court of another state may be registered in
418 the commonwealth, with or without a simultaneous request for enforcement, by sending the
419 following to the appropriate court in the commonwealth:
420 (1) a letter or other document requesting registration;
421 (2) 2 copies, including 1 certified copy, of the determination sought to be registered and a
422 statement under penalty of perjury that to the best of the knowledge and belief of the person
423 seeking registration the order has not been modified; and
424 (3) except as otherwise provided in section 2-209, the name and address of the person
425 seeking registration and any parent or person acting as a parent who has been awarded custody,
426 parenting time or visitation in the child-custody determination sought to be registered.
427 (b) (1) On receipt of the documents required by subsection (a), the registering court shall
428 cause the determination to be filed as a foreign judgment, together with 1 copy of any
429 accompanying documents and information, regardless of their form.
430 (2) The person seeking registration shall serve notice upon the persons named pursuant to
431 paragraph (3) of subsection (a) and provide them with an opportunity to contest the registration
432 in accordance with this section.
433 (c) The notice required by paragraph (2) of subsection (b) shall state that:
434 (1) a registered determination is enforceable as of the date of the registration in the same
435 manner as a determination issued by a court of the commonwealth;
436 (2) a hearing to contest the validity of the registered determination shall be requested
437 within 20 days after service of notice; and
22 of 32

438 (3) failure to contest the registration shall result in confirmation of the child-custody
439 determination and preclude further contest of that determination with respect to any matter that
440 could have been asserted.
441 (d) A person seeking to contest the validity of a registered order shall request a hearing
442 within 20 days after service of the notice. At that hearing, the court shall confirm the registered
443 order unless the person contesting registration establishes that:
444 (1) the issuing court did not have jurisdiction under article 2;
445 (2) the child-custody determination sought to be registered has been vacated, stayed or
446 modified by a court of a state having jurisdiction to do so under article 2; or
447 (3) the person contesting registration was entitled to notice, but notice was not given in
448 accordance with the standards of section 1-108, in the proceedings before the court that issued
449 the order for which registration is sought.
450 (e) If a timely request for a hearing to contest the validity of the registration is not made,
451 the registration is confirmed as a matter of law and the person requesting registration and all
452 persons served shall be notified of the confirmation.
453 (f) Confirmation of a registered order, whether by operation of law or after notice and
454 hearing, precludes further contest of the order with respect to any matter that could have been
455 asserted at the time of registration.
456 Section 3-306. ENFORCEMENT OF REGISTERED DETERMINATION
23 of 32

457 (a) A court of the commonwealth may grant any relief normally available under the law
458 of the commonwealth to enforce a registered child-custody determination made by a court of

460 (b) A court of the commonwealth shall recognize and enforce, but shall not modify,
461 except in accordance with article 2, a registered child-custody determination of a court of another
462 state.
463 Section 3-307. SIMULTANEOUS PROCEEDINGS
464 If a proceeding for enforcement under this article is commenced in a court of the
465 commonwealth and the court determines that a proceeding to modify the determination is
466 pending in a court of another state having jurisdiction to modify the determination under article
467 2, the enforcing court shall immediately communicate with the modifying court. The proceeding
468 for enforcement continues unless the enforcing court, after consultation with the modifying
469 court, stays or dismisses the proceeding.
470 Section 3-308. EXPEDITED ENFORCEMENT OF CHILD-CUSTODY
471 DETERMINATION
472 (a) A complaint or petition under this article shall be verified. Certified copies of all
473 orders sought to be enforced and of any order confirming registration shall be attached to the
474 petition. A copy of a certified copy of an order may be attached instead of the original.

476 (1) whether the court that issued the determination identified the jurisdictional basis it
477 relied upon in exercising jurisdiction and, if so, what the basis was;
24 of 32

478 (2) whether the determination for which enforcement is sought has been vacated, stayed
479 or modified by a court whose decision shall be enforced under this chapter and, if so, identify the
480 court, case number and nature of the proceeding;

482 proceeding, including proceedings relating to domestic violence, protective orders, termination
483 of parental rights and adoptions and, if so, identify the court, case number and nature of the
484 proceeding;
485 (4) the present physical address of the child and the defendant or respondent, if known;
486 (5) whether relief in addition to the immediate physical custody of the child and
487 attorney's fees is sought, including a request for assistance from law enforcement officials and, if
488 so, the relief sought; and

490 305, the date and place of registration.
491 (c) Upon the filing of a complaint or petition, the court shall issue an order directing the
492 defendant or respondent to appear with or without the child at a hearing and may enter any
493 orders necessary to ensure the safety of the parties and the child. The hearing shall be held on the
494 next judicial day after service of the order unless that date is impossible. In that event, the court
495 shall hold the hearing on the first judicial day possible. The court may extend the date of the
496 hearing at the request of the plaintiff or petitioner.

503 3-305 and that:
504 (i) the issuing court did not have jurisdiction under article 2;
505 (ii) the child-custody determination for which enforcement is sought has been vacated,
506 stayed or modified by a court having jurisdiction to do so under article 2; or
507 (iii) the defendant or respondent was entitled to notice, but notice was not given in
508 accordance with the standards of section 1-108, in the proceedings before the court that issued
509 the order for which enforcement is sought; or
510 (2) the child-custody determination for which enforcement is sought was registered and
511 confirmed under section 3-305, but has been vacated, stayed or modified by a court of a state

513 Section 3-309. SERVICE OF COMPLAINT OR PETITION AND ORDER
514 Except as otherwise provided in section 3-311, the complaint or petition and order shall

519 a finding that a plaintiff or petitioner is entitled to immediate physical custody of the child, the

523 3-305 and that:
524 (i) the issuing court did not have jurisdiction under article 2;

533 (b) The court shall award the fees, costs and expenses authorized under section 3-312 and
534 may grant additional relief, including a request for the assistance of law enforcement officials,
535 and set a further hearing to determine whether additional relief is appropriate.
536 (c) If a party called to testify refuses to answer on the ground that the testimony may be

27 of 32

538 (d) A privilege against disclosure of communications between spouses and a defense of
539 immunity based on the spousal relationship or parent and child relationship does not apply in a
540 proceeding under article 3.

544 warrant to take physical custody of the child if the child is immediately likely to suffer serious
545 physical harm or be removed from the commonwealth.
546 (b) If the court, upon the testimony of the plaintiff or petitioner or other witness, finds

28 of 32

558 (d) The defendant or respondent shall be served with the complaint or petition, warrant
559 and order immediately after the child is taken into physical custody.
560 (e) A warrant to take physical custody of a child is enforceable throughout the
561 commonwealth. If the court finds on the basis of the testimony of the plaintiff or petitioner or
562 other witness that a less intrusive remedy is not effective, the court may authorize law
563 enforcement officers to enter private property to take physical custody of the child. If required by
564 the exigency circumstances of the case, the court may authorize law enforcement officers to
565 make a forcible entry at any hour.
566 (f) The court may impose conditions upon placement of a child to ensure the appearance
567 of the child and the child's custodian.

574 (b) The court shall not assess fees, costs or expenses against a state unless authorized by
575 law other than this chapter.
576 Section 3-313. RECOGNITION AND ENFORCEMENT
577 A court of the commonwealth shall accord full faith and credit to an order issued by
578 another state and consistent with this chapter that enforces a child-custody determination by a
29 of 32

579 court of another state unless the order has been vacated, stayed or modified by a court having
580 jurisdiction to do so under article 2.
581 Section 3-314. APPEALS
582 An appeal may be taken from a final order in a proceeding under this article in
583 accordance with expedited appellate procedures in other civil cases. Unless the court enters a
584 temporary emergency order under section 2-204, the enforcing court shall not stay an order
585 enforcing a child-custody determination pending appeal.

587 (a) In a case arising under this chapter or involving the Hague Convention on the Civil
588 Aspects of International Child Abduction, the prosecutor or other appropriate public official may
589 take any lawful action, including resort to a proceeding under this article or any other available
590 civil proceeding to locate a child, obtain the return of a child or enforce a child-custody

596 of the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction.
597 (b) A prosecutor or appropriate public official acting under this section shall represent the
598 commonwealth and shall not represent any other party to the proceeding.

602 or a party and assist a prosecutor or appropriate public official with responsibilities under said
603 section 3-315.
604 Section 3-317. COSTS AND EXPENSES
605 If the defendant or respondent is not the prevailing party, the court may assess against the
606 defendant or respondent all direct expenses and costs incurred by the prosecutor or other
607 appropriate public official and law enforcement officers under section 3-315 or 3-316.
608 ARTICLE 4. MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS
609 Section 4-401. APPLICATION AND CONSTRUCTION
