4 Section 90(a) As used in this section, the following words shall have the following
5 meanings:
6 i. “Statement” means a juvenile’s oral assertion, written assertion, or nonverbal conduct if

1 of 4
9 iii. “Deception” means communicating, or relaying in any way, false or misleading facts,
10 false or misleading information, false or misleading evidence, or unauthorized implicit or explicit
11 offers of leniency.
12 iv. “Custodial Interrogation” means any questioning by law enforcement officers, or
13 persons acting on behalf of a law enforcement officers, in relation to an investigation, under
14 circumstances where a reasonable juvenile would consider themselves to be in custody, and that
15 questioning is likely to elicit an incriminating response.
16 (b) A statement made by a juvenile during a custodial interrogation shall be presumed to
17 be involuntary, and therefore inadmissible in any court where such statement is offered as
18 evidence, if during the custodial interrogation a law enforcement officer, or person acting on
19 behalf of a law enforcement officer, knowingly engages in deception.
20 A statement that is involuntary, as described in the above paragraph, shall not form the

23 (c)The presumption that such statement, as described in subsection (b), is inadmissible,
24 may be overcome if the Commonwealth proves, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the statement
25 was voluntary and not made due to any deception. A failure to create and save an audiovisual
26 recording of such a statement shall be a factor for the court to consider in determining whether
27 the Commonwealth can meet its burden.
28 (d) Nothing in this section shall abrogate the Commonwealth’s burden to prove a
29 statement is voluntary prior to introducing that statement into evidence.
2 of 4
30 (e)Subsection (b) shall apply to all statements, as described in subsection (b), made on or

38 persons acting on behalf of a law enforcement officer, in relation to an investigation, under

40 questioning is likely to elicit an incriminating response.
41 iv. “Place of Detention” means a vehicle or fixed location under the control of law
42 enforcement, including a police or sheriff’s station, holding cell, jail, correctional or detention
43 facility, or any other place where a juvenile is held in order to conduct a custodial interrogation.
44 v. “Recording” means an authentic, accurate, and unaltered audiovisual record, created
45 by an electronic or digital device, that captures the entirety of what transpired during a custodial
46 interrogation, including all parties involved in the custodial interrogation, and a fair and accurate
47 representation of the space used for the custodial interrogation, commencing when law
48 enforcement, or their representative(s), begins speaking with, or otherwise interacting with, a
49 juvenile in said space, including any recitation of the juvenile’s constitutional rights, and ending
3 of 4
50 when law enforcement, or their representative(s), stops speaking to, or otherwise interacting
51 with, the juvenile in said space.
52 (b) All statements made by a juvenile during a custodial interrogation in a place of

55 evidence resulting from the statement, inadmissible in any court where such statement or
56 evidence is offered as evidence.
57 (c) The presumption that such a statement or evidence, as described in subsection (b), is
58 inadmissible, may be overcome if the Commonwealth proves, by clear and convincing evidence,
59 that creating and saving a recording was not reasonably possible under the circumstances.
60 (d) Lack of economic resources relative to the implementation of recording shall not be
61 considered grounds to conclude that recording was not reasonably possible under subsection (c).
62 (e) If the Commonwealth seeks to offer as evidence a statement, or evidence derived
63 there from, made during a custodial interrogation outside of a place of detention, as defined in
64 subsection (a), for which there is no recording, as defined by subsection (a), then the
65 Commonwealth must prove, by clear and convincing evidence, that conducting the custodial
66 interrogation in a place of detention was not reasonably possible.
67 (f) Subsection (b) and (e) shall apply to all statements, as described in subsection (b) and
68 (e), made on or after the effective date of this statute.
