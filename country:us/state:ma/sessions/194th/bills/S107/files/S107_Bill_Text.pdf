14 enters care and at other times the department deems appropriate. Within 3 months of the
15 effective date of this statute, the department shall create a simple and plain language version of
16 these rights as they are enumerated below so that they are accessible and easily understood by
17 children and youth in care. This simple and plain language version shall be created with the
18 participation of lived experience community members. The department shall explain these rights
19 to the child in a developmentally appropriate way when the child enters the department’s care.
20 The department shall ensure the document is translated into the language spoken by the child, the
21 child’s parent and the foster parent(s). The document shall be posted in all congregate care
22 facilities in a public space where all residents have access, prominently on its website and in all
23 area offices. The department shall present the document for continual use to the child’s attorney
24 and parent(s) and display the document prominently on its website and in all area offices.

44 needs.
45 (vii) Each child has the right to be placed in a safe and nurturing environment and receive

147 contact number for a department staff member who can make decisions and take action with
148 respect to the child during non-business hours.

150 development and review of the action plans and family time and visitation plans, their
151 Individualized Education Program and Best Interest Determination and shall be consulted as the
152 department formulates or updates said items. Children aged 14 and older shall also be presented
153 with the action or service plan for their review, written feedback and signature. A child has the

155 participation if a child does not want them to attend.
156 (iii) Each child has the right to be informed, in a developmentally appropriate way, of the

173 be detrimental to the child. The department shall provide that child the ability to offer input to
174 the department before a final decision is made with respect to determining or changing
175 placement or permanency. If the child is unable to attend in person, by phone or video, the child
176 shall have the right to submit a written statement to be considered at the meeting or hearing.
177 (vi) Each child has the right to department-provided adequate notice of all court hearings.

185 authorization in a developmentally appropriate way. When a child leaves the care of the
186 department, they shall be given copies of medical, dental and educational records held by the
187 department and original copies of all personal documents. If a minor who is aging out of care and
188 is seeking to change their name and/or gender marker on relevant legal documents to affirm their
189 gender identity, before the child ages out of care, the department must ensure that all relevant
190 legal documents, including birth certificate, social security card, state identification card, driver’s
191 license, passport and immigration documentation are updated and corrected before the child
192 departs care. This shall also apply to children in the permanent custody of the department whose
193 parents have had their rights terminated. The department must further provide contact
194 information for providers who are currently providing care for the child. The department shall
195 begin planning to return the documents to the child at least 30 days before the child leaves care
196 to be able to give the documents to the child on the day of the child’s departure. As soon as a
197 child in the department’s care is eligible the department must assist the child in obtaining a state
198 identification card if the child does not have one and wants one.
199 (viii) Each child has the right to an attorney when the department seeks custody of the
200 child and to meaningful contact with said attorney including at foster care reviews. Each child
201 shall be informed, when appropriate, by the department of the name and phone numbers of the
10 of 15

202 assigned attorney. Each child, child’s parent and foster parent shall be informed, when
203 appropriate, by the department that the child can contact the child’s attorney, and of the
204 processes to file a complaint regarding the child’s attorney and to request a change of attorney
205 for the child. The department shall notify the child’s attorney of each child’s placement address
206 and phone number no later than 24 hours after the time of placement or placement change.
207 (ix) Each child has the right to department-provided notice of the clothing, birthday,
208 holiday and emergency payments to foster parents and placement providers for children in
209 placement and that the child has the right to have those payments used to meet the child’s needs.
210 A child over the age of 14 who has a bank account may receive direct payment from the
211 department through their attorney or the department upon request.
212 (x) Each child, and their attorney, has the right to be informed if the department applies
213 for any benefits on behalf of the child, including but not limited to benefits under Title XVI of
214 the Social Security Act, also referred to as “Supplemental Security Income;" benefits under Title
215 II of the Social Security Act, also referred to as “Retirement, Survivors or Disability Benefits,”
216 and if the department applies to be the representative payee for such benefits. The department
217 shall preserve all of such funds received in an interest-bearing account belonging to the child so
218 the funds are available for the child’s benefit and use while they are in care, and the child’s use
219 when they turn 18. The department shall not use such funds for the customary costs of foster
220 care, nor shall it use such funds to pay the costs of items which would ordinarily be funded by
221 another source. If necessary, the department shall preserve said funds in an ABLE (Achieving a
222 Better Life Experience) account authorized by Section 529A of the Internal Revenue Code of
223 1986, or another trust account for the child determined not to interfere with SSI or asset
224 limitations for any other benefit program. Each child, and their attorney, shall have the right to
11 of 15

225 be informed by the department if they stop receiving said benefits, or are no longer eligible to
226 receive them.
227 (6) Transition Age Youth
228 (i) Each child, age 14 or older, has the right to collaborate with the department to plan
229 their transition from foster care to adulthood. Transition planning should cover all areas needed

240 necessary for such planning.
241 (ii) Each child, who turns 18 while in the custody of the department, has the right to
242 continue under the responsibility of the department and receive young adult services until turning
243 23, pursuant to federal requirements. Each child has the right to be offered a Voluntary
244 Placement Agreement by the department in the month prior to their turning 18 years old. The
245 Voluntary Placement Agreement shall be developed together with the child during permanency
246 and transition planning. Each child has the right to be made aware of this right and any federal
12 of 15

247 requirements governing services for transition age youth throughout the transition planning
248 process.
249 (iii) Each child has the right to a transition plan at least one year prior to turning 18 years
250 old crafted by the department at the direction of the transition age youth, regardless whether they
251 will continue under the responsibility of the department upon turning 18, that includes
252 personalized, detailed, tangible, available and clear options for resources for meeting their basic
253 needs including, but not limited to, housing, education and vocational supports which fulfill the

256 the department has the right to engage and re-engage with the department under a Voluntary
257 Placement Agreement at any time for any reason.
258 (v) Each child has the right to all department-identified, appropriate housing
259 opportunities available to a youth turning 18, a young adult leaving the care of the department
260 after the age of 18 and a youth who re-enters the department.
261 (vi) Each child has the right not to be made homeless or redirected to shelter by the
262 department upon said child turning age 18. The department shall have the responsibility of
263 identifying any and all appropriate housing opportunities to said youth, and each child shall be
264 informed of and supported with any housing opportunities through the department or other
265 outside available resources upon the youth’s discharge or re-entry to the department’s
266 responsibility at age 18. The department shall not discharge youth due to the youth receiving
267 services from other state agencies including but not limited to the department of mental health,
13 of 15

268 the department of disability services, the department of transitional assistance, or the department
269 of youth services, and shall not discharge youth on the basis of an arrest without a conviction.
270 (7) Remedies
271 (i) Each child has the right to have these rights enforced. The department shall not
272 retaliate against or punish a child for asserting their rights.
273 Nothing in this section shall be construed to diminish the rights, privileges, or remedies
274 of any person under any other federal or state law.
275 (ii) Each child has the right to department-provided contact information for the
276 ombudsperson, the office of the child advocate and the court when they enter the care and
277 custody of the department and upon request. If it is developmentally inappropriate to provide the
278 child with such information, a child’s attorney may be provided with this contact information.
279 (iii) Each child has the right, if the child, the child’s parent, the child’s attorney, the
280 child’s social worker or the child’s foster parent or placement provider believes any of the above
281 rights have been violated, to discuss the alleged violation with the department, file a complaint
282 with the department’s ombudsman, file a complaint with the office of the child advocate, and
283 those with appropriate standing, may request a fair hearing or petition the Juvenile or Probate
284 and Family Court for a determination and enforcement of these rights. The department shall not
285 retaliate against or punish a child, a child’s parent, an attorney, a social worker, a foster parent or
286 placement provider for asserting this right. If the department, ombudsman, the office of the child
287 advocate or the court determines the child's rights have been violated, the department shall
288 resolve the violation as soon as practicable and make corrections so that the violation does not
289 occur again.

295 office of the child advocate, shall submit an annual report to the house and senate committees on
296 ways and means, the joint committee on children, families and persons with disabilities and the
