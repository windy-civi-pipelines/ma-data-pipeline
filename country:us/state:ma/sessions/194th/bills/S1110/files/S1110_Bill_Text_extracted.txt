92 Section 3. User Direction for Disclosure of Digital Assets
93 (a) A user may use an online tool to direct the custodian to disclose or not to disclose
94 some or all of the user’s digital assets, including the content of electronic communications. If the
95 online tool allows the user to modify or delete a direction at all times, a direction regarding
96 disclosure using an online tool overrides a contrary direction by the user in a will, trust, power of
97 attorney or other record.
98 (b) If a user has not used an online tool to give direction under subsection (a) or if the
99 custodian has not provided an online tool, the user may allow or prohibit in a will, trust, power of
100 attorney or other record disclosure to a fiduciary of some or all of the user’s digital assets,
101 including the content of electronic communications sent or received by the user.
102 (c) A user’s direction under subsection (a) or (b) overrides a contrary provision in a
103 terms-of-service agreement that does not require the user to act affirmatively and distinctly from
104 the user’s assent to the terms of service.
105 Section 4. Terms-of-Service Agreement
106 (a) This chapter shall not be construed to change or impair a right of a custodian or a user
107 under a terms-of-service agreement to access and use the digital assets of the user.
6 of 18
108 (b) This chapter shall not be construed to give a fiduciary any new or expanded rights
109 other than those held by the user for whom, or for whose estate, the fiduciary acts or represents.
110 (c) A fiduciary’s access to digital assets may be modified or eliminated by a user by
111 federal law or by a terms-of-service agreement if the user has not provided direction pursuant to
112 section 3.
113 (d) Notwithstanding anything in this section to the contrary, if a user’s account is a higher
114 education institutional account, a user’s assent to a terms-of-service agreement shall not be
115 construed to constitute the user’s direction to prohibit the disclosure of the user's digital assets to
116 a fiduciary upon or after the user's death.
117 Section 5. Procedure for Disclosing Digital Assets
118 (a) When disclosing the digital assets of a user under this chapter, the custodian may, at
119 their sole discretion:
120 (i) grant a fiduciary or designated recipient full access to the user’s account;
121 (ii) grant a fiduciary or designated recipient partial access to the user’s account sufficient
122 to perform the tasks with which the fiduciary or designated recipient is charged; or
123 (iii) provide a fiduciary or designated recipient a copy in a record of any digital asset that,
124 on the date the custodian received the request for disclosure, the user could have accessed if the
125 user were alive and had full capacity and access to the account.
126 (b) A custodian may assess a reasonable administrative charge for the cost of disclosing
127 digital assets under this chapter.
7 of 18
128 (c) A custodian shall not be required to disclose under this chapter a digital asset deleted
129 by a user.
130 (d) If a user directs or a fiduciary requests a custodian to disclose under this chapter
131 some, but not all, of the user’s digital assets, the custodian shall not be required to disclose the
132 assets if segregation of the assets would impose an undue burden on the custodian. If the
133 custodian believes the direction or request imposes an undue burden, the custodian or fiduciary
134 may seek an order from the court to disclose:
135 (i) a subset limited by date of the user’s digital assets;
136 (ii) all of the user’s digital assets to the fiduciary or designated recipient;
137 (iii) none of the user’s digital assets; or
138 (iv) all of the user’s digital assets to the court for review in camera.
139 Section 6. Disclosure of Electronic Communications of Deceased User
140 (a) If a deceased user consented or a court directs disclosure of the contents of electronic
141 communications of the user, the custodian shall disclose to the personal representative of the
142 estate of the user the content of an electronic communication sent or received by the user if the
143 representative provides to the custodian:
144 (i) a written request for disclosure in physical or electronic form;
145 (ii) a certified copy of the death certificate of the user;
146 (iii) an attested copy of the letter of appointment of the representative or a small-estate
147 affidavit or court order;
8 of 18
148 (iv) unless the deceased user provided direction using an online tool, a copy of the user’s
149 will, trust or other record evidencing the user’s consent to disclosure of the content of electronic
150 communications; and
151 (v) if requested by the custodian:
152 (A) a number, username, address or other unique subscriber or account identifier assigned
153 by the custodian to identify the user’s account;
154 (B) evidence linking the account to the user; or
155 (C) a finding by the court that:
156 (I) the user had a specific account with the custodian, identifiable by the information
157 specified in subclause (A);
158 (II) disclosure of the content of electronic communications of the user would not violate
159 18 U.S.C. section 2701 et seq., as amended, 47 U.S.C. section 222, as amended, or other
160 applicable law;
161 (III) unless the user provided direction using an online tool, the user consented to
162 disclosure of the content of electronic communications; or
163 (IV) disclosure of the content of electronic communications of the user is reasonably
164 necessary for administration of the estate.
165 (b) Notwithstanding anything in this section to the contrary, unless the deceased user
166 prohibited disclosure of digital assets or a court directs otherwise, the custodian shall disclose to
9 of 18
167 the personal representative of the estate of the user the content of an electronic communication
168 sent or received by the user if:
169 (i) the user’s account was a higher education institutional account;
170 (ii) the user was 25 years of age or younger at the time of their death; and
171 (iii) the representative gives to the custodian each of the records required pursuant to
172 clauses (i) through (iii) or requested pursuant to clause (v) of subsection (a); provided, however,
173 that the representative shall not be required to provide a record of the user’s consent to disclosure
174 if such record does not exist.
175 (c) Unless the deceased user prohibited disclosure of digital assets or a court directs
176 otherwise, a custodian shall disclose to the personal representative of the estate of a deceased
177 user a catalogue of electronic communications sent or received by the user and digital assets,
178 other than the content of electronic communications, of the user; provided, however, that the
179 representative shall give to the custodian:
180 (i) each of the records required pursuant to clauses (i) through (iii) of subsection (a); and
181 (ii) if requested by the custodian:
182 (A) a number, username, address or other unique subscriber or account identifier assigned
183 by the custodian to identify the user’s account;
184 (B) evidence linking the account to the user;
185 (C) a finding by the court that the user had a specific account with the custodian,
186 identifiable by the information specified in subclause (A); or
10 of 18
187 (D) an affidavit or a finding by the court stating that disclosure of the user’s digital assets
188 is reasonably necessary for administration of the estate.
189 Section 7. Disclosure of Digital Assets of Principal
190 (a) Unless otherwise ordered by the court, directed by the principal or provided by a
191 power of attorney, a custodian shall disclose to an agent with specific authority over digital
192 assets or general authority to act on behalf of a principal a catalogue of electronic

194 electronic communications, of the principal if the agent provides to the custodian:

207 the custodian:

226 higher education institutional account and the original user was 25 years of age or younger at the
227 time of their death;
228 (iii) a certification by the trustee, under penalty of perjury, that the trust exists and the
229 trustee is a currently acting trustee of the trust; and

92 Section 3. User Direction for Disclosure of Digital Assets
93 (a) A user may use an online tool to direct the custodian to disclose or not to disclose
94 some or all of the user’s digital assets, including the content of electronic communications. If the
95 online tool allows the user to modify or delete a direction at all times, a direction regarding

97 attorney or other record.
98 (b) If a user has not used an online tool to give direction under subsection (a) or if the
99 custodian has not provided an online tool, the user may allow or prohibit in a will, trust, power of
100 attorney or other record disclosure to a fiduciary of some or all of the user’s digital assets,
101 including the content of electronic communications sent or received by the user.
102 (c) A user’s direction under subsection (a) or (b) overrides a contrary provision in a

104 the user’s assent to the terms of service.
105 Section 4. Terms-of-Service Agreement
106 (a) This chapter shall not be construed to change or impair a right of a custodian or a user
107 under a terms-of-service agreement to access and use the digital assets of the user.
6 of 18

108 (b) This chapter shall not be construed to give a fiduciary any new or expanded rights
109 other than those held by the user for whom, or for whose estate, the fiduciary acts or represents.
110 (c) A fiduciary’s access to digital assets may be modified or eliminated by a user by
111 federal law or by a terms-of-service agreement if the user has not provided direction pursuant to
112 section 3.
113 (d) Notwithstanding anything in this section to the contrary, if a user’s account is a higher
114 education institutional account, a user’s assent to a terms-of-service agreement shall not be
115 construed to constitute the user’s direction to prohibit the disclosure of the user's digital assets to
116 a fiduciary upon or after the user's death.
117 Section 5. Procedure for Disclosing Digital Assets
118 (a) When disclosing the digital assets of a user under this chapter, the custodian may, at
119 their sole discretion:
120 (i) grant a fiduciary or designated recipient full access to the user’s account;
121 (ii) grant a fiduciary or designated recipient partial access to the user’s account sufficient
122 to perform the tasks with which the fiduciary or designated recipient is charged; or
123 (iii) provide a fiduciary or designated recipient a copy in a record of any digital asset that,
124 on the date the custodian received the request for disclosure, the user could have accessed if the
125 user were alive and had full capacity and access to the account.
126 (b) A custodian may assess a reasonable administrative charge for the cost of disclosing
127 digital assets under this chapter.
7 of 18

128 (c) A custodian shall not be required to disclose under this chapter a digital asset deleted
129 by a user.
130 (d) If a user directs or a fiduciary requests a custodian to disclose under this chapter
131 some, but not all, of the user’s digital assets, the custodian shall not be required to disclose the
132 assets if segregation of the assets would impose an undue burden on the custodian. If the
133 custodian believes the direction or request imposes an undue burden, the custodian or fiduciary
134 may seek an order from the court to disclose:
135 (i) a subset limited by date of the user’s digital assets;
136 (ii) all of the user’s digital assets to the fiduciary or designated recipient;
137 (iii) none of the user’s digital assets; or
138 (iv) all of the user’s digital assets to the court for review in camera.
139 Section 6. Disclosure of Electronic Communications of Deceased User
140 (a) If a deceased user consented or a court directs disclosure of the contents of electronic
141 communications of the user, the custodian shall disclose to the personal representative of the
142 estate of the user the content of an electronic communication sent or received by the user if the
143 representative provides to the custodian:
144 (i) a written request for disclosure in physical or electronic form;
145 (ii) a certified copy of the death certificate of the user;
146 (iii) an attested copy of the letter of appointment of the representative or a small-estate
147 affidavit or court order;
8 of 18

148 (iv) unless the deceased user provided direction using an online tool, a copy of the user’s
149 will, trust or other record evidencing the user’s consent to disclosure of the content of electronic
150 communications; and
151 (v) if requested by the custodian:
152 (A) a number, username, address or other unique subscriber or account identifier assigned
153 by the custodian to identify the user’s account;
154 (B) evidence linking the account to the user; or
155 (C) a finding by the court that:
156 (I) the user had a specific account with the custodian, identifiable by the information
157 specified in subclause (A);
158 (II) disclosure of the content of electronic communications of the user would not violate
159 18 U.S.C. section 2701 et seq., as amended, 47 U.S.C. section 222, as amended, or other
160 applicable law;
161 (III) unless the user provided direction using an online tool, the user consented to
162 disclosure of the content of electronic communications; or
163 (IV) disclosure of the content of electronic communications of the user is reasonably
164 necessary for administration of the estate.
165 (b) Notwithstanding anything in this section to the contrary, unless the deceased user
166 prohibited disclosure of digital assets or a court directs otherwise, the custodian shall disclose to
9 of 18

167 the personal representative of the estate of the user the content of an electronic communication
168 sent or received by the user if:
169 (i) the user’s account was a higher education institutional account;
170 (ii) the user was 25 years of age or younger at the time of their death; and
171 (iii) the representative gives to the custodian each of the records required pursuant to
172 clauses (i) through (iii) or requested pursuant to clause (v) of subsection (a); provided, however,
173 that the representative shall not be required to provide a record of the user’s consent to disclosure
174 if such record does not exist.
175 (c) Unless the deceased user prohibited disclosure of digital assets or a court directs
176 otherwise, a custodian shall disclose to the personal representative of the estate of a deceased
177 user a catalogue of electronic communications sent or received by the user and digital assets,
178 other than the content of electronic communications, of the user; provided, however, that the
179 representative shall give to the custodian:
180 (i) each of the records required pursuant to clauses (i) through (iii) of subsection (a); and
181 (ii) if requested by the custodian:
182 (A) a number, username, address or other unique subscriber or account identifier assigned
183 by the custodian to identify the user’s account;
184 (B) evidence linking the account to the user;
185 (C) a finding by the court that the user had a specific account with the custodian,
186 identifiable by the information specified in subclause (A); or

188 is reasonably necessary for administration of the estate.
