228 second trust shall not:
229 (i) include as a current beneficiary a person who is not a current beneficiary of the first
230 trust or include as a current beneficiary with respect to trust principal a person who is a current
231 beneficiary of the first trust only with respect to trust income, except as otherwise provided in

239 the law of any jurisdiction and may:
240 (i) retain a power of appointment granted in the first trust;
241 (ii) omit a power of appointment granted in the first trust, other than a presently
242 exercisable general power of appointment;
13 of 28

266 substantially similar to the beneficial interests of the beneficiary in the first trust.
267 (d) A power to make a distribution under a second trust for the benefit of a beneficiary
268 who is an individual shall be substantially similar to a power under the first trust to make a

271 (ii) the beneficiary is under a legal disability or the trustee reasonably believes the
272 beneficiary is incapacitated, and the distribution is made as permitted under this chapter; or

284 beneficiary currently receives those benefits or is an individual who has been adjudicated
285 incompetent.
286 “Governmental benefits”, financial aid or services from a state, federal or other public
287 agency.
288 “Special-needs fiduciary”, with respect to a trust that has a beneficiary with a disability:
289 (i) a trustee or other fiduciary, other than a settlor, who has discretion to distribute part or
290 all of the principal of a first trust to 1 or more current beneficiaries;
291 (ii) if no trustee or fiduciary has discretion under clause (i), a trustee or other fiduciary,
292 other than a settlor, who has discretion to distribute part or all of the income of the first trust to 1
293 or more current beneficiaries; or
294 (iii) if no trustee or fiduciary has discretion under clause (i) or (ii), a trustee or other
295 fiduciary, other than a settlor, who is required to distribute part or all of the income or principal
296 of the first trust to one or more current beneficiaries.
297 “Special-needs trust”, a trust which the trustee believes would not be considered a
298 resource for purposes of determining whether a beneficiary with a disability is eligible for any
299 governmental benefit.
300 (b) A special-needs fiduciary may exercise the decanting power under section 911 over
301 the principal of a first trust as if the fiduciary had authority to distribute principal to a beneficiary
302 with a disability subject to expanded distributive discretion if:
303 (i) a second trust is a special-needs trust that benefits the beneficiary with a disability;
304 and
16 of 28
305 (ii) the special-needs fiduciary determines that exercise of the decanting power will
306 further the purposes of the first trust.
307 (c) In an exercise of the decanting power under this section, the following rules shall
308 apply:
309 (1) Notwithstanding clause (ii) of subsection (c) of section 911, the interest in the second
310 trust of a beneficiary with a disability may:
311 (i) be a pooled trust as defined by Medicaid law for the benefit of the beneficiary with a
312 disability under 42 U.S.C. section 1396p(d)(4)(C); or
313 (ii) contain payback provisions complying with reimbursement requirements of Medicaid
314 law under 42 U.S.C. section 1396p(d)(4)(A).
315 (2) Clause (iii) of subsection (c) of section 911 shall not apply to the interests of the
316 beneficiary with a disability.
317 (3) Except as affected by any change to the interests of the beneficiary with a disability,
318 the second trust, or if there are 2 or more second trusts, the second trusts in the aggregate shall

347 the trust to another trust or to modify the trust.
348 (c) A general prohibition of the amendment or revocation of a first trust, a spendthrift

354 the first trust to another trust.

363 or
364 (ii) the increase is approved by the court.

380 liability or claim that would have been payable from the first trust if the decanting power had not
381 been exercised.

387 act or failure to act of another fiduciary as permitted by law of the commonwealth other than this
388 article.
389 Section 918. Removal or replacement of authorized fiduciary
390 An authorized fiduciary shall not exercise the decanting power to modify a provision in a
391 first-trust instrument granting another person power to remove or replace the fiduciary unless:
392 (i) the person holding the power consents to the modification in a signed record and the
393 modification applies only to the person;
394 (ii) the person holding the power and the qualified beneficiaries of the second trust
395 consent to the modification in a signed record and the modification grants a substantially similar
396 power to another person; or
397 (iii) the court approves the modification and the modification grants a substantially
398 similar power to another person.
399 Section 919. Tax-related limitations
400 (a) For the purposes of this section, the following terms shall have the following
401 meanings unless the context clearly requires otherwise:
402 “Grantor trust”, a trust to which a settlor of a first trust is considered the owner under
403 sections 671 through 677, inclusive, or section 679 of the Internal Revenue Code.
21 of 28
404 “Internal Revenue Code”, the Internal Revenue Code of the United States as amended
405 and as then in effect; provided, however, that references to a specific provision of the Internal
406 Revenue Code shall include a successor provision of the same general effect.
407 “Nongrantor trust”, a trust that is not a grantor trust.
408 “Qualified benefits property”, property subject to the minimum distribution requirements
409 of section 401(a)(9) of the Internal Revenue Code and any applicable regulations, or to any
410 similar requirements that refer thereto.
411 (b) An exercise of the decanting power is subject to the following limitations:
412 (1) If a first trust contains property that qualified, or would have qualified but for
413 provisions of this article other than this section, for a marital deduction for purposes of the gift or
414 estate tax under the Internal Revenue Code or a state gift, estate or inheritance tax, the second-
415 trust instrument shall not include or omit any term that, if included in or omitted from the trust
416 instrument for the trust to which the property was transferred, would have prevented the transfer
417 from qualifying for the deduction or would have reduced the amount of the deduction under the
418 same provisions of the Internal Revenue Code or state law under which the transfer qualified.
419 (2) If the first trust contains property that qualified, or would have qualified but for
420 provisions of this article other than this section, for a charitable deduction for purposes of the
421 income, gift or estate tax under the Internal Revenue Code or a state income, gift, estate or
422 inheritance tax, the second-trust instrument shall not include or omit any term that, if included in
423 or omitted from the trust instrument for the trust to which the property was transferred, would
424 have prevented the transfer from qualifying for the deduction or would have reduced the amount
22 of 28
425 of the deduction under the same provisions of the Internal Revenue Code or state law under
426 which the transfer qualified.
427 (3) If the first trust contains property that qualified, or would have qualified but for
428 provisions of this article other than this section, for the exclusion from the gift tax described in
429 section 2503(b) of the Internal Revenue Code, the second-trust instrument shall not include or
430 omit a term that, if included in or omitted from the trust instrument for the trust to which the
431 property was transferred, would have prevented the transfer from qualifying under such section.
432 If the first trust contains property that qualified, or would have qualified but for provisions of this
433 article other than this section, for the exclusion from the gift tax described in section 2503(b) of
434 the Internal Revenue Code by application of section 2503(c) of the Internal Revenue Code, the
435 second-trust instrument shall not include or omit a term that, if included or omitted from the trust
436 instrument for the trust to which the property was transferred, would have prevented the transfer
437 from qualifying under section 2503(c) of the Internal Revenue Code.
438 (4) If the property of the first trust includes shares of stock in an S corporation, as defined
439 in section 1361 of the Internal Revenue Code and the first trust is, or but for provisions of this
440 article other than this section would be, a permitted shareholder under any provision of section
441 1361 of the Internal Revenue Code, an authorized fiduciary may exercise the power with respect
442 to part or all of the S corporation stock only if any second trust receiving the stock is a permitted
443 shareholder under section 1361(c)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code. If the property of the first
444 trust includes shares of stock in an S corporation and the first trust is, or but for provisions of this
445 article other than this section would be, a qualified subchapter S trust within the meaning of
446 section 1361(d) of the Internal Revenue Code, the second-trust instrument shall not include or
447 omit a term that prevents the second trust from qualifying as a qualified subchapter S trust.
23 of 28
448 (5) If the first trust contains property that qualified, or would have qualified but for
449 provisions of this article other than this section, for a 0 inclusion ratio for purposes of the
450 generation-skipping transfer tax under section 2642(c) of the Internal Revenue Code, the second-
451 trust instrument shall not include or omit a term that, if included in or omitted from the first-trust
452 instrument, would have prevented the transfer to the first trust from qualifying for a 0 inclusion
453 ratio under such section.
454 (6) If the first trust is directly or indirectly the beneficiary of qualified benefits property,
455 the second-trust instrument shall not include or omit any term that, if included in or omitted from
456 the first-trust instrument, would have increased the minimum distributions required with respect
457 to the qualified benefits property under section 401(a)(9) of the Internal Revenue Code and any
458 applicable regulations or any similar requirements that refer thereto. If an attempted exercise of
459 the decanting power violates the preceding sentence, the trustee shall be deemed to have held the
460 qualified benefits property and any reinvested distributions of the property as a separate share
461 from the date of the exercise of the power and section 922 shall apply to the separate share.
462 (7) If the first trust qualifies as a grantor trust because of the application of section
463 672(f)(2)(A) of the Internal Revenue Code, the second trust shall not include or omit a term that,
464 if included in or omitted from the first-trust instrument, would have prevented the first trust from
465 qualifying under such section.
466 (8) In this paragraph, “tax benefit” shall mean a federal or state tax deduction, exemption,
467 exclusion or other benefit not otherwise listed in this section, except for a benefit arising from
468 being a grantor trust. Subject to paragraph (9), a second-trust instrument shall not include or omit
24 of 28
469 a term that, if included in or omitted from the first-trust instrument, would have prevented
470 qualification for a tax benefit if:
471 (i) the first-trust instrument expressly indicates an intent to qualify for the benefit or the
472 first-trust instrument clearly is designed to enable the first trust to qualify for the benefit; and
473 (ii) the transfer of property held by the first trust or the first trust qualified or, but for
474 provisions of this article other than this section, would have qualified for the tax benefit.
475 (9) Subject to paragraph (4):
476 (i) except as otherwise provided in paragraph (7), the second trust may be a nongrantor
477 trust, even if the first trust is a grantor trust; and
478 (ii) the second trust may be a grantor trust, even if the first trust is a nongrantor trust.
479 Section 920. Duration of second trust
480 (a) Subject to subsection (b), a second trust may have a duration that is the same as or
481 different from the duration of the first trust.
482 (b) To the extent that property of a second trust is attributable to property of the first trust,
483 the property of the second trust is subject to any rules governing maximum perpetuity,
484 accumulation or suspension of the power of alienation which apply to property of the first trust.

488 compelled to make a discretionary distribution of principal at the time of the exercise.
25 of 28
489 Section 922. Saving provision
490 (a) If exercise of the decanting power would be effective under this article except that the
491 second-trust instrument in part does not comply with this article, the exercise of the power shall
492 be effective and the following rules shall apply with respect to the principal of the second trust
493 attributable to the exercise of the power:
494 (1) A provision in the second-trust instrument which is not permitted under this article
495 shall be void to the extent necessary to comply with this article.
496 (2) A provision required by this article to be in the second-trust instrument which is not
497 contained in the instrument shall be deemed to be included in the instrument to the extent
498 necessary to comply with this article.
499 (b) If a trustee or other fiduciary of a second trust determines that subsection (a) applies
500 to a prior exercise of the decanting power, the fiduciary shall take corrective action consistent
501 with the fiduciary’s duties.
502 Section 923. Trust for care of an animal
503 (a) For purposes of this section, the following terms shall have the following meanings
504 unless the context clearly requires otherwise:

506 “Protector”, the person who may enforce the intended use of the principal or income of
507 an animal trust under subsection (f) of section 408.
26 of 28
508 (b) The decanting power may be exercised over an animal trust that has a protector to the
509 extent the trust could be decanted under this article if each animal that benefits from the trust
510 were an individual if the protector consents in a signed record to the exercise of the power.
511 (c) Notwithstanding any other provision of this article, if a first trust is an animal trust, in
512 an exercise of the decanting power, the second trust shall provide that trust property may be
513 applied only to its intended purpose for the period the first trust benefitted the animal.
514 Section 924. Terms of second trust
515 A reference in this chapter to a trust instrument or terms of the trust includes a second-
516 trust instrument and the terms of the second trust.
517 Section 925. Settlor

519 subsection (b), a settlor of a first trust is deemed to be the settlor of the second trust with respect
520 to the portion of the principal of the first trust subject to the exercise of the decanting power.
521 (b) In determining settlor intent with respect to a second trust, the intent of a settlor of the
522 first trust, a settlor of the second trust and the authorized fiduciary may be considered.
523 Section 926. Later-discovered and later-acquired property
524 (a) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (c), if exercise of the decanting power was
525 intended to distribute all the principal of the first trust to 1 or more second trusts, later-

527 after the exercise of the power shall be part of the trust estate of the second trust or trusts.
27 of 28
528 (b) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (c), if exercise of the decanting power was
529 intended to distribute less than all of the principal of the first trust to 1 or more second trusts,
530 later-discovered property belonging to the first trust or property paid to or acquired by the first
531 trust after exercise of the power shall remain part of the trust estate of the first trust.
532 (c) An authorized fiduciary may provide in an exercise of the decanting power or by the
533 terms of a second trust for disposition of later-discovered property belonging to the first trust or
534 property paid to or acquired by the first trust after exercise of the power.
535 Section 927. Obligations

537 enforceable to the same extent against the property when held by the second trust after exercise
538 of the decanting power.

161 shall not affect the right of a person to file an application under section 909 asserting that:

169 Section 909. Court involvement
170 (a) On application of an authorized fiduciary, a person entitled to notice under subsection
171 (c) of section 907, a beneficiary or, with respect to a charitable interest, the attorney general or

178 (iii) approve an exercise of the decanting power;

199 distributed to each second trust and the property, if any, that remains in the first trust.
200 Section 911. Decanting power under expanded distributive discretion

226 beneficiaries may exercise the decanting power over the principal of the first trust.
227 (c) Subject to section 913, in an exercise of the decanting power under this section, a
228 second trust shall not:
229 (i) include as a current beneficiary a person who is not a current beneficiary of the first
230 trust or include as a current beneficiary with respect to trust principal a person who is a current
231 beneficiary of the first trust only with respect to trust income, except as otherwise provided in
232 subsection (d);
233 (ii) include as a presumptive remainder beneficiary or successor beneficiary a person who
234 is not a current beneficiary, presumptive remainder beneficiary or successor beneficiary of the
235 first trust, except as otherwise provided in subsection (d); or
236 (iii) reduce or eliminate a vested interest.
237 (d) Subject to clause (iii) of subsection (c) and section 914, in an exercise of the
238 decanting power under this section, a second trust may be a trust created or administered under
239 the law of any jurisdiction and may:
240 (i) retain a power of appointment granted in the first trust;
241 (ii) omit a power of appointment granted in the first trust, other than a presently
242 exercisable general power of appointment;
13 of 28

243 (iii) create or modify a power of appointment if the powerholder is a current beneficiary
244 of the first trust and the authorized fiduciary has expanded distributive discretion to distribute
245 principal to the beneficiary; or
246 (iv) create or modify a power of appointment if the powerholder is a presumptive
247 remainder beneficiary or successor beneficiary of the first trust; provided, however, that the

266 substantially similar to the beneficial interests of the beneficiary in the first trust.
267 (d) A power to make a distribution under a second trust for the benefit of a beneficiary
268 who is an individual shall be substantially similar to a power under the first trust to make a

270 (i) the distribution is applied for the benefit of the beneficiary;
271 (ii) the beneficiary is under a legal disability or the trustee reasonably believes the
272 beneficiary is incapacitated, and the distribution is made as permitted under this chapter; or

284 beneficiary currently receives those benefits or is an individual who has been adjudicated
285 incompetent.
286 “Governmental benefits”, financial aid or services from a state, federal or other public
287 agency.
288 “Special-needs fiduciary”, with respect to a trust that has a beneficiary with a disability:
289 (i) a trustee or other fiduciary, other than a settlor, who has discretion to distribute part or
290 all of the principal of a first trust to 1 or more current beneficiaries;
291 (ii) if no trustee or fiduciary has discretion under clause (i), a trustee or other fiduciary,
292 other than a settlor, who has discretion to distribute part or all of the income of the first trust to 1
293 or more current beneficiaries; or
294 (iii) if no trustee or fiduciary has discretion under clause (i) or (ii), a trustee or other
295 fiduciary, other than a settlor, who is required to distribute part or all of the income or principal
296 of the first trust to one or more current beneficiaries.
297 “Special-needs trust”, a trust which the trustee believes would not be considered a
298 resource for purposes of determining whether a beneficiary with a disability is eligible for any
299 governmental benefit.
300 (b) A special-needs fiduciary may exercise the decanting power under section 911 over
301 the principal of a first trust as if the fiduciary had authority to distribute principal to a beneficiary
302 with a disability subject to expanded distributive discretion if:
303 (i) a second trust is a special-needs trust that benefits the beneficiary with a disability;
304 and
16 of 28

305 (ii) the special-needs fiduciary determines that exercise of the decanting power will
306 further the purposes of the first trust.
307 (c) In an exercise of the decanting power under this section, the following rules shall
308 apply:
309 (1) Notwithstanding clause (ii) of subsection (c) of section 911, the interest in the second
310 trust of a beneficiary with a disability may:
311 (i) be a pooled trust as defined by Medicaid law for the benefit of the beneficiary with a
312 disability under 42 U.S.C. section 1396p(d)(4)(C); or
313 (ii) contain payback provisions complying with reimbursement requirements of Medicaid
314 law under 42 U.S.C. section 1396p(d)(4)(A).
315 (2) Clause (iii) of subsection (c) of section 911 shall not apply to the interests of the
316 beneficiary with a disability.
317 (3) Except as affected by any change to the interests of the beneficiary with a disability,
318 the second trust, or if there are 2 or more second trusts, the second trusts in the aggregate shall
319 grant each other beneficiary of the first trust beneficial interests in the second trusts which are
320 substantially similar to the beneficiary’s beneficial interests in the first trust.
321 Section 914. Protection of charitable interest

327 described in subsection (a) of section 405.
328 (2) “Unconditional”, not subject to the occurrence of a specified event that is not certain
329 to occur, other than a requirement in a trust instrument that a charitable organization be in
330 existence or qualify under a particular provision of the Internal Revenue Code of the United
331 States on the date of the distribution, if the charitable organization meets the requirement on the
332 date of determination.
333 (b) If a first trust contains a determinable charitable interest, the attorney general has the
334 rights of a qualified beneficiary and may represent and bind the charitable interest.

336 under law of the commonwealth other than this article.

354 the first trust to another trust.

359 (a) If a first-trust instrument specifies an authorized fiduciary’s compensation, the
360 fiduciary may not exercise the decanting power to increase the fiduciary’s compensation above
361 the specified compensation unless:
362 (i) all qualified beneficiaries of the second trust consent to the increase in a signed record;
363 or
364 (ii) the increase is approved by the court.
19 of 28

365 (b) If a first-trust instrument does not specify an authorized fiduciary’s compensation, the

408 “Qualified benefits property”, property subject to the minimum distribution requirements
409 of section 401(a)(9) of the Internal Revenue Code and any applicable regulations, or to any
410 similar requirements that refer thereto.
411 (b) An exercise of the decanting power is subject to the following limitations:
412 (1) If a first trust contains property that qualified, or would have qualified but for
413 provisions of this article other than this section, for a marital deduction for purposes of the gift or
414 estate tax under the Internal Revenue Code or a state gift, estate or inheritance tax, the second-
415 trust instrument shall not include or omit any term that, if included in or omitted from the trust
416 instrument for the trust to which the property was transferred, would have prevented the transfer
417 from qualifying for the deduction or would have reduced the amount of the deduction under the
418 same provisions of the Internal Revenue Code or state law under which the transfer qualified.
419 (2) If the first trust contains property that qualified, or would have qualified but for
420 provisions of this article other than this section, for a charitable deduction for purposes of the
421 income, gift or estate tax under the Internal Revenue Code or a state income, gift, estate or
422 inheritance tax, the second-trust instrument shall not include or omit any term that, if included in
423 or omitted from the trust instrument for the trust to which the property was transferred, would
424 have prevented the transfer from qualifying for the deduction or would have reduced the amount
22 of 28

425 of the deduction under the same provisions of the Internal Revenue Code or state law under
426 which the transfer qualified.
427 (3) If the first trust contains property that qualified, or would have qualified but for
428 provisions of this article other than this section, for the exclusion from the gift tax described in
429 section 2503(b) of the Internal Revenue Code, the second-trust instrument shall not include or
430 omit a term that, if included in or omitted from the trust instrument for the trust to which the
431 property was transferred, would have prevented the transfer from qualifying under such section.
432 If the first trust contains property that qualified, or would have qualified but for provisions of this
433 article other than this section, for the exclusion from the gift tax described in section 2503(b) of
434 the Internal Revenue Code by application of section 2503(c) of the Internal Revenue Code, the
435 second-trust instrument shall not include or omit a term that, if included or omitted from the trust
436 instrument for the trust to which the property was transferred, would have prevented the transfer
437 from qualifying under section 2503(c) of the Internal Revenue Code.
438 (4) If the property of the first trust includes shares of stock in an S corporation, as defined
439 in section 1361 of the Internal Revenue Code and the first trust is, or but for provisions of this
440 article other than this section would be, a permitted shareholder under any provision of section
441 1361 of the Internal Revenue Code, an authorized fiduciary may exercise the power with respect
442 to part or all of the S corporation stock only if any second trust receiving the stock is a permitted
443 shareholder under section 1361(c)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code. If the property of the first
444 trust includes shares of stock in an S corporation and the first trust is, or but for provisions of this
445 article other than this section would be, a qualified subchapter S trust within the meaning of
446 section 1361(d) of the Internal Revenue Code, the second-trust instrument shall not include or

449 provisions of this article other than this section, for a 0 inclusion ratio for purposes of the
450 generation-skipping transfer tax under section 2642(c) of the Internal Revenue Code, the second-
451 trust instrument shall not include or omit a term that, if included in or omitted from the first-trust
452 instrument, would have prevented the transfer to the first trust from qualifying for a 0 inclusion
453 ratio under such section.
454 (6) If the first trust is directly or indirectly the beneficiary of qualified benefits property,
455 the second-trust instrument shall not include or omit any term that, if included in or omitted from
456 the first-trust instrument, would have increased the minimum distributions required with respect
457 to the qualified benefits property under section 401(a)(9) of the Internal Revenue Code and any
458 applicable regulations or any similar requirements that refer thereto. If an attempted exercise of
459 the decanting power violates the preceding sentence, the trustee shall be deemed to have held the
460 qualified benefits property and any reinvested distributions of the property as a separate share
461 from the date of the exercise of the power and section 922 shall apply to the separate share.
462 (7) If the first trust qualifies as a grantor trust because of the application of section
463 672(f)(2)(A) of the Internal Revenue Code, the second trust shall not include or omit a term that,
464 if included in or omitted from the first-trust instrument, would have prevented the first trust from
465 qualifying under such section.
466 (8) In this paragraph, “tax benefit” shall mean a federal or state tax deduction, exemption,
467 exclusion or other benefit not otherwise listed in this section, except for a benefit arising from
468 being a grantor trust. Subject to paragraph (9), a second-trust instrument shall not include or omit
24 of 28

469 a term that, if included in or omitted from the first-trust instrument, would have prevented
470 qualification for a tax benefit if:
471 (i) the first-trust instrument expressly indicates an intent to qualify for the benefit or the
472 first-trust instrument clearly is designed to enable the first trust to qualify for the benefit; and
473 (ii) the transfer of property held by the first trust or the first trust qualified or, but for
474 provisions of this article other than this section, would have qualified for the tax benefit.
475 (9) Subject to paragraph (4):
476 (i) except as otherwise provided in paragraph (7), the second trust may be a nongrantor
477 trust, even if the first trust is a grantor trust; and
478 (ii) the second trust may be a grantor trust, even if the first trust is a nongrantor trust.
479 Section 920. Duration of second trust
480 (a) Subject to subsection (b), a second trust may have a duration that is the same as or
481 different from the duration of the first trust.
482 (b) To the extent that property of a second trust is attributable to property of the first trust,
483 the property of the second trust is subject to any rules governing maximum perpetuity,
484 accumulation or suspension of the power of alienation which apply to property of the first trust.

491 second-trust instrument in part does not comply with this article, the exercise of the power shall
492 be effective and the following rules shall apply with respect to the principal of the second trust
493 attributable to the exercise of the power:
494 (1) A provision in the second-trust instrument which is not permitted under this article
495 shall be void to the extent necessary to comply with this article.
496 (2) A provision required by this article to be in the second-trust instrument which is not
497 contained in the instrument shall be deemed to be included in the instrument to the extent
498 necessary to comply with this article.
499 (b) If a trustee or other fiduciary of a second trust determines that subsection (a) applies
500 to a prior exercise of the decanting power, the fiduciary shall take corrective action consistent
501 with the fiduciary’s duties.
502 Section 923. Trust for care of an animal
503 (a) For purposes of this section, the following terms shall have the following meanings
504 unless the context clearly requires otherwise:

506 “Protector”, the person who may enforce the intended use of the principal or income of
507 an animal trust under subsection (f) of section 408.
26 of 28

508 (b) The decanting power may be exercised over an animal trust that has a protector to the
509 extent the trust could be decanted under this article if each animal that benefits from the trust
510 were an individual if the protector consents in a signed record to the exercise of the power.
511 (c) Notwithstanding any other provision of this article, if a first trust is an animal trust, in
512 an exercise of the decanting power, the second trust shall provide that trust property may be
513 applied only to its intended purpose for the period the first trust benefitted the animal.
