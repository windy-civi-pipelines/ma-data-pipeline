6 prison or jail to implement automated and expedited record sealing, and the department of
7 criminal justice information services shall include the date of a person’s release from a house of
8 corrections, prison, or jail for any offense as part of criminal offender record information if the
9 date is known to the department.
1 of 6
10 SECTION 2. Section 18 ¾ of chapter 6A of the General Laws, as so appearing, is hereby
11 amending by inserting after the last paragraph the following paragraph:-
12 (16) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section to the contrary, the secretary

14 of corrections and any jail to report on the seventh day of each month to the commissioner of
15 probation the names, personal identifying information, and the actual dates that any person was
16 released from the house of corrections, jail or the department of correction during the prior
17 month and also shall provide such information as to other dates of past release for other

19 and expedited sealing of records, and the inclusion of the dates a person was released from
20 custody or incarceration on criminal offender and juvenile court activity record information

22 SECTION 3. Section 100A of chapter 276 of the General Laws, as so appearing, is
23 hereby amended by striking the first paragraph and inserting in place thereof the following three
24 paragraphs:-
25 Notwithstanding any law to the contrary, a person shall not be required to file a petition
26 or other form of a request in order to seal any record of criminal court appearances and
27 dispositions related to a criminal offense in the commonwealth under this section after an
28 applicable waiting period, except as specified within this section. The commissioner of probation
29 shall establish and implement an automated process for sealing of such records. The
30 commissioner shall seal all such records within 30 days of the time that the records became
31 eligible for sealing under this section; provided, however, that sealing of any conviction for a sex

32 offense, as defined in section 178C of chapter 6, shall require that a person with such records file
33 a request for sealing of such convictions with the commissioner on a form provided by the
34 commissioner. In the event that records of any offense required to be sealed under this section
35 without a request are not sealed due to an error or omission or lack of availability of a court
36 record based on the age of said record, a person with such records shall not be precluded from
37 seeking relief, and the commissioner of probation shall seal such records forthwith upon receipt
38 of any request to seal said record from the person or the person’s legal representative.
39 The commissioner of probation shall provide all defendants at the time of a conviction or
40 other disposition of their offense or offenses with a notice that the offense or offenses may be
41 sealed in the future without the necessity of filing a petition to seal the records, a brief summary
42 of the sealing law, and a list of resources related to sealing of records. The clerk’s office of any
43 division of the trial court, the commissioner of probation, and any other criminal justice agency,
44 upon request of a person whose records are sealed, or the person’s legal representative, shall
45 provide access to the sealed records to the person or the person’s legal representative without
46 said person, or legal representative obtaining a court order or having to unseal the records.
47 The commissioner of probation shall seal records of any record of criminal court
48 appearances and dispositions related to a criminal offense or offenses in the commonwealth on
49 file with the commissioner provided that: (1) the person's court appearance and court disposition,
50 including any period of incarceration or custody for any misdemeanor record to be sealed
51 occurred not less than 3 years prior to the sealing; (2) the person's court appearance and court
52 disposition, including any period of incarceration or custody for any felony record to be sealed

60 offense that was later decriminalized, is not precluded from seeking earlier and immediate
61 sealing of the records, if the person files a request for such sealing on a form that shall be
62 provided by the commissioner.

71 of criminal court appearances and dispositions related to a juvenile court offense. The
72 commissioner of probation shall establish and implement an automated process for sealing of
73 such records. The commissioner shall seal said records in the commonwealth on file with the
74 commissioner within 30 days after any records become eligible for sealing after the applicable 3-
75 year waiting period. The records shall become eligible for sealing when: (1) any court
76 appearance or disposition including court supervision, probation, commitment or parole for the

78 adjudicated delinquent or as a youthful offender, found guilty of any criminal offense in the trial
79 court of the commonwealth, or been committed as a juvenile or imprisoned within the

82 availability of a court record based on the age of said record, a person with such an offense shall
83 not be precluded from seeking relief, and the commissioner of probation shall seal such records
84 forthwith upon receipt of a request to seal said records from the person or the person’s legal
