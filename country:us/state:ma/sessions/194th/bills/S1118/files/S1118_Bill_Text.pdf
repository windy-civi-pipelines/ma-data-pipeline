61 powers granted by, and in a manner consistent with, section 6 of chapter 93A.
62 (c) Any action based upon or arising under this chapter shall be instituted within 3 years
63 after the date of the last alleged unlawful act, the last alleged injury, when an injured individual
64 became aware of the last alleged injury or when the attorney general’s office became aware of
65 the last alleged injury, whichever is most recent.
