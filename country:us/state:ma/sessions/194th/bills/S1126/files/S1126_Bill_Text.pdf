16 SECTION 2. Section 11I of said chapter 12 of the General Laws, as so appearing, is
17 hereby amended by adding the following two paragraphs:
18 Any aggrieved person who demonstrates by a preponderance of the evidence that any

21 status, sex, gender, gender expression, sexual orientation, gender identity, or disability may also
22 be awarded statutory damages in an amount up to $5,000.00 per violation, plus punitive damages
