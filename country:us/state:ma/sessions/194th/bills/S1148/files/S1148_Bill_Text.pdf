11 performing tasks related to employment.
12 (b) Subsection (a) shall not apply to employers who are compelled to test for marijuana
13 due to requirements established by the federal government.
14 (c) Nothing in this Section prohibits an employer from taking adverse employment
15 action: (i) if an employee who is unable to maintain licenses, credentials, or other qualifications
16 that are reasonably necessary for the performance of the employee’s position, even if such
17 licensing, credentialing, or other qualifications prohibit the employee from using marijuana; or
18 (ii) the employee is charged with a crime relating to his or her use, possession, sale, manufacture,
19 distribution, dispensation, or transfer of marijuana and, based on the employer’s investigation
20 into the matter, the employer reasonably believes the employee committed a crime.
21 (d) Any person claiming to be aggrieved under subsection (a) may bring a civil action
22 under this section for damages or injunctive relief, or both, and shall be entitled to a trial by jury
23 on any issue of fact in an action for damages regardless of whether equitable relief is sought by a
24 party in such action. If the court finds for the petitioner, recovery shall be in the amount of actual
25 damages; or up to 2 times such amount if the court finds that the act or practice complained of
26 was committed with knowledge, or reason to know, that such act or practice violated the
27 provisions of this section.
28 (e) The executive office of labor and workforce development in consultation with the
29 executive office of public safety and security shall promulgate regulations to enforce this section.
