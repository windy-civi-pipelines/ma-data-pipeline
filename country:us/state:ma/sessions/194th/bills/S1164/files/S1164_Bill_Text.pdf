4 following meanings, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise:-
5 “Adaptive parenting equipment”, any piece of equipment or any item used to increase,
6 maintain, or improve the parenting capabilities of a parent with a disability.
7 “Disability”, a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major
8 life activities of an individual, a record of such impairment, or being regarded as having such an
1 of 9

9 impairment. This definition shall be broadly interpreted in a manner consistent with the
10 Americans with Disabilities Act Amendments Act of 2008.
11 “Supportive parenting services”, services that help a parent with a disability compensate
12 for those aspects of the disability that affect their ability to care for their children and that will
13 enable them to discharge their parental responsibilities, including, but not limited to, specialized
14 or adapted training, evaluations, assistance with effective use of adaptive equipment, peer
15 supports or other psychosocial parental skill building therapies or services, and accommodations
16 that allow a parent with a disability to benefit from other services, such as braille text or sign
17 language interpreters.
18 Nothing in this chapter shall allow a parent’s disability or its manifestations to be
19 considered a negative factor in a determination of custody or of parenting time with a minor
20 child, absent a specific showing by a preponderance of the evidence made by the party raising
21 the allegation, that there is a nexus between the parent’s disability, or its manifestations, and
22 alleged harm to the child, and that this alleged harm cannot be prevented or alleviated by
23 accommodations for the disability, including adaptive parenting equipment or supportive
24 parenting services.
25 If the court considers a parent’s disability or its manifestations as a negative factor in an
26 award of custody or of parenting time with a child, then the court shall make specific written
27 findings as to the nexus between the parent’s disability, or its manifestations, and harm to the
28 child, what effect, if any, said harm has on the best interests of the child, and whether adaptive
29 parenting equipment or supportive parenting services can alleviate said harm.
