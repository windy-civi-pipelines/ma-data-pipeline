12 SECTION 4. Section 4C of chapter 260 of the General Laws, as so appearing, is hereby
13 amended by striking out the first paragraph and inserting in place thereof the following
14 paragraph:-
15 Actions of tort alleging the defendant sexually abused a minor may be commenced at any
16 time after the acts alleged to have caused an injury or condition.
17 SECTION 5. Said chapter 260 is hereby further amended by striking out section 4C1/2,
18 as appearing in the 2022 Official Edition, and inserting in place thereof the following section:-
19 Section 4C½. An action of tort alleging that the defendant negligently supervised a
20 person who sexually abused a minor or that the defendant’s conduct caused or contributed to the
21 sexual abuse of a minor by another person may be commenced at any time after the acts alleged
22 to have caused an injury or condition. For the purposes of this section, “sexual abuse” shall have
23 the same meaning as in section 4C.
24 SECTION 6. Sections 4C and 4C1/2 of chapter 260 of the General Laws shall apply
25 regardless of when acts alleged to have caused an injury or condition to a minor shall have
26 accrued and regardless of whether it may have lapsed or would otherwise be barred by time
27 under any law of the commonwealth. In an action based on sexual abuse against a minor that
28 would have been barred by time under any law of the commonwealth in effect before the
29 effective date of this act, damages may be awarded against an entity that employed or supervised
30 the person who allegedly committed the sexual abuse only if there is a finding of negligence on
31 the part of the entity.

32 SECTION 7. Changes in the law made by Sections 1 – 6 above shall apply retroactively
33 to childhood sexual abuse that occurred prior to the effective date of this act, irrespective of any
34 statute of limitations in effect at the time the abuse occurred.
35 SECTION 8. These Acts shall take effect July 31, 2026.
