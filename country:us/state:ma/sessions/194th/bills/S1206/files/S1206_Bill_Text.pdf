14 of the animal, taking into account their health, safety, comfort, and well-being and any relevant
15 facts, including, but not limited to:
16 (i) Whether the parties are seeking sole or shared custody of the animal; (ii) Each party’s
17 history with the animal, including in acquiring the animal and subsequent amount of time spent,

38 equitable remedy such as shared custody or, alternatively, by determining sole custody by one
39 party is in the best interest of the animal using the process established in this section.
