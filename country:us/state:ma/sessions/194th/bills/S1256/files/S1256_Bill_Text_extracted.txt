85 less than 3 months and not more than 24 months. The motion shall include 1) a statement that the
86 defendant is a survivor as defined in Section 2 of this Act and 2) the defendant’s plan for the
87 diversion period, which may include programs, services, restorative justice activities,
88 employment, and/or community service. If such a motion has been filed, the court shall not
89 proceed with pre-trial hearings until it issues a decision on the motion. Where the defendant
90 requests a hearing and has made a prima facie showing that they meet the requirements of this
91 Act, the court shall order a hearing.
92 b) Within 60 days of receiving a motion pursuant to this Act or holding a hearing on
93 such a motion, the court shall make written findings as to 1) whether the defendant has
5 of 14
94 established by a preponderance of the evidence that they are a Survivor as defined in Section 2
95 above and that their alleged criminal offense was related to their experiences as a Survivor such
96 that they are eligible for relief pursuant to this Act and 2) whether the conditions of diversion are
97 feasible and will contribute to the well-being of the defendant and their community.
98 c) No consent by the defendant to the stay of proceedings or any act done or
99 statement made in fulfillment of the terms and conditions of such stay of proceedings shall be

102 charge or charges;
103 d) If the defendant has performed satisfactorily in diversion, at the end of the period
104 of diversion, the court shall enter a dismissal of the underlying case. A court may conclude that
105 the defendant has performed satisfactorily if the defendant has substantially complied with the
106 conditions of diversion and not willfully violated any other conditions set by the court. If the
107 defendant does not perform satisfactorily in diversion, the court may extend the period of
108 diversion and modify the conditions; or the court may reinstate criminal or delinquency
109 proceedings.

111 of this Act.
