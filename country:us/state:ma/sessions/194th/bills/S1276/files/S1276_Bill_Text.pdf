12 ten years or more is prescribed in chapter 94C; (f) a violation of section 13B of chapter 268; (g) a

21 offense involving a child as defined in section 178C of chapter 6; a violation of section 13, 13 ½,
22 13B, 13B ½, 13 B ¾, 13F, 18B, 22, 22A, 22B, 22C, 23, 23A, 23B, 24, 25, 26B, 26C, 37, 43A, 50

27 bodily injury; conspiracy or solicitation to commit any of the above enumerated crimes.
28 SECTION 2. Said chapter 276 is hereby amended by striking out subsection (3) of
29 section 58A and inserting in place thereof the following subsection:-
30 (a) If, after a hearing pursuant to the provisions of subsection (4), the district or superior
31 court justice finds by clear and convincing evidence that no conditions of release will reasonably
32 assure the safety of any other person or the community, said justice shall order the detention of
33 the person prior to trial. A person so detained shall be detained until the disposition of the case
2 of 5

34 and shall brought to trial as soon as reasonably possible and subject to the requirements of Rule
35 36.
36 (b) Nothing in this section shall be construed as modifying or limiting the presumption of
37 innocence.
38 (c) A hearing under this section may be reopened by the judge, at any time before trial, or
39 upon a motion of the commonwealth or the person detained if the judge finds that: (i)
40 information exists that was not known at the time of the hearing or that there has been a change
41 in circumstances and (ii) that such information or change in circumstances has a material bearing
42 on the issue of whether there are conditions of release that will reasonably assure the safety of
43 any other person or the community.
44 (d) On an annual basis, the Secretary of Public Safety shall conduct an analysis of
45 prosecutorial decisions to seek dangerousness hearings within the Commonwealth, and judicial
46 determinations of dangerousness when a hearing is conducted. Such analysis shall examine the
47 treatment of offenders and determine whether offenders who are charged with the same offenses
48 and who have similar criminal histories are treated equally to one another, or whether there is
49 disparate impact by race, gender, or ethnicity. The trial court shall provide to the Department of
50 Criminal Justice Information Services data regarding the number and location of dangerousness-
51 eligible offenses, the number of dangerousness hearings that are conducted, the outcome of such
52 hearings, and the demographic information of the accused parties. The analysis of the Secretary
53 of Public Safety shall be presented to the General Court and shall be a public document.
54 SECTION 3. Said chapter 276 is hereby amended by adding to the conclusion of section
55 58, as appearing in the 2016 Official Edition, the following subsection:-
3 of 5

56 (1) Any adult who has been charged with a crime, and any adult guardian of a juvenile
57 who has been charged with an act of delinquency, shall be requested to voluntarily provide the
58 court with his or her cellular telephone number, if the defendant or guardian has such a device,
59 but may decline to do so; provided, however, that upon the order of a judicial officer a defendant
60 may be required to provide such information. The executive office of the trial court shall
61 procure or establish a service using a system of automated text messaging to remind criminal
62 defendants of mandatory court appearance dates in advance of the date of such appearance. Such
63 service shall be made available to all criminal defendants and to the guardians of juvenile
64 defendants free of charge. Information so provided by a criminal defendant or the guardian of a
65 juvenile defendant pursuant to this subsection shall not be deemed to be a public record, shall not
66 be provided to law enforcement agencies for criminal investigative purposes, and may not be
67 used against the defendant in any criminal proceeding; provided, however, that the fact that a
68 party did or did not participate in this system shall be marked on the docket, and such fact may
69 be used in a proceeding if otherwise admissible. This subsection shall take effect on July 1, 2023.
70 SECTION 4. Said chapter 276 is hereby amended by inserting after section 82A the
71 following section:-
72 Section 82B. (1) A person who violates any non-financial condition of release ordered
73 under section 58 of chapter 119, section 58, 58A, 58B, 59, or 87 of this chapter, or section 1 or
74 1A of chapter 279; or any other non-financial condition of probation imposed by a court after
75 conviction or admission to sufficient facts; or any non-financial term or condition of parole
76 imposed by the parole board; may be arrested upon probable cause by a sheriff, deputy sheriff or
77 police officer and kept in custody in a convenient place, not more than 24 hours, Sunday
78 excepted, until notice of the violation can be given to the probation service, and such person be
4 of 5

79 taken before the issuing court upon a warrant obtained by the probation service; or, in the case of
80 a person under parole supervision, to the parole board.
81 (2) The trial court, the probation service and the parole board shall promptly provide to
82 the department of criminal justice information services records of all non-financial conditions of
83 release imposed upon criminal defendants and delinquent children, and all non-financial
84 conditions of probation and parole, and the department of criminal justice information services
85 shall make such information accessible in electronic format to sheriffs, deputy sheriffs and police
86 officers.
87 SECTION 5. Chapter 268 of the General Laws is hereby amended by inserting after
88 section 13D the following section:-
89 Section 13E. Whoever unlawfully removes, destroys, damages, or interferes with the
90 proper functioning of a court-imposed geolocation monitoring device, any breath-testing
91 instrument, or any other mechanical or electronic mechanism intended to facilitate recognizance
92 or compliance with conditions of pretrial release, probation or parole, shall be punished by
93 imprisonment in the state prison for not more than 10 years or imprisonment in a house of
94 correction for not more than 2 and ½ years. A sentence imposed for violation of this section
95 shall not run concurrently with any other sentence. In any subsequent proceeding under section
96 58, 58A, 58B or 59 of chapter 276, the fact of a person’s prior violation of this section shall be
97 prima facie evidence that there is no financial condition or other condition of release that will
98 reasonably assure the presence of the person so convicted.
