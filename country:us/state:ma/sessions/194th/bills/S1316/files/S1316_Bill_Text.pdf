In the One Hundred and Ninety-Fourth General Court
(2025-2026)
_______________
An Act creating an employer’s duty of care to safeguard its employees from workplace bullying.
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives in General Court assembled, and by the authority
of the same, as follows:
1 The General Laws, as appearing in the 2022 Official Edition, are hereby amended by
2 inserting after chapter 149A the following chapter:-
3 Chapter 149B. The Healthy Workplace Act
4 Section 1. Legislative Findings and Purpose
5 Whereas, the social and economic well-being of the State is dependent upon healthy and
6 productive employees;
7 Whereas, approximately a third of all employees will directly experience health-
8 endangering workplace bullying during their working lives;
1 of 8

9 Whereas, workplace bullying can negatively affect an employee’s mental and physical
10 health and inflict serious harm, including, among other things, feelings of shame and
11 humiliation, severe anxiety, depression, suicidal ideation, impaired immune systems,
12 hypertension, increased risk of cardiovascular disease, and post-traumatic stress disorder;
13 Whereas, workplace bullying can have serious consequences for employers, including
14 reduced employee productivity and morale, greater levels of fear and distrust, higher turnover
15 and absenteeism rates, and increased demands on employee benefit programs, including health
16 care coverage;
17 Whereas, if employees who have been subjected to workplace bullying cannot establish
18 that the behavior was motivated by protected class membership status such as race, color, sex,
19 sexual orientation, national origin, disability, or age, or by retaliation for engaging in protected
20 whistleblowing, then they are unlikely to enjoy legal protection against such abuse;
21 Whereas, legal protection from abusive work environments should not be limited to
22 behavior grounded in protected class status; and,
23 Whereas, existing workers’ compensation plans, occupational safety and health laws, and
24 common-law tort actions are inadequate to discourage workplace bullying or to provide relief to
25 employees who have been harmed by workplace bullying.
26 Whereas, it is the purpose of this chapter to create an enforceable duty of care for
27 employers to engage in reasonable preventive and responsive actions to safeguard employees
28 from workplace bullying and to abstain from retaliating against employees who act pursuant to
29 their rights under this chapter.

30 Section 2. Definitions
31 “Workplace bullying”: when an employer or one or more its employees, subjects an
32 employee to an abusive work environment that causes physical harm, psychological harm, or
33 both;
34 "Abusive work environment”: acts, omissions, or both, that a reasonable person would
35 find constitutes an abusive work environment, based on the severity, nature, and frequency of the
36 conduct, including, but not limited to: repeated verbal abuse such as targeted derogatory remarks,
37 insults, epithets, or ridicule; verbal, non-verbal, or physical conduct of a threatening,
38 intimidating, or humiliating nature; defamatory statements that undermine an employee’s
39 vocational and personal reputation; the sabotage or deliberate undermining of an employee’s
40 work performance; and orchestrated patterns of ostracism. A single act normally shall not
41 constitute an abusive work environment, but an especially severe and egregious act may meet
42 this standard. Pertinent online communications and off-site conduct between employees shall be
43 included in determining whether an abusive work environment exists. Conduct that exploits an
44 employee’s known psychological or physical illness or disability shall be considered an
45 aggravating factor in determining whether an abusive work environment exists. A single act
46 normally shall not constitute an abusive work environment, but an especially severe and
47 egregious act may meet this standard. Pertinent online communications and off-site conduct
48 between employees shall be included in determining whether an abusive work environment
49 exists. Conduct that exploits an employee’s known psychological or physical illness or disability
50 shall be considered an aggravating factor in determining whether an abusive work environment
51 exists. An adverse employment action as defined in Section 2(c) and associated with behaviors
3 of 8

52 defined in this section shall be considered an aggravating factor in determining whether an
53 abusive work environment exists.
54 “Adverse employment action”: an outcome that negatively impacts an employee,
55 including but not limited to, termination, constructive discharge, suspension, or reduction in
56 compensation.
57 “Constructive discharge”: an adverse employment action where: (1) the employee
58 reasonably believed they were subjected to workplace bullying; (2) the employee resigned
59 because of that mistreatment; and (3) the employer was aware of the workplace bullying prior to
60 the resignation and failed to stop it.
61 “Retaliation”: retaliatory acts or omissions, by way of an adverse employment action or
62 other material response that would dissuade a reasonable person from exercising their rights
63 under this chapter, directed at an employee because they opposed any employment practice
64 under this chapter, or made a charge, testified, assisted, or participated in any manner in an
65 investigation or proceeding under this chapter.
66 “Psychological harm”: the impairment of a person’s mental health, as established by
67 competent evidence.
68 “Physical harm”: the impairment of a person’s physical health or bodily integrity, as
69 established by competent evidence.

141 corresponding timing and remedial sufficiency of the employer’s offer. It further shall be a
142 rebuttable presumption that an employee is acting reasonably by refusing to work under the
143 supervision of any co-employee who engaged in the behaviors violative of this chapter.
