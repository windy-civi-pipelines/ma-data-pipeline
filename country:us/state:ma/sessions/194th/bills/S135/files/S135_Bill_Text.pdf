50 SECTION 9. There shall be established a special legislative commission, hereinafter the
51 commission, to investigate the creation of a new certification for child welfare workers at the
52 department of children and families. The commission shall consist of the house and senate chairs
53 of the joint committee on children, families, and persons with disabilities, or their designees, who
54 shall serve as co-chairs; the child advocate, or a designee; the commissioner of the department of
55 children and families, or their designee; two current workers employed by the department of
56 children and families and appointed by SEIU Local 509 who have served at the department for
57 over five years; two representatives of child or family welfare organizations from communities
58 which are disproportionately involved with the department of children and families, appointed by
59 the co-chairs; and two individuals previously personally involved with the department of
60 children and families, appointed by the co-chairs. All appointments shall be made not later than
61 60 days after the effective date of this act. The commission shall convene its first meeting not
62 more than 90 days from the effective date of this act.
63 The commission shall examine the feasibility and make recommendations regarding the
64 creation of a new certification for child welfare workers at the department of children and
65 families, including, without limitation: (1) whether social work licensure, as outlined in section
66 121 of Chapter 112 of the general laws, is the only appropriate qualification to be a child welfare
67 professional employed by the department of children and families; (2) explore the possibility of a
68 new certification or form of licensure to be made available in addition to social work licensure,
69 with training and education requirements specific to child protection and the work of the
70 department of children and families; (3) consider what would qualify an individual for this new
71 certification, recognizing that standardized tests are inherently biased and do not effectively
72 evaluate a person’s ability to provide services to children and families; (4) ensure that the
4 of 5

73 recommended criteria for child welfare certification not serve as a barrier to certification for
74 members of communities disproportionately involved with the department of children and
75 families, and ensures parity for workforce access regardless of primary language, cultural
76 background, or race.
77 The Commission shall, no later than fifteen months from the effective date of this act,
78 report to the general court on the results of its investigation and study together with its finding,
79 by filing the same with the clerks of the house of representatives and senate who shall forward
80 the same to the secretary of the executive office of health and human services, the house and
81 senate committees on ways and means, the joint committee on children, families, and persons
82 with disabilities, and the joint committee on consumer protection and professional licensure.
