3 Section 52F. (a) Notwithstanding any general or special law or rule or regulation to the

6 guardian, including but not limited to, divorce, paternity, actions arising out of chapter 209c for
7 custody-support-parenting time, and modifications or enforcement of all such actions.
8 (b) An employee may elect, or an employer may require the employee, to substitute any
9 of the accrued paid vacation leave, personal leave, or medical or sick leave of the employee for

10 any of the leave provided under this section, but nothing in this section shall require an employer
11 to provide paid sick leave or paid medical leave in any situation in which the employer would
12 not normally provide any such paid leave. Leave under this section may be taken intermittently
13 or on a reduced leave schedule.
14 (c) If the necessity for leave under this section is foreseeable, the employee shall provide
15 the employer with not less than seven days of notice before the date the leave is to begin. If the
16 necessity for leave is not foreseeable, the employee shall provide such notice as is practicable.
17 (d) An employer may require that a request for leave under this section be supported by a
18 certification issued at such time and in such manner as the attorney general may by regulation
19 require.
20 (e) The attorney general shall enforce this section, and may obtain injunctive or
21 declaratory relief for this purpose. Violation of this section shall be subject to the second
22 paragraph of section 150 and to section 180.
