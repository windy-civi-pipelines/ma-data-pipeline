16 to consent to the release of information, through the prescription monitoring program, about the
17 administration of opioid maintenance treatment at the facility. Said consent form shall be
18 accompanied by information clearly explaining that such consent is not required but is
19 encouraged to improve coordination of services; and by information on how the individual may
20 complete and return the form to the facility or to the department of public health if they elect to
21 give such consent. A record of the individual’s election relative to this form shall be maintained
22 by the facility as part of the record of treatment required by this section. The same form and
23 information shall be presented to the individual upon their discharge from the facility.
