3 Section 245. (a) Notwithstanding any general or special law to the contrary, the
4 Department of Public Health shall promulgate regulations to allow businesses and other entities
5 to be prescribed epinephrine auto-injectors for the purposes of:
6 (1) providing an epinephrine auto-injector for immediate self-administration to any
7 individual that an employee, designated individual, agent of the business, or other entity believes

11 (2) administering an epinephrine auto-injector to any individual by an employee,
12 designated individual, or agent who has successfully completed the applicable training required
13 by regulation in accordance with this section.

15 injectors in accordance with this section and its employees, designated individuals, and agents;
16 an individual authorized to administer epinephrine auto-injectors pursuant to subsection (c); a
17 health care professional that prescribes or dispenses epinephrine auto-injectors pursuant to this
18 section; and a person who conducts the applicable training shall not be liable for any injuries or
19 damages that result from any act or omission related to the administration or self-administration
20 of an epinephrine auto-injector in accordance with this section that may constitute ordinary
21 negligence. This immunity does not apply to acts or omissions constituting gross, willful, or
22 wanton negligence. The administration of an epinephrine auto-injector in accordance with this
23 section is not the practice of medicine.
24 (c) Any business or other entity that possesses epinephrine auto-injectors pursuant to this

27 epinephrine auto-injectors to any individual believed in good faith to be experiencing
28 anaphylaxis, if the epinephrine auto-injectors are stored in a locked, secure container and are
29 made available only upon remote authorization by a licensed physician or nurse practitioner after
30 consultation with the physician or nurse practitioner by audio, televideo, or other similar means
31 of electronic communication. Consultation with a physician or nurse practitioner for this purpose
32 shall not be considered the practice of telemedicine or otherwise be construed as violating any
33 law or rule regulating the physician or nurse practitionerâ€™s practice.
