451 promulgated hereunder shall have standing as statutory law.

453 administrative proceeding in a member state pertaining to the subject matter of this compact
454 which may affect the powers, responsibilities or actions of the Commission.
455 3. The Commission shall be entitled to receive service of process in any such
456 proceeding, and shall have standing to intervene in such a proceeding for all purposes. Failure to

459 B. Default, Technical Assistance, and Termination
460 1. If the Commission determines that a member state has defaulted in the
461 performance of its obligations or responsibilities under this compact or the promulgated rules,
462 the Commission shall:
463 a. Provide written notice to the defaulting state and other member states of the
464 nature of the default, the proposed means of curing the default and/or any other action to be
465 taken by the Commission; and
466 b. Provide remedial training and specific technical assistance regarding the default.
24 of 28
467 2. If a state in default fails to cure the default, the defaulting state may be terminated
468 from the compact upon an affirmative vote of a majority of the member states, and all rights,
469 privileges and benefits conferred by this compact may be terminated on the effective date of
470 termination. A cure of the default does not relieve the offending state of obligations or liabilities
471 incurred during the period of default.
472 3. Termination of membership in the compact shall be imposed only after all other
473 means of securing compliance have been exhausted. Notice of intent to suspend or terminate
474 shall be given by the Commission to the governor, the majority and minority leaders of the
475 defaulting state’s legislature, and each of the member states.
476 4. A state that has been terminated is responsible for all assessments, obligations,
477 and liabilities incurred through the effective date of termination, including obligations that
478 extend beyond the effective date of termination.
479 5. The Commission shall not bear any costs related to a state that is found to be in
480 default or that has been terminated from the compact, unless agreed upon in writing between the
481 Commission and the defaulting state.
482 6. The defaulting state may appeal the action of the Commission by petitioning the
483 U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia or the federal district where the Commission has
484 its principal offices. The prevailing member shall be awarded all costs of such litigation,
485 including reasonable attorney’s fees.

488 disputes related to the compact that arise among member states and between member and non-
489 member states.
490 2. The Commission shall promulgate a rule providing for both mediation and
491 binding dispute resolution for disputes as appropriate.
492 D. Enforcement
493 1. The Commission, in the reasonable exercise of its discretion, shall enforce the
494 provisions and rules of this compact.
495 2. By majority vote, the Commission may initiate legal action in the United States
496 District Court for the District of Columbia or the federal district where the Commission has its
497 principal offices against a member state in default to enforce compliance with the provisions of
498 the compact and its promulgated rules and bylaws. The relief sought may include both injunctive
499 relief and damages. In the event judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing member shall
500 be awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorney’s fees.
501 3. The remedies herein shall not be the exclusive remedies of the Commission. The
502 Commission may pursue any other remedies available under federal or state law.
503 Section 11. DATE OF IMPLEMENTATION OF THE INTERSTATE COMMISSION
504 FOR PHYSICAL THERAPY PRACTICE AND ASSOCIATED RULES, WITHDRAWAL,

26 of 28
508 shall be limited to the powers granted to the Commission relating to assembly and the
509 promulgation of rules. Thereafter, the Commission shall meet and exercise rulemaking powers
510 necessary to the implementation and administration of the compact.
511 B. Any state that joins the compact subsequent to the Commission’s initial adoption
512 of the rules shall be subject to the rules as they exist on the date on which the compact becomes
513 law in that state. Any rule that has been previously adopted by the Commission shall have the
514 full force and effect of law on the day the compact becomes law in that state.
515 C. Any member state may withdraw from this compact by enacting a statute
516 repealing the same.
517 1. A member state’s withdrawal shall not take effect until six (6) months after
518 enactment of the repealing statute.
519 2. Withdrawal shall not affect the continuing requirement of the withdrawing state’s
520 physical therapy licensing board to comply with the investigative and adverse action reporting
521 requirements of this act prior to the effective date of withdrawal.
522 D. Nothing contained in this compact shall be construed to invalidate or prevent any
523 physical therapy licensure agreement or other cooperative arrangement between a member state
524 and a non-member state that does not conflict with the provisions of this compact.
525 E. This compact may be amended by the member states. No amendment to this
526 compact shall become effective and binding upon any member state until it is enacted into the
527 laws of all member states.
528 Section 12. CONSTRUCTION AND SEVERABILITY
27 of 28
529 This compact shall be liberally construed so as to effectuate the purposes thereof. The
530 provisions of this compact shall be severable and if any phrase, clause, sentence or provision of
531 this compact is declared to be contrary to the constitution of any party state or of the United
532 States or the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or circumstance is held
533 invalid, the validity of the remainder of this compact and the applicability thereof to any
534 government, agency, person or circumstance shall not be affected thereby. If this compact shall
535 be held contrary to the constitution of any party state, the compact shall remain in full force and
536 effect as to the remaining party states and in full force and effect as to the party state affected as
537 to all severable matters.

468 from the compact upon an affirmative vote of a majority of the member states, and all rights,
469 privileges and benefits conferred by this compact may be terminated on the effective date of
470 termination. A cure of the default does not relieve the offending state of obligations or liabilities
471 incurred during the period of default.
472 3. Termination of membership in the compact shall be imposed only after all other
473 means of securing compliance have been exhausted. Notice of intent to suspend or terminate

475 defaulting state’s legislature, and each of the member states.

497 principal offices against a member state in default to enforce compliance with the provisions of
498 the compact and its promulgated rules and bylaws. The relief sought may include both injunctive
499 relief and damages. In the event judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing member shall
500 be awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorney’s fees.
501 3. The remedies herein shall not be the exclusive remedies of the Commission. The
502 Commission may pursue any other remedies available under federal or state law.
503 Section 11. DATE OF IMPLEMENTATION OF THE INTERSTATE COMMISSION
504 FOR PHYSICAL THERAPY PRACTICE AND ASSOCIATED RULES, WITHDRAWAL,

514 full force and effect of law on the day the compact becomes law in that state.
515 C. Any member state may withdraw from this compact by enacting a statute
516 repealing the same.
517 1. A member state’s withdrawal shall not take effect until six (6) months after
518 enactment of the repealing statute.
519 2. Withdrawal shall not affect the continuing requirement of the withdrawing state’s
520 physical therapy licensing board to comply with the investigative and adverse action reporting
521 requirements of this act prior to the effective date of withdrawal.
522 D. Nothing contained in this compact shall be construed to invalidate or prevent any
523 physical therapy licensure agreement or other cooperative arrangement between a member state
524 and a non-member state that does not conflict with the provisions of this compact.
525 E. This compact may be amended by the member states. No amendment to this

527 laws of all member states.
528 Section 12. CONSTRUCTION AND SEVERABILITY
27 of 28

529 This compact shall be liberally construed so as to effectuate the purposes thereof. The
530 provisions of this compact shall be severable and if any phrase, clause, sentence or provision of

532 States or the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or circumstance is held
533 invalid, the validity of the remainder of this compact and the applicability thereof to any
534 government, agency, person or circumstance shall not be affected thereby. If this compact shall
