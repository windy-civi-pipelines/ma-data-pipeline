70 movement occurs, through:
71 (a) Evaluate alternative ways to reduce risks associated with patient and equipment
72 handling, including evaluation of equipment and patient care and patient support environments;
73 (b) Conduct individual patient care ergonomic evaluations in all patient care areas,
74 following guidance from the Patient Care Ergonomics Resource Guide: Safe Patient Handling

87 mechanical lifting devices, lateral transfer aids, friction reducing devices, and motorized beds.
88 (4) Provide patient handling equipment and technology as stipulated in section (3) which
89 is appropriate for each clinical area and patient or resident population, to reduce the risk of injury
90 to direct caregivers, patients or residents.
91 (5) Provide specialized training in safe patient handling by qualified personnel to all
92 direct caregivers who lift, transfer, or reposition patients, including but not limited to
93 demonstration of proficiency in safe techniques for lifting or transferring patients and the
94 appropriate use of lifting or transferring devices and equipment. Health care facilities must train
95 staff on policies, equipment, and devices at least annually.
96 (6) Develop procedures for direct caregivers to refuse to perform or be involved in patient
97 and equipment handling or movement that the direct caregiver believes in good faith will expose
5 of 7
98 a patient or a direct caregiver to an unacceptable risk of injury without subjecting such direct
99 caregiver to disciplinary action.
100 (7) Prepare an annual performance evaluation report and submit to the governing body or
101 the quality assurance committee on activities related to both the identification, assessment, and
102 development of strategies to control risk of injury to patients and direct caregivers associated
103 with the lifting, transferring, repositioning, or movement of a patient with statistics on the

110 patients; and outcomes; to the extent permitted by privacy regulations.;
111 (9) Identify the type and quantity of patient handling equipment and other equipment
112 required and ensure that the purchase of other acquisition of all such equipment is incorporated
113 into the safe patient handling program; and
114 (10). Develop a comprehensive tracking system for all equipment purchased for the safe
115 patient handling and mobility program, including ensuring proper maintenance of said
116 equipment.
117 By December 30, 2024, health care facilities shall complete the acquisition of safe patient
118 handling equipment determined to be required by their safe patient handling and mobility
119 committee. Such equipment shall include, though not be limited to: (a) at least one readily
6 of 7
120 available lift and all necessary components per unit unless the facility’s safe patient handling and
121 mobility committee determines that more lifts are required on the unit.
122 The department shall ensure that every health care facility has in place a safe patient
123 handling and mobility program and has completed the acquisition of all equipment and
124 technology deemed necessary by the facility’s safe patient handling and mobility committee. The
125 department shall also develop methods to ensure compliance including, but not limited to,
126 penalties for non-compliance.
127 Within one year of passage, any development of architectural plans for constructing or
128 remodeling a healthcare facility or a unit of a healthcare facility must incorporate patient
129 handling equipment and the construction design needed to accommodate such equipment as
130 deemed necessary by the safe patient handling and mobility committee.
