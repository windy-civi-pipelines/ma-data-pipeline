(2025-2026)
_______________
An Act relative to physician assistant interstate compact.
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives in General Court assembled, and by the authority
of the same, as follows:
1 SECTION 1. The General Laws are hereby amended by inserting after chapter 112A the
2 following chapter:-
3 Chapter 112B. Physician Assistant Licensure Compact.
4 Section 1. In order to strengthen access to medical services, and in recognition of the
5 advances in the delivery of medical services, the participating states of the physician assistant
6 licensure compact have allied in common purpose to develop a comprehensive process that
7 complements the existing authority of state licensing boards to license and discipline physician
8 assistants and seeks to enhance the portability of a license to practice as a physician assistant
9 while safeguarding the safety of patients. This compact allows medical services to be provided
10 by physician assistants, via the mutual recognition of the licensee’s qualifying license by other
11 compact participating states. This compact also adopts the prevailing standard for physician
12 assistant licensure and affirms that the practice and delivery of medical services by the physician
1 of 34

13 assistant occurs where the patient is located at the time of the patient encounter, and therefore
14 requires the physician assistant to be under the jurisdiction of the state licensing board where the
15 patient is located. State licensing boards that participate in this compact retain the jurisdiction to
16 impose adverse action against a compact privilege in that state issued to a physician assistant
17 through the procedures of this compact. The physician assistant licensure compact will alleviate
18 burdens for military families by allowing active duty military personnel and their spouses to
19 obtain a compact privilege based on having an unrestricted license in good standing from a
20 participating state.
21 Section 2.
22 As used in this chapter, unless the context requires otherwise, the following words shall
23 have the following meanings:
24 “Adverse action”, any administrative, civil, equitable, or criminal action permitted
25 by a state’s laws which is imposed by a licensing board or other authority against a
26 physician assistant license or license application or compact privilege such as license denial,

165 competent jurisdiction, according to the practice and procedure of that court applicable to
166 subpoenas issued in proceedings pending before it. The issuing authority shall pay any witness
167 fees, travel expenses, mileage and other fees required by the service statutes of the state in which

171 taking adverse action against a licensee’s compact privilege or application for a compact
172 privilege in that participating state; and

180 laws to determine appropriate action.

386 employment, duties, or responsibilities, or as determined by the commission that the person
387 against whom the claim is made had a reasonable basis for believing occurred within the scope
388 of commission employment, duties, or responsibilities; provided that nothing herein shall be
389 construed to prohibit that person from retaining their own counsel at their own expense; and
390 provided further, that the actual or alleged act, error, or omission did not result from that
391 person’s intentional or willful or wanton misconduct.
392 (3) The commission shall indemnify and hold harmless any member, officer, executive
393 director, employee, and representative of the commission for the amount of any settlement or
394 judgment obtained against that person arising out of any actual or alleged act, error, or omission
395 that occurred within the scope of commission employment, duties, or responsibilities, or that
396 such person had a reasonable basis for believing occurred within the scope of commission
397 employment, duties, or responsibilities, provided that the actual or alleged act, error, or omission
398 did not result from the intentional or willful or wanton misconduct of that person.
399 (4) Venue is proper and judicial proceedings by or against the commission shall be
400 brought solely and exclusively in a court of competent jurisdiction where the principal office of
401 the commission is located. The commission may waive venue and jurisdictional defenses in any
402 proceedings as authorized by commission rules.
20 of 34

403 (5) Nothing herein shall be construed as a limitation on the liability of any licensee for
404 professional malpractice or misconduct, which shall be governed solely by any other applicable
405 state laws.
406 (6) Nothing herein shall be construed to designate the venue or jurisdiction to bring
407 actions for alleged acts of malpractice, professional misconduct, negligence, or other such civil
408 action pertaining to the practice of a physician assistant. All such matters shall be determined
409 exclusively by state law other than this compact.
410 (7) Nothing in this compact shall be interpreted to waive or otherwise abrogate a
411 participating state’s state action immunity or state action affirmative defense with respect to
412 antitrust claims under the Sherman Act, Clayton Act, or any other state or federal antitrust or
413 anticompetitive law or regulation.
414 (8) Nothing in this compact shall be construed to be a waiver of sovereign immunity by
415 the participating states or by the commission.
416 Section 8. (a) The commission shall provide for the development, maintenance,
417 operation, and utilization of a coordinated data and reporting system containing licensure,
418 adverse action, and the reporting of the existence of significant investigative information on all
419 licensed physician assistants and applicants denied a license in participating states.
420 (b) Notwithstanding any other state law to the contrary, a participating state shall submit
421 a uniform data set to the data system on all physician assistants to whom this compact is
422 applicable, utilizing a unique identifier as required by the rules of the commission, including:
423 (1) identifying information;
21 of 34

424 (2) licensure data;
425 (3) adverse actions against a license or compact privilege;
426 (4) any denial of application for licensure, and the reason or reasons for such denial,
427 excluding the reporting of any criminal history record information where prohibited by law;
428 (5) the existence of significant investigative information; and
429 (6) other information that may facilitate the administration of this compact, as determined
430 by the rules of the commission.
431 (c) Significant investigative information pertaining to a licensee in any participating state
432 shall only be available to other participating states.
433 (d) The commission shall promptly notify all participating states of any adverse action
434 taken against a licensee or an individual applying for a license that has been reported to it. This
435 adverse action information shall be available to any other participating state.
436 (e) Participating states contributing information to the data system may, in accordance
437 with state or federal law, designate information that may not be shared with the public without
438 the express permission of the contributing state. Notwithstanding any such designation, such
439 information shall be reported to the commission through the data system.
440 (f) Any information submitted to the data system that is subsequently expunged pursuant
441 to federal law or the laws of the participating state contributing the information shall be removed
442 from the data system upon reporting of such by the participating state to the commission.
22 of 34

443 (g) The records and information provided to a participating state pursuant to this compact
444 or through the data system, when certified by the commission or an agent thereof, shall constitute
445 the authenticated business records of the commission, and shall be entitled to any associated
446 hearsay exception in any relevant judicial, quasi-judicial or administrative
447 proceedings in a participating state.
448 Section 9. (a) The commission shall exercise its rulemaking powers pursuant to the
449 criteria in this section and the rules adopted thereunder. Commission rules shall become binding
450 as of the date specified by the commission for each rule.
451 (b) The commission shall promulgate reasonable rules in order to effectively and
452 efficiently implement and administer this compact and achieve its purposes. A commission rule
453 shall be invalid and not have force or effect only if a court of competent jurisdiction holds that
454 the rule is invalid because the commission exercised its rulemaking authority in a manner that is
455 beyond the scope of the purposes of this compact, or the powers granted hereunder, or based
456 upon another applicable standard of review.
457 (c) The rules of the commission shall have the force of law in each participating state,
458 provided however that where the rules of the commission conflict with the laws of the
459 participating state that establish the medical services a physician assistant may perform in the
460 participating state, as held by a court of competent jurisdiction, the rules of the commission shall
461 be ineffective in that state to the extent of the conflict.
462 (d) If a majority of the legislatures of the participating states rejects a commission rule,
463 by enactment of a statute or resolution in the same manner used to adopt this compact within 4
23 of 34

464 years of the date of adoption of the rule, then such rule shall have no further force and effect in
465 any participating state or to any state applying to participate in the compact.
466 (e) Commission rules shall be adopted at a regular or special meeting of the commission.
467 (f) Prior to promulgation and adoption of a final rule or rules by the commission, and at
468 least 30 days in advance of the meeting at which the rule will be considered and voted upon, the
469 commission shall file a notice of proposed rulemaking:
470 (1) on the website of the commission or other publicly accessible platform;
471 (2) to persons who have requested notice of the commission’s notices of proposed
472 rulemaking; and
473 (3) in such other ways as the commission may by rule specify.
474 (g) The notice of proposed rulemaking shall include:
475 (1) the time, date, and location of the public hearing on the proposed rule and the
476 proposed time, date and location of the meeting in which the proposed rule will be considered
477 and voted upon;
478 (2) the text of the proposed rule and the reason for the proposed rule;
479 (3) a request for comments on the proposed rule from any interested person and the date
480 by which written comments must be received; and
481 (4) the manner in which interested persons may submit notice to the commission of their
482 intention to attend the public hearing or provide any written comments.
24 of 34

483 (h) Prior to adoption of a proposed rule, the commission shall allow persons to submit
484 written data, facts, opinions, and arguments, which shall be made available to the public.
485 (i) If the hearing is to be held via electronic means, the commission shall publish the
486 mechanism for access to the electronic hearing.
487 (1) All persons wishing to be heard at the hearing shall as directed in the notice of
488 proposed rulemaking, not less than 5 business days before the scheduled date of the hearing,
489 notify the commission of their desire to appear and testify at the hearing.
490 (2) Hearings shall be conducted in a manner providing each person who wishes to
491 comment a fair and reasonable opportunity to comment orally or in writing.
492 (3) All hearings shall be recorded. A copy of the recording and the written comments,
493 data, facts, opinions, and arguments received in response to the proposed rulemaking shall be
494 made available to a person upon request.
495 (4) Nothing in this section shall be construed as requiring a separate hearing on each
496 proposed rule. Proposed rules may be grouped for the convenience of the commission at hearings
497 required by this section.
498 (j) Following the public hearing the commission shall consider all written and oral
499 comments timely received.
500 (k) The commission shall, by majority vote of all delegates, take final action on the
501 proposed rule and shall determine the effective date of the rule, if adopted, based on the
502 rulemaking record and the full text of the rule.
503 (1) If adopted, the rule shall be posted on the commission’s website.
25 of 34

504 (2) The commission may adopt changes to the proposed rule provided the changes do not
505 enlarge the original purpose of the proposed rule.
506 (3) The commission shall provide on its website an explanation of the reasons for
507 substantive changes made to the proposed rule as well as reasons for substantive changes not
508 made that were recommended by commenters.
509 (4) The commission shall determine a reasonable effective date for the rule. Except for an
510 emergency as provided in subsection (l), the effective date of the rule shall be no sooner than 30
511 days after the commission issued the notice that it adopted the rule.
512 (l) Upon determination that an emergency exists, the commission may consider and adopt
513 an emergency rule with 24 hours prior notice, without the opportunity for comment, or hearing,
514 provided that the usual rulemaking procedures provided in this compact and in this section shall
515 be retroactively applied to the rule as soon as reasonably possible, in no event later than 90 days
516 after the effective date of the rule. For the purposes of this provision, an emergency rule is one
517 that must be adopted immediately by the commission in order to:
518 (1) meet an imminent threat to public health, safety, or welfare;
519 (2) prevent a loss of commission or participating state funds;
520 (3) meet a deadline for the promulgation of a commission rule that is established by
521 federal law or rule; or
522 (4) protect public health and safety.
523 (m) The commission or an authorized committee of the commission may direct revisions
524 to a previously adopted commission rule for purposes of correcting typographical errors, errors
26 of 34

525 in format, errors in consistency, or grammatical errors. Public notice of any revisions shall be
526 posted on the website of the commission. The revision shall be subject to challenge by any
527 person for a period of 30 days after posting. The revision may be challenged only on grounds
528 that the revision results in a material change to a rule. A challenge shall be made as set forth in
529 the notice of revisions and delivered to the commission prior to the end of the notice period. If no
530 challenge is made, the revision will take effect without further action. If the revision is
531 challenged, the revision may not take effect without the approval of the commission.
532 (n) No participating state’s rulemaking requirements shall apply under this compact.
533 Section 10. (a)(1) The executive and judicial branches of state government in each
534 participating state shall enforce this compact and take all actions necessary and appropriate to
535 implement the compact.
536 (2) Venue is proper and judicial proceedings by or against the commission shall be
537 brought solely and exclusively in a court of competent jurisdiction where the principal office of
538 the commission is located. The commission may waive venue and jurisdictional defenses to the
539 extent it adopts or consents to participate in alternative dispute resolution proceedings. Nothing
540 herein shall affect or limit the selection or propriety of venue in any action against a licensee for
541 professional malpractice, misconduct or any such similar matter.
542 (3) The commission shall be entitled to receive service of process in any proceeding
543 regarding the enforcement or interpretation of the compact or the commission’s rules and shall
544 have standing to intervene in such a proceeding for all purposes. Failure to provide the
545 commission with service of process shall render a judgment or order in such proceeding void as
546 to the commission, this compact, or commission rules.
27 of 34

547 (b) (1) If the commission determines that a participating state has defaulted in the
548 performance of its obligations or responsibilities under this compact or the commission rules, the
549 commission shall provide written notice to the defaulting state and other participating states. The
550 notice shall describe the default, the proposed means of curing the default and any other action
551 that the commission may take and shall offer remedial training and specific technical assistance
552 regarding the default.
553 (2) If a state in default fails to cure the default, the defaulting state may be terminated
554 from this compact upon an affirmative vote of a majority of the delegates of the participating
555 states, and all rights, privileges and benefits conferred by this compact upon such state may be
556 terminated on the effective date of termination. A cure of the default does not relieve the
557 offending state of obligations or liabilities incurred during the period of default.
558 (3) Termination of participation in this compact shall be imposed only after all other
559 means of securing compliance have been exhausted. Notice of intent to suspend or terminate
560 shall be given by the commission to the governor, the majority and minority leaders of the
561 defaulting state’s legislature, and to the licensing board of each of the participating states.
562 (4) A state that has been terminated is responsible for all assessments, obligations, and
563 liabilities incurred through the effective date of termination, including obligations that extend
564 beyond the effective date of termination.
565 (5) The commission shall not bear any costs related to a state that is found to be in default
566 or that has been terminated from this compact, unless agreed upon in writing between the
567 commission and the defaulting state.
28 of 34

568 (6) The defaulting state may appeal its termination from the compact by the commission
569 by petitioning the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia or the federal district where
570 the commission has its principal offices. The prevailing member shall be awarded all costs of
571 such litigation, including reasonable attorney’s fees.
572 (7) Upon the termination of a state’s participation in the compact, the state shall
573 immediately provide notice to all licensees within that state of such termination:
574 (i) licensees who have been granted a compact privilege in that state shall retain the
575 compact privilege for 180 days following the effective date of such termination.
576 (ii) licensees who are licensed in that state who have been granted a compact privilege in
577 a participating state shall retain the compact privilege for 180 days unless the licensee also has a
578 qualifying license in a participating state or obtains a qualifying license in a participating state
579 before the 180-day period ends, in which case the compact privilege shall continue.
580 (c) (1) Upon request by a participating state, the commission shall attempt to resolve
581 disputes related to this compact that arise among participating states and between participating
582 and non-participating states.
583 (2) The commission shall promulgate a rule providing for both mediation and binding
584 dispute resolution for disputes as appropriate.
585 (d)(1) The commission, in the reasonable exercise of its discretion, shall enforce the
586 provisions of this compact and rules of the commission.
587 (2) If compliance is not secured after all means to secure compliance have been
588 exhausted, by majority vote, the commission may initiate legal action in the United States
29 of 34

589 District Court for the District of Columbia or the federal district where the commission has its
590 principal offices, against a participating state in default to enforce compliance with the
591 provisions of this compact and the commission’s promulgated rules and bylaws. The relief
592 sought may include both injunctive relief and damages. In the event judicial enforcement is
593 necessary, the prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable
594 attorney’s fees.
595 (3) The remedies herein shall not be the exclusive remedies of the commission. The
596 commission may pursue any other remedies available under federal or state law.
597 (e)(1) A participating state may initiate legal action against the commission in the U.S.
598 District Court for the District of Columbia or the federal district where the commission has its
599 principal offices to enforce compliance with the provisions of the compact and its rules. The
600 relief sought may include both injunctive relief and damages. In the event judicial enforcement is
601 necessary, the prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable
602 attorney’s fees.
603 (2) No person other than a participating state shall enforce this compact against the
604 commission.
605 Section 11. (a) This compact shall come into effect on the date on which this compact
606 statute is enacted into law in the seventh participating state.
607 (1) On or after the effective date of the compact, the commission shall convene and
608 review the enactment of each of the states that enacted the compact prior to the commission
609 convening referred to as charter participating states, to determine if the statute enacted by each
610 such charter participating state is materially different than the model compact.
30 of 34

611 (i) a charter participating state whose enactment is found to be materially different from
612 the model compact shall be entitled to the default process set forth in subsection (b) of section
613 10.
614 (ii) if any participating state later withdraws from the compact or its participation is
615 terminated, the commission shall remain in existence and the compact shall remain in effect even
616 if the number of participating states should be less than seven. Participating states enacting the
617 compact subsequent to the commission convening shall be subject to the process set forth in
618 paragraph (21) of subsection (c) of section 7 to determine if their enactments are materially
619 different from the model compact and whether they qualify for participation in the compact.
620 (2) Participating states enacting the compact subsequent to the seven initial charter
621 participating states shall be subject to the process set forth in paragraph (21) of subsection (c) of
622 section 7 to determine if their enactments are materially different from the model compact and
623 whether they qualify for participation in the compact.
624 (3) All actions taken for the benefit of the commission or in furtherance of the purposes
625 of the administration of the compact prior to the effective date of the compact or the commission
626 coming into existence shall be considered to be actions of the commission unless specifically
627 repudiated by the commission.
628 (b) Any state that joins this compact shall be subject to the commission’s rules and
629 bylaws as they exist on the date on which this compact becomes law in that state. Any rule that
630 has been previously adopted by the commission shall have the full force and effect of law on the
631 day this compact becomes law in that state.
31 of 34

632 (c) Any participating state may withdraw from this compact by enacting a statute
633 repealing the same.
634 (1) A participating state’s withdrawal shall not take effect until 180 days after enactment
635 of the repealing statute. During this 180 day-period, all compact privileges that were in effect in
636 the withdrawing state and were granted to licensees licensed in the withdrawing state shall
637 remain in effect. If any licensee licensed in the withdrawing state is also licensed in another
638 participating state or obtains a license in another participating state within the 180 days, the
639 licensee’s compact privileges in other participating states shall not be affected by the passage of
640 the 180 days.
641 (2) Withdrawal shall not affect the continuing requirement of the state licensing board of
642 the withdrawing state to comply with the investigative, and adverse action reporting
643 requirements of this compact prior to the effective date of withdrawal.
644 (3) Upon the enactment of a statute withdrawing a state from this compact, the state shall
645 immediately provide notice of such withdrawal to all licensees within that state. Such
646 withdrawing state shall continue to recognize all licenses granted pursuant to this compact for a
647 minimum of 180days after the date of such notice of withdrawal.
648 (d) Nothing contained in this compact shall be construed to invalidate or prevent any
649 physician assistant licensure agreement or other cooperative arrangement between participating
650 states and between a participating state and non-participating state that does not conflict with the
651 provisions of this compact.
652 (e) This compact may be amended by the participating states. No amendment to this
653 compact shall become effective and binding upon any participating state until it is enacted
32 of 34

654 materially in the same manner into the laws of all participating states as determined by the
655 commission.
656 Section 12. (a) This compact and the commission’s rulemaking authority shall be
657 liberally construed so as to effectuate the purposes, and the implementation and administration of
658 the compact. Provisions of the compact expressly authorizing or requiring the promulgation of
659 rules shall not be construed to limit the commission’s rulemaking authority solely for those
660 purposes.
661 (b) The provisions of this compact shall be severable and if any phrase, clause, sentence
662 or provision of this compact is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be contrary to the
663 constitution of any participating state, a state seeking participation in the compact, or of the
664 United States, or the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or circumstance is
665 held to be unconstitutional by a court of competent jurisdiction, the validity of the remainder of
666 this compact and the applicability thereof to any other government, agency, person or
667 circumstance shall not be affected thereby.
668 (c) Notwithstanding subsection (b) or this subsection, the commission may deny a state’s
669 participation in the compact or, in accordance with the requirements of subsection (b) of section
670 (10), terminate a participating state’s participation in the compact, if it determines that a
671 constitutional requirement of a participating state is, or would be with respect to a state seeking
672 to participate in the compact, a material departure from the compact. Otherwise, if this compact
673 shall be held to be contrary to the constitution of any participating state, the compact shall
674 remain in full force and effect as to the remaining participating states and in full force and effect
675 as to the participating state affected as to all severable matters.
33 of 34

676 Section 13. (a) Nothing herein prevents the enforcement of any other law of a
677 participating state that is not inconsistent with this compact.
678 (b) Any laws in a participating state in conflict with this compact are superseded to the
679 extent of the conflict.
680 (c) All agreements between the commission and the participating states are binding in
681 accordance with their terms.
