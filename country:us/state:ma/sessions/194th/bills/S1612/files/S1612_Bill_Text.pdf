76 cemetery or corporation described in section 6, or any employee or agent thereof that disposes of
77 unclaimed remains in accordance with this section. Each municipality or cemetery corporation

80 dead shall be made in a single chamber, vault or tomb wholly or partly above the natural surface
81 of the ground unless the part thereof below such surface is of a permanent character, constructed
82 of materials capable of withstanding extreme climatic conditions, waterproof and air tight, and
83 capable of being sealed permanently to prevent all escape of effluvia, and unless the part thereof
84 above the natural surface of the ground is constructed of natural stone of a standard not less than
85 that required by the United States government for monuments erected in national cemeteries, of
86 durability sufficient to withstand all conditions of weather.
87 Notwithstanding any general or special law to the contrary and for the purposes of this
88 section, a board of health may serve as the duly authorized representative for the purpose of

91 jurisdiction of the board of health; (ii) the board of health has received notice from a licensed
92 funeral director that either no person has come forward to claim the remains or that no person

94 after such notification under this clause prior to signing the form. The unclaimed remains shall

96 examiner pursuant to section 14 of chapter 38, who shall authorize the cremation or hydrolysis
97 only when no further examination or judicial inquiry concerning the death is necessary. The
98 office of the chief medical examiner may waive the fee set forth in said section 14 of said chapter
99 38 for cremation authorizations pursuant to this section. There shall be no liability for a board of
100 health or an employee, agent, or licensee thereof that authorizes the disposal of unclaimed
101 remains in accordance with this section. Nothing in this section shall supersede the obligations of
102 the office of the chief medical examiner as set forth in this chapter and chapter 38.
103 SECTION 18. Said chapter 114 is hereby further amended by striking out section 44 and
104 inserting in place thereof the following section:-
105 Section 44. Cremation or alkaline hydrolysis shall not be conducted upon the body of a
106 deceased person within 48 hours after the person’s decease, unless the person died of a
107 contagious or infectious disease. If the death occurred within the commonwealth, cremation or
108 alkaline hydrolysis shall not be conducted upon the body by any corporation described in section
109 6 until the corporation’s officers have received (i) the certificate or burial permit required by law
110 before burial; and (ii) a certificate from a medical examiner or similarly authorized person who
111 has viewed the body and made personal inquiry into the cause and manner of death and is of
112 opinion that no further examination or judicial inquiry concerning the same is necessary. If the
113 death occurs without the commonwealth, the medical examiner's certificate may be provided by
114 a medical examiner or similarly authorized person in whose jurisdiction the death occurred or the
115 reception and cremation or hydrolysis of the body of a deceased person shall be governed by a
116 by-law or regulation made or approved by the department of public health as provided in section

127 certificate that the burial permit and the certificate of the medical examiner prerequisite to the
128 disposal of said body have been duly presented.
129 Upon the burial, removal, hydrolysis or cremation of a body, the superintendent or other
