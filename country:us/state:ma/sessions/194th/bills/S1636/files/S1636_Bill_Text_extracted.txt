SENATE . . . . . . . . . . . . . . No. 1636
By Mr. Velis (by request), a petition (accompanied by bill, Senate, No. 1636) of Kirstin Beatty,
for legislation to ensure safer and secure communications by improving technological safety with
radiation limits through the Massachusetts Broadband Institute. Public Health.
The Commonwealth of Massachusetts
_______________
In the One Hundred and Ninety-Fourth General Court
(2025-2026)
_______________
An Act ensuring safer and secure communications with radiation limits through the
Massachusetts Broadband Institute.
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives in General Court assembled, and by the authority
of the same, as follows:
1 SECTION 1. The legislature finds and confirms all of the following:-
2 Whereas, the use of wireless instead of wired telecommunications has been proven to be
3 for the benefit of private profits at the expense of public ownership, accountability, taxes, and
4 regulation as discussed by Bruce Kushnick in the Book of Broken Promises.
5 Whereas, the use of private instead of public ownership has been at the expense of has
6 net neutrality and free use of copper or other public lines, cost-efficacy, and reliable service as
7 discussed by Bruce Kushnick in the Book of Broken Promises.
8 Whereas, cellular services are the first to fail from natural hazards, as well as being a
9 causative factor in California fires such as the 2007 Malibu Canyon fire and the 2020 Silverado
10 Fire.
1 of 14
11 Whereas, wireless services are unusually energy intensive, with 4G using 23 times more
12 energy than wired services and 5G using 3 times as much as 4G, the latter discussed in Michael
13 Koziol's 2019 IEEE Spectrum article “5G’s Waveform Is a Battery Vampire”.
14 Whereas, hacking of digital communications is a threat, especially for wireless services,
15 but is a non-existent or lesser threat for off-line services, including traditional copper line
16 telecommunications.
17 Whereas, natural and man-made electromagnetic pulses (EMP) such as a huge solar flare
18 or a nuclear explosion can destroy functionality of the electric grid and also cause harm to
19 communications equipment, although infrastructure can be hardened and replacement equipment
20 set aside.
21 Whereas, traditional copper lines used for wired telecommunications have greater
22 reliability and sound quality than wireless or digital services.
23 Whereas, decades of research has provided thousands of studies indicating random
24 wireless exposures are harmful to public and environmental health.
25 Whereas, Dr. Martin Pall, Dr. Devra Davis, Dr. Henry Lai, Dr. Belpoggi, Dr. Belyaev,
26 Dr. De-Kun Li, Dr. Belpomme, and countless other reputable experts have provided recent, peer-
27 reviewed studies demonstrating that exposure to non-ionizing radiation like wireless and certain
28 electricity exposures causes DNA breaks and mutations in germ line cells that produce mutations
29 in future generations; produces oxidative stress and free radical damage that have major roles in
30 chronic disease; and attacks the endocrine and nervous systems including our hormone balance
31 and our brains.
2 of 14
32 Whereas, in 2020 Boston in FCC’s 19-226 docket stated: 'Boston believes that the
33 concerns of the public are real and that the Commission has done a disservice to itself, local
34 government, consumers, and even the wireless industry in failing to understand and respond to
35 the broadly shared mistrust of the safety of RF emissions.'
36 Whereas, the Pittsfield Board of Health in April 2022 issued an an Emergency Order to
37 Verizon to turn off a cell tower because of sick residents.
38 Resolved, that the policy goals of this act shall be to redirect the Massachusetts
39 Broadband Institute to focus on providing secure, reliable, and safer wired broadband and
40 telecommunication services, in addition to supporting public ownership with accompanying
41 greater accountablity and free market access.
42 SECTION 2. Chapter 40J of Title VII of the General Laws is hereby amended by

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives in General Court assembled, and by the authority
of the same, as follows:
1 SECTION 1. The legislature finds and confirms all of the following:-
2 Whereas, the use of wireless instead of wired telecommunications has been proven to be
3 for the benefit of private profits at the expense of public ownership, accountability, taxes, and
4 regulation as discussed by Bruce Kushnick in the Book of Broken Promises.
5 Whereas, the use of private instead of public ownership has been at the expense of has
6 net neutrality and free use of copper or other public lines, cost-efficacy, and reliable service as
7 discussed by Bruce Kushnick in the Book of Broken Promises.
8 Whereas, cellular services are the first to fail from natural hazards, as well as being a
9 causative factor in California fires such as the 2007 Malibu Canyon fire and the 2020 Silverado
10 Fire.

18 or a nuclear explosion can destroy functionality of the electric grid and also cause harm to
19 communications equipment, although infrastructure can be hardened and replacement equipment
20 set aside.
21 Whereas, traditional copper lines used for wired telecommunications have greater
22 reliability and sound quality than wireless or digital services.
23 Whereas, decades of research has provided thousands of studies indicating random
24 wireless exposures are harmful to public and environmental health.
25 Whereas, Dr. Martin Pall, Dr. Devra Davis, Dr. Henry Lai, Dr. Belpoggi, Dr. Belyaev,
26 Dr. De-Kun Li, Dr. Belpomme, and countless other reputable experts have provided recent, peer-
27 reviewed studies demonstrating that exposure to non-ionizing radiation like wireless and certain
