By Mr. Velis (by request), a petition (accompanied by bill, Senate, No. 1637) of Kirstin Beatty,
for legislation to require medical facilities and nursing homes to support safer electromagnetic
radiation exposures and to support reduction of other environmental hazards through facility
wiring and training. Public Health.
The Commonwealth of Massachusetts
_______________
In the One Hundred and Ninety-Fourth General Court
(2025-2026)
_______________
An Act wiring medical facilities, nursing homes, and medical training to support safer
electromagnetic radiation exposures and to support reduction of other environmental hazards.
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives in General Court assembled, and by the authority
of the same, as follows:
1 SECTION 1. Whereas, physicians and nurses should help prevent harm from non-
2 ionizing radiation (e.g. wireless), mold, excessive screen time, local pollutants, and recalled or
3 toxic products.
4 Whereas, medical professionals would benefit from continuing education on toxins that
5 cause illness, but should be exempted where inapplicable to specialty or where expert.
6 Whereas, non-ionizing radiation is significantly linked to leukemia and lymphoma, so
7 reducing such exposures should be a part of treatment and insurance coverage.
8 Whereas, medical providers and nursing homes should progressively limit non-ionizing
9 radiation technology exposures as part of quality control measures, because numerous peer-
1 of 24
10 reviewed studies demonstrate such exposures contribute to dementias, cancers, numerous chronic
11 illness, and to feeling unwell.
12 Whereas, nutritional imbalances can be caused by toxic exposures and can contribute to
13 pathological conditions, such that nutritional analysis and supplementation such as with
14 antioxidants should be a part of treatment and insurance coverage.
15 Resolved, that the policy goals of this act are to:
16 (a) address electromagnetic radiation exposures from technology in medical facility and
17 nursing home exposures with medical training, guidance, and progressive limits and monitoring
18 that align with recommendations in the scientific literature and that of expert groups such as the
19 Building Biology Institute and the International Commission on the Biological Effects of
20 Electromagnetic Fields;
21 (b) update medical training to insure medical professionals in relevant fields are kept
22 current regarding and acknowledge digital addiction, potential toxicities in consumer products,
23 and mold hazards;
24 (c) update medical insurance to support medical evaluation, treatment and guidance
25 regarding environmental hazards such as digital addiction, plastics, electromagnetic radiation,
26 and ensuing pathological nutritional deficiences; and
27 (d) to reorganize the disorganized section 2 of chapter 112 only for organizational
28 purposes without modifying content.
29 SECTION 2. Chapter 111 of the General Laws is hereby amended by inserting after
30 section 72BB the following new section:-

SENATE DOCKET, NO. 2289 FILED ON: 1/17/2025
SENATE . . . . . . . . . . . . . . No. 1637
By Mr. Velis (by request), a petition (accompanied by bill, Senate, No. 1637) of Kirstin Beatty,
for legislation to require medical facilities and nursing homes to support safer electromagnetic
radiation exposures and to support reduction of other environmental hazards through facility
wiring and training. Public Health.
The Commonwealth of Massachusetts
_______________
In the One Hundred and Ninety-Fourth General Court
(2025-2026)
_______________
An Act wiring medical facilities, nursing homes, and medical training to support safer
electromagnetic radiation exposures and to support reduction of other environmental hazards.
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives in General Court assembled, and by the authority
of the same, as follows:
1 SECTION 1. Whereas, physicians and nurses should help prevent harm from non-
2 ionizing radiation (e.g. wireless), mold, excessive screen time, local pollutants, and recalled or
3 toxic products.
4 Whereas, medical professionals would benefit from continuing education on toxins that
5 cause illness, but should be exempted where inapplicable to specialty or where expert.
6 Whereas, non-ionizing radiation is significantly linked to leukemia and lymphoma, so
7 reducing such exposures should be a part of treatment and insurance coverage.
8 Whereas, medical providers and nursing homes should progressively limit non-ionizing
9 radiation technology exposures as part of quality control measures, because numerous peer-
1 of 24

10 reviewed studies demonstrate such exposures contribute to dementias, cancers, numerous chronic
11 illness, and to feeling unwell.
12 Whereas, nutritional imbalances can be caused by toxic exposures and can contribute to
13 pathological conditions, such that nutritional analysis and supplementation such as with
14 antioxidants should be a part of treatment and insurance coverage.
15 Resolved, that the policy goals of this act are to:
16 (a) address electromagnetic radiation exposures from technology in medical facility and
17 nursing home exposures with medical training, guidance, and progressive limits and monitoring
18 that align with recommendations in the scientific literature and that of expert groups such as the
19 Building Biology Institute and the International Commission on the Biological Effects of
20 Electromagnetic Fields;
21 (b) update medical training to insure medical professionals in relevant fields are kept
22 current regarding and acknowledge digital addiction, potential toxicities in consumer products,
23 and mold hazards;
24 (c) update medical insurance to support medical evaluation, treatment and guidance
25 regarding environmental hazards such as digital addiction, plastics, electromagnetic radiation,
26 and ensuing pathological nutritional deficiences; and
27 (d) to reorganize the disorganized section 2 of chapter 112 only for organizational
28 purposes without modifying content.
29 SECTION 2. Chapter 111 of the General Laws is hereby amended by inserting after
30 section 72BB the following new section:-

34 radiation specialist certified by the Building Biology Institute, a 501(c)(3) founded in Florida in
35 1987 based on the German principles of Building Biology.
36 (b) Each convalescent and nursing home, infirmary maintained in towns, rest home,
37 charitable home for the aged, and intermediate care facility for the mentally retarded shall create
38 a master plan to reduce non-ionizing radiation in the facility and shall keep records of its
39 progress. The master plan, including progress towards completion, shall be a public record and
40 shall be freely available for viewing.
41 (c) Inspection and enforcement. The department or its agents and the board of health or
42 its agents of the city or town where any portion of a convalescent home or nursing home,
43 infirmary maintained in a town, rest home, charitable home for the aged, or intermediate care
44 facility for persons with an intellectual disability is located may visit and inspect the master plan
45 and such institution at any time.
46 Any person making an inspection under authority of this section shall record in writing
47 every violation which he finds of the applicable provisions, including lack of progress, good
48 faith, or compliance. Every record of inspection so made shall be treated as a public record
49 except to such extent as the record or a portion thereof is expressly exempt from such treatment
50 under section seven of chapter four, and said violations shall be made public at the same time
51 that a written plan of correction is submitted.
3 of 24

52 If a written plan of correction is not submitted within the allowable time, said violations
53 shall be made public at the expiration of the allowable time. Inspections shall be unannounced
54 and made at such intervals as the department shall specify in its rules and regulations, but at least
55 twice per annum. A visit made to a facility for the purpose of providing consultation shall not be
56 considered to be an inspection.
57 The superior court shall have jurisdiction in equity to enforce the rules and regulations
58 promulgated under this section.
