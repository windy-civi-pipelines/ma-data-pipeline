10 failure to perceive a substantial and unjustifiable risk that a result would occur from said failure.
1 of 3
11 The risk must be of such nature and degree that failure to perceive it constitutes a gross deviation
12 from the standard of care that a reasonable person would observe in this situation."
13 SECTION 3. Section 34B of chapter 148 of the Massachusetts General Laws is hereby
14 amended by striking out the section in its entirety and inserting in place thereof the following:

21 prison for not more than 7 years or in a house of correction for not more than 5 years, or both.
22 Any person found to have acted in accordance with the definition of criminal negligence in
23 section 1 of this chapter may be determined to be criminally liable for damage or death stemming
24 from repeated and reckless non-compliance with requirements set forth in this chapter. For

26 permanent disfigurement, loss or impairment of a bodily function, limb or organ, or a substantial
27 risk of death. SECTION 4. Section 34 of Chapter 148 is hereby amended by striking out the
28 section in its entirety and inserting in place thereof the following: "Section 34. Except as
29 otherwise provided, any person violating any provision of this chapter shall be liable to a fine of
30 one hundred dollars, or, in case of a continuing offence after notice of such violation, to a fine of
31 not more than one hundred dollars for every day during which the violation continues, unless

36 a year, provided that the Judge shall have the authority to take into account the size of the project
37 on which the violation occurred and levy additional fines if the total cost said project is such that
38 the fine is inadequate to deter continued offenses. Third and continuing offenses: a fine of not
39 more than .025% of the total project value, or $10,000, whichever is greater, and/or
40 imprisonment in the house of correction for up to 3 years." SECTION 5. Notwithstanding any
