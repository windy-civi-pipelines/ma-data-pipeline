An Act to ensure pay parity for county sheriffs' correction officers and jail officers.
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives in General Court assembled, and by the authority
of the same, as follows:
1 Section 17 of Chapter 37 of the General Laws, as appearing in the 2022 Official Edition,
2 is hereby amended by adding the following paragraph:
3 Notwithstanding any general or special law to the contrary, The Correction Officers and
4 Jail Officers working in the fourteen (14) County Sheriffs' Offices throughout the
5 Commonwealth of Massachusetts shall re‐titled Correction Officer I, II and III or Jail Officer I,
6 II, and III, and be paid base salaries according to the corresponding salary Grade in State
7 Bargaining Unit 4 covering the Department of Correction job titles of Correction Officer I, II, or
8 III. County Sheriffs’ Office, Correction Officers and Jail Officers shall be slotted into such Unit
9 4 titles according to where the core duties and responsibilities of such Correction Officers and
10 Jail Officers within the County Sheriffs’ Offices most closely approximate the core duties and
1 of 2

11 responsibilities of the corresponding Department of Correction CO I, II, and III titles. The
12 foregoing compensation adjustment shall be structured so that the salary rates for Sheriffs' Office
13 Correction Officer I, II, III and Jail Officer I, II, III equalize with the general Department of
14 Corrections base salary rates in through equal annual increments over the three fiscal years after
15 next following the passage of this legislation by the General Court and its enactment by the
16 Governor. Upon the enactment of this legislation, County Sheriffs will not be required to bargain
17 under G. L. Chapter 150E with public employee organizations representing County Sheriffs
18 Correction Officers I, II and III or Jail Officers I, II and III over base salary rates for such
19 Officers covering the three fiscal year period in which such Officers are receiving salary rates
20 pursuant to this legislation, but shall otherwise remain obligated to comply with collective
21 bargaining agreements, if any, covering such Officers and, in all other respects, except as
22 otherwise provided herein, shall remain obligated to comply with their obligations under Chapter
23 150E with respect to such Officers and the public employee labor organizations representing
24 such Officers during such three fiscal year period. Following the three fiscal year period covered
25 by this legislation, Chapter 150E shall once again fully apply to County Sheriffs as it relates to
26 Correction Officers I, II, and III and Jail Officers I, II and III in all respects, including but not
27 limited to the negotiation of base salary rates with public employee organizations representing
28 them.
