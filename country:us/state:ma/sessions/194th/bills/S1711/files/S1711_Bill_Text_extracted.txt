1 of 8
11 SECTION 2. Section 16 of said chapter 127, as so appearing, is hereby amended by
12 striking out in the second paragraph the words “who is committed for a term of 30 days’
13 imprisonment or more.” and inserting in place thereof the following:-
14 within 24 hours of admission to the facility. Regardless of whether the individual was
15 receiving medication for addiction treatment immediately prior to admission to the facility, the
16 examination shall include an assessment for treatment with medication for addiction treatment.
17 SECTION 3. Said chapter 127, as so appearing, is hereby further amended by striking out
18 section 17B and replacing it with the following:-
19 Section 17B. Medication-assisted treatment for substance use conditions for state
20 detainees or prisoners at correctional facilities.
21 (a) All correctional facilities, jails and houses of correction, in consultation with the
22 commissioner of public health, shall offer all medications for addiction treatment to a detained,
23 committed or incarcerated person, upon the recommendation of a qualified addiction specialist.
24 All correctional facilities, jails and houses of correction shall maintain or provide for the capacity
25 to possess, dispense, administer and secure all medications for addiction treatment; provided
26 however, that such facilities shall not be required to maintain or provide a medication for
27 addiction treatment that is not also a MassHealth covered benefit.
28 (b) No detained, committed or incarcerated person shall be denied medication for
29 addiction treatment on the basis of a positive drug screening upon entering custody or at any time
30 during the incarceration, detention or commitment of the person; nor shall any detained,
31 committed or incarcerated person receive a disciplinary infraction for a positive drug screening.
32 The medication for addiction treatment of a detained, committed or incarcerated person shall not
2 of 8
33 be discontinued due to any disciplinary infraction. A detained, committed or incarcerated person
34 may request medication for addiction treatment at any time during the incarceration, detention or
35 commitment of such detained, committed or incarcerated person.
36 (c) The commissioner and county sheriffs shall ensure that each detained, committed or
37 incarcerated person who was receiving medication for addiction treatment immediately
38 preceding incarceration, detention or commitment continues to have such treatment available as
39 soon as practicable, and in any event within 24 hours of admission to the facility, unless such
40 person voluntarily discontinues the treatment or unless a qualified addiction specialist
41 determines, based on individual medical need, that maintaining the same treatment is no longer
42 clinically indicated. Each detained, committed or incarcerated person shall receive the same dose
43 of the same medication that the person was receiving before incarceration, commitment or
44 detention, unless a qualified addiction specialist determines, based on individual medical need
45 and in consultation with the person, that a change in dose or medication is clinically indicated.
46 (d) The commissioner and county sheriffs shall ensure that each detained, committed or
47 incarcerated person who was not receiving medication for addiction treatment immediately
48 preceding incarceration, detention or commitment, and for whom medication for addiction
49 treatment is clinically indicated, shall be offered such medication within 24 hours of the
50 assessment required by section 16. The determinations of which medication to prescribe and the
51 dosage shall be made based on individual medical need in consultation with the patient.
52 Detained, committed or incarcerated persons shall be authorized to receive the medication for as
53 long as clinically indicated.
3 of 8
54 (e) All state and county correctional facilities shall ensure consistent and ongoing access
55 to a qualified addiction specialist by a detained, committed or incarcerated person.
56 (f) Treatment established under this section shall include behavioral health counseling for
57 individuals diagnosed with substance use disorder or substance use-related needs; provided,
58 however, that counseling services shall be consistent with current therapeutic standards for these
59 therapies in a community setting and shall not be a substitute for medication for addiction
60 treatment. The commissioner and county sheriffs may make such treatment available by directly
61 engaging qualified providers of substance use services, through collaboration with other
62 agencies, and by utilizing trained volunteers from community recovery programs.
63 (g) No incentives, rewards or punishments shall be used to encourage or discourage a
64 detained, committed or incarcerated person’s decision to receive or decline medication for
65 addiction treatment, or any particular such medication.
66 (h) The commissioner of public health may promulgate regulations and guidelines
67 necessary to implement the treatment program under this section.
68 SECTION 4. Said chapter 127, as so appearing, is hereby further amended by striking out
69 Section 17C and replacing it with the following:-
70 Section 17C. Not later than 120 days prior to the expected discharge date of a person
71 detained, committed or incarcerated in a state prison or county facility, or within a reasonable
72 timeframe if the length of incarceration, detention or commitment is less than 120 days, but in
73 any event no less than 30 days prior to such expected discharge date, a qualified addiction
74 specialist shall establish a medically appropriate re-entry treatment plan for the person. A re-
75 entry treatment plan may include any treatment upon discharge that the qualified addiction
4 of 8
76 specialist shall recommend and deem appropriate, which may include, but shall not be limited to,
77 any medication for addiction treatment. A re-entry treatment plan shall ensure that a detained,
78 committed or incarcerated person is provided with a referral to an appropriate provider or
79 treatment site in the geographic region where the person will reside upon release, and that the
80 person receives not less than 2 doses of an opioid antagonist, along with education and
81 instruction about the use of opioid antagonists and where they can access opioid antagonists in
82 the community. The detained, committed or incarcerated person shall receive information on
83 available treatment facilities in their area, information on available housing and employment
84 resources and any other information that will assist the individual in continued recovery once
85 released. The commissioner and county sheriffs shall further ensure that, for a person with a re-
86 entry treatment plan under this section, the facility shall request reinstatement or apply for
87 MassHealth benefits for the person at least 30 days prior to release or shall use best efforts to
88 request such reinstatement of or apply for MassHealth benefits or other public assistance for the
89 person within a reasonable timeframe if the person’s sentence, detention or commitment is less
90 than 30 days. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this section shall authorize a state prison
91 or county facility to extend a person’s sentence, detention or commitment to comply with this
92 section. In the event the expected discharge date of a detained, committed or incarcerated person
93 serving a sentence to a state prison or county facility is less than 30 days following the start date
94 of said detained, committed or incarcerated person’s sentence, detention or commitment, a
95 qualified addiction specialist shall use best efforts to establish a medically appropriate treatment
96 plan for the person prior to the expected discharge date.
97 The re-entry treatment plan shall be forwarded to the parole board and may be
98 incorporated into any treatment plan included within the terms and conditions of parole.

99 SECTION 5. Said chapter 127, as so appearing, is hereby amended by striking out
100 section 17D and replacing it with the following:-
101 (a) Every six months, on a schedule to be established by the department of public health,
102 the commissioner and the administrator of each county correctional facility shall report, in a
103 format determined by the commissioner of public health, to the commissioner of public health,
104 the house and senate committees on ways and means, the joint committee on mental health,

114 status, who received a different medication for addiction treatment than they received prior to

116 custody of the facility, in any status, who received medication for addiction treatment who did
117 not receive such treatment prior to incarceration, detention or commitment, by medication type;
118 (vi) a summary of facility practices and any changes to those practices related to medication for
119 addiction treatment; (vii) the number of persons who were referred to treatment after release;

124 provide such information; (x) the number of people who were provided 2 doses of an opioid
125 antagonist upon release; and (xi) any other information requested by the commissioner of public
126 health related to the provision of medication for addiction treatment.

131 safety and homeland security and the joint committee on the judiciary. The department of
132 correction and county correctional facilities shall provide, upon request from the commissioner
133 of public health, information necessary to prepare the report. The report shall, to the extent
134 possible, provide a comparison between the detained, committed and incarcerated persons who
