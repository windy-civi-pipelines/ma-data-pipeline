Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives in General Court assembled, and by the authority
of the same, as follows:
1 SECTION 1. Chapter 111 of the General Laws, as appearing in the 2022 Official Edition,
2 is hereby amended by adding the following section:-

14 facility, continuing care facility and group homes operated, funded or subject to oversight by the
15 department of public health, the department of mental health or the department of developmental

26 future, that if carried out would constitute a crime, and causes another person to reasonably
27 believe that the person has the intent and ability to carry out such conduct.
28 (b) Annually, each health care employer shall perform a facility specific risk assessment
29 that includes, but is not limited to, the standards determined by the department and in
2 of 10

30 consultation with the office of health equity. The facility specific risk assessment shall be done in
31 cooperation with the employees of the health care employer and any labor organization or
32 organizations representing the employees, examining all factors, which may put any of the
33 employees at risk of workplace violence. The factors shall include, but not be limited to: (i)
34 working in public settings; (ii) guarding or maintaining property or possessions; (iii) working in
35 high-crime areas; (iv) working late night or early morning hours; (v) working alone or in small

37 people are in crisis; (viii) working in areas where a patient or resident may exhibit violent
38 behavior; (ix) working in areas with known security problems; and (x) working with insufficient
39 qualified staff in 1 or more position titles to address foreseeable risk factors.
40 (c) Based on the findings of the risk assessment in subsection (b), the health care
41 employer shall develop and implement a program to minimize the danger of workplace violence
42 to employees, which shall include appropriate employee training, and a system for the ongoing
43 reporting and monitoring of incidents and situations involving violence or the risk of violence.

51 health care facility plan to any labor organization or organizations representing any of its
52 employees. The plan shall include but not be limited to: (i) a list of those factors and
3 of 10

53 circumstances that may pose a danger to employees; (ii) a description of the methods that the
54 health care employer will use to alleviate hazards associated with each factor; including, but not
55 limited to, employee training and any appropriate changes in job design, staffing, security,
56 equipment or facilities; (iii) a post-incident debriefing process with affected staff; and (iv) a
57 description of the reporting and monitoring system.
58 (e) Each health care employer shall designate a senior manager responsible for the
59 development and support of an in-house crisis response team for employee-victims of workplace
60 violence. Said team shall implement an assaulted staff action program that includes, but is not
61 limited to, group crisis interventions, individual crisis counseling, staff victims’ support groups,
62 employee victims’ family crisis intervention, peer-help and professional referrals.

64 the department under authority hereof may, based on the reason for the violation and the
65 discretion of the department, be punished by a fine of not more than $2,000 for each offense. The
66 department or its representative or any aggrieved employee, any interested party or any officer of
67 any labor union or association, whether incorporated or otherwise, may file a written complaint
68 with the district court in the jurisdiction of which the violation occurs and shall promptly notify
69 the attorney general in writing of such complaint. The attorney general, upon determination that
70 there is a violation of any workplace standard relative to the protection of the occupational health
71 and safety of employees or of any standard of requirement of licensure, may order any work site
72 to be closed by way of the issuance of a cease and desist order enforceable in the appropriate
73 courts of the commonwealth.
4 of 10

74 (g) No employee shall be penalized by a health care employer in any way as a result of
75 such employee’s filing of a complaint or otherwise providing notice to the department in regard
76 to the occupational health and safety of such employee or their fellow employees exposed to
77 workplace violence risk factors.
78 (h) Each health care employer shall submit a report annually, on a form prescribed by the

82 the department and the office of the district attorney for the county where the health care facility
83 is located. Not more than 90 days after receiving the reports, the department shall make the
84 aggregate data statewide and by county publicly available; provided that the department
85 categorize the aggregate data by occupation and incident type.
