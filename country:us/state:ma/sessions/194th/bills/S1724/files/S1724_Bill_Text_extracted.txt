309 investigation. Upon receipt of information that by law is confidential or privileged, the
310 corrections inspector general shall maintain the confidentiality of such information and shall not

327 corrections inspector general will not further disclose such information. If the corrections
328 inspector general determines that such disclosure is necessary to an investigation or
329 recommendation, the corrections inspector general will contact the staff member as well as the
330 bargaining unit representative before any disclosure.

338 or information is made, given, or disclosed maliciously or without good faith.
339 (c) This section is not intended to infringe on the rights of an employer to supervise,
340 discipline, or terminate an employee for other reasons.
