An Act building a more accessible Massachusetts.
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives in General Court assembled, and by the authority
of the same, as follows:
1 SECTION 1. The first paragraph of section 13A of chapter 22 of the General Laws, as
2 amended by section 29 of chapter 39 of the acts of 2021, is hereby further amended by striking
3 out the second and third sentences and inserting in place thereof the following 3 sentences:- Two
4 of the appointive members shall be architects licensed to practice in the commonwealth. One of
5 the appointive members shall be a licensed building inspector. Three of the appointive members
6 shall be selected after consultation with advocacy groups on behalf of persons with disabilities.
7 SECTION 2. Said section 13A of said chapter 22, as so amended, is hereby further
8 amended by striking out the fourth paragraph and inserting in place thereof the following 4
9 paragraphs:-
1 of 7

10 The board shall make and from time to time alter, amend and repeal, in accordance with
11 the provisions of chapter 30A, rules and regulations designed to make multiple dwellings and
12 public buildings and facilities, including, but not limited to, areas that are not generally in public
13 use, accessible to, functional for and safe for use by persons with disabilities. The board shall
14 also make rules and regulations requiring that any person who has lawful control of improved or
15 enclosed private property used as off-street parking areas where the public has a right of access
16 as invitees or licensees, shall reserve parking spaces in said off-street parking areas for vehicles
17 authorized to display handicapped plates or placards under section 2 of chapter 90; provided, that
18 the parking requirements shall be consistent with the ADA Standards for Accessible Design. The
19 parking spaces reserved for vehicles of such persons with a disability shall be clearly marked as
20 such.
21 The rules and regulations of the board shall establish standards and procedures designed
22 to make adaptable for persons with physical disabilities for any building, regardless of the date of
23 construction: (i) all dwelling units in multiple dwellings equipped with an elevator; (ii) all
24 ground floor dwelling units in multiple dwellings not equipped with an elevator; and (iii) all
25 public use and common use portions of such multiple dwellings; provided, however, that in any
26 building constructed before March 13, 1991, such standards and procedures for dwelling units
27 shall apply only to such units within: (i) any non-residential building undergoing a gut
28 rehabilitation as part of a change in use into a multiple dwelling facility; or (ii) any residential
29 building which is vacant undergoing a gut rehabilitation. The rules and regulations of the board
30 shall establish standards and procedures designed to make accessible to, functional for and safe
31 for use by persons with physical disabilities residential buildings whenever constructed and
32 without the restrictions in the above paragraph.
2 of 7

33 Unless otherwise specified, 5 per cent of the units in lodging or residential facilities for
34 hire, rent or lease, containing 20 or more units, shall meet this requirement; provided, however,
35 that accessible units shall allow 5 feet of turning radius for a wheelchair in the kitchens and
36 bathrooms. In the event that the board determines that the need, in certain areas of the
37 commonwealth, for such units either exceeds or does not require said 5 percent, the board may
38 require that, in said areas a percentage of units less than 5 per cent or not greater than 10 per cent
39 be accessible and safe for persons with disabilities; provided, however, that said accessible units
40 shall allow 5 feet of turning radius for a wheelchair in the kitchens and bathrooms.
41 The board may make such determination only if there is sufficient factual basis, using
42 data from the central registry of the Massachusetts rehabilitation commission, established in
43 section 74 of chapter 6, and other sources, to establish with a reasonable degree of certainty the
44 present and future needs for said accessible units in certain areas of the commonwealth. A
45 percentage of less than 5 per cent shall not be established unless such accessible units, which are
46 not needed by persons with disabilities cannot be readily hired, rented or leased to other persons.
47 The rules and regulations of the board shall include, but not be limited to, detailed architectural
48 standards further defining adaptable and accessible dwelling units and such other provisions
49 necessary to provide rights and remedies substantially equivalent to or greater than the rights and
50 remedies provided by the federal Fair Housing Act, the ADA Standards for Accessible Design
51 and regulations thereunder as pertaining to such multiple dwellings.
