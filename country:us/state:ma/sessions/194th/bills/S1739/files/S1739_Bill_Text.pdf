103 employment, shall be granted under this subsection, without impairment, full benefits for
104 vacation and sick time earned from their original commencement of employment in the sheriff’s
105 civil process office not to exceed those of other state employees.
106 Section 3B. No sheriff, deputy or employee, nor any other individual or entity shall have
107 or acquire any legal right to the tangible or intangible property of the civil process office, nor any

203 Whenever a deputy sheriff or other employee of a sheriff’s civil process office who, due
204 to no fault of his own, while in the performance of duty, receives bodily injury from an act of
10 of 13

205 violence by a person connected with the proceeding for which service of process was attempted
206 or served, and who is incapacitated for duty because of the injury sustained, shall be paid, in
207 addition to benefits paid under chapter 152, the difference between the weekly cash benefits to
208 which he is entitled under chapter 152 and his regular salary. Any absence from work due to the
209 injury shall not be charged against the employee’s available sick leave credits, even if the
210 absence is for less than 8 calendar days. This section does not apply to injuries sustained during
211 work for which a deputy or employee is being paid commission.
212 All amounts payable under this section shall be paid at the same times and in the same
213 manner as, and for all purposes shall be deemed to be the deputy or employee’s regular
214 compensation. If a person or entity is liable for monetary damages for an injury of a deputy
215 sheriff or other employee of a sheriff’s civil process for which he is compensated under this
216 section, the deputy, employee, or sheriff’s department that is paying compensation under this
217 section, may proceed to enforce the liability of such person or entity in any court of competent
218 jurisdiction. Any sum recovered shall be for the benefit of the sheriff’s department that is paying
219 such compensation, unless the sum is greater than the compensation paid to the injured person, in
220 which case the excess shall be retained by or paid to the injured person. For the purposes of this
221 section, “excess” shall mean the amount by which the total sum received as damages for the
222 injury, exclusive of interest and costs, exceeds the amount paid under this section as
223 compensation to the injured person. The party bringing the action shall be entitled to any costs
224 recovered by him. Any interest received in the action shall be apportioned between the sheriff’s
225 department and the injured person in proportion to the amounts received by them respectively,
226 inclusive of interest and costs. The expense of any attorney’s fees shall be divided between the
11 of 13

227 sheriff’s department and the injured person in proportion to the amounts received by them
228 respectively.
229 Any person or entity, who injures a deputy sheriff or other employee of a sheriff’s civil
230 process office who is compensated under this section for the injury, shall be liable in tort to the
231 sheriff’s department that is paying the injured person, for all costs, in excess of the amount of
232 compensation paid, that are incurred by the sheriff’s department to replace the injured person.
233 SECTION 12. Chapter 262 of the General Laws is hereby amended by striking out
234 section 8A and inserting in place thereof the following section:-
235 Section 8A. Each constable shall annually, not later than April 15, file with the municipal
236 treasurer an account signed under the pains and penalties of perjury of all fees and money
237 received by the constable under section 8 for the service of civil process. If 2 or more constables
238 share such fees and money, such constables may file a joint account; provided, however, that
239 each constable signs the account under the pains and penalties of perjury.
240 Each deputy sheriff shall annually, not later than 30 days after the close of the fiscal year,
241 file with the sheriff and the state treasurer an account signed under the pains and penalties of
242 perjury of all fees and money received by the deputy sheriff under section 8 for the service of
243 civil process. If 2 or more deputy sheriffs share such fees and money, such deputy sheriffs may
244 file a joint account; provided, however, that each deputy sheriff shall sign the account under the
245 pains and penalties of perjury.
246 On a schedule determined by the sheriff, but at least quarterly, each deputy sheriff who
247 serves process shall file a written report to the sheriff, made under the pains and penalties of
12 of 13

248 perjury and in a form prescribed by the sheriff, detailing information relative to the service of
249 civil process in their respective jurisdictions pursuant to section 11 of chapter 37.
250 SECTION 13. Subject to appropriation, the human resources division shall conduct, in
251 consultation with the sheriffs and Massachusetts Sheriffs Association, Inc., a comprehensive
252 assessment that will lead to statewide standards for classification, recruitment, promotion,
253 compensation and professional standards for all sheriffs’ offices. The assessment shall include,
254 but is not limited to, standardizing job titles and classification, job postings, minimum testing
255 requirements and other employment practices. The human resources division shall issue a report
256 of its assessment by April 30, 2027, and require that implementation of the standards shall begin
257 not later than September 1, 2027. A copy of the human resources division’s assessment report
258 shall be sent to the chairs of the joint committee on state administration and regulatory oversight,
259 the chairs of house and senate ways and means, the clerks of the house and senate, the chairs of
260 the joint committee on public safety and homeland security, the secretary of administration and
