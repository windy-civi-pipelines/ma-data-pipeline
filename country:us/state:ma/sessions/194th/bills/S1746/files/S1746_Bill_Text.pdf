3 Section 101. Temporary Door Locking Devices
4 Notwithstanding any general or special law to the contrary the executive office of public
5 safety and security shall promulgate regulations to allow the use of temporary door locking
6 devices for use in public buildings during emergency lockdown situations which require
7 sheltering in place protocols, and in consultation with the executive office of education and the
8 Massachusetts school building authority, shall establish regulations regarding the use of
9 temporary locking devices in school buildings. These regulations shall include, but not be limited

10 to (1) circumstances under which temporary door locking devices may be used; (2) appropriate
11 locations for temporary door locking devices and ensuring consistent operation throughout a
12 building; (3) a local approval process, including consultation with the fire department and law
13 enforcement agency with jurisdiction over the building; (4) integration of such devices into
14 building safety plans and training programs; (5) in-service training on the use of the device by
15 first responders and public employees; and (6) standards for annual inspections to ensure proper
16 use and operation. Temporary door locking devices, as defined in this section, shall not be
17 proscribed by any ordinance that prohibits a building from installing a barricade device.
18 For the purposes of this section, temporary door locking device shall mean, a device that
19 prevents unwanted entry through a door, provided that the device (1) can be engaged without

25 function of the door may be permanently mounted; (6) does not affect the fire rating of the door
26 and complies with National Fire Protection Association fire rating standards; (7) can be removed
27 with a single operation once engaged, unless the building is equipped throughout with an
28 automatic sprinkler system, in which case two operations may be permitted; (8) is positioned at a
29 height not to exceed 48‚Äù above the floor; and (9) is only engaged for a finite period of time.
