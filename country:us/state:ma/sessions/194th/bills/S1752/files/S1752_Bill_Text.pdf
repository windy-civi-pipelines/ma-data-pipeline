13 SECTION 2. A city or town which accepts this section in the manner provided in section
14 4 of chapter 4 may impose a local zoning restriction on the residency of level 3-sex offenders in
15 the following manner:
16 (a) Any community that, by majority vote of the city council or town meeting, shall make
17 it unlawful for any adult criminal Level 3 sex offender to establish a residence or any other living
18 accommodations within 1500 feet of the property on which any school, day-care center, park,
19 beach, or recreational facility open to the public is located. The fifteen-hundred-foot restriction
20 shall be measured in a straight line from the nearest property line upon which the house,
21 apartment complex, condominium complex, motel, hotel or other residence is located to the
22 property line of the nearest school, day-care center, park, or recreational facility. Distances will
23 be taken from the state's GIS system, and GIS services to the state shall be presumed accurate
24 and shall be evidence of a violation.
25 (b) Changes to property resulting in a school, day-care center, park, beach or recreational
26 facility within 500 feet of an adult criminal Level 3 sex offender's registered address which occur
27 after an adult criminal Level 3 sex offender establishes residency shall not form the basis for
28 finding that a criminal sex offender is in violation of this section.
29 (c) Level 3 registered sex offenders who reside on a permanent or temporary basis within
30 500 feet of any school, day-care center, park, beach or recreational facility following passage of
31 this section shall be in violation of this section and shall, within 30 days of receipt of written
32 notice of the registered sex offender's noncompliance with this section, move from said location
33 to a new location, but said new location may not be within 1500 feet of any school, day-care
34 center, park, beach, or recreational facility. The first day following the thirty-day written notice

35 shall be considered the first violation. Following the first violation, every day that the registered
36 sex offender continues to reside within 1500 feet of any school, day-care center, park, or
37 recreational facility shall be considered a separate violation.
