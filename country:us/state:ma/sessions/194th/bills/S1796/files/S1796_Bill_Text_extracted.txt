87 deliver, and receive securities on the order of the board; and shall prepare and deliver to the
88 board a list, at such time as the board may require, of all securities held by it with their current
89 market values. Such custodian may make a reasonable charge for such services.
90 (f) Any person who assists any board or member thereof in the purchase, sale, investment
91 or reinvestment of the funds of any such system, without the written consent of the public
92 employee retirement administration commission after notice in writing by him to such board or
93 member to desist therefrom as provided for in subdivision (4) shall be punished as provided for

105 funds are to be invested directly in mortgages or in collateral loans;
106 (ii) no new investment of funds shall be made in the stocks, securities or other obligations

254 (a) discharge their duties for the exclusive purpose of providing benefits to members and
255 their beneficiaries with the care, skill, prudence and diligence under the circumstances then

257 use in the conduct of an enterprise of a like character and with like aims and by diversifying the
258 investments of the system so as to minimize the risk of large losses unless under the
259 circumstances it is clearly prudent not to do so.
260 (b) Discharge their duties in the best interests of members and their beneficiaries by
261 equally considering investment returns, employer contributions to the fund, and employee
262 contributions to the fund.

267 (4) Orders to protect the system. â€” If the commission determines after a hearing that the
268 investment or record keeping practices of any board are not being conducted with reasonable
269 care, skill, prudence or diligence, he may order such board to take or desist from any action that
270 in his judgment is necessary to preserve the integrity of the system. If the commission has reason
271 to believe that the investment and record keeping practices of any board are not being conducted
272 with reasonable care, skill, prudence or diligence, he may issue a temporary order which shall
273 remain in effect until an investigation, hearing and determination can be made. Violation of any
274 such order shall be punished as provided for in section 24.
275 (5) Confidentiality of certain records. Any documentary material or data made or
276 received by a member of the PRIM board which consists of trade secrets or commercial or
277 financial information that relates to the investment of public trust or retirement funds, shall not
278 be disclosed to the public if disclosure is likely to impair the government's ability to obtain such
279 information in the future or is likely to cause substantial harm to the competitive position of the
280 person or entity from whom the information was obtained. The provisions of the open meeting
281 law shall not apply to the PRIM board when it is discussing the information described in this
282 subdivision. This subdivision shall apply to any request for information covered by this
283 subdivision for which no disclosure has been made by the effective date of this subdivision.
284 (6) The guidelines for investing in small businesses with a principal place of business in
285 the commonwealth shall be:
286 (a) For the purposes of this section small business shall be a business entity, including its
287 affiliates, that: (i) is independently owned and operated; (ii) has a principal place of business in
288 the commonwealth; and (iii) would be defined as a ''small business'' under applicable federal law,
14 of 16
289 as established in the United States Code and promulgated from time to time by the United States
290 Small Business Administration.
291 (b) Investments shall be made by banks or financial institutions with demonstrated
292 experience making capital available to small businesses with good management, which are fast
293 growing and identify the potential to use increased capital to create jobs and which are
294 experiencing difficulty in accessing capital.
295 (c) Capital shall be provided to small businesses in a variety of financial instruments,
296 including but not limited to: working capital and expansion loans to businesses, both secured and
297 non-secured; provide lines of credit; capital expenditure loans; term loans; project finance loans;
298 grants; loan guarantees; and mezzanine and structured finance loans.
299 (d) Capital shall not be provided unless financial and managerial advisory services are
300 also provided to the business that is served.
301 (7)(a) It shall be the policy of the PRIM board to use minority investment managers to
302 manage PRIT Fund assets, encompassing all asset classes, and to increase the racial, ethnic, and
303 gender diversity of PRIT Fund investments to the greatest extent feasible, consistent with sound
304 investment policy. The PRIM board and the executive director shall take affirmative steps to
305 remove any barriers to the full participation of minority investment managers in investment
306 opportunities. Such affirmative steps shall include, but not be limited to, consideration of
307 whether current investment policy discourages the use of minority investment managers through
308 quantitative or qualitative restrictions, including, but not limited to, number of years track record
309 and minimum assets under management.
15 of 16
310 (b) It shall be the goal of the PRIM board that not less than 20 per cent of investment
311 managers be minorities, females and persons with disabilities. It shall further be the goal of the
312 PRIM board to utilize businesses owned by minorities, females and persons with disabilities for
313 not less than 20 per cent of total contracts awarded pursuant to section 23B.
314 (c) Annually, not later than January 15 of each year, the PRIM board shall file with the
315 house and senate committee on ways and means and with the joint committee on public service a
316 report detailing its progress toward implementing the policies and goals outlined above. Such
317 report shall include documentation related to all minority investment managers considered for
318 investment, including documentation, where applicable, of the reasons for declining any such
319 investment.

91 or reinvestment of the funds of any such system, without the written consent of the public

105 funds are to be invested directly in mortgages or in collateral loans;
106 (ii) no new investment of funds shall be made in the stocks, securities or other obligations

254 (a) discharge their duties for the exclusive purpose of providing benefits to members and

258 investments of the system so as to minimize the risk of large losses unless under the
259 circumstances it is clearly prudent not to do so.

261 equally considering investment returns, employer contributions to the fund, and employee
262 contributions to the fund.

268 investment or record keeping practices of any board are not being conducted with reasonable
269 care, skill, prudence or diligence, he may order such board to take or desist from any action that
270 in his judgment is necessary to preserve the integrity of the system. If the commission has reason
271 to believe that the investment and record keeping practices of any board are not being conducted
272 with reasonable care, skill, prudence or diligence, he may issue a temporary order which shall
273 remain in effect until an investigation, hearing and determination can be made. Violation of any
274 such order shall be punished as provided for in section 24.

276 received by a member of the PRIM board which consists of trade secrets or commercial or
277 financial information that relates to the investment of public trust or retirement funds, shall not
278 be disclosed to the public if disclosure is likely to impair the government's ability to obtain such
279 information in the future or is likely to cause substantial harm to the competitive position of the
280 person or entity from whom the information was obtained. The provisions of the open meeting
281 law shall not apply to the PRIM board when it is discussing the information described in this
282 subdivision. This subdivision shall apply to any request for information covered by this
283 subdivision for which no disclosure has been made by the effective date of this subdivision.
284 (6) The guidelines for investing in small businesses with a principal place of business in
285 the commonwealth shall be:
286 (a) For the purposes of this section small business shall be a business entity, including its
287 affiliates, that: (i) is independently owned and operated; (ii) has a principal place of business in
288 the commonwealth; and (iii) would be defined as a ''small business'' under applicable federal law,
14 of 16

289 as established in the United States Code and promulgated from time to time by the United States
290 Small Business Administration.
291 (b) Investments shall be made by banks or financial institutions with demonstrated
292 experience making capital available to small businesses with good management, which are fast
293 growing and identify the potential to use increased capital to create jobs and which are
294 experiencing difficulty in accessing capital.
295 (c) Capital shall be provided to small businesses in a variety of financial instruments,
296 including but not limited to: working capital and expansion loans to businesses, both secured and
297 non-secured; provide lines of credit; capital expenditure loans; term loans; project finance loans;
298 grants; loan guarantees; and mezzanine and structured finance loans.
299 (d) Capital shall not be provided unless financial and managerial advisory services are
300 also provided to the business that is served.
301 (7)(a) It shall be the policy of the PRIM board to use minority investment managers to
302 manage PRIT Fund assets, encompassing all asset classes, and to increase the racial, ethnic, and
303 gender diversity of PRIT Fund investments to the greatest extent feasible, consistent with sound
304 investment policy. The PRIM board and the executive director shall take affirmative steps to
305 remove any barriers to the full participation of minority investment managers in investment
306 opportunities. Such affirmative steps shall include, but not be limited to, consideration of
307 whether current investment policy discourages the use of minority investment managers through
308 quantitative or qualitative restrictions, including, but not limited to, number of years track record
309 and minimum assets under management.
15 of 16

310 (b) It shall be the goal of the PRIM board that not less than 20 per cent of investment
311 managers be minorities, females and persons with disabilities. It shall further be the goal of the
312 PRIM board to utilize businesses owned by minorities, females and persons with disabilities for
313 not less than 20 per cent of total contracts awarded pursuant to section 23B.
314 (c) Annually, not later than January 15 of each year, the PRIM board shall file with the
315 house and senate committee on ways and means and with the joint committee on public service a
316 report detailing its progress toward implementing the policies and goals outlined above. Such
317 report shall include documentation related to all minority investment managers considered for
318 investment, including documentation, where applicable, of the reasons for declining any such
319 investment.
