Within 4 weeks of the appointment of joint standing committees in the first annual session of the
General Court, each joint standing committee shall adopt rules of procedure regarding its
conduct. Said rules of procedure, together with any amendments, shall be filed with the Clerk of
the Senate and the Clerk of the House and shall be available to the public and members of the
General Court on the official website for the General Court. No rule shall conflict with these
joint rules.
Except as provided by Joint Rule 1E or 1F, each matter shall be referred only to 1 joint
committee for consideration and all reports of matters by joint committees shall be made to the
2
House or the Senate, under Joint Rule 4, not to another joint committee. The committee to which
a matter is initially referred may discharge the matter to another committee with jurisdiction over
the matter.
Matters referred by either the Senate or the House to its committee on Ways and Means shall be
considered by the respective committees of the 2 branches, acting as a joint committee, when, in
the judgment of the chairs of the respective committees of the 2 branches, the interests of
legislation or the expedition of business will be better served by such joint consideration. Matters
may also be referred to the committees on Ways and Means, of the 2 branches, as a joint
committee.
The committees on Rules, together with the presiding officers of the 2 branches, acting
concurrently, may consider and suggest such measures as shall, in their judgment, tend to
facilitate the business of the session and a majority vote of the 2 branches shall be required to
approve such recommendations.
In order to assist the House and the Senate in their: (1) consideration and enactment of new
legislation and modifications of existing laws, when either are deemed to be appropriate; (2)
evaluation of the effectiveness and administration of laws and programs previously enacted; and
(3) appraisal of the conditions and circumstances which may indicate the desirability of enacting
new legislation, the various joint committees shall have the following oversight responsibilities:
(i) each joint committee shall review and study, on a continuing basis, the implementation,
administration, execution and effectiveness of those laws, or parts of law, the subject matter of
which is within the jurisdiction of that committee, the administrative regulations adopted to
implement those laws, and those state agencies or entities having responsibilities for the
administration and execution of such laws;
(ii) in carrying out these review and study activities, each committee shall determine whether
such laws, administrative regulations and programs under those laws are being implemented in
accordance with the intent of the General Court and whether such laws, administrative
regulations and programs should be continued, curtailed or eliminated;
(iii) each committee shall also review and study any conditions and circumstances which may
indicate the necessity or desirability of enacting new legislation within the jurisdiction of that
committee, regardless of whether any matter has been introduced on that subject, and shall, on a
continuing basis, undertake research on matters within the jurisdiction of that committee.
3
Committees shall coordinate oversight activities, under the direction of the presiding officers of
both branches, to achieve the maximum objectives of clauses (i), (ii) and (iii).
Each committee may, upon completion of its oversight hearings, report to the General Court the
results of its findings and recommendations together with accompanying corrective legislation, if
any, by filing the same with the Clerk of the House of Representatives or the Clerk of the Senate.
Copies of such reports shall be posted on the website of the General Court. The disposition of
said reports shall be determined by the Clerks with the approval of the Speaker and the President.
The Senate and House chairs of a joint committee may appoint subcommittees to investigate and
study any matter referred to said subcommittee. Any subcommittee so established shall be co-
chaired by a majority member of the Senate and a majority member of the House who are
members of the joint standing committee appointing the subcommittee. The composition of the
subcommittee shall be proportional to the composition of the appointing joint committee;
provided, however, that not less than 10 per cent of the subcommitteeâ€™s members shall be from
the minority party. Chairs of subcommittees shall not be considered chairs under section 9B of
chapter 3 of the General Laws. A subcommittee may, upon completion of an investigation and
study, report the results of the investigation and study together with legislation, if any, by filing
the same with the Senate and House chairs of the appointing joint committee.
In the case of a vacancy of a chair of a committee, the vice-chair shall perform all duties of said
prior chair until said vacancy is filled.
Temporary employees of the general court assigned to a joint committee who are students at an
accredited education institution or employees or grantees of other non-profit organizations under

Section 3:
section 501 (c) (3) of the Internal Revenue Code may receive compensation from such
organization, according to that organization's regular program of providing such compensation
for temporary governmental or public service employment. A temporary employee's Senate or
House supervisor shall establish the employee's total compensation, shall verify that the sum of
the employee's state compensation, if any, and that any outside compensation the employee is to
receive under this rule would not exceed this total compensation, and shall file the written terms
of the employee's compensation with the Senate or House Human Resources Office, where it
shall be available for public inspection. The temporary employee shall sign a confidentiality and
ethics agreement provided by the Senate or House Human Resources Office. Joint employees
shall complete appropriate training as required by either branch of the general court, as may be
4
agreed upon by the Senate and House Offices of Human Resources. [Amended Jan. 6, 18 82; Jan. 5, 18 83;

legislative session. The bill sponsor shall provide the committee a comprehensive summary of
said bill prior to the hearing. Said summary shall be made available along with the text of the bill
on the website of the general court; provided said summary shall disclose that the summary was
created by the sponsor of the bill and the committee does not certify the accuracy of its contents;
provided further nothing in this rule shall prevent a joint standing committee from completing its
own summary and making said summary publicly available. [Adopted June 3, 1985; Amended Feb. 12,

Section 4:

and, to the extent feasible, the day of the week and times during that day set aside for formal
sessions by the respective branches.
Hearings shall be made available on a platform that permits remote public participation from
outside the hearing room through audio and video technology; provided, however, the chairs
may by agreement waive this requirement for technological, operational or logistical reasons.
Chairs shall schedule hearings that offer remote participation through Legislative Information
Services and the Sergeant-at-Arms. Members of the committee may participate remotely and
shall have the same privileges, rights and responsibilities as if the member were physically
present at the hearing location, and other members may offer remote testimony before
5
committees of which they are not a member. The agenda for such a hearing shall specify how
members of the public may access, monitor and participate in the remote aspect of the meeting.
Nothing contained herein shall limit the ability of a committee to meet in executive session,
prevent disruption or maintain decorum during the hearing. Committees may adopt rules to
govern the orderly and efficient operation of such hearings.
[Adopted June 3, 1985; Amended June 12, 1995; Mar. 7, 2019.]
1D. All hearings of joint standing committees, and special joint committees of the Senate and
House of Representatives, shall be open to the public, and any person shall be permitted to attend
any such hearing unless such committee convenes in executive session; provided however that
prior to entering executive session said committee shall state its purpose in executive session and
take a public vote that requires a minimum of two-thirds of the members of the committee voting
in the affirmative to enter said executive session. All joint standing committees shall determine a
schedule for committee hearings in accordance with 1C. These committee schedules shall be
submitted to the Clerk of the House and Senate who shall cause them to be published on the
official website for the General Court. Establishment of such schedules shall not preclude joint
standing committees from scheduling additional hearings or meetings as needed. All joint
standing committees, and special joint committees of the Senate and House of Representatives,
shall notify the Sergeant-at-Arms of the time, place and agenda of all public hearings not less
than 5 days prior to the time of such meetings. The 5 day requirement shall be suspended in an
emergency only after all reasonable efforts have been made to contact all committee members
and upon a recorded vote of at least a majority of the members of each branch appointed to the
committee, but not less than two-thirds of the members of each branch voting. If public
testimony is being solicited, agendas shall include an electronic mail address or other mechanism
for the submission of testimony and shall inform the public that testimony received may be made
publicly available. Any such public testimony received by the committee that is readily capable
of being reproduced shall be made available on the general court website; provided, however,
that the committee chair or testifier may redact such public testimony that includes sensitive
personal information or information that may jeopardize health, wellness or safety; provided
further, the committee on rules shall promulgate guidance for committees to ensure the
disclosure of relevant information and the non-disclosure of inappropriate material. If expert
testimony is being solicited by the committee, the committee shall make reasonable efforts to
promote the diversity of expert witness panels.
6
Nothing contained in this rule shall prohibit a joint standing committee or special joint
committee of the Senate and the House of Representatives from taking appropriate action
including, but not limited to, the exclusion of a person from a committee meeting in order to
prevent the disruption of or interference with committee proceedings. All meetings of joint
standing committees, and special joint committees of the Senate and House of Representatives,
shall be limited to no more than 50 bills to be discussed in a hearing, unless it can be determined
that all of the bills being considered are of the same subject matter.
A meeting of a committee may be recorded by a person in attendance by means of a recorder or
any other means of audio/visual reproduction except when a meeting is held in executive session;
provided, that a person seeking to record a meeting of a committee notifies the Chairs of the
committee prior to commencing such recording; and provided further, that during such recording
there is no interference with the conduct of the meeting.
The Chairs of each committee shall preserve decorum and order during each committee hearing.
The use of visual aids including, without limitation, posters, displays, or charts shall be permitted
only upon approval of the Chairs.
Joint Committees may receive testimony from public officials out of the regular order of
participation; provided, however, that if a committee follows such a practice, public officials of
Indigenous communities shall be treated accordingly.
At any time after a matter filed by a member of the general court has had a public hearing, a co-
chair of a Committee may initiate a vote thereon if the matter is filed in the branch of said chair.
Said vote shall be taken from each member of the branch of said chair, and if a majority of the
members of said branch voting on the matter vote in support of the matter, then the bill shall be
reported favorably and referred to the branch of origination unless it is a money bill, in which
case said bill shall be referred to the House of Representatives. The Senate chair and the senate
members of the committee shall have no authority or ability to impede the vote on a bill in the
Committee filed by a member of the house of representatives, and the House Chair and the
House members shall have no authority or ability to impede the vote on a bill in the Committee
filed by a member of the senate; provided, however a co-chair shall notify their co-chair prior to
a vote. A co-chair of the Committee shall provide to the members of their branch on the
Committee either the text or comprehensive summaries of the bills or other forms of legislative
matters prior to a vote thereon. Any recorded votes on a favorable or adverse report or study
7
order on an individual bill, taken by roll call or electronic poll of each member, shall be posted
on the website of the General Court.
Any matter not filed by a member of the General Court, including, but not limited to, matters
filed by the Governor, shall have a hearing and a vote scheduled upon agreement of the co-chairs
of the Committee. Said vote shall be taken from each member of the Committee and if a majority
of the members of the Committee voting on the matter vote in support of the matter, then the bill
shall be reported favorably and referred to the branch in which the matter was originally
introduced except that reports on money bills shall be made to the House. [Adopted June 3, 1985.
Amended June 12, 1995; Feb. 20, 2007; Mar. 14, 2013; Mar. 7, 2019.]
1E. The joint standing committee on Health Care Financing shall review all legislation relating
to health care to evaluate the appropriateness and fiscal effect of such legislation. A matter
within the jurisdiction of said committee may, if appropriate, initially be referred to another joint
standing committee sharing jurisdiction of the subject-matter. Any matter reported favorably by
such joint standing committee shall be referred to the joint committee on Health Care Financing;
provided, however, that notwithstanding any rule to the contrary, any such matter so reported
shall not be read a first time in the branch in which the report was received. The next favorable
report on any such matter, if made by a joint committee, may be made to either branch. Such
next favorable report shall be considered the first reading. The branch of origin for any such bill
so reported shall be the branch receiving such favorable report.
For all matters initially referred to the joint committee on Health Care Financing and not
previously referred to another joint committee, the joint committee on Health Care Financing
may make favorable reports to either branch, at the discretion of the committee, except that
reports on money bills shall be made to the House.

$100,000; provided, however, that any matter reported by the committee on Health Care
Financing with a fiscal effect of less than $100,000 shall not be referred, under the rules, to the
committee on Ways and Means. [Adopted Jan. 26, 2005; Amended May 19, 2005; Feb. 20, 2007; Feb. 12, 2009.]

1F. The joint committee on Bonding, Capital Expenditures and State Assets shall review all
legislation providing for the giving, loaning or pledging of the credit of the Commonwealth (see
Article LXII of the Amendments to the Constitution, as amended by Article LXXXIV). Said
committee shall be responsible for evaluating such legislation and determining the
appropriateness of enacting legislation containing increased bond authorizations for the
Commonwealth. The committee shall periodically review and hold open public hearings,
accepting oral and written testimony on the status of the bonds and notes of the Commonwealth,
including (1) general obligation debt; (2) dedicated income tax debt; and (3) special obligation
debt. The committee shall also, in its continuing study of the stateâ€™s bonding practices, review
the Commonwealthâ€™s liabilities relative to (a) state-supported debt; (b) state-guaranteed debt; and
(c) indirect obligations.
Any bill providing for borrowing for new projects, and requiring the Commonwealth to issue
bonds for such purpose, shall, prior to its reference to the committee on Ways and Means, be
referred to the committee on Bonding, Capital Expenditures and State Assets for report on its
relationship to the finances of the Commonwealth. A measure may initially be referred to
another joint committee with jurisdiction over the subject matter before being referred to the
committee on Bonding, Capital Expenditures and State Assets; provided, however, that
notwithstanding any rule to the contrary, any such matter so reported shall not be read a first time
in the branch in which the report was received. The next favorable report on any such matter by
the committee on Bonding, Capital Expenditures and State Assets shall be considered the first
reading. The branch of origin for any such bill so reported shall be the branch receiving such
favorable report.
The provisions of Joint Rule 4 shall apply to all matters referred to the joint committee on
Bonding, Capital Expenditures and State Assets, except that where constitutionally prohibited.
The joint committee shall consult with the various agencies of the Executive branch and the

conduct hearings relative to the statutory authority of the Executive branch and the Treasurer and

determine whether such laws, administrative regulations and programs are being implemented in
accordance with the intent of the General Court.
The committee on Bonding, Capital Expenditures and State Assets shall be authorized to report
to the General Court from time to time on the results of its hearings and to file drafts of
legislation necessary to carry its recommendations into effect.

Senate and House committee chairs and the Senate and House ranking minority members may
designate 1 or more members of their staff who may receive such security clearance.
Any person who receives security clearance under this rule shall sign all confidentiality
agreements required by homeland security officials. The breach of any such confidentiality
agreement shall constitute a violation of the Joint Rules of the Senate and House of
Representatives. Any alleged violation of a confidentiality agreement shall be referred for
investigation to the Senate committee on Ethics and Rules or the House committee on Ethics,
respectively, and, if appropriate, to law enforcement authorities for potential criminal
prosecution. [Adopted Jan. 26, 2005; Amended Feb. 12, 2009; Mar. 7, 2019.]

privilege or benefit or any measure providing for the creation of, or directly affecting any,
10

3A. A joint standing committee may, upon the written and signed report of two-thirds of the
members of the Senate and two-thirds of the members of the House appointed to said committee,
report a bill or other form of legislation without said legislation being founded upon petition;

referred to the committee. The committee shall hold a public hearing on such bill or other form
of legislation before it is reported. A bill or other form of legislation so reported shall be placed

General Court, may report by bill or otherwise such legislation as may be germane to the subject
matter referred to them. [Adopted June 3, 1985.]

Section 7:
4. Favorable reports, and adverse reports on subjects of legislation other than petitions, by joint
committees shall be made to the branch in which the matter was originally introduced except that
reports on money bills shall be made to the House and if adverse reports on matters other than
petitions which are accompanied by money bills are accepted by the House, this shall constitute
final rejection. Adverse reports by joint committees on petitions shall be made to the branch in
which the petition was originally introduced, except that such adverse reports on petitions
accompanied by proposed money bills shall be made to the House; and, if accepted by the branch
in which they are made, shall be considered as a final rejection. When a report is made from any
committee to either branch, and the subject-matter of the report is subsequently referred to a joint
committee, such committee, except for the committee on Health Care Financing, shall report its
action to the branch in which the reference originated. [See also Joint Rule 5.]

branches, acting concurrently, may be recommitted to the same committees at the pleasure of the
branch acting on the report, and bills or resolves may be recommitted in either branch. If a bill or

committee. A concurrent vote shall, however, be necessary for re-committal, with instructions.
After recommitment, report shall, in all cases, be made to the branch originating the

amendment, which shall be deemed to have been introduced by the member of the Senate who
reports for the committee; and the procedure as regards reporting, filing and subsequent action
shall be that provided for legislative amendments by this rule. Or the joint committee may report
ought not to pass for the reason that no legislation is necessary or that the recommendation ought

so substituted unless consideration in joint session is called for under the Constitution. If either
branch calls for the consideration of any proposal in joint session, notice of its action shall be
sent to the other branch; and it shall then be the duty of the Senate and the House of
Representatives to arrange for the holding of the joint session not later than the second
Wednesday in May. Subject to the requirements of the Constitution, joint sessions or

House or the Senate, under Joint Rule 4, not to another joint committee. The committee to which
a matter is initially referred may discharge the matter to another committee with jurisdiction over
the matter.
Matters referred by either the Senate or the House to its committee on Ways and Means shall be
considered by the respective committees of the 2 branches, acting as a joint committee, when, in
the judgment of the chairs of the respective committees of the 2 branches, the interests of
legislation or the expedition of business will be better served by such joint consideration. Matters

administration, execution and effectiveness of those laws, or parts of law, the subject matter of
which is within the jurisdiction of that committee, the administrative regulations adopted to
implement those laws, and those state agencies or entities having responsibilities for the
administration and execution of such laws;
(ii) in carrying out these review and study activities, each committee shall determine whether
such laws, administrative regulations and programs under those laws are being implemented in
accordance with the intent of the General Court and whether such laws, administrative
regulations and programs should be continued, curtailed or eliminated;
(iii) each committee shall also review and study any conditions and circumstances which may
indicate the necessity or desirability of enacting new legislation within the jurisdiction of that
committee, regardless of whether any matter has been introduced on that subject, and shall, on a
continuing basis, undertake research on matters within the jurisdiction of that committee.

members of the joint standing committee appointing the subcommittee. The composition of the
subcommittee shall be proportional to the composition of the appointing joint committee;
provided, however, that not less than 10 per cent of the subcommitteeâ€™s members shall be from
the minority party. Chairs of subcommittees shall not be considered chairs under section 9B of
chapter 3 of the General Laws. A subcommittee may, upon completion of an investigation and
study, report the results of the investigation and study together with legislation, if any, by filing
the same with the Senate and House chairs of the appointing joint committee.
In the case of a vacancy of a chair of a committee, the vice-chair shall perform all duties of said
prior chair until said vacancy is filled.
Temporary employees of the general court assigned to a joint committee who are students at an
accredited education institution or employees or grantees of other non-profit organizations under

organization, according to that organization's regular program of providing such compensation
for temporary governmental or public service employment. A temporary employee's Senate or
House supervisor shall establish the employee's total compensation, shall verify that the sum of
the employee's state compensation, if any, and that any outside compensation the employee is to

Nothing contained in this rule shall prohibit a joint standing committee or special joint
committee of the Senate and the House of Representatives from taking appropriate action

shall be limited to no more than 50 bills to be discussed in a hearing, unless it can be determined
that all of the bills being considered are of the same subject matter.
A meeting of a committee may be recorded by a person in attendance by means of a recorder or
any other means of audio/visual reproduction except when a meeting is held in executive session;
provided, that a person seeking to record a meeting of a committee notifies the Chairs of the
committee prior to commencing such recording; and provided further, that during such recording
there is no interference with the conduct of the meeting.
The Chairs of each committee shall preserve decorum and order during each committee hearing.
The use of visual aids including, without limitation, posters, displays, or charts shall be permitted
only upon approval of the Chairs.

At any time after a matter filed by a member of the general court has had a public hearing, a co-
chair of a Committee may initiate a vote thereon if the matter is filed in the branch of said chair.
Said vote shall be taken from each member of the branch of said chair, and if a majority of the
members of said branch voting on the matter vote in support of the matter, then the bill shall be
reported favorably and referred to the branch of origination unless it is a money bill, in which

filed by the Governor, shall have a hearing and a vote scheduled upon agreement of the co-chairs
of the Committee. Said vote shall be taken from each member of the Committee and if a majority
of the members of the Committee voting on the matter vote in support of the matter, then the bill

such joint standing committee shall be referred to the joint committee on Health Care Financing;
provided, however, that notwithstanding any rule to the contrary, any such matter so reported
shall not be read a first time in the branch in which the report was received. The next favorable
report on any such matter, if made by a joint committee, may be made to either branch. Such
next favorable report shall be considered the first reading. The branch of origin for any such bill
so reported shall be the branch receiving such favorable report.

another joint committee with jurisdiction over the subject matter before being referred to the

which the petition was originally introduced, except that such adverse reports on petitions
accompanied by proposed money bills shall be made to the House; and, if accepted by the branch
in which they are made, shall be considered as a final rejection. When a report is made from any

an amendment to the Constitution made by the Governor or contained in a report authorized to
be made to the General Court may report on the recommendation a proposal for a legislative
amendment, which shall be deemed to have been introduced by the member of the Senate who
reports for the committee; and the procedure as regards reporting, filing and subsequent action
shall be that provided for legislative amendments by this rule. Or the joint committee may report
ought not to pass for the reason that no legislation is necessary or that the recommendation ought

shall be followed. If such an adverse report is amended in the Senate by substituting a proposal
for a legislative amendment, notice of the Senate's action shall be sent to the House and said
proposal, together with the official papers relating to the subject, shall be in the custody of the
Clerk of the Senate; and if said report is so amended in the House, the proposal, duly endorsed,

so substituted unless consideration in joint session is called for under the Constitution. If either
branch calls for the consideration of any proposal in joint session, notice of its action shall be
sent to the other branch; and it shall then be the duty of the Senate and the House of
Representatives to arrange for the holding of the joint session not later than the second
Wednesday in May. Subject to the requirements of the Constitution, joint sessions or
continuances of joint sessions of the 2 branches to consider proposals for specific amendments to
the Constitution, and all rules or procedures, shall be determined only by concurrent votes of the
2 branches. The rules relative to joint conventions shall apply to the joint sessions of the 2
houses. [Adopted Feb. 21, 1919. Amended March 30, 1921; April 11, 1935; Jan. 12, 1939; Jan. 15, 1945; Nov. 9, 1951; Jan.
