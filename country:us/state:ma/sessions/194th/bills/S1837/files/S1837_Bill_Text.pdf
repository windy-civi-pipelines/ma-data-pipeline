22 are members of the Massachusetts State Employees Retirement System as required by section 22
23 of Chapter 32, by the first day of the second month following the work month, to pay an
24 additional amount equal to 10% of the total amount of delinquent contributions. The state
25 retirement board shall have the right to commence an action in contract for payment of
26 outstanding amounts determined to be due in accordance with the provisions of this chapter.
