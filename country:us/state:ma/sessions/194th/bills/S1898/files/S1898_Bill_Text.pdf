An Act authorizing the appointment of retired police officers to perform police details in the
town of Plainville.
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives in General Court assembled, and by the authority
of the same, as follows:
1 SECTION 1. The town administrator of the town of Plainville may appoint retired police
2 officers of the town of Plainville as special police officers to perform police details or other
3 police duties arising from police details or during the course of police detail work, whether or not
4 related to the detail work. The retired police officer shall have been a regular, full-time police
5 officer who retired in good standing and based on superannuation. A special police officer
6 appointed pursuant to this act shall not be subject to the maximum age restrictions for police
7 officers set forth in chapter 32 of the General Laws, but shall not be eligible to serve as a special
8 police officer once the special police officer has reached the age of 70. No further deductions
9 shall be made from the regular compensation of any special police officers appointed pursuant to
1 of 4

10 this act under Chapter 32 of the General Laws for any service performed subsequent to their
11 reaching the age of 65.
12 SECTION 2. Prior to appointment as a special police officer pursuant to this act, a retired
13 police officer shall: (i) pass a medical examination conducted by a physician selected by the
14 chief of police of the town of Plainville to determine whether the retired police officer is capable
15 of performing the essential duties of a special police officer; and (ii) provide proof of that
16 passage to the chief of police. Additional post-appointment fitness for duty examinations may be
17 required of a special police officer by the chief of police if, in the chief of police's sole discretion,
18 a question as to that special police officer's fitness for duty has arisen. The cost of all medical
19 examinations pursuant to this section shall be borne by the retired or special police officer.
20 SECTION 3. A special police officer appointed pursuant to this act shall not be subject to
21 chapter 31, sections 98A and 111F of chapter 41 or chapter 150E of the General Laws. A special
22 police officer may be required by the chief of police, as a condition of employment, to purchase
23 an insurance policy that indemnifies the town of Plainville against workers' compensation costs
24 in the event that the special police officer is injured while performing duties of a special police
25 officer.
26 SECTION 4. A special police officer appointed pursuant to this act shall be subject to the
27 town policies, procedures, rules and regulations of the police department of the town of
28 Plainville including, but not limited to, those policies, procedures, rules and regulations
29 governing training, equipment, uniforms, certifications or any other restrictions or requirements
30 related to employment as a special police officer. A special police officer appointed under this
31 act shall comply with all requirements of chapter 6E of the General Laws, including: (i)
2 of 4

32 maintaining certification and good standing with the Massachusetts Peace Officer Standards and
33 Training Commission; and (ii) complying with all annual in-service and other training
34 requirements mandated by the municipal police training committee.
35 SECTION 5. A special police officer of the town of Plainville, while performing the
36 duties described in this act, shall have the same power of arrest and authority to perform other
37 police functions as a full-time, regular police officer of the town of Plainville.
38 SECTION 6. A special police officer shall be appointed annually for a term of 1 year
39 commencing on July 1, but shall serve at the pleasure of the town of Plainville and may be
40 suspended or removed from the appointment by the town administrator at any time. In the case
41 of removal, the special police officer shall be provided with 14 days written notice before
42 removal.
43 SECTION 7. The chief of police of the town of Plainville may restrict the type of detail
44 assignments that special police officers may work. The cost of all training equipment and
45 uniforms shall be borne by the special police officer except as otherwise determined by the chief
46 of police.
47 SECTION 8. Special police officers of the town of Plainville shall be sworn before the
48 clerk of the town of Plainville, who shall keep record of all appointments and expirations of
49 appointments.
50 SECTION 9. Special police officers appointed pursuant to this act shall be eligible for
51 indemnification pursuant to section 100 of chapter 41 of the General Laws. Special police
52 officers shall not be subject to sections 85H or 85H½ of chapter 32 of the General Laws and

55 detail or other duties shall be at the discretion of the chief of police of the town of Plainville.
