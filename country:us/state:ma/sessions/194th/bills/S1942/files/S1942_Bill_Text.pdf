10 SECTION 4. Section 1 of chapter 121A of the General Laws, as so appearing, is hereby
11 amended by replacing the definitions of “decadent area”, “sub-standard area”, and “project” with
12 the below definitions of those terms, and inserting the following additional definitions after the
13 definition of “project”-
14 “Decadent area”, an area, including a spot rehabilitation property, which is detrimental to
15 safety, health, morals, welfare or sound growth of a community because of the existence of a
16 building or buildings which are out of repair, physically deteriorated, unfit for human habitation,
17 or obsolete, or in need of major maintenance or repair, or because much of the real estate in
18 recent years has been sold or taken for non-payment of taxes or upon foreclosure of mortgages,
19 or because a building or buildings have been torn down and not replaced and in which under
20 existing conditions it is improbable that the building or buildings will be replaced, or because of
21 a substantial change in business or economic conditions, or because of inadequate light, air, or
22 open space, or because of excessive land coverage, or because diversity of ownership, irregular
23 lot sizes or obsolete street patterns make it improbable that the area will be redeveloped by the
24 ordinary operations of private enterprise, or by reason of any combination of the foregoing
25 conditions.
26 “Sub-standard area”, an area, including a spot rehabilitation property, upon which there is
27 a dwelling or wherein dwellings predominate which, by reason of dilapidation, overcrowding,
28 faulty arrangement or design, lack of ventilation, light, or sanitation facilities, or any
29 combination of these factors, are detrimental to safety, health, morals, welfare or sound growth
30 of a community.
2 of 12

31 “Project”, any undertaking consisting of the construction in one or more specified
32 blighted open, decadent or sub-standard areas of decent, safe and sanitary residential,

42 sub-standard area or areas; and (d) installation, construction, and reconstruction of public and
43 private ways, public utilities and services, and site improvements essential to the preparation of
44 blighted open, decadent or sub-standard area or areas for beneficial development or
45 redevelopment.
46 “Spot Blight Project Sponsor”, a community development corporation certified under
47 chapter 40H; a bona-fide non-profit organization, established under chapter 180 that has, in the
48 determination of the housing board, satisfactory and sufficient experience in the construction or
49 rehabilitation of residential or non-residential buildings, the creation or provision of affordable

64 or repair, or because the building has been sold or taken for non-payment of taxes or upon
65 foreclosure of mortgages.
