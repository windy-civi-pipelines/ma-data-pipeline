3 Section 38D. A board of assessors may request the owner or lessee of any real property to
4 make a written return under oath within sixty days containing such information as may
5 reasonably be required by it to determine the actual fair cash valuation of such property.
6 Failure of an owner or lessee of real property to comply with such request within 60 days

8 filing at the appellate tax board. The appellate tax board and the county commissioners shall not

11 comply in good faith. If any owner or lessee of real property in a return made under this section
12 makes any statement which he knows to be false in a material particular, such false statement
13 shall bar him from any statutory appeal under this chapter.
14 If an owner or lessee of Class one, residential property fails to submit the information
15 within the time and in the form prescribed, the owner shall be assessed an additional penalty for
16 the next ensuing tax year in the amount of $50 for single family dwellings and $250 for all other
17 residential real estate, but only if the board of assessors informed the owner or lessee that failure
18 to submit such information would result in the penalty.
19 If an owner or lessee of Class three, commercial or Class four, industrial property fails to
20 submit the information within the time and in the form prescribed, the owner or lessee shall be
21 assessed an additional penalty for the next ensuing tax year in the amount of $250 but only if the
22 board of assessors informed the owner or lessee that failure to so submit such information would
23 result in the penalty.
