95 purpose for processing the information has been satisfied, or (3) when the individual revokes

119 Privacy Policy, which shall include, at a minimum, the following:
120 (1) the permissible purpose for which the covered entity is collecting, processing, or
121 disclosing any location information;
122 (2) the type of location information collected, including the precision of the data;
123 (3) the identities of service providers with which the covered entity contracts with respect
124 to location data;
125 (4) any disclosures of location data necessary to carry out a permissible purpose and the

129 (6) the data management and data security policies governing location information; and
130 (7) the retention schedule and guidelines for permanently deleting location information.
131 (h) A covered entity in lawful possession of location information shall provide notice to
132 individuals to whom that information pertains of any change to its Location Privacy Policy at
133 least 20 business days before the change goes into effect, and shall request and obtain consent
134 before collecting or processing location information in accordance with the new Location
135 Privacy Policy.
136 (i) It shall be unlawful for a government entity to monetize location information.
137 Section 3: Prohibition Against Retaliation
7 of 10
138 A covered entity shall not take adverse action against an individual because the
139 individual exercised or refused to waive any of such individual’s rights under this chapter, unless
140 location data is essential to the provision of the good, service, or service feature that the
141 individual requests, and then only to the extent that such data is essential. This prohibition
142 includes but is not limited to:
143 (1) refusing to provide a good or service to the individual;
144 (2) charging different prices or rates for goods or services, including through the use of

147 Section 4. Enforcement
148 (a) A violation of this chapter or a regulation promulgated under this chapter regarding an
149 individual’s location information constitutes an injury to that individual and shall be deemed an
150 unfair or deceptive act or practice in the conduct of trade or commerce under chapter 93A.
151 (b) Any individual alleging a violation of this chapter by a covered entity or service
152 provider may bring a civil action in the superior court or any court of competent jurisdiction;
153 provided that, venue in the superior court shall be proper in the county in which the plaintiff
154 resides or was located at the time of any violation.

156 or otherwise, to file an administrative complaint with the attorney general or to accept mandatory
157 arbitration of a claim arising under this chapter.

158 (d) In a civil action in which the plaintiff prevails, the court may award (1) actual
159 damages, including damages for emotional distress, or $5,000 per violation, whichever is greater,
160 (2) punitive damages; and (3) any other relief, including but not limited to an injunction or
161 declaratory judgment, that the court deems to be appropriate. The court shall consider each
162 instance in which a covered entity or service provider collects, processes, or discloses location
163 information in a manner prohibited by this chapter or a regulation promulgated under this chapter
164 as constituting a separate violation of this chapter or regulation promulgated under this chapter.
165 In addition to any relief awarded, the court shall award reasonable attorney’s fees and costs to
166 any prevailing plaintiff.
167 (e) The attorney general may bring an action pursuant to section 4 of chapter 93A against
168 a covered entity or service provider to remedy violations of this chapter and for other relief that
169 may be appropriate.
170 (f) Any provision of a contract or agreement of any kind, including a covered entity’s
171 terms of service or policies, including but not limited to the Location Privacy Policy, that
172 purports to waive or limit in any way an individual’s rights under this chapter, including but not
173 limited to any right to a remedy or means of enforcement, shall be deemed contrary to state law
174 and shall be void and unenforceable.
175 (g) No private or government action brought pursuant to this chapter shall preclude any
176 other action under this chapter.
177 Section 5. Implementation
178 The Attorney General may adopt, amend or repeal rules and regulations for the
179 implementation, administration, and enforcement of this chapter.
9 of 10
