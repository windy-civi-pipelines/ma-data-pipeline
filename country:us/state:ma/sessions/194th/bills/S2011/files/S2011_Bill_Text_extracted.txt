Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives in General Court assembled, and by the authority
of the same, as follows:
1 SECTION 1. Section 6 of chapter 62 of the General Laws, as most recently amended by
2 section 103 of chapter 268 of the acts of 2022, is hereby further amended by adding the
3 following subsection:-
4 (dd) A person or taxpayer who employs persons engaged in “agricultural and farm work,”
5 as defined in section 2 of chapter 151, except when the employee is a parent, spouse, child or
6 other member of the employer's immediate family, shall be allowed a refundable credit against
7 the tax liability imposed by this chapter as follows: the amount of the refundable credit shall
8 equal up to 40% of the hourly wages paid for agricultural and farm work that exceeds the
9 employee’s regular hourly rate as overtime wages pursuant to section 1A of said chapter 151. For
10 taxpayers who employ persons engaged in “agricultural and farm work,” as defined in section 2
11 of chapter 151, the percentage of the refundable credit shall be determined by the number of
12 employees engaged in “agricultural and farm work”, as defined in section 2 of chapter 151,
13 employed by the taxpayer, and scaled according to size, such that farms with fewer employees
1 of 5
14 engaged in “agricultural and farm work” will receive a tax credit worth a larger percent of their
15 overtime wages paid than farms with a larger number of employees engaged in “agricultural and
16 farm work” will receive. The tax credit shall not exceed 40%. If the amount of the credit allowed
17 under this section exceeds the taxpayer's liability, the commissioner of revenue shall treat such
18 excess as an overpayment and shall pay the taxpayer 100 per cent of the amount of such excess,
19 without interest.

24 child or other member of the employer's immediate family, shall be allowed a refundable credit
25 against the tax liability imposed by this chapter as follows: the amount of the refundable credit
26 shall equal up to 40% of the hourly wages paid for agricultural and farm work that exceeds the
27 employee’s regular hourly rate as overtime wages pursuant to section 1A of said chapter 151. For
28 taxpayers who employ persons engaged in “agricultural and farm work,” as defined in section 2
29 of chapter 151, the percentage of the refundable credit shall be determined by the number of
30 employees engaged in “agricultural and farm work”, as defined in section 2 of chapter 151,
31 employed by the taxpayer, and scaled according to size, such that farms with fewer employees
32 engaged in “agricultural and farm work” will receive a tax credit worth a larger percent of their
33 overtime wages paid than farms with a larger number of employees engaged in “agricultural and
34 farm work” will receive. The tax credit shall not exceed 40%. If the amount of the credit allowed
35 under this section exceeds the taxpayer's liability, the commissioner of revenue shall treat such
2 of 5
