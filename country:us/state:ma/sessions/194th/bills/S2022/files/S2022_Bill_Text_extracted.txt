31 home. In the case of a property owned jointly, the State would be repaid when the surviving
32 owner dies or sells;
33 i) The State’s lien would have the same priority as the municipal liens for unpaid taxes
34 and the State would have the right to foreclose if the outstanding deferred tax amounts remain
