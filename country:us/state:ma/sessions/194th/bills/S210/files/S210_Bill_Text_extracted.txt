9 preauthorization for any repair of a complex rehabilitation technology wheelchair estimated to
10 cost less than $1,000.

20 such type of wheelchair.
21 “Collateral costs”, expenses incurred by a consumer in connection with the repair of a

27 “Consumer”, (i) the purchaser of a wheelchair, including purchases covered by private or

5 of 15
97 “IMPORTANT: IF THIS WHEELCHAIR IS DEFECTIVE WITHIN THE PERIOD OF
98 YOUR WARRANTY, [INSERT WARRANTY PERIOD, NOT LESS THAN 2 YEARS FROM
99 THE DATE OF FIRST DELIVERY], YOU MAY BE ENTITLED UNDER STATE LAW TO
100 REPLACEMENT OF THE WHEELCHAIR OR A REFUND OF ITS PURCHASE PRICE. TO
101 BE ENTITLED TO A REFUND OR REPLACEMENT, YOU MUST FIRST NOTIFY THE
102 MANUFACTURER, THE WHEELCHAIR LESSOR OR THE WHEELCHAIR DEALER OF
103 THE NON-CONFORMITY AND GIVE THE MANUFACTURER OR AUTHORIZED
104 WHEELCHAIR DEALER AN OPPORTUNITY TO REPAIR THE WHEELCHAIR IN
105 ACCORDANCE WITH SECTION 107 OF CHAPTER 93 OF THE MASSACHUSETTS
106 GENERAL LAWS.
107 IF THIS WHEELCHAIR IS DEFECTIVE WITHIN THE PERIOD OF YOUR
108 WARRANTY, THE MANUFACTURER OR AUTHORIZED WHEELCHAIR DEALER
109 MUST PERFORM A REMOTE ASSESSMENT OF THE WHEELCHAIR NOT MORE THAN
110 3 BUSINESS DAYS FOLLOWING NOTICE AND, IF NECESSARY, PERFORM AN IN-
111 PERSON ASSESSMENT NOT MORE THAN 4 BUSINESS DAYS FOLLOWING THE
112 REMOTE ASSESSMENT.
113 IF NECESSARY, THE MANUFACTURER OR AUTHORIZED WHEELCHAIR
114 DEALER SHALL PROVIDE A TEMPORARY LOANER WHEELCHAIR FOR THE
115 DURATION OF REPAIRS PROVIDED FOR UNDER THE WARRANTY AS SOON AS
116 POSSIBLE, BUT NOT MORE THAN 4 BUSINESS DAYS FOLLOWING NOTICE FOR
117 STANDARD WHEELCHAIRS AND 8 BUSINESS DAYS FOLLOWING NOTICE FOR
118 CUSTOMIZED, ADAPTED OR MODIFIED WHEELCHAIRS.”.
6 of 15
119 (3) If the manufacturer, lessor or wheelchair dealer fail to provide the statement of
120 warranty as required pursuant to this subsection, the manufacturer shall be in violation of this
121 subsection and the minimum express warranty period shall be extended to 3 years.
122 (c)(1) If a new wheelchair is defective and the consumer reports such nonconformity to
123 the manufacturer, a wheelchair lessor or a wheelchair dealer and such consumer makes the
124 wheelchair available for repair prior to the expiration of the applicable warranty period from the
125 date of first delivery, the nonconformity shall be repaired at no charge to the consumer. It shall
126 be presumed that the consumer has made the wheelchair available to the manufacturer or
127 authorized wheelchair dealer for repair if such consumer allows the manufacturer or dealer to
128 take it from the consumer’s home or other location where the user customarily uses the
129 wheelchair.
130 (2) If a wheelchair covered by a manufacturer’s warranty has a nonconformity to which
131 the warranty is applicable and is made available by the consumer to the manufacturer or
132 authorized wheelchair dealer for the repair of the nonconformity, the manufacturer shall:
133 (i) perform, or coordinate with an authorized wheelchair dealer to perform, a remote
134 assessment of the original wheelchair not more than 3 business days following notice from the
135 consumer and, if it is determined that a remote assessment is not sufficient to diagnose the
136 nonconformity, an in-person assessment not more than 4 business days following the remote
137 assessment; provided, however, that if a consumer cancels the initial remote assessment and the
138 manufacturer or authorized wheelchair dealer makes reasonable efforts to reschedule the
139 assessment as soon as feasible, the manufacturer or authorized wheelchair dealer shall not be in
140 violation of this clause; provided, however, that the manufacturer or authorized dealer shall
7 of 15
141 provide the consumer with an estimated timeframe for assessment and, following assessment, an
142 estimated timeframe for any repairs;
143 (ii) provide, or coordinate with an authorized wheelchair dealer to provide, for the
144 duration of the repair period, directly and at no cost to the consumer, as selected by the consumer
145 and as soon as reasonably possible: (A) a temporary loaner wheelchair not more than 4 business
146 days following notice from the consumer if the original wheelchair is a standard wheelchair and
147 not more than 8 business days following notice by the consumer if the original wheelchair has
148 been customized, adapted or modified to the extent that a standard wheelchair is not a suitable
149 temporary loaner wheelchair; or (B) reimbursement for the cost incurred by the consumer for
150 renting a wheelchair while the original wheelchair is assessed and repaired; and
151 (iii) cover all of the consumer’s collateral costs.
152 (3) If, after a reasonable attempt to repair, the nonconformity is not repaired, the
153 manufacturer shall:
154 (i) at the direction of a consumer other than one who leases a wheelchair: (A) accept
155 return of the original wheelchair, issue a replacement wheelchair and refund any collateral costs;
156 or (B) accept return of the wheelchair and refund to the consumer and to any holder of a
157 perfected security interest, as their interest may appear, the full purchase price and any finance
158 charge amount paid by the consumer at the point of sale and any collateral costs, less a
159 reasonable allowance for use; provided, however, that a reasonable allowance for use shall not
160 exceed the amount obtained by multiplying the full purchase price of the wheelchair by a
161 fraction, the denominator of which shall be 1,825 and the numerator of which shall be the
8 of 15
162 number of days that the wheelchair was in the consumer's possession before the consumer first
163 reported the nonconformity to the wheelchair dealer; or
164 (ii) at the direction of a consumer who leases a wheelchair, accept return of the original
165 wheelchair, refund to the wheelchair lessor and to any holder of a perfected security interest, as
166 their interest may appear, the current value of the written lease and refund to the consumer the
167 amount such consumer paid under the written lease and any collateral costs, less a reasonable
168 allowance for use; provided, however, that a reasonable allowance for use shall not exceed the
169 amount obtained by multiplying the total amount for which the written lease obligates the
170 consumer by a fraction, the denominator of which shall be 1,825, or the number of days of the
171 lease, whichever number is greater, and the numerator of which shall be half of the number of
172 days that the consumer possessed the wheelchair before first reporting the nonconformity to the
173 manufacturer, wheelchair lessor or wheelchair dealer; and provided further, that
174 the current value of the written lease shall be the total amount for which that lease
175 obligates the consumer during the period of the lease remaining after its early termination, plus
176 the wheelchair dealer's early termination costs and the value of the original wheelchair at the
177 lease expiration date if the lease sets forth that value, less the wheelchair lessor's early
178 termination savings.
179 To receive a replacement wheelchair or a refund due under paragraph (3) of this
180 subsection, a consumer described thereunder shall offer to transfer possession of the wheelchair
181 having the nonconformity to its manufacturer. Not later than 30 days after such offer, the
182 manufacturer shall provide the consumer with the replacement wheelchair or refund. When the
183 manufacturer provides the replacement wheelchair or refund, the consumer shall make the
9 of 15
184 wheelchair having the nonconformity available for return to the manufacturer, along with any
185 endorsements necessary to transfer legal possession to the manufacturer.
186 (4)(i) To receive a refund due under clause (i) of paragraph (3) of subsection (C), a
187 consumer described thereunder shall offer to return the original wheelchair to its manufacturer.
188 Not later than 30 days after such offer, the manufacturer shall provide the refund to the
189 consumer. When the manufacturer provides the refund, the consumer shall make the original
190 wheelchair available for return to the manufacturer.
191 (ii) To receive a refund due under paragraph (3) of subsection (C), a wheelchair lessor
192 shall offer to transfer possession of the original wheelchair to its manufacturer. No later than 30
193 days after such offer, the manufacturer shall provide the refund to the wheelchair lessor. When
194 the manufacturer provides the refund, the wheelchair lessor shall provide to the manufacturer any
195 endorsements necessary to transfer legal possession to the manufacturer.
196 A lease against a consumer shall not be enforced after such consumer exercises rights
197 pursuant to clause (ii) of paragraph (3).
198 A wheelchair returned by a consumer or wheelchair lessor in the commonwealth, or by a
199 consumer or wheelchair lessor in another state under a similar law of that state, shall not be
200 resold or leased in the commonwealth unless the reasons for such return have been fully
201 disclosed to a prospective buyer or lessee.
202 (5) Manufacturers shall fill all repair and replacement orders for wheelchairs under
203 warranty pursuant to this section from their own inventory or have a written subcontract for the
204 purchase of items necessary to fill repair and replacement orders; provided, however, that the
205 subcontract shall be in writing and contain, at a minimum: (i) names, addresses, phone numbers
10 of 15
206 and contact information for both entities; (ii) the contract term start and end dates; (iii) a
207 description of the wheelchairs covered under the subcontract and the cost of each item; (iv)
208 signatures of both parties, including signature dates and position titles; (v) an established credit
209 limit that is reasonable, based on the value of the products and services to be provided by the
210 contractor; and (vi) a provision requiring shipping of parts, whenever feasible, by overnight mail.
211 (6) The manufacturer shall keep written record of all repair attempts made, including, but
212 not limited to: (i) the date a repair was requested; (ii) the type of repair requested; (iii) the date
213 the repair attempt began; (iv) the length of the repair attempt; (v) collateral costs covered; (vi)
214 the results of the repair attempt; and (vii) the total number of repair attempts made.
215 (d) Each consumer shall have the option of submitting any dispute arising under this
216 section, upon the payment of a prescribed filing fee, to an alternate arbitration mechanism
217 established pursuant to regulations promulgated under this section by the undersecretary of
218 consumer affairs and business regulation. Upon application of the consumer and payment of the
219 appropriate filing fee by the consumer, a manufacturer shall submit to alternative arbitration. The
220 alternate arbitration shall be conducted by a professional arbitrator or arbitration firm appointed
221 by and pursuant to the regulations promulgated by the office of consumer affairs and business
222 regulation pursuant to this section. The alternate arbitration mechanism shall ensure the personal
223 objectivity of its arbitrators and the right of each party to present its case, be in attendance during
224 any presentation made by the other party and rebut or refute such presentation.
225 (e) The attorney general may bring an action under section 4 of chapter 93A to enforce
226 this section and to obtain restitution, civil penalties, injunctive relief and any other relief awarded
227 pursuant to said chapter 93A. Nothing contained in this section shall limit any rights or remedies
11 of 15
228 available to a consumer under any other law. Any waiver by a consumer of rights under this
229 section shall be void.
230 (f) In addition to any other remedy at law, a consumer may bring an action to recover for
231 damages caused by a violation of this section. The court shall award a consumer who prevails in
232 such an action twice the amount of any pecuniary loss, together with costs, disbursements and
233 reasonable attorney fees, and any equitable relief that the court deems is appropriate.
234 (g) Annually, not later than January 1, the office of consumer affairs and business
235 regulation shall report to the joint committee on children, families and persons with disabilities
236 and the joint committee on consumer protection and professional licensure on the operational
237 status of the wheelchair alternate arbitration mechanism, including, but not limited to, data

97 “IMPORTANT: IF THIS WHEELCHAIR IS DEFECTIVE WITHIN THE PERIOD OF
98 YOUR WARRANTY, [INSERT WARRANTY PERIOD, NOT LESS THAN 2 YEARS FROM
99 THE DATE OF FIRST DELIVERY], YOU MAY BE ENTITLED UNDER STATE LAW TO
100 REPLACEMENT OF THE WHEELCHAIR OR A REFUND OF ITS PURCHASE PRICE. TO
101 BE ENTITLED TO A REFUND OR REPLACEMENT, YOU MUST FIRST NOTIFY THE
102 MANUFACTURER, THE WHEELCHAIR LESSOR OR THE WHEELCHAIR DEALER OF
103 THE NON-CONFORMITY AND GIVE THE MANUFACTURER OR AUTHORIZED
104 WHEELCHAIR DEALER AN OPPORTUNITY TO REPAIR THE WHEELCHAIR IN
105 ACCORDANCE WITH SECTION 107 OF CHAPTER 93 OF THE MASSACHUSETTS
106 GENERAL LAWS.
107 IF THIS WHEELCHAIR IS DEFECTIVE WITHIN THE PERIOD OF YOUR
108 WARRANTY, THE MANUFACTURER OR AUTHORIZED WHEELCHAIR DEALER
109 MUST PERFORM A REMOTE ASSESSMENT OF THE WHEELCHAIR NOT MORE THAN
110 3 BUSINESS DAYS FOLLOWING NOTICE AND, IF NECESSARY, PERFORM AN IN-
111 PERSON ASSESSMENT NOT MORE THAN 4 BUSINESS DAYS FOLLOWING THE
112 REMOTE ASSESSMENT.
113 IF NECESSARY, THE MANUFACTURER OR AUTHORIZED WHEELCHAIR
114 DEALER SHALL PROVIDE A TEMPORARY LOANER WHEELCHAIR FOR THE
115 DURATION OF REPAIRS PROVIDED FOR UNDER THE WARRANTY AS SOON AS
116 POSSIBLE, BUT NOT MORE THAN 4 BUSINESS DAYS FOLLOWING NOTICE FOR
117 STANDARD WHEELCHAIRS AND 8 BUSINESS DAYS FOLLOWING NOTICE FOR
118 CUSTOMIZED, ADAPTED OR MODIFIED WHEELCHAIRS.”.
6 of 15

119 (3) If the manufacturer, lessor or wheelchair dealer fail to provide the statement of
120 warranty as required pursuant to this subsection, the manufacturer shall be in violation of this
121 subsection and the minimum express warranty period shall be extended to 3 years.
122 (c)(1) If a new wheelchair is defective and the consumer reports such nonconformity to
123 the manufacturer, a wheelchair lessor or a wheelchair dealer and such consumer makes the
124 wheelchair available for repair prior to the expiration of the applicable warranty period from the
125 date of first delivery, the nonconformity shall be repaired at no charge to the consumer. It shall
126 be presumed that the consumer has made the wheelchair available to the manufacturer or
127 authorized wheelchair dealer for repair if such consumer allows the manufacturer or dealer to
128 take it from the consumer’s home or other location where the user customarily uses the
129 wheelchair.
130 (2) If a wheelchair covered by a manufacturer’s warranty has a nonconformity to which
131 the warranty is applicable and is made available by the consumer to the manufacturer or
132 authorized wheelchair dealer for the repair of the nonconformity, the manufacturer shall:
133 (i) perform, or coordinate with an authorized wheelchair dealer to perform, a remote
134 assessment of the original wheelchair not more than 3 business days following notice from the
135 consumer and, if it is determined that a remote assessment is not sufficient to diagnose the
136 nonconformity, an in-person assessment not more than 4 business days following the remote
137 assessment; provided, however, that if a consumer cancels the initial remote assessment and the
138 manufacturer or authorized wheelchair dealer makes reasonable efforts to reschedule the
139 assessment as soon as feasible, the manufacturer or authorized wheelchair dealer shall not be in
140 violation of this clause; provided, however, that the manufacturer or authorized dealer shall
7 of 15

141 provide the consumer with an estimated timeframe for assessment and, following assessment, an
142 estimated timeframe for any repairs;
143 (ii) provide, or coordinate with an authorized wheelchair dealer to provide, for the
144 duration of the repair period, directly and at no cost to the consumer, as selected by the consumer
145 and as soon as reasonably possible: (A) a temporary loaner wheelchair not more than 4 business
146 days following notice from the consumer if the original wheelchair is a standard wheelchair and
147 not more than 8 business days following notice by the consumer if the original wheelchair has
148 been customized, adapted or modified to the extent that a standard wheelchair is not a suitable
149 temporary loaner wheelchair; or (B) reimbursement for the cost incurred by the consumer for
150 renting a wheelchair while the original wheelchair is assessed and repaired; and
151 (iii) cover all of the consumer’s collateral costs.
152 (3) If, after a reasonable attempt to repair, the nonconformity is not repaired, the
153 manufacturer shall:
154 (i) at the direction of a consumer other than one who leases a wheelchair: (A) accept
155 return of the original wheelchair, issue a replacement wheelchair and refund any collateral costs;
156 or (B) accept return of the wheelchair and refund to the consumer and to any holder of a
157 perfected security interest, as their interest may appear, the full purchase price and any finance
158 charge amount paid by the consumer at the point of sale and any collateral costs, less a
159 reasonable allowance for use; provided, however, that a reasonable allowance for use shall not
160 exceed the amount obtained by multiplying the full purchase price of the wheelchair by a
161 fraction, the denominator of which shall be 1,825 and the numerator of which shall be the
8 of 15

162 number of days that the wheelchair was in the consumer's possession before the consumer first
163 reported the nonconformity to the wheelchair dealer; or
164 (ii) at the direction of a consumer who leases a wheelchair, accept return of the original
165 wheelchair, refund to the wheelchair lessor and to any holder of a perfected security interest, as
166 their interest may appear, the current value of the written lease and refund to the consumer the
167 amount such consumer paid under the written lease and any collateral costs, less a reasonable
168 allowance for use; provided, however, that a reasonable allowance for use shall not exceed the
169 amount obtained by multiplying the total amount for which the written lease obligates the
170 consumer by a fraction, the denominator of which shall be 1,825, or the number of days of the
171 lease, whichever number is greater, and the numerator of which shall be half of the number of
172 days that the consumer possessed the wheelchair before first reporting the nonconformity to the
173 manufacturer, wheelchair lessor or wheelchair dealer; and provided further, that
174 the current value of the written lease shall be the total amount for which that lease
175 obligates the consumer during the period of the lease remaining after its early termination, plus
176 the wheelchair dealer's early termination costs and the value of the original wheelchair at the
177 lease expiration date if the lease sets forth that value, less the wheelchair lessor's early
178 termination savings.
179 To receive a replacement wheelchair or a refund due under paragraph (3) of this
180 subsection, a consumer described thereunder shall offer to transfer possession of the wheelchair
181 having the nonconformity to its manufacturer. Not later than 30 days after such offer, the
182 manufacturer shall provide the consumer with the replacement wheelchair or refund. When the
183 manufacturer provides the replacement wheelchair or refund, the consumer shall make the
9 of 15

184 wheelchair having the nonconformity available for return to the manufacturer, along with any
185 endorsements necessary to transfer legal possession to the manufacturer.
186 (4)(i) To receive a refund due under clause (i) of paragraph (3) of subsection (C), a
187 consumer described thereunder shall offer to return the original wheelchair to its manufacturer.
188 Not later than 30 days after such offer, the manufacturer shall provide the refund to the
189 consumer. When the manufacturer provides the refund, the consumer shall make the original
190 wheelchair available for return to the manufacturer.
191 (ii) To receive a refund due under paragraph (3) of subsection (C), a wheelchair lessor
192 shall offer to transfer possession of the original wheelchair to its manufacturer. No later than 30
193 days after such offer, the manufacturer shall provide the refund to the wheelchair lessor. When
194 the manufacturer provides the refund, the wheelchair lessor shall provide to the manufacturer any
195 endorsements necessary to transfer legal possession to the manufacturer.
196 A lease against a consumer shall not be enforced after such consumer exercises rights
197 pursuant to clause (ii) of paragraph (3).
198 A wheelchair returned by a consumer or wheelchair lessor in the commonwealth, or by a
199 consumer or wheelchair lessor in another state under a similar law of that state, shall not be
200 resold or leased in the commonwealth unless the reasons for such return have been fully
201 disclosed to a prospective buyer or lessee.
202 (5) Manufacturers shall fill all repair and replacement orders for wheelchairs under
203 warranty pursuant to this section from their own inventory or have a written subcontract for the
204 purchase of items necessary to fill repair and replacement orders; provided, however, that the
205 subcontract shall be in writing and contain, at a minimum: (i) names, addresses, phone numbers
10 of 15

212 not limited to: (i) the date a repair was requested; (ii) the type of repair requested; (iii) the date
213 the repair attempt began; (iv) the length of the repair attempt; (v) collateral costs covered; (vi)
214 the results of the repair attempt; and (vii) the total number of repair attempts made.
215 (d) Each consumer shall have the option of submitting any dispute arising under this
216 section, upon the payment of a prescribed filing fee, to an alternate arbitration mechanism
217 established pursuant to regulations promulgated under this section by the undersecretary of
218 consumer affairs and business regulation. Upon application of the consumer and payment of the
219 appropriate filing fee by the consumer, a manufacturer shall submit to alternative arbitration. The
220 alternate arbitration shall be conducted by a professional arbitrator or arbitration firm appointed
221 by and pursuant to the regulations promulgated by the office of consumer affairs and business
222 regulation pursuant to this section. The alternate arbitration mechanism shall ensure the personal
223 objectivity of its arbitrators and the right of each party to present its case, be in attendance during

227 pursuant to said chapter 93A. Nothing contained in this section shall limit any rights or remedies
11 of 15

228 available to a consumer under any other law. Any waiver by a consumer of rights under this
