Conway, for legislation to prohibit state funds to be allocated to any agency, school, university,
etc. that does research on animals. State Administration and Regulatory Oversight.

In the One Hundred and Ninety-Fourth General Court
(2025-2026)
_______________
An Act providing that no state funds will be allocated to any agency, school, university, etc. that
does research on animals.
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives in General Court assembled, and by the authority
of the same, as follows:
1 All animals feel pain and stress. It is inhumane for humans to deliberately inflict this on
2 them. Any animals that are currently being used for research purposes will have to be rehomed
3 either by adoption or sanctuaries that can care for them. They will not be euthanized. If homes
4 can not be found for them, they will be cared for by the institutions that have them until their
5 natural death (no research on them). The state may use the canceled funds to provide for their
6 care. They will be allowed adequate space and freedom and if they are social animals they will
7 be given the opportunity for social contact with their own kind. Rats and mice are not exempt.
8 Birds, reptiles and amphibians are also included.
