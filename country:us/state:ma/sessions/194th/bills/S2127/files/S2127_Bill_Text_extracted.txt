of the same, as follows:
1 SECTION 1. Chapter 7C of the Massachusetts General Laws, as appearing in the 2020
2 Official Edition 2 is hereby amended by adding the following section: -
3 Section 73. (a) For the purposes of this section, the following terms shall have the
4 following meanings unless the context clearly requires otherwise:
5 "Awarding authority" (i) a state agency for a contract for a public works project as
6 defined in Section 44A of chapter 149 of the Massachusetts General laws; (ii) Institutions of
7 higher education; (iii) Natural resource agencies, including the department of conservation and

12 precast, and concrete masonry units; (ii) Reinforcing steel products, specifically rebar and post
1 of 7
13 tensioning tendons; (iii) Structural steel products, specifically hot rolled sections, hollow
14 sections, plate, and metal deck; and (iv) Engineered wood products including mass timber

17 and structural sawn lumber.
18 “Cradle-to-gate”, activities associated with a product or building’s life cycle from the
19 extraction stage through production stage, and covering modules A1 through A3 in accordance
20 with ISO Standards 14025 and 21930.
21 “Cradle-to-grave”, activities associated with a product or building’s life cycle from the
22 extraction stage through disposal stage, and covering modules A1 through C4 in accordance with
23 ISO Standards 14025 and 21930.
24 "Construction contractor", the business entity, a general contractor or joint venture
25 contractor, holding the prime contract with the governmental entity to construct the eligible
26 project.
27 "Department", the division of capital asset management and maintenance.

51 "Responsible bidder”, the eligible product supplier, the subcontractor that manufactures
52 or provides for installation, or both, of the eligible product.
3 of 7
53 “Whole Building Life Cycle Assessment”, a cradle-to-gate whole building life cycle
54 assessment performed in accordance with ISO 14040 and ISO 14044, excluding operating
55 energy, that can be compared to a reference baseline building. The reference building shall be of
56 the same size, geographic location, and thermal performance as the proposed building, and shall
57 be functionally equivalent per ASTM E2921-22.
58 SECTION 2. On or before the date one year following enactment, the department shall
59 promulgate rules that will result in embodied carbon reductions of at least 30% in eligible
60 projects. The rules must establish that an awarding authority shall include in a specification for
61 bids for an eligible project that the responsible bidder will comply with one of the following
62 embodied carbon reduction compliance pathways to achieve the reduction in embodied carbon
63 emissions:
64 (a) Performance pathway: comparative whole building life cycle assessment at
65 design:
66 (i). projects shall conduct a cradle-to-grave whole building life cycle assessment
67 performed in accordance with ISO 14040 and ISO 14044, excluding operating energy, and
68 demonstrating a minimum 30 percent reduction in global warming potential (GWP) as compared
69 to a reference baseline building from the LCA commons and/or database established in
70 SECTION (3). The reference baseline building shall be of the same size, geographic location,
71 and thermal performance as the proposed building, and shall be functionally equivalent per
72 ASTM E2921-22. The products and product quantities in the proposed building and the reference
73 building are permitted to vary;
4 of 7
74 (ii). software used to conduct the whole building life cycle assessment, including
75 reference baseline building, shall have a data set compliant with ISO-14044, and ISO 21930 and
76 the software shall conform to ISO 21931. The software tools and datasets shall be the same for
77 evaluation of both the baseline building and the proposed building;
78 (b) Re-use pathway: building re-use wherein at least 45% of the existing structure is
79 maintained.
80 (i). An alteration or addition to an existing building shall maintain at a minimum 45
81 percent combined of the existing building’s primary structural elements (foundations; columns,
82 beams, walls, and floors; and lateral elements) and existing building enclosure (roof framing,
83 wall framing and exterior finishes). Window assemblies, insulation, portions of buildings
84 deemed structurally unsound or hazardous, and hazardous materials that are remediated as part of
85 the project shall not be included in the calculation;
86 (c) Prescriptive pathway: Comparison of Type III Environmental Product Declarations at
87 procurement. Each product that is permanently installed and listed as a covered product shall
88 have a Type III environmental product declaration (EPD). Eligible projects shall demonstrate
89 that the project’s embodied carbon, averaged across 90 percent of covered products, is lower
90 than industry average by 30%. To achieve this reduction, eligible projects must use project-
91 specific material quantities and environmental product declarations to demonstrate that the
92 products specified in contract documents have a lower global warming potential than the
93 industry average as defined by the United States environmental protection agency by 30%,
94 industry-wide environmental product declarations applicable to the product, or as established by
95 an appropriate state agency.
5 of 7
96 (d) Verification of compliance with a pathway will be confirmed with the department and
97 awarding authority through the following methods:
98 (i) For the performance pathway, a summary of the GWP analysis produced by the
99 software and signed by the design professional of record shall be provided in the construction
100 documents as documentation of compliance;
101 (ii) For the building reuse pathway, documentation shall be provided in the construction
102 documents and signed by the design professional of record to demonstrate compliance;
103 (iii) For the prescriptive pathway, calculations to demonstrate compliance, Type III EPDs
104 for products required to comply if included in the project, and signature of the design
105 professional of record shall be provided on the construction documents. Updated EPDs for
106 products used in construction shall be provided to the owner at the close of construction and to
107 the department or awarding authority upon request. The department may require inspection
108 during and at completion of construction to demonstrate substantial conformance. Inspection
109 shall be performed by the design professional of record or third party acceptable to the enforcing
110 agency.
111 (e) Data collected through any of the three compliance pathways described under
112 subsections (a-c) of this section must be consistently transferred by the department or awarding
113 authority to the federal LCA Commons and/or database established by the department in Section
114 3. The project details will be anonymized, except for each eligible project’s global warming
115 potential.
116 (f) The Department will conduct biennial reviews, starting 2 years after the rules
117 promulgated pursuant to Section 2 are finalized, to determine further reduction goals over time,
6 of 7
118 consistent with the intent of achieving net zero emissions by 2050, and will accordingly establish
119 by rules increased embodied carbon emission reduction targets across all three pathways. In
120 these reviews, the department may also consider adding additional compliance pathways.
121 SECTION 3. On or before the date one year following enactment, the department shall
122 establish a database of representative Whole Building Life Cycle Assessments and/or elect to
123 rely on the federally managed LCA Commons, reflecting an appropriate range of size, function,
124 location, and occupancy conditions. This database and/or the LCA Commons, will be used to
125 identify baseline buildings to evaluate improvements on global warming potential for covered
126 projects.
