An Act providing for the creation of a Massachusetts COVID-19 Memorial.
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives in General Court assembled, and by the authority
of the same, as follows:
1 SECTION 1. The Massachusetts General Laws are hereby amended by inserting the
2 following new chapter:
3 PURPOSE:
4 The COVID-19 Pandemic, which began in the year 2020, and may well continue deep
5 into future years, and possibly further, has already taken a toll that is massive, tragic, and
6 devastating to the lives of tens of thousands, of Massachusetts residents; disrupted, and damaged
7 the lives of the people of Massachusetts, their families, schools and other educational
8 institutions, workplaces, friends; businesses, the economy, other institutions of society, and
9 more. These losses, as they mount, are also accompanied by the damage to the health, perhaps
1 of 3

10 for life, of many thousands of other individuals. The losses, as of the original writing of these
11 words, are already at the level previously encountered, only in previous military conflicts; and
12 these losses are likely to continue to mount, far beyond those levels.
13 Public Monuments, serve many purposes, including to honor significant persons, and to
14 remember important losses; thereby providing specific respect, and some important roles in
15 public education.
16 Therefore, this legislation, establishes a Purpose for developing a Massachusetts COVID-
17 19 Memorial.
18 SECTION 2. To establish this Memorial, this enabling legislation, authorizes the creation
19 of a Massachusetts COVID-19 Memorial Commission, to honor those who have died from the
20 virus, been injured, and/or harmed by it, and to encourage thoughtful reflection on the
21 circumstances of the Pandemic, in Massachusetts.
22 This Commission, shall have nineteen (19) members, appointed by the Governor of
23 Massachusetts, and other specified officials: One (1) designee of the Governor; One (1) designee
24 of the President of the Senate; One (1) designee of the Speaker of the House; Five (5) Chief
25 Executive Officers, or their designees, from accredited hospitals, whose primary offices, are in
26 the Commonwealth; One (1) representative of Massachusetts Nurses; One (1) representative of
27 Massachusetts Doctors; One (1) representative of Massachusetts Educators; One (1)
28 representative of EMTs; One (1) representative of Firefighters; One (1) representative of Police
29 Officers; One (1) representative of Homemakers; One (1) representative of Food Service
30 Workers; Three (3) Citizens At Large
2 of 3

31 SECTION 3. The life of this Commission, shall be up to three (3) years, from its
32 appointment; and it shall select a Chairperson, from among its membership.
33 This Commission, shall publicize its Mission of Memorial, and welcome any, and all,
34 appropriate ideas for a fixed Memorial, a location for such Memorial, in a statue type display,
35 and possibly including a public health educational outreach program, on viruses, vaccines, and
36 other similar effective disease controlling, and defeating; scientific, and public engaging
37 activities.
38 A Report shall be produced, with analysis, recommendations, and suggestions for such a
