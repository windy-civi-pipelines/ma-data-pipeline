230 report before a report is released. The process shall include notice and an opportunity for a
231 hearing.
232 (d) The general counsel shall submit a copy of the investigative report to all interested
233 parties including, but not limited to: (i) the complainant; (ii) the respondent; (iii) each member of

237 or the district attorney for the district in which the incident occurred with the complainant’s

256 client or other person for providing information to the commission, the general counsel or
257 commission staff, including filing a report or complaint with the commission or testifying in a
