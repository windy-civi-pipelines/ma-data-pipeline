1 of 3
10 objectives for each agency or department for a period not to exceed four years. Said budget shall

12 adjusted or otherwise. Said zero-based budget shall be referred by the Senate and House of
13 Representatives to the committees of subject matter jurisdiction relevant to each component of
14 said budget. Such committees shall evaluate each such component, taking into account all
15 available information, including that provided by public testimony in oral and written form. The
16 evaluations of the committee shall then be reported to the Senate and House Committees on
17 Ways and Means.
18 The Ways and Means Committees of the Senate and House of Representatives shall,

25 of the General Court for their consideration. Such joint resolution, if adopted, shall be employed
26 in evaluating each annual budget considered by the General Court for the four years following its
27 adoption.
28 Zero-based budgeting shall mean, for the purposes of this section, a means of developing
29 appropriations based on the cost-effective achievement of the tasks and goals of a particular
30 agency or department without regard to prior appropriations, adjusted for inflation or otherwise.
31 Any appropriation so developed shall to the extent possible, be accompanied by a brief
2 of 3
32 description of said tasks and goals together with the performance measure of the achievement of
