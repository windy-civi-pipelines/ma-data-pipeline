47 Section 43. (a) If a municipality that votes to establish a municipal lighting plant fails,
48 within 150 days from the passage of the final vote required by section 35 or 36, to agree with a
49 distribution company currently serving such municipality as to price or as to the property to be
50 included in the purchase, the municipality may apply to the department within 180 days after the
3 of 9

51 expiration of the 150 days for review of the feasibility of the municipality’s acquisition of the
52 property. The municipality’s filing shall include:
53 (1) an outline of the property the municipality wishes to acquire;
54 (2) a projection of purchase price of the property;
55 (3) a projection of total costs of establishing the municipal lighting plant;
56 (4) a financing plan to cover the purchase price, including a description of municipality’s
57 bonding ability;

62 (b) The department may investigate the feasibility of the municipality’s proposed
63 acquisition, and shall, within 180 days of the filing and after notice and a public hearing, issue a
64 report regarding the feasibility of the municipality’s filing; provided, however, that the
65 department shall not be required to issue more than 3 such reports in any contiguous 12-month
66 period. Any reports that are not issued within 180 days of the filing shall be issued in the order of
67 the filings. If multiple municipalities file with the stated intent of establishing a joint or
68 cooperative system of municipal lighting plants, the department shall process such filings
69 simultaneously, to the extent possible. The department shall transmit its report to the distribution
70 company, the clerk of each municipality and the department of energy resources. The department
71 shall report to the general court the results of its findings and file such reports with the clerks of
4 of 9

72 the house of representatives and the senate, who shall forward the same to the joint committee on
73 telecommunications, utilities and energy. The department may assess reasonable fees to fund its
74 responsibilities under this subsection from each municipality submitting a filing for a proposed
75 acquisition.
76 (c) Upon the issuance of the department’s report, the municipality may seek
77 determination as to what property ought in the public interest to be included in the purchase and
78 what price should be paid, which shall be based on the standard formula developed by the
79 department in subsection (d). The value shall be estimated without enhancement on account of
80 future earning capacity or good will or of exclusive privileges derived from rights in the public
81 ways. The price shall include damages, if any, which the department finds would be caused by

85 reconfiguration and the sale. The property shall include the portion of the property within the
86 limits of the municipality as is suitable for, and shall be used in connection with, the distribution
87 of electricity within such limits. If any such property is subject to any mortgages, liens or other
88 encumbrances, the department in making its determination shall provide for the deduction or
89 withholding from the purchase price, pending discharge, of such sum or sums as it deems proper.
90 The department may assess reasonable fees to fund its responsibilities under this subsection from
91 each municipality seeking such determination for a proposed acquisition.
92 (d) No later than December 31, 2022 the department shall develop a standard formula
93 used to determine the value of property, including any jointly-owned poles or other facilities
94 shared with other public utilities, to be purchased by any municipality seeking to establish a
5 of 9

95 municipal lighting plant under this section. The formula shall be used by the department in all
96 determinations of property value performed under subsections (c) and (g); provided, however,
97 that the department may make reasonable exceptions to the formula in specific transactions.
98 (e) The department, after notice to the parties to the proposed acquisition, shall give a
99 hearing on the proposed acquisition and make the determination described in subsection (c) not
100 more than 180 days after the date of the municipality’s application.
101 (f) Not more than 60 days after the department makes the determination described in
102 subsection (c), the distribution company shall tender to the municipality’s clerk a copy of a good
103 and sufficient deed of conveyance for the property to be purchased and place the deed in escrow.
104 The municipality shall have not more than 300 days after the date of tender in which to accept or
105 reject the tender and, if accepting, to pay to the distribution company the price determined by the
106 department. In the case of a city, the city council shall vote to accept or reject the tender and a
107 majority of the voters at an annual or special city election shall ratify the city council vote. In
108 case of a town, a town meeting or a town officer or body to which the town meeting delegates
109 authority shall vote to accept or reject the tender and a majority of voters at an annual or special
110 town election shall ratify the vote.
111 (g) In connection with the exercise by a municipality of the option to purchase a utility
112 plant pursuant to this section, the municipality may elect to assume responsibilities for
113 maintenance, placement and removal of jointly-owned poles or other facilities shared with other
114 public utilities or to purchase such facilities at a price set by the department based on the
115 standard formula established in subsection (d). Except where the municipality makes such
116 election, the municipality shall assume the rights and obligations of the previous owner with
6 of 9

117 respect to any person other than the distribution company controlling or using the poles, conduits
118 or other jointly-owned or joint-use facilities, property and rights; provided, that in the
119 assumption of the rights and obligations of the previous owner by a municipality, the
120 municipality shall in no way or form restrict, impede or prohibit access that other parties would
121 enjoy under the previous ownership.
122 (h) A municipal lighting plant established pursuant to this section shall file with the
123 department a plan for supporting development of renewable and alternative energy production
124 comparable to the magnitude of such support achieved under: (1) sections 138 to 143, inclusive,
125 (2) sections 11F and 11F½ of chapter 25A and (3) section 83 of chapter 169 of the acts of 2008.
126 Following department approval of such plan, the municipal lighting plant shall implement the
127 plan and report annually to the department regarding implementation.
128 (i) The department shall not allow any costs of the incumbent distribution company in
129 connection with the proceedings described in this section as a cost of service in excess of the
130 costs reasonably necessary to provide information, negotiate necessary contractual arrangements
131 and represent the interests of the remaining ratepayers in designing any severance plan required.
132 (j) If, at the time of purchase of the distribution equipment by a municipality, the
133 distribution company has unfunded liabilities for pensions and other post-retirement benefits that
134 would be recovered through distribution rates, the department shall determine the fair share of
135 such liabilities attributable to the distribution system to be acquired by the municipality and the
136 method by which the municipal lighting plant shall compensate the distribution company for that
137 fair share.
7 of 9

138 (k) To the extent that the distribution company has entered into any long term contracts
139 for renewable energy pursuant to section 83 of chapter 169 of the acts of 2008 prior to the date of
140 the acquisition, the municipality acquiring any electric distribution facilities pursuant to this
141 section shall be required to assess its distribution customers an equivalent charge in distribution
142 rates to cover its proportionate share of the monthly costs of such contracts, as would have been
143 charged to the electric distribution customers in such municipality had the acquisition not
144 occurred. Such amounts collected shall then be remitted to the electric distribution company
145 within 30 days of being invoiced by the electric distribution company.
146 (l) The department shall report to the joint committee on telecommunications, utilities
