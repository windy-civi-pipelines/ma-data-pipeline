118 report may include general maintenance, reading and adjustment of ventilation rates, filter
119 replacement to meet a Minimum Efficiency Reporting Value (MERV) of at least 13 if equipment
120 allows, while assuring the pressure drop is less than the fan’s capability, direct outside airflow
121 intake measurement, or whole system installation or replacement. Portable filtration and air
122 cleaners shall be used only if the existing heating, ventilation and air conditioning infrastructure
123 cannot meet minimum filtration and ventilation requirements or, as recommended by a
124 mechanical engineer, as a supplemental enhancement to the permanent heating, ventilation, and
125 air conditioning system or there are concerns with outdoor air contaminants such as those created
126 by wildfires and pollution. All HVAC repairs, upgrades, or replacements shall be performed by a
127 skilled and trained workforce. All HVAC adjustments shall be performed by qualified adjusting
128 personnel.
129 School districts shall ensure that all work required by the ventilation assessment is
130 performed using a skilled and trained construction workforce and rules promulgated in
