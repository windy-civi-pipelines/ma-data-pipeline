of the same, as follows:
1 Section 1E of Chapter 164 of the General Laws as appearing in the 2022 Official Edition
2 shall hereby be amended by striking out said section and replacing it with the following section:-
3 Section 1E
4 (a) The department is hereby authorized to promulgate rules and regulations to establish
5 and require performance-based rates for each distribution, transmission, and gas company
6 organized and doing business in the commonwealth pursuant to the provisions of this chapter. In
7 promulgating such performance-based rate schemes, the department shall establish service
8 quality standards for each distribution, transmission, and gas company, including, but not limited
9 to, standards for customer satisfaction service outages, distribution facility upgrades, repairs and
10 maintenance, telephone service, billing service, public safety, occupational safety, training and
1 of 15
11 certifications for both in-house and contractor employees, map and record accuracy, and in-
12 house staffing benchmarks sufficient to ensure pipeline safety through the period of transition to
13 net zero emissions. provided, however, that such service quality standards shall include
14 benchmarks for employee staff levels and employee training programs for each such distribution,
15 transmission, and gas company.
16 In addition, the department shall require each gas company, as part of performance-based
17 rate making, require each gas company to submit a just transition plan, which must be approved
18 by the department, to address workforce development, maintenance and attrition over the course
19 of the transition to net zero emissions generally, and the PBR period specifically, and provide for
20 the following:
21 (1). A detailed proposed chronology for transition to net zero emissions energy supply
22 and distribution to be set through performance-based rate making;
23 (2). Sufficient in-house staffing levels, in each relevant classification, to ensure the safety
24 and reliability of the gas company’s pipeline through the projected transition period;
25 (3). Training and workforce development plans providing for gas company workforce
26 needs on residual natural gas and electric as well as alternative energy sources, generation and
27 distribution infrastructure utilized by the gas company to replace and/or complement natural gas;
28 (4). Any and all mitigation measures to address the impacts of transition—e.g., attrition,
29 retrenchment—on the gas company’s workforce over the course of the PBR—including, but not
30 limited to—cross-training and hiring preferences at dual-fuel companies and joint ventures with
31 renewable energy generators/distributors, early retirement incentives;
2 of 15
32 (5). In the event of the gas company’s anticipated substantial partial or complete
33 cessation of gas operations in Massachusetts during the period in which PBR is effective:
34 (i) Means by which the gas company, and/or its parent corporation intends to avoid
35 burdening the Commonwealth, its ratepayers, and taxpayers with the social welfare costs
36 resulting from such cessation;
37 (ii) Measures to ensure the solvency of the LDC pension system during and after
38 transition;
39 (iii) Measures to stem the displacement of LDC employees attrited as a result of the
40 transition from the Massachusetts energy sector.
41 Nothing in this section shall prohibit or supplant the LDC’s collective bargaining
42 obligations relative to the National Labor Relations Act.
43 (b) In complying with the service quality standards and employee benchmarks
44 established pursuant to this section, a distribution, transmission, or gas company that makes a
45 performance based rating filing after the effective date of this act shall not be allowed to engage
46 in labor displacement or reductions below staffing levels in existence on January 1, 2022, unless
47 such are fully compliant with any law supporting a just transition to net zero emissions and part
48 of a collective bargaining agreement or agreements between such company and the applicable
49 organization or organizations representing such workers, or with the approval of the department
50 following an evidentiary hearing at which the burden shall be upon the company to demonstrate
51 that such staffing reductions shall not adversely disrupt service quality standards or public safety
52 and shall maintain reliable service through the transition to net zero emissions as established by
53 the department herein. Nothing in this paragraph shall prevent the reduction of forces below the
3 of 15
54 January 1, 2022 level through early retirement and severances negotiated with labor
55 organizations before said date.
56 (c) The department shall promulgate regulations relative to an alternative dispute
57 resolution process for the handling of damage claims by customers in an amount under $100.
58 The department shall establish a 60-day timeline for the resolution of all mediation claims. The
59 department shall issue a biannual report to the joint committee on telecommunications, utilities,
60 and energy which shall include, but not be limited to, the following information: the nature of
61 consumer claims, the number of consumer claims and the resolutions of consumer claims
62 reviewed by the department during the previous 6 months. Said report shall be available for

80 infrastructure.
81 “Plan”, a targeted infrastructure replacement program construction plan that a gas
82 company files pursuant to subsection (b).
83 “Project”, an eligible infrastructure replacement project proposed by a gas company in a
84 plan filed under this section.
85 (b) A gas company shall file with the department a plan to address aging or leaking
86 natural gas infrastructure within the commonwealth and the leak rate on the gas company’s
87 natural gas infrastructure in the interest of public safety and reducing lost and unaccounted for
88 natural gas through a reduction in natural gas system leaks. This plan shall include, but not be
89 limited to, provisions to ensure the gas company trains a sufficient, highly skilled, stable
90 workforce to repair and maintain the safety and reliability of its pipeline for the duration of its
91 useful life, until and including its retirement or re-purposing for alternative use. Each
92 company’s gas infrastructure plan shall include interim targets for the department’s review. The
93 department shall review these interim targets to ensure each gas company is meeting the

111 outside contractor crews, respectively, to perform construction; (viii) all oversight and quality
112 assurance measures implemented by the gas company on construction during the course of the
113 plan; (ix) all funds to be expended on training for its in-house on the construction and
114 maintenance of its pipeline; (x) any plans for the utilization of pipeline to satisfy the
115 Commonwealth’s net zero emissions goals and aggregated data reflecting the projected impact of
116 the plans on the Commonwealth’s net zero emissions goals; and (xi) any other information the
117 department considers necessary to evaluate the plan.
118 As part of each plan filed under this section, a gas company shall include a timeline for

6 of 15
120 pace and program end date with a target end date of: (i) not more than 20 years from the filing of
121 a gas company’s initial plan; or (ii) a reasonable target end date considering the allowable
122 recovery cap established pursuant to subsection (f). The department shall not approve a timeline
123 as part of a plan unless the allowable recovery cap established pursuant to subsection (f) provides
124 the gas company with a reasonable opportunity to recover the costs associated with removing all
125 leak-prone infrastructure on the accelerated basis set forth under the timeline utilizing the cost
126 recovery mechanism established pursuant to this section. After filing the initial plan, a gas
127 company shall, at 5-year intervals, provide the department with a summary of its replacement
128 progress to date, a summary of work to be completed during the next 5 years and any similar
129 information the department may require. The department may require a gas company to file an
130 updated long-term timeline as part of a plan if it alters the cap established pursuant to subsection
131 (f).
132 Section 3. Chapter 164 of the General Laws shall hereby be amended by inserting at the
133 end thereof the following new sections:
134 Section 149. In this chapter, unless the context otherwise requires, the following words
135 shall have the following meanings:

150 Section 150: Every Company shall develop, and periodically amend a comprehensive
151 plan, as set forth in Section 149 to be filed with the Department of Public Utilities, for the hire,
152 retention, and training of a sufficient operations and maintenance workforce through 2050
153 addressing its plans to meet the Commonwealth’s net zero emissions goals and its plans to fulfill
