_______________
An Act establishing a resilient electric vehicle charging system pilot program and river
restoration fund and veterans and emergency responders’ fund.
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives in General Court assembled, and by the authority
of the same, as follows:
1 SECTION 1. Definitions
2 For the purposes of this Act, the following terms shall have the meanings ascribed to
3 them:
4 1. "Resilient Hydroelectric Power Generation" means generating stations that:
5 a. Are manufactured, installed, and operated in accordance with applicable government
6 and industry standards;
7 b. Are connected to the electric grid and operated in conjunction with an electric
8 company's transmission and distribution system during normal operation of the electrical grid;
9 c. Operate in compliance with standards and requirements established under this Act;
1 of 8

10 d. Utilize a synchronous generator with black start capability, frequency control, and
11 disconnect capability;
12 e. Do not include the active use of fossil fuels;
13 f. Have a nameplate capacity of 2.0 megawatts or less;
14 g. Do not involve any dam or water diversion structure constructed after December 31,
15 1997; and
16 h. Must demonstrate compliance with meeting appropriate and site-specific standards that
17 address adequate and healthy river flows, water quality standards, fish passage, and protection
18 measures, mitigation, and enhancement opportunities in the impacted watershed by obtaining
19 and maintaining a current Low Impact Hydropower Institute (LIHI) certification, provided that:
20 i. If the generating station is not LIHI certified prior to its participation in the Resilient
21 Electric Vehicle Charging System Pilot Program (the Program), it will submit an application for
22 certification within 3 years from the date of being enrolled in the Program and its ongoing
23 participation in the Program will be contingent on successfully obtaining and maintaining a LIHI
24 certification, including completing any certification conditions in the time prescribed.
25 2. "Resilient Electric Vehicle Charging System" means an electric vehicle (EV)
26 microgrid designed to provide uninterrupted electric service for EV charging throughout an
27 extended outage.
28 3. "Extended Outage" means an outage of the electric distribution system that
29 continues for a period of 24 hours or longer.
2 of 8

30 4. "Uninterrupted" means that the Resilient Electric Vehicle Charging System
31 generates electricity throughout an extended outage, except for momentary interruptions
32 associated with transitions to and from grid-parallel and grid-islanded operations.
33 5. "EV Microgrid" is a group of energy-generating resources with at least one source
34 of Resilient Hydroelectric Power Generation and energy storage within clearly defined electrical
35 boundaries that acts as a single controllable entity with respect to the grid for the purpose of EV
36 charging and supporting emergency response needs during an extended outage. An EV microgrid
37 can connect and disconnect from the grid to operate in both grid-connected or island-mode.
38 6. “Charging Revenue” shall constitute all onsite energy sales from EV charging
39 from a Resilient Electric Vehicle Charging System.
40 7. “Low Impact Hydropower Institute (LIHI)” is a non-profit 501(c)(3) organization
41 whose stated purpose is to reduce the impacts of hydropower generation through the certification
42 of hydropower projects that have avoided or reduced their environmental impacts pursuant to the
43 Low Impact Hydropower Institute's criteria.
44 SECTION 2. Establishment of the Resilient Electric Vehicle Charging System Pilot
45 Program
46 1. Program Creation: The Department of Public Utilities (DPU) shall, within 180
47 days of the enactment of this Act, promulgate rules and regulations to establish the Resilient
48 Electric Vehicle Charging System Pilot Program ("the Program").
49 2. Program Components:
3 of 8

50 a. Resilience Adder: Establish a net metering adder for the valuation of uninterrupted
51 Resilient Hydroelectric Power Generation generated within an EV microgrid that participates in
52 the Program.
53 b. Timely Utility Interconnection Process: Create an expedited interconnection process
54 for Resilient Hydroelectric Power Generation comprising an EV microgrid.
55 c. Compliance and Operation Rules for Emergency Responders: Develop compliance
56 standards, routine testing requirements, and operational protocols to ensure that EV charging
57 stations are accessible and functional for emergency responders during extended outages.
58 Program compliance will be developed under Section 3 and 4 of these regulations.
59 d. Support for Resilient Communications: Require that EV microgrids incorporate
60 infrastructure to support resilient radio communications for emergency services during normal
61 operations and during extended outages. In addition, satellite or similar resilient WIFI service
62 shall be installed and provided for free public use during an extended outage as available after
63 emergency service providers.
64 SECTION 3. River Restoration Fund
65 1. Establishment: A River Restoration Fund ("the River Restoration Fund") is
66 hereby established to support environmental justice initiatives, river restoration projects, and
67 community education related to energy, the environment, and local industrial history.
68 2. Funding Mechanism: Participants in the Program shall allocate 5% of revenues
69 received from onsite EV fast charging to the River Restoration Fund.
70 3. Fund Governance and Oversight:
