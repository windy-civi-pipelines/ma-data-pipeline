An Act addressing challenges facing public libraries and digital resource collections.
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives in General Court assembled, and by the authority
of the same, as follows:
1 SECTION 1. The general court finds and declares that:
2 (i) libraries serve the public good, and all citizens of the commonwealth stand to gain
3 from the services rendered and the materials contained within library collections;
4 (ii) the general court has a historic responsibility in supporting public libraries and the
5 public’s access to free access to diverse resources to everyone, as it did in 1848 by establishing
6 the Boston public library as the first large free municipal library in the United States; and
7 (iii) the evolution of resource production and publishing and the advent of technology has
8 changed the way consumers and libraries source and use materials, and in order to serve the
9 public good, libraries increasingly use digital and electronic materials and technology.

10 SECTION 2. Chapter 78 of the General Laws is hereby amended by adding the following

15 libraries, the legislature, the attorney general, or the board of library commissioners; or
16 (ii) requires, coerces or enables the library to violate the confidentiality of a patron’s
17 library records, pursuant to section 7.
18 (b) A contract between a publisher and library to license electronic literary materials that
19 includes a provision that violates this section shall constitute an unfair and deceptive practice
20 under section 2 of chapter 93A. Any remedy provided pursuant to said chapter 93A shall be
21 available for the enforcement of this section.
22 SECTION 3. As used in sections 1 through 4, inclusive, the following words shall, unless

41 how patron privacy records and metadata are kept, used, accessed and sold as it relates to patrons
42 using and accessing digital and electronic resources through a public library, make
43 recommendations addressing the security and privacy of data related to digital resources, if
44 needed; (v) identify and describe concerns, if any, regarding consumer protection and access
45 issues that emerge surrounding digital collections; (vi) investigate and summarize the actions of
46 other states in addressing digital collection creation; (vii) examine the impact of licensed
47 electronic literary resources on library users; and (viii) recommend legislative and executive
48 action to: (A) support the sustainability of diverse digital and electronic resource collections in
