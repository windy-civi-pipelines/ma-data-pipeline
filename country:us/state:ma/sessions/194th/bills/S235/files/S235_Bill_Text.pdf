245 of this subsection. Such request shall include an initial licensing fee of $1,000,000 payable to the
246 commission.
247 (2) Upon receiving a request for a temporary license, the executive director of the
248 commission shall review the request. If the executive director determines that the entity
249 requesting the temporary license is a qualified gaming entity and has paid the internet gaming
250 initial licensing fee pursuant to paragraph (1), the commission shall authorize the qualified
251 gaming entity to conduct internet gaming for a period of 1 year under a temporary license or
252 until a final determination on its operator license application is made.
253 (3) All qualified gaming entities that submit an application for temporary licensure
254 within 30 days of the date on which the Commission first begins to accept applications for an
255 internet gaming license shall be given an equal opportunity to commence offering, conducting,
256 or operating internet gaming on the same day.
257 (d) Prior to issuing an operator license or an internet gaming provider license, the
258 commission shall commence an investigation into the suitability of the applicant. The
259 commission may use information obtained from the applicant pursuant to chapter 23K, chapter
260 23N, chapter 128A, chapter 128C, or information from other jurisdictions where the applicant is
261 authorized to conduct internet gaming wagering. In evaluating the suitability of the applicant, the
262 commission shall consider the overall reputation of the applicant including, but not limited to: (i)
13 of 40

263 the integrity, honesty, good character and reputation of the applicant; (ii) the financial stability,
264 integrity and background of the applicant; (iii) the business practices and the business ability of
265 the applicant to establish and maintain a successful internet gaming operation; (iv) whether the
266 applicant has a history of compliance with gaming licensing requirements in other jurisdictions;
267 (v) whether the applicant, at the time of application, has been issued a judgment against it in
268 litigation involving its business practices; and (vi) the suitability of all parties in interest to the
269 license, including affiliates and close associates, and the financial resources of the applicant.
270 (e) The commission may deny an application, if the commission determines during
271 its investigation that an applicant has failed to: (i) establish the applicant's integrity or the
272 integrity of any affiliate, close associate, financial resources or any person required to be
273 qualified by the commission; (ii) demonstrate responsible business practices in any jurisdiction;
274 or (iii) overcome any other reason, as determined by the commission, as to why it would be
275 injurious to the interests of the commonwealth to award the applicant an operator license.
276 (f) Upon application by a qualified gaming entity that is not denied pursuant to
277 subsection (e) and payment of the initial licensing fee pursuant to subsection (g) or (k), the
278 commission shall grant a license to a qualified gaming entity that provides the right to conduct
279 internet gaming; provided, that the qualified gaming entity shall meet the requirements for
280 licensure under this chapter and the rules and regulations of the commission.
281 (g) An operator license shall be issued for a 5- year period upon payment of a
282 $5,000,000 initial licensing fee, and may be renewed for 5-year periods upon payment of a
283 $5,000,000 renewal fee; provided, that the operator shall continue to meet all requirements under
284 this chapter and the rules and regulations of the commission. The commission shall credit any
14 of 40

285 initial licensing fee paid pursuant to paragraph (1) of subsection (c) to a successful applicant for
286 an operator license or an internet gaming platform provider license against the licensing fee due
287 under this subsection or subsection (k).
288 (h) An operator shall submit to the commission such documentation or information as
289 the commission may require to demonstrate that the operator continues to meet the requirements
290 of this chapter and the rules and regulations of the commission. An operator shall submit
291 required documentation or information no later than 5 years after issuance of its operator license
292 and every 5 years thereafter, or within lesser periods based on circumstances specified by the
293 commission. Any request from the commission for such documentation within a lesser period
294 shall provide at least 120 days for the operator to comply.
295 (i) No licensee shall transfer an operator license, or any direct or indirect interest in
296 the license, without the majority approval of the commission. A person seeking to acquire such
297 license through a transfer shall qualify and otherwise be determined by the commission to be
298 eligible for licensure under this chapter. The commission may reject a proposed license transfer
299 or a proposed transfer of interest in the license to an unsuitable person and may reject a proposed
300 transfer that, in the determination of the commission, would be injurious to the interests of the
301 commonwealth. The commission may promulgate regulations governing this process which may
302 include assessment of a fee to reflect the cost associated with reviewing the proposed transfer.
303 Such fee shall not exceed $200,000.
304 (j) Applications for operator licenses shall be public records under section 10 of
305 chapter 66; provided however, that trade secrets, competitively-sensitive or other proprietary
15 of 40

306 information provided in the course of an application for an operator license under this chapter
307 shall be withheld from disclosure under said section 10 of said chapter 66.

312 application and investigation of the applicant; provided, however, that if the costs of the
313 investigation exceed the initial application fee, the applicant shall pay the additional amount to
314 the commission not more than 30 days after notification of insufficient fees or the application
315 shall be rejected.
316 (b) All fees in this section shall be deposited into the Internet Gaming Control Fund
317 established in section 14.
318 Section 8. (a) All persons employed by an operator to perform duties directly related to
319 the operation of internet gaming in the commonwealth in a supervisory role shall maintain a
320 valid occupational license issued by the commission. The commission shall issue such
321 occupational license to a person who meets the requirements of this section. The holder of an
322 occupational license issued by the commission pursuant to Chapter 23K or 23N shall be deemed
323 qualified to hold an occupational licensing for internet gaming without additional review.
324 (b) An occupational license authorizes the licensee to be employed in the capacity
325 designated by the commission while the license is active. The commission may establish, by rule
326 or regulation, job classifications with different requirements based on the extent to which a
327 particular job impacts, or has the potential to impact, the lawful operation of internet gaming.
16 of 40

328 (c) An applicant for an occupational license shall submit any required application
329 forms established by the commission and shall pay a nonrefundable application fee of $100. An

337 false statement of a material fact to the commission; (ii) has had a license revoked by any
338 governmental authority responsible for regulation of gaming activities; (iii) has been convicted
339 of a felony or other crime involving embezzlement, theft, fraud, perjury, or a gambling-related

432 determined by the operator. All bets authorized pursuant to this section must be initiated within
433 the commonwealth or a permissible jurisdiction. Consistent with the intent of the federal
434 Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act of 2006, 31 U.S.C. section 5361 to 5367,
435 inclusive, the intermediate routing of electronic data related to a lawful wager authorized

446 licensee. No patron on the exclusion list shall be permitted to participate in internet gaming
447 pursuant to this chapter.
448 (2) The commission shall establish a list of self-excluded persons from internet

450 filing a statement with the commission acknowledging that they are a problem gambler and by
451 agreeing that, during any period of voluntary exclusion, they shall not collect any winnings or
452 recover any losses resulting from any internet gaming. The commission shall adopt further
453 regulations for the self-excluded persons list including procedures for placement, removal and
454 transmittal of the list to internet gaming operators. The commission may adopt regulations to
455 exclude from participation in internet gaming any person that has self-excluded from sports
456 wagering pursuant to Chapter 23N. The commission may revoke, limit, condition, suspend or
457 fine an internet gaming operator if the operator knowingly or recklessly fails to exclude any
22 of 40

458 person placed on the list of self-excluded persons. The list of self-excluded persons from internet

466 Section 14. (a) An excise is hereby imposed upon internet gaming operators in the
467 commonwealth at the rate of 20 per cent of the operator's adjusted gross internet gaming receipts.
468 The accrual method of accounting shall be used for purposes of calculating the amount of the tax
469 owed by the licensee. The excise shall be paid to the commission at the time provided for filing
470 the return pursuant to subsection (c).
471 (b) Promotional credits shall be calculated into an operator’s adjusted gross internet
472 gaming receipts according to this subsection.
473 (1) Until January 1, 2028, when determining the promotional credits deduction used for
474 calculating “adjusted gross internet gaming receipts” each month, as defined in Section 3, an
475 internet gaming operator shall include all promotional credits used by patrons.
476 (2) On or after January 1, 2028, when determining the promotional credits deduction used
477 for calculating “adjusted gross internet gaming receipts” each month, as defined in Section 3, an
23 of 40

478 internet gaming operator shall only include a portion of the total promotional credits used by
479 patrons as follows:

494 (B) carry forward any unused free bet credits accumulated before January 1, 2028.
495 (c)(1) The excise imposed and collected pursuant to subsection shall be due and payable
496 to the commission in monthly installments on or before the fifteenth calendar day following the
497 calendar month in which the adjusted gross internet gaming receipts were received.
24 of 40

498 (2) On or before the fifteenth calendar day of each month, the operator shall complete
499 and submit the return for the preceding month by electronic communication to the commission in
500 a form prescribed by the commission that provides:

507 (4) When an operator's adjusted gross internet gaming receipts for a month is a
508 negative number because the winnings paid to wagerers and excise taxes paid pursuant to federal
509 law exceed the operator's total gross receipts from internet gaming, the commission shall allow
510 the operator to carry over the negative amount to returns filed for subsequent months. The
511 negative amount of adjusted internet gaming receipts shall not be carried back to an earlier
512 month and taxes previously received by the commission shall not be refunded unless the operator
513 surrenders its license and the operator's last return reported negative adjusted internet gaming
514 receipts.
515 (d) The excise on adjusted gross internet gaming receipts imposed by this section shall be
516 in lieu of all other state and local taxes and fees imposed on the operation of, or the proceeds

25 of 40

518 (e) Annually, not later than July 1, the commission shall publish on its website a report
519 stating the amount in fees, surcharges and civil penalties received from operators and taxes
520 received from operators and from people or entities that offer internet gaming.
521 Section 15. (a) There shall be established and set up on the books of the commonwealth a
522 separate fund to be known as the Internet Gaming Control Fund. The commission shall be the
523 trustee of the fund and shall expend money to finance the operational activities of the
524 commission pertaining to internet gaming. The fund shall be credited with: (i) any appropriation,
525 bond proceeds or other monies authorized by the general court and specifically designated to be
526 credited thereto; (ii) the proceeds of any fees collected pursuant to this section unless otherwise
527 specified; (iii) fees collected pursuant to sections 7 and 8; and (iv) such additional funds as are
528 subject to the direction and control of the commission. All available money in the fund that is
529 unexpended at the end of each fiscal year shall not revert to the General Fund and shall be
530 available for expenditure in the subsequent fiscal year.
531 (b) The commission shall establish fees for any investigation into a violation of this
532 chapter or regulation promulgated hereunder by an internet gaming operator to be paid by the
533 internet gaming operator including, but not limited to, billable hours by commission staff
534 involved in the investigation and the costs of services, equipment or other expenses that are
535 incurred by the commission during the investigation.
536 (c) The commission’s costs of regulating internet gaming shall be covered by: (i) the
537 fees set forth in subsection (b); (ii) any other fees specified in this chapter; or (iii) any other
538 designated sources of funding. The commission shall not assess internet gaming operators
26 of 40

539 pursuant to this chapter in proportion to each operator's share of the commonwealth's total
540 adjusted gross internet gaming receipts.
541 (d) If the fees collected pursuant to subsections (b) and (c) exceed the cost required to
542 maintain regulatory control, the surplus funds shall be credited in proportional shares against
543 each internet gaming operator's next assessment.
544 (e) The commission shall annually assess and collect a $1,000,000 fee in shares
545 to be determined by the commission against each internet gaming operator. The fee collected
546 pursuant to this subsection shall be deposited into the Public Health Trust Fund established in
547 section 58 of said chapter 23K and shall be used for the costs of services and public health
548 programs provided for in said section 58 of said chapter 23K.
549 Section 16. (a) The commission may assess a civil administrative penalty on an operator
550 who fails to comply with any provision of this chapter or any regulation or order adopted by the
551 commission; provided, however, that the noncompliance shall have occurred after the
552 commission has given such operator written notice of the noncompliance and the time stated in
553 the notice for coming into compliance has elapsed; provided further, that the commission may
554 assess a penalty without providing written notice if the failure to comply: (i) was part of a pattern
555 of noncompliance and not an isolated instance; (ii) was willful or neglectful and not the result of
556 error; (iii) resulted in a significant breach to the integrity of the operator or the internet gaming
557 laws of the commonwealth; or (iv) consisted of failure to promptly report to the commission any
558 knowledge of evidence or circumstances that would cause a reasonable person to believe that a
559 violation of this chapter has been committed. The civil administrative penalty shall be in addition
560 to any other civil penalty that may be prescribed by law.
27 of 40

561 (b) For the purpose of determining whether such noncompliance was part of a pattern
562 of noncompliance and not an isolated instance, the commission shall consider, but not be limited
563 to; (i) whether the commission had previously notified the operator of such noncompliance on
564 more than 1 occasion during the previous month or of any noncompliance with the same
565 provision of a law, regulation, order, license or approval as the current noncompliance during the
566 previous 6-month period; or (ii) whether the current and previous instances of noncompliance,
567 considered together, indicate a potential threat to the integrity of the operator and internet
568 gaming in the commonwealth or an interference with the commission's ability to efficiently and
569 effectively regulate internet gaming in the commonwealth and enforce any regulation, license or
570 order. If an operator that has received a notice of noncompliance fails to come into compliance
571 within the time period stated in the notice, the civil administrative penalty may be assessed by
572 the commission upon the operator from the date of receipt of such notice.
573 (c) If the commission seeks to assess a civil administrative penalty on an operator, the
574 commission shall cause to be served upon the operator, by service in hand or by certified mail,
575 return receipt requested, a written notice of its intent to assess a civil administrative penalty that
576 shall include: (i) a concise statement of the alleged act or omission for which such civil
577 administrative penalty is sought to be assessed; (ii) each law, regulation, order, license or
578 approval that has not been complied with as a result of such alleged act or omission; (iii) the
579 amount that the commission seeks to assess as a civil administrative penalty for each alleged act
580 or omission; (iv) a statement of the operator's right to an adjudicatory hearing on the proposed
581 assessment; (v) the requirements the operator shall comply with to avoid being deemed to have
582 waived the right to an adjudicatory hearing; and (vi) the manner of payment thereof if the
583 operator elects to pay the penalty and waive an adjudicatory hearing. After written notice of
28 of 40

584 noncompliance or intent to assess a civil administrative penalty has been given, each day
585 thereafter during which noncompliance occurs or continues shall constitute a separate offense
586 and shall be subject to a separate civil administrative penalty if reasonable efforts have not been
587 made by the operator to promptly come into compliance.
588 (d) If the commission seeks to assess a civil administrative penalty on an operator, the
589 operator shall have the right to an adjudicatory hearing under chapter 30A, the provisions of
590 which shall apply except when they are inconsistent with the provisions of this chapter.
591 (e) An operator shall be deemed to have waived its right to an adjudicatory hearing
592 unless, not more than 21 days after the date of the commission's notice that the commission seeks
593 to assess a civil administrative penalty, the operator files with the commission a written
594 statement denying the occurrence of any of the acts or omissions alleged by the commission in
595 the notice or asserting that the amount of the proposed civil administrative penalty is excessive.
596 In an adjudicatory hearing authorized under chapter 30A, the commission shall be required to
597 prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, the occurrence of each act or omission alleged by the
598 commission in the notice.
599 (f) If an operator waives the right to an adjudicatory hearing, the proposed civil
600 administrative penalty shall be final immediately upon such waiver. If a civil administrative
601 penalty is assessed at the conclusion of an adjudicatory hearing, the civil administrative penalty
602 shall be final upon the expiration of 30 days unless an action for judicial review of the decision is
603 commenced under chapter 30A.
604 (g) An operator who institutes proceedings for judicial review of the final assessment
605 of a civil administrative penalty shall place the full amount of the final assessment in an interest-
29 of 40

606 bearing escrow account in the custody of the clerk or magistrate of the reviewing court. The
607 establishment of an interest-bearing escrow account shall be a condition precedent to the
608 jurisdiction of the reviewing court unless the party seeking judicial review demonstrates, in a
609 preliminary hearing held not more than 20 days after the filing of the complaint, the presence of
610 a substantial question for review by the court or the operator's inability to pay. Upon such a
611 demonstration, the court may grant an extension or waiver of the interest-bearing escrow account
612 requirement or may require, in lieu of such interest-bearing escrow account, the posting of a
613 bond payable directly to the commonwealth in the amount of 125 per cent of the assessed
614 penalty.
615 If, after judicial review, in a case where the escrow account requirement has been waived,
616 and in cases where a bond has been posted in lieu of such requirement, the court affirms, in
617 whole or in part, the assessment of a civil administrative penalty, the commission shall be paid
618 the amount thereof together with interest at the rate provided in section 6C of chapter 231. If,
619 after judicial review in a case where an interest-bearing escrow account has been established, the
620 court affirms the assessment of such penalty, in whole or in part, the commission shall be paid
621 the amount thereof together with the accumulated interest in the interest-bearing escrow account.
622 If the court sets aside the assessment of a civil administrative penalty in a case where the amount
623 of such penalty has been deposited in an interest-bearing escrow account, the operator on whom
624 the civil administrative penalty was assessed shall be repaid the amount so set aside, together
625 with the accumulated interest thereon.
626 (h) Each operator who fails to timely pay a civil administrative penalty and each
627 operator who issues a bond under this section and fails to timely pay to the commission the
628 amount required for the bond, shall be liable to the commonwealth for up to 3 times the amount
30 of 40

629 of the civil administrative penalty, together with costs, plus interest accrued from the time the
630 civil administrative penalty became final and attorneys' fees, including all costs and attorneys
631 fees incurred directly in the collection of the penalty. The rate of interest shall be the rate
632 provided in section 6C of chapter 231. The commission may require that the amount of a civil
633 administrative penalty imposed under this section exceed any economic benefit realized by a
634 person.
635 (i) The commission may impose conditions on, suspend or revoke an operator' s license
636 or reprimand or assess a fine on an operator upon a finding that the operator: (i) has committed a
637 criminal or civil offense under this chapter or under any other law; (ii) is not in compliance with
638 internet gaming regulations promulgated pursuant to this chapter; (iii) is under criminal
639 investigation in another jurisdiction; (iv) has breached a condition of licensure; (v) has affiliates,
640 close associates or employees that are not qualified or licensed under this chapter with whom the
641 operator continues to conduct business or employ; (vi) is no longer capable of maintaining
642 operations as an internet gaming operator; or (vii) whose business practice, upon a determination
643 by the commission, is injurious to the policy objectives of this chapter.
644 Section 17. There shall be established and set up on the books of the commonwealth an
645 Internet Gaming Fund which shall receive revenues collected pursuant to sections 6 and 14. The
646 commission shall be the trustee of the fund and shall transfer monies from the fund as follows:

686 civil penalty not to exceed $2,000 for each violation or $5,000 for violations arising from the
687 same series of events. Such penalty shall be imposed on all persons and is not limited to persons
688 licensed under this chapter.
689 (b) The commission may condition, suspend, reprimand, assess a fine or revoke an
