5 transportation for its population. In doing so, a consistent part of development, includes the
6 continuing capital expenditures needed, to expand, and improve mass transit lines, particularly
7 the fixed rail lines, stations, and other facilities; and resources for such, which often appear
8 weak; or in need of capital upgrading; and/or are non-existent.

10 expenditures, and this Statute, is designed for that purpose.
11 3.) Each and every year, a sum of not less than $200,000,000, ($200 Million), shall be
12 transferred to a Massachusetts Transportation Endowment Fund (MTEF).
13 4.) This money, shall become a permanent trust fund, operating as an endowment, with
14 significantly described requirements, and provisions. Income from the fund, may be used, only
15 for capital construction, and improvements, of mass transportation lines, stations, and facilities,
16 and needed additional directly related construction.
17 5.) Principal amounts, shall become fixed Endowment Principal, together with other
18 specified amounts, to be further described.
19 6a.) When the fund principal, exceeds $1,000,000,000 ($1 Billion) in Endowment
20 Principal; the formula for use, shall change:
21 6b.) Half of the annual contribution of $300,000,000 ($300 Million) may be directed to
22 capital expenditures; while $150,000,000 ($150 Million) is directed to increase in the
23 Endowment Principal.
24 6c.) Half of the annual income, may be utilized for capital expenditures. New non-fare
25 revenues, from businesses on transit properties, shall be apportioned, with half of such revenues
26 going to Operations, and half to the Endowment Principal.
27 7.) A Capital Project Approval Board (CPAB), of nine (9) members, shall review
28 potential capital projects, establish a priority listing, and annually announce their decisions
29 publicly.
