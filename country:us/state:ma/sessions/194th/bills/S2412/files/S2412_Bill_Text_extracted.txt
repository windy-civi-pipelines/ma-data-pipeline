5 SECTION 2. Notwithstanding any general or special law to the contrary, to ensure the
6 safety of all individuals in proximity of a commuter rail station in the commonwealth, the
7 Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority shall require that all commuter rail station grade
8 crossings are converted into active crossings containing, at a minimum:
9 (1) four quadrant gates, or gate skirts. Four quadrant gates consist of two exit gates used
10 in combination with standard entrance gates. The additional gate arms, combined with standard
1 of 2
11 entrance gates, restrict access to the track crossing area. A gate skirt is defined as a secondary bar
12 or gate marked with identical striping to the primary gate arm. The skirt hangs down from the
13 pedestrian gate, and, in its fully deployed horizontal position, blocks additional area under the
14 arm gate;
15 (2) signage at the entry point of the crossing to direct pedestrians to the appropriate and
16 identified crossing area;
17 (3) a signalized visual warning device; and
18 (4) channelization to provide orientation clues to the designated pathway over the tracks
19 and to direct pedestrians with vision impairments away from unprotected drop-offs along the
20 edges of boarding platforms at stations.
21 Passive crossings without the required safety measures as enumerated above at a
22 commuter rail station in the commonwealth shall be prohibited. Within 120 days of the passage
23 of this Act, the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority shall submit a plan for the upgrades
24 necessary to ensure that all commuter rail stations with pedestrian grade crossings in the
25 commonwealth are in compliance with this Act. Said report shall be sent to the chairperson of
26 the department of public utilities, the secretary of transportation, the secretary of administration
27 and finance, the house and senate chairs of the joint committee on transportation and the chairs
28 of the house and senate committees on ways and means. The Massachusetts Bay Transportation
29 Authority shall also file said plan with the house and senate clerks.
