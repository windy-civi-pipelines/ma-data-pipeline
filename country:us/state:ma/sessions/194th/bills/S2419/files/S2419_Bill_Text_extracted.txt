3 “The department’s manual must indicate that where pedestrians who walk slower than
4 3.5 feet per second, or pedestrians who use wheelchairs, routinely use the crosswalk, a walking
5 speed of less than 3.5 feet per second should be considered in determining the pedestrian
6 clearance time. The department will be responsible for promulgating regulations that direct a
7 municipality to:

9 who are likely to have: (i.) a walking speed lower than 3.5 feet per second as determined by
10 current research, (ii.) a slower than average walking speed due to a physical mobility issue, and
11 (iii.) slower walking speeds resulting from transporting, assisting, or conveying another person

13 (b.) require that locations contained in said list, where there are signalized crosswalks
14 regularly in use, account for the slower walking speed of pedestrians by adjusting signal walk
15 clearance times to a reasonable degree to allow for pedestrians to safely complete a crossing."
