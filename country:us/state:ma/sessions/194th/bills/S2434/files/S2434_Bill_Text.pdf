6 licensed pursuant to section seven W; provided, that the defects which are the reasons for the
7 failure to issue a certificate of inspection were not caused by the abusive or negligent operation
8 of the motor vehicle or by damage resulting from an accident or collision occurring after the date
9 of the sale or lease; and provided, further, that the cost of repairs necessary to permit the issuance

109 be amended by striking out section 13I and replacing it with the following section:-
110 Section 13I. For the purposes of this section and section 13J
111 “Collateral” shall mean consumer goods secured or motor vehicles leased by a consumer

114 of more than one year;
6 of 11

115 “creditor” and “secured creditor” shall include the lessor of a motor vehicle; and
116 “debtor” shall include a consumer lessee of a motor vehicle.
117 (a) In any consumer credit transaction involving, or loan that is secured by, a non-
118 possessory security interest in consumer goods a provision relating to default is enforceable only
119 to the extent that the default is material and consists of the debtor’s failure to make one or more
120 payments as required by the agreement, or the occurrence of an event which substantially
121 impairs the value of the collateral.
122 (b) After a default under a consumer credit transaction by a debtor the secured creditor
123 may not bring an action against the debtor or proceed against the collateral until he gives the
124 debtor the notice required by this section. Said notice shall be deemed to be delivered when
125 delivered to the debtor or when mailed to the debtor at the debtor’s address last known to the
126 creditor. If a debtor cures a default after receiving such notice and again defaults, the creditor
127 shall give another notice before bringing action or proceeding against the collateral with respect
128 to the subsequent default, but no notice is required in connection with a subsequent default if,
129 within the period commencing on the date of the consumer credit transaction subject to this
130 section and the date of the subsequent default, the debtor has cured a default after notice three or
131 more times.
132 (c) The notice shall be in writing and shall be given to the debtor ten days or more after
133 the default. The notice shall conspicuously state the rights of the debtor upon default in
134 substantially the following form:
135 The heading shall read:' 'Rights of Defaulting Consumer under Massachusetts Law.'' The
136 body of the notice shall read: ''You may cure your default in (describe transaction in a manner
7 of 11

137 enabling debtor to identify it) by paying to (name and address of lessor or creditor) (amount due)
138 before (date which is at least twenty-one days after notice is mailed).
139 If you pay this amount within the time allowed you are no longer in default and may
140 continue with the transaction (lease or loan) as though no default had occurred.
141 (d) No court shall enter a deficiency judgment against a debtor which includes a finance
142 charge or insurance premiums allocable to installments due after repossession. A debtor whose
143 goods have been repossessed shall not be liable in a civil action for a deficiency unless the
144 secured party files an affidavit signed either by the purchaser at the sale or by the secured party
145 stating the price for which the goods were sold and the date and place of sale. Such affidavit
146 shall be filed with the complaint.
147 (e) Unless the secured creditor has first notified the debtor that he has elected to
148 accelerate the unpaid balance of the obligation because of default, brought action against the
149 debtor, or proceeded against the collateral, the debtor may cure a default consisting of a failure to
150 pay money by tendering the amount of all unpaid sums due at the time of tender, without
151 acceleration, plus any unpaid delinquency or deferral charges. Cure shall restore the debtor to his
152 rights under the agreement as though the defaults cured have not occurred, subject to the
153 provisions of subsection (b).
154 SECTION 12. Chapter 255 of the general laws, as so appearing in the 2014 edition, shall
155 be amended by striking out section 13J and replacing it with the following section:-
156 Section 13J. (a) Subject to the provisions of this section and section 13I, a secured
157 creditor under a consumer credit transaction may take possession of collateral. In taking
158 possession the secured creditor under a consumer credit transaction may proceed without a prior
8 of 11

159 hearing only if the default is material and consists of the debtor’s failure to make one or more
160 payments as required by the agreement or the occurrence of an event which substantially impairs
161 the value of the collateral, and only if possession can be obtained without use of force, without a
162 breach of peace and, unless the debtor consents to an entry, at the time of such entry, without
163 entry upon property owned by, or rented to the debtor.
164 (b) Except as provided in subsection (a), a creditor under a consumer credit transaction
165 may proceed against collateral only after a prior hearing. In any proceeding where possession of
166 the collateral is part of the relief sought by a creditor no court shall allow a secured creditor or
167 lessor to take possession of collateral until the right of the creditor or lessor to take possession
168 has been determined at a hearing at which the consumer has an opportunity to be heard, having
169 been notified in writing of such hearing at least seven days in advance thereof.
170 (c) The consumer under a secured consumer credit transaction may redeem the collateral
171 from the creditor or lessor at any time within twenty days of the creditor or lessor’s taking
172 possession of the collateral, or thereafter until the creditor or lessor has either disposed of the
173 collateral, entered into a contract for its disposition, or gained the right to retain the collateral.
174 (d) The creditor or lessor may after gaining possession sell or otherwise dispose of the
175 collateral. Unless displaced by the provisions of this section and section thirteen I, the rights and
176 obligations of the parties, including redemption and disposition of the collateral shall be
177 governed by the provisions of Part 6 of Article 9 of chapter 106, including consumer leases of
178 motor vehicles, to the extent applicable. Notwithstanding the provisions in Part 6 of Article 9 of
179 chapter 106, if, in connection with a consumer credit transaction which involves an unpaid
180 balance of two thousand dollars or less and which is at the time of default secured by a non-
9 of 11

181 possessory security interest in consumer goods, the creditor or lessor takes possession of or
182 accepts surrender of the collateral, the consumer shall not be liable for any deficiency. If the
183 agreement between the creditor or lessor and consumer provides that the consumer is to obtain
184 insurance protecting the collateral against fire, theft, collision or other hazards and naming the
185 creditor or lessor as loss payee and if, prior to the repossession or surrender of the collateral, loss
186 or damage occurs which would give rise to insurance proceeds under the terms of the policy in
187 force, then nothing in this section shall be deemed to limit the creditor or lessor’s rights to so
188 much of the insurance proceeds as does not exceed the fair market value of the collateral existing
189 just prior to the loss or damage and, if insurance as required by the agreement is not in force at
190 the time of the loss or damage, nothing in this section shall be deemed to limit the creditor or
191 lessor’s rights in proceeding against any third party who is responsible for the loss or damage in
192 the name of the consumer or otherwise. For the purposes of this section the unpaid balance of a
193 consumer credit transaction shall be that amount which the consumer would have been required
194 to pay upon prepayment.
195 (e) (1) If the unpaid balance of the consumer credit transaction at the time of default was
196 two thousand dollars or more the creditor or lessor shall be entitled to recover from the consumer
197 the deficiency, if any, resulting from deducting the fair market value of the collateral from the
198 unpaid balance due and shall also be entitled to any reasonable repossession and storage costs,
199 provided he has complied with all provisions of this section.
200 (2) In a proceeding for a deficiency the fair market value of the collateral shall be a
201 question for the court to determine. Periodically published trade estimates of the retail value of
202 goods shall, to the extent they are recognized in the particular trade or business, be presumed to
203 be the fair market value of the collateral.
10 of 11

204 (f) Any secured creditor or lessor obtaining possession of a motor vehicle under the
205 provisions of this section shall, within one hour after obtaining such possession, notify the police
206 department of the city or town in which such possession occurred, giving such police department
207 a description of the vehicle involved.
208 SECTION 13. Sections 1 through 9 shall not apply to leases in existence before the
209 effective date of this Act. However, such sections shall apply when, after the effective date of
210 this Act, a consumer lease is renegotiated by the same lessee for the same motor vehicle.
211 SECTION 14. Sections 10 and 11 shall not apply to leases in default before the effective
212 date of this Act. However, such sections shall apply where a lease in default before the effective
213 date of this Act at is cured, and then goes into default again after the effective date of this Act.
