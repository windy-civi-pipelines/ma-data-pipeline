of the same, as follows:

3 department of the trial court. Any employee of the trial court may voluntarily contribute 1 or
4 more sick, personal or vacation days to the sick leave bank for use by Andrew Setera. If Andrew

6 remaining time in the sick leave bank shall be transferred to the trial court paid leave bank. Sick
7 leave bank days shall not be used for absences unrelated to the illness or disability that
