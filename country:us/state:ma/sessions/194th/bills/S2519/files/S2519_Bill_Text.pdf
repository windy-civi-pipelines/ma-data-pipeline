6 of 36

116 Member States may charge a fee for granting a license to practice Cosmetology.
117 Individuals not residing in a Member State shall continue to be able to apply for a Member
118 State’s Single-State License as provided under the laws of each Member State. However, the
119 Single-State License granted to these individuals shall not be recognized as granting a Multistate
120 License to provide services in any other Member State. Nothing in this Compact shall affect the
121 requirements established by a Member State for the issuance of a Single-State License. A
122 Multistate License issued to a Licensee by a Home State to a resident of that State shall be
123 recognized by each Member State as authorizing a Licensee to practice Cosmetology in each
124 Member State. At no point shall the Commission have the power to define the educational or
125 professional requirements for a license to practice Cosmetology. The Member States shall retain
126 sole jurisdiction over the provision of these requirements.
127 Section 4. To be eligible to apply to their Home State’s State Licensing Authority for an
128 initial Multistate License under this Compact, a Licensee must hold an active and unencumbered
129 Single-State License to practice Cosmetology in their Home State. Upon the receipt of an
130 application for a Multistate License, according to the Rules of the Commission, a Member
131 State’s State Licensing Authority shall ascertain whether the applicant meets the requirements
132 for a Multistate License under this Compact. If an applicant meets the requirements for a
133 Multistate License under this Compact and any applicable Rules of the Commission, the State
134 Licensing Authority in receipt of the application shall, within a reasonable time, grant a
135 Multistate License to that applicant, and inform all Member States of the grant of said Multistate
136 License. A Multistate License to practice Cosmetology issued by a Member State’s State
137 Licensing Authority shall be recognized by each Member State as authorizing the practice
138 thereof as though that Licensee held a Single-State License to do so in each Member State,
7 of 36

139 subject to the restrictions herein. A Multistate License granted pursuant to this Compact may be
140 effective for a definite period of time, concurrent with the licensure renewal period in the Home
141 State. To maintain a Multistate License under this Compact, a Licensee must (a) agree to abide
142 by the rules of the State Licensing Authority, and the State scope of practice laws governing the
143 Practice of Cosmetology, of any Member State in which the Licensee provides services, (b) pay
144 all required fees related to the application and process, and any other fees which the Commission
145 may by Rule require, and (c) comply with any and all other requirements regarding Multistate
146 Licenses which the Commission may by Rule provide.
147 A Licensee practicing in a Member State is subject to all scope of practice laws
148 governing Cosmetology Services in that State. The Practice of Cosmetology under a Multistate
149 License granted pursuant to this Compact will subject the Licensee to the jurisdiction of the State
150 Licensing Authority, the courts, and the laws of the Member State in which the Cosmetology
151 Services are provided.
152 Section 5. A Licensee may hold a Multistate License, issued by their Home State, in only
153 one Member State at any given time. If a Licensee changes their Home State by moving between
154 two Member States:
155 1. The Licensee shall immediately apply for the reissuance of their Multistate License in
156 their new Home State. The Licensee shall pay all applicable fees and notify the prior Home State
157 in accordance with the Rules of the Commission.
158 2. Upon receipt of an application to reissue a Multistate License, the new Home State
159 shall verify that the Multistate License is active, unencumbered and eligible for reissuance under
160 the terms of the Compact and the Rules of the Commission. The Multistate License issued by the
8 of 36

161 prior Home State will be deactivated and all Member States notified in accordance with the
162 applicable Rules adopted by the Commission.
163 3. If required for initial licensure, the new Home State may require a Background Check
164 as specified in the laws of that State, or the compliance with any Jurisprudence Requirements of
165 the new Home State.
166 4. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Compact, if a Licensee does not meet the
167 requirements set forth in this Compact for the reissuance of a Multistate License by the new
168 Home State, then the Licensee shall be subject to the new Home State requirements for the
169 issuance of a Single-State License in that State.
170 If a Licensee changes their primary state of residence by moving from a Member State to
171 a non-Member State, or from a non-Member State to a Member State, then the Licensee shall be
172 subject to the State requirements for the issuance of a Single-State License in the new Home
173 State. Nothing in this Compact shall interfere with a Licensee’s ability to hold a Single-State
174 License in multiple States; however, for the purposes of this Compact, a Licensee shall have only
175 one Home State, and only one Multistate License. Nothing in this Compact shall interfere with
176 the requirements established by a Member State for the issuance of a Single-State License.
177 Section 6. A. Nothing in this Compact, nor any Rule or regulation of the Commission,
178 shall be construed to limit, restrict, or in any way reduce the ability of a Member State to enact
179 and enforce laws, regulations, or other rules related to the Practice of Cosmetology in that State,
180 where those laws, regulations, or other rules are not inconsistent with the provisions of this
181 Compact.
9 of 36

182 B. Insofar as practical, a Member State’s State Licensing Authority shall cooperate with
183 the Commission and with each entity exercising independent regulatory authority over the
184 Practice of Cosmetology according to the provisions of this Compact.
185 C. Discipline shall be the sole responsibility of the State in which Cosmetology Services
186 are provided. Accordingly, each Member State’s State Licensing Authority shall be responsible
187 for receiving complaints about individuals practicing Cosmetology in that State, and for
188 communicating all relevant Investigative Information about any such Adverse Action to the other
189 Member States through the Data System in addition to any other methods the Commission may
190 by Rule require.
191 Section 7. A. A Licensee’s Home State shall have exclusive power to impose an Adverse
192 Action against a Licensee’s Multistate License issued by the Home State.
193 B. A Home State may take Adverse Action on a Multistate License based on the
194 Investigative Information, Current Significant Investigative Information, or Adverse Action of a
195 Remote State.
196 C. In addition to the powers conferred by State law, each Remote State’s State Licensing
197 Authority shall have the power to:
198 1. Take Adverse Action against a Licensee’s Authorization to Practice Cosmetology
199 through the Multistate License in that Member State, provided that:
200 a. Only the Licensee’s Home State shall have the power to take Adverse Action against
201 the Multistate License issued by the Home State; and
10 of 36

202 b. For the purposes of taking Adverse Action, the Home State’s State Licensing
203 Authority shall give the same priority and effect to reported conduct received from a Remote
204 State as it would if such conduct had occurred within the Home State. In so doing, the Home
205 State shall apply its own State laws to determine the appropriate action.
206 2. Issue cease and desist orders or impose an Encumbrance on a Licensee’s Authorization
207 to Practice within that Member State.
208 3. Complete any pending investigations of a Licensee who changes their primary state of
209 residence during the course of such an investigation. The State Licensing Authority shall also be
210 empowered to report the results of such an investigation to the Commission through the Data
211 System as described herein.
212 4. Issue subpoenas for both hearings and investigations that require the attendance and
213 testimony of witnesses, as well as the production of evidence. Subpoenas issued by a State
214 Licensing Authority in a Member State for the attendance and testimony of witnesses or the
215 production of evidence from another Member State shall be enforced in the latter State by any
216 court of competent jurisdiction, according to the practice and procedure of that court applicable
217 to subpoenas issued in proceedings before it. The issuing State Licensing Authority shall pay any
218 witness fees, travel expenses, mileage, and other fees required by the service statutes of the State
219 in which the witnesses or evidence are located.
220 5. If otherwise permitted by State law, recover from the affected Licensee the costs of
221 investigations and disposition of cases resulting from any Adverse Action taken against that
222 Licensee.
11 of 36

223 6. Take Adverse Action against the Licensee’s Authorization to Practice in that State
224 based on the factual findings of another Remote State.
225 D. A Licensee’s Home State shall complete any pending investigation(s) of a
226 Cosmetologist who changes their primary state of residence during the course of the
227 investigation(s). The Home State shall also have the authority to take appropriate action(s) and
228 shall promptly report the conclusions of the investigations to the Data System.
229 E. If an Adverse Action is taken by the Home State against a Licensee’s Multistate
230 License, the Licensee’s Authorization to Practice in all other Member States shall be deactivated
231 until all Encumbrances have been removed from the Home State license. All Home State
232 disciplinary orders that impose an Adverse Action against a Licensee’s Multistate License shall
233 include a statement that the Cosmetologist’s Authorization to Practice is deactivated in all
234 Member States during the pendency of the order.
235 F. Nothing in this Compact shall override a Member State’s authority to accept a
236 Licensee’s participation in an Alternative Program in lieu of Adverse Action. A Licensee’s
237 Multistate License shall be suspended for the duration of the Licensee’s participation in any
238 Alternative Program.
239 G. Joint Investigations
240 1. In addition to the authority granted to a Member State by its respective scope of
241 practice laws or other applicable State law, a Member State may participate with other Member
242 States in joint investigations of Licensees.
12 of 36

243 2. Member States shall share any investigative, litigation, or compliance materials in
244 furtherance of any joint or individual investigation initiated under the Compact.

246 the individual has a current license to practice Cosmetology in good standing. The individual
247 may retain their Home State designation during any period of service when that individual or
248 their spouse is on active duty assignment.
249 Section 9. A. The Compact Member States hereby create and establish a joint
250 government agency whose membership consists of all Member States that have enacted the
251 Compact known as the Cosmetology Licensure Compact Commission. The Commission is an
252 instrumentality of the Compact Member States acting jointly and not an instrumentality of any
253 one State. The Commission shall come into existence on or after the effective date of the
254 Compact as set forth in section 13.

423 total amount sufficient to cover its annual budget as approved each year for which revenue is not

443 loss, injury, or liability caused by the intentional or willful or wanton misconduct of that person.
444 The procurement of insurance of any type by the Commission shall not in any way compromise
445 or limit the immunity granted hereunder.

451 of Commission employment, duties, or responsibilities; provided that nothing herein shall be
452 construed to prohibit that person from retaining their own counsel at their own expense; and

461 did not result from the intentional or willful or wanton misconduct of that person.
23 of 36

462 4. Nothing herein shall be construed as a limitation on the liability of any Licensee for
463 professional malpractice or misconduct, which shall be governed solely by any other applicable
464 State laws.
465 5. Nothing in this Compact shall be interpreted to waive or otherwise abrogate a Member
466 State’s State action immunity or State action affirmative defense with respect to antitrust claims
467 under the Sherman Act, Clayton Act, or any other State or federal antitrust or anticompetitive
468 law or regulation.

507 from the Data System.
508 Section 11. A. The Commission shall promulgate reasonable Rules in order to effectively
509 and efficiently implement and administer the purposes and provisions of the Compact. A Rule
510 shall be invalid and have no force or effect only if a court of competent jurisdiction holds that the
511 Rule is invalid because the Commission exercised its rulemaking authority in a manner that is
512 beyond the scope and purposes of the Compact, or the powers granted hereunder, or based upon
513 another applicable standard of review.
514 B. The Rules of the Commission shall have the force of law in each Member State,
515 provided however that where the Rules of the Commission conflict with the laws of the Member
516 State that establish the Member State’s scope of practice laws governing the Practice of
517 Cosmetology as held by a court of competent jurisdiction, the Rules of the Commission shall be
518 ineffective in that State to the extent of the conflict.
519 C. The Commission shall exercise its rulemaking powers pursuant to the criteria set forth
520 in this section and the Rules adopted thereunder. Rules shall become binding as of the date
521 specified by the Commission for each Rule.
522 D. If a majority of the legislatures of the Member States rejects a Rule or portion of a
523 Rule, by enactment of a statute or resolution in the same manner used to adopt the Compact
26 of 36

524 within four (4) years of the date of adoption of the Rule, then such Rule shall have no further
525 force and effect in any Member State or to any State applying to participate in the Compact.
526 E. Rules shall be adopted at a regular or special meeting of the Commission.
527 F. Prior to adoption of a proposed Rule, the Commission shall hold a public hearing and
528 allow persons to provide oral and written comments, data, facts, opinions, and arguments.
529 G. Prior to adoption of a proposed Rule by the Commission, and at least thirty (30) days
530 in advance of the meeting at which the Commission will hold a public hearing on the proposed
531 Rule, the Commission shall provide a notice of proposed rulemaking:
532 1. On the website of the Commission or other publicly accessible platform;
533 2. To persons who have requested notice of the Commission’s notices of proposed
534 rulemaking; and
535 3. In such other way(s) as the Commission may by Rule specify.
536 H. The notice of proposed rulemaking shall include:
537 1. The time, date, and location of the public hearing at which the Commission will hear
538 public comments on the proposed Rule and, if different, the time, date, and location of the
539 meeting where the Commission will consider and vote on the proposed Rule;
540 2. If the hearing is held via telecommunication, video conference, or other electronic
541 means,
542 the Commission shall include the mechanism for access to the hearing in the notice of
543 proposed rulemaking;
27 of 36

544 3. The text of the proposed Rule and the reason therefor;
545 4. A request for comments on the proposed Rule from any interested person; and
546 5. The manner in which interested persons may submit written comments.
547 I. All hearings will be recorded. A copy of the recording and all written comments and
548 documents received by the Commission in response to the proposed Rule shall be available to
549 the public.
550 J. Nothing in this section shall be construed as requiring a separate hearing on each Rule.
551 Rules may be grouped for the convenience of the Commission at hearings required by this
552 section.
553 K. The Commission shall, by majority vote of all members, take final action on the
554 proposed Rule based on the rulemaking record and the full text of the Rule:
555 1. The Commission may adopt changes to the proposed Rule provided the changes do not
556 enlarge the original purpose of the proposed Rule.
557 2. The Commission shall provide an explanation of the reasons for substantive changes
558 made to the proposed Rule as well as reasons for substantive changes not made that were
559 recommended by commenters.
560 3. The Commission shall determine a reasonable effective date for the Rule. Except for
561 an emergency as provided in section 11.L, the effective date of the Rule shall be no sooner than
562 forty-five (45) days after the Commission issuing the notice that it adopted or amended the Rule.
28 of 36

563 L. Upon determination that an emergency exists, the Commission may consider and
564 adopt an emergency Rule with five (5) days’ notice, with opportunity to comment, provided that
565 the usual rulemaking procedures provided in the Compact and in this section shall be
566 retroactively applied to the Rule as soon as reasonably possible, in no event later than ninety (90)
567 days after the effective date of the Rule. For the purposes of this provision, an emergency Rule is
568 one that must be adopted immediately to:
569 1. Meet an imminent threat to public health, safety, or welfare;
570 2. Prevent a loss of Commission or Member State funds;
571 3. Meet a deadline for the promulgation of a Rule that is established by federal law or
572 rule; or
573 4. Protect public health and safety.
574 M. The Commission or an authorized committee of the Commission may direct revisions
575 to a previously adopted Rule for purposes of correcting typographical errors, errors in format,
576 errors in consistency, or grammatical errors. Public notice of any revisions shall be posted on the
577 website of the Commission. The revision shall be subject to challenge by any person for a period
578 of thirty (30) days after posting. The revision may be challenged only on grounds that the
579 revision results in a material change to a Rule. A challenge shall be made in writing and
580 delivered to the Commission prior to the end of the notice period. If no challenge is made, the
581 revision will take effect without further action. If the revision is challenged, the revision may not
582 take effect without the approval of the Commission.
583 N. No Member State’s rulemaking requirements shall apply under this Compact.
29 of 36

584 Section 12. A. Oversight
585 1. The executive and judicial branches of State government in each Member State shall
586 enforce this Compact and take all actions necessary and appropriate to implement the Compact.
587 2. Venue is proper and judicial proceedings by or against the Commission shall be
588 brought solely and exclusively in a court of competent jurisdiction where the principal office of
589 the Commission is located. The Commission may waive venue and jurisdictional defenses to the
590 extent it adopts or consents to participate in alternative dispute resolution proceedings. Nothing
591 herein shall affect or limit the selection or propriety of venue in any action against a Licensee for
592 professional malpractice, misconduct or any such similar matter.
593 3. The Commission shall be entitled to receive service of process in any proceeding
594 regarding the enforcement or interpretation of the Compact and shall have standing to intervene
595 in such a proceeding for all purposes. Failure to provide the Commission service of process shall
596 render a judgment or order void as to the Commission, this Compact, or promulgated Rules.
597 B. Default, Technical Assistance, and Termination
598 1. If the Commission determines that a Member State has defaulted in the performance of
599 its obligations or responsibilities under this Compact or the promulgated Rules, the Commission
600 shall provide written notice to the defaulting State. The notice of default shall describe the
601 default, the proposed means of curing the default, and any other action that the Commission may
602 take, and shall offer training and specific technical assistance regarding the default.
603 2. The Commission shall provide a copy of the notice of default to the other Member
604 States.
30 of 36

605 3. If a State in default fails to cure the default, the defaulting State may be terminated
606 from
607 the Compact upon an affirmative vote of a majority of the delegates of the Member
608 States, and all rights, privileges and benefits conferred on that State by this Compact may be
609 terminated on the effective date of termination. A cure of the default does not relieve the
610 offending State of obligations or liabilities incurred during the period of default.
611 4. Termination of membership in the Compact shall be imposed only after all other
612 means of securing compliance have been exhausted. Notice of intent to suspend or terminate
613 shall be given by the Commission to the governor, the majority and minority leaders of the
614 defaulting State’s legislature, the defaulting State’s State Licensing Authority and each of the
615 Member States’ State Licensing Authority.
616 5. A State that has been terminated is responsible for all assessments, obligations, and
617 liabilities incurred through the effective date of termination, including obligations that extend
618 beyond the effective date of termination.
619 6. Upon the termination of a State’s membership from this Compact, that State shall
620 immediately provide notice to all Licensees who hold a Multistate License within that State of
621 such termination. The terminated State shall continue to recognize all licenses granted pursuant
622 to this Compact for a minimum of one hundred eighty (180) days after the date of said notice of
623 termination.
624 7. The Commission shall not bear any costs related to a State that is found to be in default
625 or that has been terminated from the Compact, unless agreed upon in writing between the
626 Commission and the defaulting State.
31 of 36

627 8. The defaulting State may appeal the action of the Commission by petitioning the
628 United States District Court for the District of Columbia or the federal district where the
629 Commission has its principal offices. The prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such
630 litigation, including reasonable attorney’s fees.
631 C. Dispute Resolution
632 1. Upon request by a Member State, the Commission shall attempt to resolve disputes 51
633 related to the Compact that arise among Member States and between Member and non-Member
634 States.
635 2. The Commission shall promulgate a Rule providing for both mediation and binding
636 dispute resolution for disputes as appropriate.
637 D. Enforcement
638 1. The Commission, in the reasonable exercise of its discretion, shall enforce the
639 provisions of this Compact and the Commission’s Rules.
640 2. By majority vote as provided by Commission Rule, the Commission may initiate legal
641 action against a Member State in default in the United States District Court for the
642 District of Columbia or the federal district where the Commission has its principal offices
643 to enforce compliance with the provisions of the Compact and its promulgated Rules. The relief
644 sought may include both injunctive relief and damages. In the event judicial enforcement is
645 necessary, the prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable
646 attorney’s fees. The remedies herein shall not be the exclusive remedies of the Commission. The
32 of 36

647 Commission may pursue any other remedies available under federal or the defaulting Member
648 State’s law.
649 3. A Member State may initiate legal action against the Commission in the United States
650 District Court for the District of Columbia or the federal district where the Commission has its
651 principal offices to enforce compliance with the provisions of the Compact and its promulgated
652 Rules. The relief sought may include both injunctive relief and damages. In the event judicial
653 enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation,
654 including reasonable attorney’s fees.
655 4. No individual or entity other than a Member State may enforce this Compact against
656 the Commission.
657 Section 13. A. The Compact shall come into effect on the date on which the Compact
658 statute is enacted into law in the seventh Member State.
659 1. On or after the effective date of the Compact, the Commission shall convene and
660 review the enactment of each of the Charter Member States to determine if the statute enacted by
661 each such Charter Member State is materially different than the model Compact statute.
662 a. A Charter Member State whose enactment is found to be materially different from the
663 model Compact statute shall be entitled to the default process set forth in section 12.
664 b. If any Member State is later found to be in default, or is terminated or withdraws from
665 the Compact, the Commission shall remain in existence and the Compact shall remain in effect
666 even if the number of Member States should be less than seven (7).
33 of 36

667 2. Member States enacting the Compact subsequent to the Charter Member States shall
668 be subject to the process set forth in section 9.C.24 to determine if their enactments are
669 materially different from the model Compact statute and whether they qualify for participation in
670 the Compact.
671 3. All actions taken for the benefit of the Commission or in furtherance of the purposes of
672 the administration of the Compact prior to the effective date of the Compact or the Commission
673 coming into existence shall be considered to be actions of the Commission unless specifically
674 repudiated by the Commission.
675 4. Any State that joins the Compact shall be subject to the Commission’s Rules and
676 bylaws as they exist on the date on which the Compact becomes law in that State. Any Rule that
677 has been previously adopted by the Commission shall have the full force and effect of law on the
678 day the Compact becomes law in that State.
679 B. Any Member State may withdraw from this Compact by enacting a statute repealing
680 that State’s enactment of the Compact.
681 1. A Member State’s withdrawal shall not take effect until one hundred eighty (180) days
682 after enactment of the repealing statute.
683 2. Withdrawal shall not affect the continuing requirement of the withdrawing State’s
684 State Licensing Authority to comply with the investigative and Adverse Action reporting
685 requirements of this Compact prior to the effective date of withdrawal.
686 3. Upon the enactment of a statute withdrawing from this Compact, a State shall
687 immediately provide notice of such withdrawal to all Licensees within that State.
34 of 36

688 Notwithstanding any subsequent statutory enactment to the contrary, such withdrawing State
689 shall continue to recognize all licenses granted pursuant to this Compact for a minimum of one
690 hundred eighty (180) days after the date of such notice of withdrawal.
691 C. Nothing contained in this Compact shall be construed to invalidate or prevent any
692 licensure agreement or other cooperative arrangement between a Member State and a non-
693 Member State that does not conflict with the provisions of this Compact.
694 D. This Compact may be amended by the Member States. No amendment to this
695 Compact shall become effective and binding upon any Member State until it is enacted into the
696 laws of all Member States.
697 Section 14. A. This Compact and the Commission’s rulemaking authority shall be
698 liberally construed so as to effectuate the purposes, and the implementation and administration of
699 the Compact. Provisions of the Compact expressly authorizing or requiring the promulgation of
700 Rules shall not be construed to limit the Commission’s rulemaking authority solely for those
701 purposes.
702 B. The provisions of this Compact shall be severable and if any phrase, clause, sentence
703 or provision of this Compact is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be contrary to the
704 constitution of any Member State, a State seeking participation in the Compact, or of the United
705 States, or the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or circumstance is held to
706 be unconstitutional by a court of competent jurisdiction, the validity of the remainder of this
707 Compact and the applicability thereof to any other government, agency, person or circumstance
708 shall not be affected thereby.
35 of 36

709 C. Notwithstanding section 14.B, the Commission may deny a State’s participation in the
710 Compact or, in accordance with the requirements of section 12, terminate a Member State’s
711 participation in the Compact, if it determines that a constitutional requirement of a Member State
712 is a material departure from the Compact. Otherwise, if this Compact shall be held to be contrary
713 to the constitution of any Member State, the Compact shall remain in full force and effect as to
714 the remaining Member States and in full force and effect as to the Member State affected as to all
715 severable matters.
716 Section 15. A. Nothing herein shall prevent or inhibit the enforcement of any other law of
717 a Member State that is not inconsistent with the Compact.
718 B. Any laws, statutes, regulations, or other legal requirements in a Member State in
719 conflict with the Compact are superseded to the extent of the conflict.
720 C. All permissible agreements between the Commission and the Member States are
721 binding in accordance with their terms.”
