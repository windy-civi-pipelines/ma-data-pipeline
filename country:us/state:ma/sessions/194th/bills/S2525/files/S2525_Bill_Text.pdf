specified, are hereby appropriated from the General Fund unless specifically designated otherwise, subject to the
laws regulating the disbursement of public funds and the approval thereof for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2026.
All sums appropriated under this act, including supplemental and deficiency budgets, shall be expended in a
manner reflecting and encouraging a policy of nondiscrimination and equal opportunity for members of minority

commission or division receiving funds under this act shall take affirmative steps to ensure equality of opportunity
in the internal affairs of state government and in their relations with the public, including those persons and
organizations doing business with the commonwealth. Each agency, board, department, commission and division
of the commonwealth, in spending appropriated sums and discharging its statutory responsibilities, shall adopt
measures to ensure equal opportunity in the areas of hiring, promotion, demotion or transfer, recruitment, layoff
or termination, rates of compensation, in-service or apprenticeship training programs and all other terms and
conditions of employment.
SECTION 1A. In accordance with Articles LXIII and CVII of the Articles of Amendment to the Constitution of
the Commonwealth and section 6D of chapter 29 of the General Laws, it is hereby declared that the amounts of
revenue set forth in this section, by source, for the respective funds of the commonwealth for the fiscal year ending
June 30, 2026 are necessary and sufficient to provide the means to defray the appropriations and expenditures
from such funds for fiscal year 2026 as set forth and authorized in this act. The comptroller shall keep a distinct
account of actual receipts from each such source by each such fund to furnish the executive office for
administration and finance and the house and senate committees on ways and means with quarterly statements

SECTION 3. Notwithstanding any general or special law to the contrary, for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2026
the distribution of unrestricted general government aid to cities and towns of the balance of the State Lottery and
Gaming Fund, as paid from the General Fund in accordance with clause (c) of the second paragraph of section 35
of chapter 10 of the General Laws, and additional funds from the General Fund and the Gaming Local Aid Fund,
shall be $1,337,505,369 and shall be apportioned to cities and towns in accordance with this section.
For fiscal year 2026 the total amounts to be distributed and paid to each city, town and regional school district
from item 7061-0008 of section 2 and item 1596-2450 of section 2F, shall be as set forth in the following lists. If
there is conflict between the language of this section and the distribution listed below, the distribution below shall
control. The specified amounts distributed from said item 7061-0008 of said section 2 and said item 1596-2450
of said section 2F shall be deemed in full satisfaction of the amounts due under chapter 70 of the General Laws.
For fiscal year 2026, a district’s school aid shall be calculated according to the provisions of said chapter 70, as
most recently amended by Chapter 132 of the Acts of 2019, also known as the Student Opportunity Act. The
foundation budget category of “low-income enrollment” for the purpose of calculating foundation enrollment
shall be determined by financial eligibility for certain federal programs, as defined by the provisions of section 2
of said chapter 70, and including a number of students identified and approved as low income through the
supplemental claiming system established and posted by the department for that purpose, as well as students
identified and approved as homeless for purposes of calculating the McKinney-Vento homelessness grant
program administered by the department, consistent with the conditions provided for in said section 2. Provided
further, that the assumed special education enrollment percentage for vocational school students shall be set at
4.97 per cent and the assumed special education enrollment percentage for non-vocational school students shall
be set at 3.97 per cent.
The per-pupil rates for the employee benefits and fixed charges allotments shall be adjusted by the foundation

of students designated as English learners or low-income; provided, however, that for low-income students the
amount of the foundation increment shall be determined by the low-income group into which each district is
assigned. Foundation budget rates for employee benefits and fixed charges, guidance and psychological services,
special education out-of-district tuition, English learners and low-income students shall be increased by five-
sixths of the gap between the rates used in fiscal year 2021 and the rates established in tables 1 and 2 of section 3
of said chapter 70, consistent with adjustments prescribed in said section 3 and set at the rates identified in the
table below. Required local contributions shall be calculated pursuant to said chapter 70; provided, that municipal
revenue growth factors shall be calculated in a manner consistent with calculations made in fiscal year 2025;

foundation budget.
The department of elementary and secondary education shall not consider health care costs for retired teachers to
be part of net school spending for any district in which such costs were not considered part of net school spending
in fiscal year 1994 and for any district that has not accepted the provisions of section 260 of chapter 165 of the
acts of 2014; provided, however, that any district for whom such costs are not so considered shall have included

as part of net school spending an amount equal to the increase in the foundation budget for the district associated
with health care costs of retired teachers.
No payments to cities, towns or counties maintaining an agricultural school under this section shall be made after
November 30 of the fiscal year until the commissioner of revenue certifies acceptance of the prior fiscal year’s
annual financial reports submitted under section 43 of chapter 44 of the General Laws. Advance payments shall
be made for some or all of periodic local reimbursement or assistance programs to any city, town, regional school
district or independent agricultural school that demonstrates an emergency cash shortfall, as certified by the
commissioner of revenue and approved by the secretary of administration and finance, under guidelines
established by the secretary.

109 privacy, trade secret or anticompetitive considerations. The confidential information and
110 documents shall not be public records and shall be exempt from disclosure under clause Twenty-
111 sixth of section 7 of chapter 4 or under chapter 66.

140 more than 15 per cent per wholesale acquisition cost unit during any 12-month period; or (ii) a
141 brand-name drug, generic drug or biosimilar drug with a significant price increase as determined
142 by the commission during any 12-month period; provided, however, that a significant price

162 deposited into the Prescription Drug Cost Assistance Trust Fund established in section 2LLLLLL
163 of chapter 29.
164 (d) The commission may promulgate regulations to implement this section.
165 SECTION 14. Said chapter 6D is hereby further amended by adding the following 2
166 sections:-
167 Section 24. (a) As used in this section, the following words shall have the following
168 meanings unless the context clearly requires otherwise:
169 “Eligible drug”, (i) a brand name drug or biologic, not including a biosimilar, that has a
170 launch wholesale acquisition cost of $25,000 or more for a 1-year supply or full course of
171 treatment; (ii) a biosimilar drug that has a launch wholesale acquisition cost that is less than 15

172 per cent lower than the referenced brand biologic at the time the biosimilar is launched; (iii) a
173 generic drug that has a wholesale acquisition cost of $100 or more for a 30-day supply or full
174 course of treatment, for which the wholesale acquisition cost increased by 200 per cent or more
175 during the preceding 12 months; (iv) a public health essential drug, as defined in subsection (f)
176 of section 13 of chapter 17, with a significant price increase over a defined period of time as
177 determined by the commission by regulation or with a wholesale acquisition cost of $10,000 or
178 more for a 1-year supply or full course of treatment; (v) all drugs selected pursuant to section
179 17Z of chapter 32A, section 10Z of chapter 118E, section 47CCC of chapter 175, section 8DDD
180 of chapter 176A, section 4DDD of chapter 176B and section 4VV of chapter 176G; (vi) a brand
181 name, generic or biologic drug with a total aggregate annual spend by public and private payors
182 of $25 million or more; or (vii) other prescription drug products which, due to their cost or an
183 increase in their cost: (A) may have a significant negative impact on patient access, such as by
184 significantly contributing to high patient out-of-pocket costs compared to other drugs, increased
185 utilization management compared to other drugs, lack of coverage by payers or similar factors as
186 determined by the commission; or (B) may create significant affordability challenges for the
187 commonwealth’s health care system and patients, such as by contributing significantly to
188 increased premiums, costs to the commonwealth or patient out-of-pocket costs compared to other
189 drugs, by having a substantial impact on state programs involved in the provision of health care,
190 by affecting the ability of the state and other entities that contribute to the health care cost growth
191 benchmark to meet said benchmark or similar factors, as determined by the commission;
192 provided, however, that the commission shall promulgate regulations to establish the type of
193 prescription drug products classified under clause (vii) prior to classification of any such
194 prescription drug product under said clause (vii), and the commission may adjust the dollar
195 amounts in this definition from time to time for good cause including, but not limited to,
196 inflation.
197 “Manufacturer”, a pharmaceutical manufacturer of an eligible drug.

198 “Public health essential drug”, shall have the same meaning as in subsection (f) of section
199 13 of chapter 17.
200 (b)(1) The commission shall review: (i) the negative impact of eligible drug costs on
201 patient access, such as by significantly contributing to high patient out-of-pocket costs compared
202 to other drugs, increased utilization management compared to other drugs, lack of coverage by
203 payers or similar factors as determined by the commission; and (ii) the extent to which eligible
204 drug costs have created or likely will create affordability challenges for the state’s health care
205 system and patients, such as by contributing significantly to increased premiums, costs to the
206 state, or patient out-of-pocket costs compared to other drugs, by having a substantial impact on
207 state programs involved in the provision of health care, by affecting the ability of the state and
208 other entities that contribute to the health care cost growth benchmark to meet said benchmark or
209 similar factors, as determined by the commission; provided, however, that the commission shall
210 review the eligible drugs that the commission determines may have the most significant impact
211 to patients under clause (i) or may create the most significant affordability challenges under
212 clause (ii).
213 (2) In conducting a review of eligible drugs, the commission shall consider:
214 (i) available information about the relevant factors contributing to the price paid and
215 amount spent in the state for the drug, including the wholesale acquisition cost, change in price
216 as compared to the launch price, annual price increases over time, discounts, rebates or other
217 price concessions, utilization and utilization trends, aggregate annual spending in the state on the
218 drug and the impact of the drug’s cost on the state budget;
219 (ii) the average patient co-pay or other cost-sharing for the drug in the commonwealth;
220 (iii) whether the cost of the drug contributes to inequities in health care access or
221 outcomes;

222 (iv) the price and availability of therapeutic alternatives in the commonwealth;
223 (v) input from patients affected by the condition or disease treated by the drug and
224 individuals with medical or scientific expertise related to the condition or disease treated by the
225 drug;
226 (vi) input from other stakeholders, which may include, but shall not be limited to, patient
227 advocacy organizations, consumer advocacy organizations, providers, provider organizations and
228 payers; and
229 (vii) any other factors the commission deems relevant.
230 (3) In conducting a review of eligible drugs, the commission shall notify the
231 manufacturer that the commission is reviewing the manufacturer’s drug and shall provide the
232 manufacturer with the opportunity to provide relevant information about the drug’s pricing. The
233 commission may request relevant information from the manufacturer of said eligible drug and
234 from pharmacy benefit managers, payers, wholesalers, pharmacies, clinical experts, providers
235 and other persons or entities. The commission, to the extent feasible, shall collaborate with the
236 center to avoid collecting duplicative information and reduce the administrative burden on all
237 parties.
238 (c)(1) Using the records and information provided under subsection (b), available
239 information from the center, from an outside third party, from another agency or department
240 within the commonwealth or that is otherwise available to the commission or any of its
241 subdivisions, the commission shall identify a proposed value for eligible drugs the commission
242 has reviewed pursuant to subsection (b) and which the commission has determined have or likely
243 will have a significant impact on patient access or which have created or likely will create
244 significant affordability challenges for the state’s health care system or patients, as described in
245 clauses (i) and (ii) of paragraph (1) of subsection (b). In identifying proposed values for eligible

246 drugs, the commission may prioritize drugs based on the commission’s determination of the
247 significance of the drug cost’s negative impact on patient access or the extent to which the drug’s
248 cost has created or likely will create affordability challenges for the state’s health care system or
249 patients, as described in clauses (i) and (ii) of paragraph (1) of subsection (b) of this section.
250 (2) The commission shall base the proposed value on:
251 (i) the cost of delivering and administering the drug and other administrative costs related
252 to the production and delivery of the drug that the commission deems relevant;
253 (ii) the status of the drug on the drug shortage list published by the United States Food
254 and Drug Administration;
255 (iii) the drug’s status as an orphan drug;
256 (iv) information the commission collected pursuant to paragraph (2) of subsection (b) that
257 the commission deems relevant, including, but not limited to input from patients and
258 stakeholders; and
259 (v) other factors the commission deems relevant in determining a drug’s value.
260 (3) The commission shall not base its determination on the proposed value of the eligible
261 drug solely on the analysis or research of an outside third party and shall not employ a measure
262 or metric that assigns a reduced value to the life extension provided by a treatment based on a
263 pre-existing disability or chronic health condition of the individuals whom the treatment would
264 benefit. If the commission relies upon a third party to provide cost-effectiveness analysis or
265 research related to the proposed value of the eligible drug, such analysis or research shall also
266 include, but not be limited to: (i) a description of the methodologies and models used in the
267 analysis; (ii) any assumptions and potential limitations of research findings in the context of the
268 results; and (iii) outcomes for affected subpopulations that utilize the drug, including, but not

269 limited to, potential impacts on individuals of marginalized racial or ethnic groups and on
270 individuals with specific disabilities or health conditions who regularly utilize the eligible drug.
271 (d) If, after review of an eligible drug the commission determines that the cost of the
272 eligible drug, as determined by the commission, does not substantially exceed the proposed value
273 of the drug, the commission shall notify the manufacturer, in writing, of its determination and
274 shall evaluate other ways to mitigate the eligible drug’s cost in order to improve patient access to
275 the eligible drug and help address affordability challenges. For the purposes of this subsection, to
276 “substantially exceed” shall mean to exceed by not less than 15 per cent; provided, however, that
277 for good cause, the commission may determine that a drug’s cost does not substantially exceed
278 the proposed value even if the cost exceeds the value by more than 15 per cent; provided further,
279 that the commission shall adopt regulations defining good cause prior to making such a
280 determination. The commission may engage with stakeholders, including, but not limited to,
281 patients, patient advocacy organizations, consumer advocacy organizations, providers, provider
282 organizations and payers, to explore options for mitigating the cost of the eligible drug. Upon the
283 conclusion of a stakeholder engagement process under this subsection, the commission shall
284 issue recommendations on ways to reduce the cost of the eligible drug for the purpose of
285 improving patient access to the eligible drug and helping to address affordability challenges.
286 Recommendations may include but shall not be limited to: (i) an alternative payment plan or
287 methodology; (ii) a bulk purchasing program; (iii) co-payment, deductible, co-insurance or other
288 cost-sharing restrictions; (iv) risk-based solutions; and (v) public reporting of the drugs. The
289 recommendations shall be publicly posted on the commission’s website and provided to the
290 clerks of the house of representatives and senate, the joint committee on health care financing
291 and the house and senate committees on ways and means; provided, however, that the report
292 shall be published on the website of the commission.

293 (e) If, after review of an eligible drug, the commission determines that the cost of the
294 eligible drug, as determined by the commission, substantially exceeds the proposed value of the
295 drug, the commission shall notify and provide the manufacturer with an opportunity provide
296 further information related to the pricing of the eligible drug, the manufacturer’s reasons for the
297 pricing, and any actions the manufacturer has taken or will imminently take that have a high
298 likelihood of lowering the cost of the drug for units of the drugs that are dispensed or
299 administered to an individual in the state in person, by mail, or by other means. For the purposes
300 of this subsection, to “substantially exceed” shall mean to exceed by at least 15 per cent;
301 provided, however, that the commission may determine that a drug’s cost substantially exceeds
302 the proposed value even if the cost exceeds the value by less than 15 per cent if the commission
303 has good cause for making such a determination; and provided further, that the commission shall
304 adopt regulations defining good cause prior to making such a determination.
305 (f) The commission may revise the proposed value for an eligible drug based on the
306 information provided, if any, pursuant to subsection (e). Not later than 60 days after receiving
307 any information from the manufacturer under subsection (b) or (e), the commission shall publicly
308 issue a determination on whether the cost of an eligible drug, as determined by the commission,
309 substantially exceeds the commission’s proposed value of the drug. If the commission
310 determines that the cost of an eligible drug substantially exceeds the commission’s proposed
311 value of the drug, the commission shall confidentially notify the manufacturer, in writing, of its
312 determination and shall set an upper payment limit for the drug pursuant to section 25. For the
313 purposes of this subsection, to “substantially exceed” shall mean to exceed by not less than 15
314 per cent; provided, however, that, for good cause, the commission may determine that a drug’s
315 cost substantially exceeds the proposed value if the cost exceeds the value by less than 15 per
316 cent; and provided further, that the commission shall adopt regulations defining good cause prior
317 to making such a determination.

318 (g) Records disclosed by a manufacturer or other person or entity pursuant to this section,
319 if any, shall: (i) be accompanied by an attestation that all information provided is true and
320 correct; (ii) not be public records as defined under clause Twenty-sixth of section 7 of chapter 4
321 or chapter 66; and (iii) remain confidential; provided, however, that the commission may
322 produce reports summarizing any findings; provided further, that any such report shall not be in a
323 form that identifies specific prices charged for or rebate amounts associated with drugs by a
324 manufacturer or in a manner that is likely to compromise the financial, competitive or
325 proprietary nature of the information.
326 A request for further information made by the commission under subsection (e) or a
327 determination issued or written notification made by the commission under subsection (f) shall
328 not be public records as defined under said clause Twenty-sixth of said section 7 of said chapter
329 4 or said chapter 66.
330 In issuing public determinations under subsection (f), the commission shall not identify
331 specific prices charged for, or rebate amounts associated with, drugs by a manufacturer or in a
332 manner that is likely to compromise the financial, competitive or proprietary nature of the
333 information. Such prices or rebates shall not be public records as defined under said clause
334 Twenty-sixth of said section 7 of said chapter 4 or said chapter 66.
335 (h) The commission’s proposed value of an eligible drug and the commission’s
336 underlying analysis of the eligible drug shall not be used to determine whether any individual
337 patient meets prior authorization or utilization management criteria for the eligible drug. The
338 proposed value and underlying analysis shall not be the sole factor in determining whether a drug
339 is included in a formulary or whether the drug is subject to step therapy.
340 (i) The commission may request relevant information to implement this section from the
341 manufacturer of eligible drug and from pharmacy benefit managers, payers, wholesalers,

342 pharmacies, clinical experts, providers and other persons or entities; provided, however, that if a
343 manufacturer, pharmacy benefit manager, wholesaler or payer fails to timely comply with the

355 other provision in this section or sections 23 or 25 shall not impair the commission’s ability to

363 shall be the maximum amount that may be paid or billed for a prescription drug purchased or
364 reimbursed in any financial transaction under subsection (c).

365 (b) The upper payment limit shall be the proposed value for the eligible drug; provided,
366 however, that if the commission revised the proposed value pursuant to subsection (f) of section
367 24, the upper payment limit shall be the drug’s revised proposed value. The commission may set
368 an upper payment limit that is different than the proposed value for good cause; provided,
369 however, that the commission shall adopt regulations defining good cause prior to setting any
370 upper payment limit. The commission may annually raise a drug’s upper payment limit to

373 that includes a dispensing fee above the upper payment limit.
374 (c)(1) The upper payment limit shall apply:
375 (i) when an individual purchases a prescription drug from a provider located in the
376 commonwealth or a pharmacy licensed by the commonwealth and the drug is dispensed or
377 administered to an individual in the commonwealth in person, by mail or by other means;
378 provided, however, that if the person is insured, the amount the person pays, plus the amount the
379 person’s carrier, the commonwealth or entity acting on behalf of the commonwealth, including,
380 but not limited to the medical assistance program established under chapter 118E, or the
381 participating self-insured plan pays, shall not exceed the upper payment limit plus applicable

385 commonwealth purchases from a wholesaler or other entity a prescription drug that is dispensed
386 or administered to a person in the commonwealth in person, by mail or by other means;
387 (iii) when a carrier, a pharmacy benefits manager, the commonwealth or entity acting on
388 behalf of the commonwealth, including, but not limited to, the medical assistance program

389 established under chapter 118E, or a participating self-insured plan pays or reimburses a
390 pharmacy, provider or other entity for a prescription drug that is dispensed or administered to a
391 person in the commonwealth in person, by mail or by other means; provided, however, that the
392 amount the person pays for the drug, plus the amount the carrier, the commonwealth or entity
393 acting on behalf of the commonwealth, or the participating self-insured plan pays shall not
394 exceed the upper payment limit plus applicable dispensing fees; and
395 (iv) to any other transaction within the commonwealth’s jurisdiction to which the
396 commission determines is necessary to apply the upper payment limit to effectuate the purposes
397 of this section.
398 (2) For the purposes of this subsection, “carrier” shall have the same meaning as in
399 section 1 of chapter 176O.

401 issued a public determination pursuant to subsection (f) of section 24.
402 (e) A self-insured plan governed by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of
403 1974 may elect to be subject to the upper payment limits.
404 (f) The commission may suspend an upper payment limit if the commission determines
405 that there is a shortage of the drug in the commonwealth, unless the commission determines that
406 the shortage was caused by a manufacturer or the manufacturer’s agent due to the commission
407 establishing an upper payment limit for the drug.
408 (g) Any manufacturer or wholesaler that intends to withdraw from sale or distribution
409 within the commonwealth a drug for which the commission has established an upper payment
410 limit shall provide a notice of withdrawal in writing not less than 6 months before the withdrawal
411 to the commission, the commissioner of the division of insurance, the attorney general and any

412 entity in the commonwealth with which the manufacturer or wholesaler has a contract for the
413 sale or distribution of the drug. The commission shall assess a penalty not more than 1 year’s
414 worth of the manufacturer’s revenue attributable to use of the drug in the commonwealth, as
415 determined by the commission, if the commission determines that a manufacturer or wholesaler
416 failed to provide said notice. This subsection shall not apply in instances where the drug is being
417 withdrawn due to a recall or revocation of the drug’s approval by the United States Food and
418 Drug Administration or similar reasons as determined by the commission.
419 (h) Any savings that a carrier, a participating self-insured plan or the group insurance
420 commission generates due to the implementation of an upper payment limit shall be used to
421 reduce costs to consumers, prioritizing the reduction of premiums or out-of-pocket costs for
422 prescription drugs. Annually, each carrier, participating self-insured plan, the group insurance
423 commission and the division of medical assistance shall submit to the commission a report
424 describing the savings achieved as a result of implementing upper payment limits and how those
425 savings were used to reduce costs to consumers.

755 parents in lawful wedlock.
756 (d) If a person is born to parents not married to each other or if the person who gave birth
757 and such person’s spouse at the time of the birth or conception of the child complete an affidavit

833 spouse has been legally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction pursuant to the laws of
834 the commonwealth or by a court or administrative agency of competent jurisdiction under the
835 laws of another state or foreign country, or if the birth of a child is recorded as that of a child
836 whose parentage has been acknowledged by the person who gave birth and the other parent and
837 either parent rescinds the acknowledgment as provided in section 11 of chapter 209C or under
838 similar law of another state or foreign country, the birth record shall be amended to remove the
839 other parent’s information; provided, however, that:
840 (i) there has been a notarized rescission filed with the department of public health or a
841 judgment of nonparentage or judgment of divorce by a court under the laws of the

842 commonwealth and the court presents to the state registrar a certified copy of such judgment,

855 certificate of adoption or any such certified copy, shall correct the record of birth of the adopted
856 person. If such record or certified copy does not contain the facts required by this section relative
857 to the adopting parents for correcting such record, the local clerk or state registrar shall not
858 correct such record until they have received an affidavit signed and sworn to by the adopting
859 parents, or by the person adopted, furnishing such facts. If a person who was in the custody of
860 the department of children and families is adopted and the adopting parents surrender the person
861 back to the department, that person shall have the right to change the birth certificate back to that
862 person’s birth name.
863 (h) The local clerk or state registrar in receipt of an adoption record pursuant to this
864 section shall, on forms provided by the state registrar, complete an amended, corrected or
865 supplemented record of birth, death or marriage or acknowledgment or adjudication of
866 parentage. The original record of birth, death or marriage or acknowledgment or adjudication of
867 parentage and all returns and index entries in whatever format they are maintained shall be

868 identified as corrected, amended or supplemented. All documentary evidence, including
869 certificates of adoption or certified copies thereof, shall be sent to the state registrar for a
870 permanent filing. If the affidavit is initially submitted to the state registrar, the state registrar
871 shall forward to the local clerk of the municipality where the birth or death occurred, a certified
872 copy of the corrected, amended or supplemented record, noting the documentary evidence to
873 substantiate the affidavit, and the local clerk shall thereupon correct, amend or supplement the
874 record in the office of the clerk. If a copy of the record is sent to the local clerk of the
875 municipality where the parents resided at the time of birth or where the deceased lived at the
876 time of death, the state registrar shall forward to such local clerk a certified copy of the
877 corrected, amended or supplemented record, noting the documentary evidence to substantiate the
878 affidavit, and the local clerk shall thereupon correct, amend or supplement the record in the
879 office of the clerk. Reference to the record of the affidavit or such decree shall be made on the
880 margin of the original record. If the local clerk or state registrar furnishes a copy of such a
881 record, they shall certify to the facts contained therein as corrected, amended or supplemented.
882 Except as provided in this section, the local clerk or other official responsible for the keeping of
883 such records shall not release information contained in the original record except upon proper
884 judicial order or when requested by a person seeking their own birth or marriage record or by a
885 person whose official duties, in the opinion of the local clerk or state registrar, entitle them to the
886 information contained in the original record. Death records corrected, amended or supplemented
887 after January 1, 1996, as well as the affidavit of the party seeking the correction, amendment or
888 supplementation of the death record and all documentary evidence or related records submitted
889 in support of such affidavit, shall not be restricted, except for records or other items of
890 documentary evidence submitted in support of the affidavit which are: (i) considered medical
891 records for purposes of paragraph (c) of clause twenty-sixth of section 7 of chapter 4; (ii)
892 restricted by section 2A; or (iii) restricted by judicial order. If the original record has been
893 amended following adoption in accordance with this section, the local clerk or state registrar

894 shall issue information contained in the original record only upon receipt of an order of the
895 probate court for the county in which said adoption was granted or in accordance with section 2B
896 or, in the case of an adoption granted outside the commonwealth, upon receipt of an order of the
897 probate court for the county in which the birth of the adopted person occurred or in accordance
898 with section 2B, instructing said clerk or state registrar to release the information contained in
899 such original record. Evidence contained in the adoption record of a parent’s willingness to
900 provide information about their identity to the adopted person shall, except in extraordinary
901 circumstances, be considered sufficient evidence to warrant the granting of an order for release
902 of the information contained in the birth certificate registered prior to adoption. If the corrected,
903 amended or supplemented record is that of a person who has acquired the status of a marital
904 child or whose record has been amended through an adoption decree or whose record has been
905 amended through addition of a named parent or whose record has been amended pursuant to
906 subsection (e), the local clerk or state registrar shall not indicate on such copy that the record has
907 been corrected, amended or supplemented.
908 (i) An affidavit or a certified copy of the record of any other municipality or of a written
909 statement made at the time by any person since deceased required by law to furnish evidence of
910 said affidavit, may be the basis for completing the record of a birth, marriage or death not
911 containing all the facts required by section 1. No record of birth shall be established for a
912 deceased person more than 5 years after the date of death nor shall a record of marriage be
913 established if both spouses are deceased, except as provided by sections 13A, 13B and 13C.
914 (j) Upon the adoption of an abandoned child or foundling within the commonwealth the
915 facts of whose birth are not recorded pursuant to sections 1 or 1A, or, if such facts are recorded,
916 cannot otherwise be identified, the state registrar, upon receipt of: (i) an affidavit executed by the
917 adopting parents setting forth all material facts known concerning said abandoned child or
918 foundling; and (ii) an order issued by the commissioner of children and families determining the
919 most probable date of birth of such abandoned child or foundling shall record the facts relative to

920 the birth pursuant to sections 1 or 1A. In addition to any other certificates or copies of records
921 authorized by law, the commissioner may, upon application, issue certificates setting forth the
922 facts concerning an abandoned child or foundling appearing in any records of the department of
923 children and families if no certificate of birth is recorded in the municipality where the
924 abandoned child or foundling was born or the state registry.
925 (k) If an application to correct or amend a record of birth, marriage or death or a delayed
926 record of a birth, marriage or death is approved, the applicant shall pay a fee as determined by
927 the secretary of administration and finance.
928 (l) Upon application of both parties to a marriage, the record of such marriage shall be
929 amended to remove the sex of either or both parties to the marriage and, if applicable, to change
930 the name of either or both parties to the marriage. Such application shall be made to the state
931 registrar or local clerk of the city or town where the marriage record was issued and shall
932 include: (i) an affidavit executed by both parties to the marriage on a form provided by the state
933 registrar attesting to their concurrence that the record be amended to remove sex of either or both
934 parties; and (ii) if applicable, a request by a party to the marriage for a change of name along
935 with evidence of the party’s legal change of name.

937 appearing in the 2022 Official Edition, is hereby amended by adding the following sentence:-

941 by section 13 of chapter 206 of the acts of 2024, is hereby further amended by striking out
942 subsections (a) and (b) and inserting in place thereof the following 2 subsections:-
943 (a) A tax is hereby imposed upon the transfer of the estate of each person dying on or
944 after January 1, 1997 who, at the time of death, was a resident of the commonwealth. The
945 amount of the tax shall be equal to the credit for state death taxes that would have been allowable

946 to a decedent’s estate as computed under section 2011 of the Code, as in effect on December 31,
947 2000, hereinafter referred to as the “credit”. The credit shall be determined based on the value of
948 the federal gross estate after such estate is increased by the value of any property: (i) not
949 included in the federal gross estate; (ii) in which the decedent had at death a qualifying income
950 interest for life described in subsection (c) of section 3A; (iii) for which a deduction was allowed
951 for Massachusetts estate tax purposes with respect to the transfer of such property to the
952 decedent; and (iv) which is not real or tangible personal property located outside of the
953 commonwealth at the time of death. If the federal gross estate of a person includes real or
954 tangible personal property located outside of the commonwealth at the time of death, the credit
955 shall be determined based on the value of the federal gross estate after such estate is reduced by
956 the value of such real or tangible personal property located outside of the commonwealth and
957 increased by the value of any property: (A) not included in the federal gross estate; (B) in which
958 the decedent had at death a qualifying income interest for life described in subsection (c) of
959 section 3A; (C) for which a deduction was allowed for Massachusetts estate tax purposes with
960 respect to the transfer of such property to the decedent; and (D) which is not real or tangible
961 personal property located outside of the commonwealth at the time of death; provided, however,
962 that for the purposes of calculating the federal taxable estate, no deduction shall be allowed that
963 is attributable to such real or tangible personal property located outside of the commonwealth.
964 (b) A tax is hereby imposed upon the transfer of real property situated in this
965 commonwealth and upon tangible personal property having an actual situs in this commonwealth
966 of every person who at the time of their death was not a resident of this commonwealth. The
967 amount of this tax is the amount of the credit calculated based upon a federal gross estate that is
968 equal to the sum of: (i) the value of the estate’s real or tangible personal property located in the
969 commonwealth; and (ii) the value of any real or tangible property: (A) not included in the federal
970 gross estate; (B) in which the decedent had at death a qualifying income interest for life
971 described in subsection (c) of section 3A; (C) for which a deduction was allowed for

972 Massachusetts estate tax purposes with respect to the transfer of such property to the decedent;
973 and (D) which is not located outside of the commonwealth at the time of death. Under this
974 subsection, for the purposes of calculating the federal taxable estate, no deduction shall be
975 allowed that is attributable to property other than such real or tangible personal property located
976 in the commonwealth.

1142 SECTION 58. Said chapter 119 is hereby further amended by inserting after section 23C
1143 the following section:-
1144 Section 23D. (a) For the purposes of this section, the following words shall have the

1146 “Benefits”, (i) Supplemental Security Income benefits under Title XVI of the Social
1147 Security Act; (ii) Retirement, Survivors or Disability Insurance benefits under Title II of the

1151 (b) Not more than 60 days after a child is committed to the custody of the department
1152 including, but not limited to, placement in foster care under a voluntary placement agreement or
1153 court-ordered custody arrangement, the department shall make all reasonable efforts to identify
1154 whether the child is receiving or may be eligible to receive benefits. In reviewing eligibility, the
1155 department shall consult with the parents and other individuals who may have information about
1156 the child’s eligibility. If the department determines, or has cause to believe, that the child may be
1157 eligible for benefits, it shall apply for benefits on the child’s behalf. If the agency administering
1158 such benefits denies the application, the department may appeal the decision as permitted by the
1159 agency administering the benefits. The department shall review cases of children in foster care
1160 annually to determine whether the child may have become eligible for benefits after the initial
1161 assessment determined them to be ineligible or whether the child may be eligible for new
1162 benefits after the initial assessment. The department shall seek federal foster care reimbursement
1163 for a child only if such reimbursement will not impact the child’s eligibility for benefits or the
1164 dollar amount of benefits.
1165 (c) The department may apply to be the representative payee or fiduciary of a child under
1166 its care and custody if the child is already receiving benefits prior to entering the department’s
1167 custody. The department may also apply to be the representative payee or fiduciary if the
1168 department is applying for benefits for the child. The department shall consider whether applying
1169 to become the child’s representative payee or fiduciary under this section will undermine the
1170 goal of reunification and not be in the child’s best interests.

1171 (d) The department shall provide timely notice to counsel for a child in its care and
1172 custody and the counsel for the parent, parents or legal guardian or guardians of the child of: (i)
1173 the department’s submission of an application for benefits on the child’s behalf; (ii) the

1175 (iii) the decision of an agency received by the department regarding benefits including denial,
1176 termination or reduction in benefits; (iv) the department’s decision on whether to appeal an

1178 benefits eligibility determination; and (vi) the department’s receipt of any notice of an eligibility
1179 redetermination.

1184 information available to the child’s counsel electronically or by other means. The accounting

1187 maintained on behalf of the child; (iii) any amounts deducted by the department and the reasons
1188 for the deductions; and (iv) information regarding all the child’s assets and resources, including
1189 benefits, insurance, cash assets, trust accounts and earnings if such assets or resources are
1190 controlled by the department. The department shall provide such accounting information to the
1191 court at permanency hearings, at other court proceedings, as necessary, or upon request.
1192 (f) The department shall not use a child’s benefits to reimburse the commonwealth for the
1193 child’s placement in foster care if the department is the child’s representative payee or fiduciary.
1194 The department shall ensure that if the child is receiving supplemental security income benefits
1195 under Title XVI of the Social Security Act, any funds retained on the child’s behalf are kept in a

1196 manner that does not exceed any federal asset or resource limit that would affect the child’s
1197 eligibility to continue receiving such benefits. Benefits held by the department as a representative
1198 payee or fiduciary may be spent on the child’s unmet needs, which would not ordinarily be
1199 funded by another source, subject to program rules for the use of such benefits, or otherwise
1200 conserved for the child. For a child who is a recipient of supplemental security income or other
1201 federal means-tested benefits with an asset or resource limit, the department shall conserve any
1202 funds that are above the federal asset or resource limits for such benefits in an Achieving a Better
1203 Life Experience (ABLE) account, authorized by 26 U.S.C. 529A, as amended or another account
1204 for the child determined not to interfere with federal asset or resource limits for any other federal
1205 means-tested benefit program. For a child who is not receiving supplemental security income or
1206 other federal means-tested benefits with an asset or resource limit, the department shall place
1207 excess funds in an interest-bearing account or other savings or investment vehicle for the benefit
1208 of the child. The department shall keep retroactive benefits received if the department is the
1209 child’s representative payee or fiduciary as required by the program rules of the agency
1210 administering such benefits.
1211 (g) The department shall take steps to conserve the benefits of children under its care and
1212 custody who are receiving benefits to assist them in the transition to adulthood and living
1213 independently. The department shall establish accounts as specified in subsection (f) in
1214 conserving a child’s benefits. The department shall work actively with the agency administering
1215 such benefits and the child to ensure that when the child leaves foster care, becomes eligible for
1216 direct payment or another representative payee is identified, all payments of benefits or
1217 conserved funds will be: (i) returned to the agency following program rules; or (ii) upon
1218 agreement by the agency, if necessary, transferred to the child or to a new representative payee
1219 or fiduciary.

1220 (h) The department shall provide a child under its care and custody who is not less than
1221 14 years old and the child’s legal counsel with ongoing financial information regarding the
1222 eligibility for benefits, as well as the existence, amount, availability, past use and limitations of
1223 funds conserved for the child; provided, however, that such information shall be tailored to the
1224 individual child based on age and other factors. For a youth not less than 17 years of age,
1225 financial information shall also include basic guidance on and assistance with understanding
1226 budgeting and money management, including checking and savings accounts, tailored to the
1227 youth.
1228 (i) The department shall provide each child under its care and custody who has attained
1229 the age of 14 years with ongoing financial literacy training and support and tailored to the child

1234 or training; (ix) long term asset-building; and (x) available community and agency services.
1235 Financial literacy resources concerning the use of conserved funds shall also be made available
1236 to all parents, guardians and adoptive parents who gain access to funds conserved by the
1237 department.
1238 (j) Annually, the department shall submit a report to the senate and house committees on
1239 ways and means, the joint committee on children, families and persons with disabilities, the
1240 clerks of the senate and house of representative and the secretary of administration and finance.
1241 The report shall include: (i) the numbers of children in the department’s care and custody
1242 receiving benefits for which the department is the representative payee or fiduciary; (ii) the
1243 numbers of children in the department’s care or custody who are receiving SSI, RSDI or other
1244 federal benefits; (iii) the dollar amount of benefits being conserved by the department; (iv) the

1245 number and type of accounts established by the department on behalf of such children; and (v) to
1246 the extent such data is available, the number of children in the department’s care or custody: (A)

1248 days of being committed to the department’s custody, and if not, the date of the screening and
1249 reason for the delay; (B) who were already receiving benefits after screening; and (C) for whom
1250 the department submitted applications for benefits, by type of application, and the outcome of
1251 those applications, including the number of appeals filed; provided, however, that if such data is
1252 not available, the department shall provide information regarding its ongoing efforts to gather
1253 and report upon such information.
1254 (k) The department shall continue to administer the benefits of young adults aged 18 to
