In order to assist the House and the Senate in their: (1) consideration and enactment of new
legislation and modifications of existing laws, when either are deemed to be appropriate; (2)
evaluation of the effectiveness and administration of laws and programs previously enacted; and
(3) appraisal of the conditions and circumstances which may indicate the desirability of enacting
new legislation, the various joint committees shall have the following oversight responsibilities:

administration, execution and effectiveness of those laws, or parts of law, the subject matter of
which is within the jurisdiction of that committee, the administrative regulations adopted to
implement those laws, and those state agencies or entities having responsibilities for the
administration and execution of such laws;
(ii) in carrying out these review and study activities, each committee shall determine whether
such laws, administrative regulations and programs under those laws are being implemented in
accordance with the intent of the General Court and whether such laws, administrative
regulations and programs should be continued, curtailed or eliminated;
(iii) each committee shall also review and study any conditions and circumstances which may
indicate the necessity or desirability of enacting new legislation within the jurisdiction of that
committee, regardless of whether any matter has been introduced on that subject, and shall, on a
continuing basis, undertake research on matters within the jurisdiction of that committee.
Committees shall coordinate oversight activities, under the direction of the presiding officers of
both branches, to achieve the maximum objectives of clauses (i), (ii) and (iii).

their respective branch and appoint a chair to investigate and study any matter referred to said
subcommittee that originated in their branch. Not less than 10 per cent of a Senate or House
subcommittee’s members shall be from the minority party. Chairs of subcommittees shall not be
considered chairs under section 9B of chapter 3 of the General Laws. A subcommittee may, upon
completion of an investigation and study, report the results of the investigation and study
together with legislation, if any, by filing the same with the appointing chair of the joint
committee.

accredited education institution or employees or grantees of other non-profit organizations under
section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code may receive compensation from such
organization, according to that organization’s regular program of providing such compensation
for temporary governmental or public service employment. A temporary employee’s Senate or
House supervisor shall establish the employee’s total compensation, shall verify that the sum of
the employee’s state compensation, if any, and that any outside compensation the employee is to
receive under this rule would not exceed this total compensation, and shall file the written terms

1A. All meetings of joint committees acting concurrently, Senate and House standing
committees, special committees of the Senate and House of Representatives, and joint special
committees and committees of conference on the disagreeing votes of the 2 branches shall be
open to the public, unless a majority shall vote otherwise; provided, however, that no such vote
shall be in order at the first duly noticed public meeting of a committee of conference on the
disagreeing votes of the 2 branches. [Adopted July 17, 1973. Amended July 18, 1974; Feb. 12,
2009.]
1B. A joint standing committee shall hold a public hearing on each matter referred to it in each
legislative session. [Adopted June 3, 1985; Amended Feb. 12, 2009.]
1C (1). All joint standing committees shall schedule committee hearings and executive sessions
upon agreement of the chairs and so as not to conflict, to the extent feasible, with the schedules
of other committees and, to the extent feasible, the day of the week and times during that day set
aside for formal sessions by the respective branches.
Beginning October 1, 2025, and after the posting of a schedule of hearing dates, agreed upon by
the chairs, for the remainder of the full legislative session, the chair of each branch shall record
the attendance of their respective members during committee hearings as “Present”, “Not
Present”, or “Hearing conflicts with a legislative session, hearing, conference committee or
commission meeting under joint rule 29A”. A member who is not present due to military service,
a medical emergency, or other specified reason as agreed to by the rules of the joint committee,
shall have such reason noted on the recorded attendance. The chair of each branch shall maintain
the records of the committee attendance of their respective members for the duration of the
legislative session and shall make such records available to the public alongside the livestream of
the hearing archived on said website pursuant to paragraph (3). Attendance shall be defined as
having been present either in person or remotely at a portion of the hearing. Attendance shall not
be taken if the date, time and location of the hearing were not shared with all committee
4 of 34

members at least 10 days prior to the hearing or if the schedule of hearing dates has not been
posted pursuant to rule 1D.
(2) The schedule of committee hearings shall designate which branch will preside over each
hearing, and the chairs shall ensure, to the extent practicable, that each branch presides over an
equal number of hearings. The committee staff of the branch presiding over the hearing shall,
unless otherwise agreed to by the chairs, be responsible for the administrative work necessary to
conduct the hearing, including, but not limited to, securing a hearing location, arranging for the
publication of the agenda and instructions for public participation, and processing the individuals
seeking to testify at the hearing either physically or remotely. Prior to the hearing, the staff of
each branch shall ensure that a plain-language summary of each bill to be heard by their
respective branches is available on the official website of the General Court.
(3) All hearings of joint standing committees shall be conducted in-person with the option of
remote participation available to the public and to members of the General Court, unless not
allowed by the rules of the branch to which the member belongs. All joint standing committees,
in the conduct of their hearings, shall utilize, to the extent practicable, online platforms or
systems that allow for synchronous, audio-visual communication between the members of the
committee and individuals offering testimony remotely. All hearings of joint standing
committees shall be publicly livestreamed on the official website of the General Court which
shall display and transmit, in real-time, the audio-visual attributes of public testimony offered
remotely; provided further, that said livestream shall be archived on the official website of the
General Court for the duration of the legislative session. Any member of the General Court may
offer remote testimony before joint standing committees. The chairs of the joint standing
committees may prioritize the testimony of those physically present at the hearing location and
may allow individuals participating in-person a greater amount of time to testify than those
participating remotely. All notices of hearings of joint standing committees issued pursuant to
Joint Rule 1D at which public testimony is being solicited shall include instructions on how to
offer testimony both in-person and remotely.
1D. All meetings of joint standing committees, and special joint committees of the Senate and
House of Representatives, and joint special committees shall be open to the public, and any

executive session, as provided herein.
All joint standing committees shall, not later than 3 weeks from appointment, determine a
schedule for committee hearings to be held from the beginning of the first annual session through
the first Wednesday in December in said session. These committee schedules shall be submitted
to the Clerks of the Senate and House of Representatives who shall cause them to be published
on the official website of the General Court. Establishment of such schedules shall not preclude
joint standing committees from scheduling additional hearings or meetings as needed.
No executive session shall be held until after the committee has first convened in an open session
for which notice has been given, the presiding officer has stated the purpose of the executive
session, a majority of the committee members present has voted to go into executive session, the
vote of each member has been recorded on a roll call vote, and the presiding officer has stated
before the executive session if the committee will reconvene after the executive session. The
records of all such roll calls shall be kept in the offices of the committee for the duration of the
General Court during which said vote was recorded, and the committee shall cause the record of
5 of 34

such roll call to be available on the official website of the General Court within 48 hours of such
roll call.
All joint standing committees, and special joint committees of the Senate and House of
Representatives, shall notify the Sergeant-at-Arms of the time, place and agenda of all public
hearings and executive sessions. Notification to the Sergeant-at-Arms for public hearings
conducted shall not be less than 10 days prior to the time of such meetings.
Said agenda and docket of bills to be heard may only be amended upon agreement of the chairs
and upon posting notice of such amendment more than 72 hours from the time of such hearing.
The 10 day requirement shall be suspended in an emergency only after all reasonable efforts
have been made to contact all committee members and upon a recorded vote of at least a
majority of the members of each branch appointed to the committee, but not less than two-thirds
of the members of each branch voting.
If public testimony is being solicited, agendas shall include: (i) an electronic mail address and
physical mail address for the submission of testimony, (ii) instructions on how the public may
participate remotely, and (iii) the committee reporting deadline under Joint Rule 10 for the
matters being heard. The Sergeant-at-Arms shall notify the Clerks, who shall inform all members
electronically and publish such information on the official website of the General Court
whenever practicable.
Committees shall make written testimony received by the committee publicly available;
provided, however, that the committee shall adopt rules relative to the public availability of
written testimony received by the committee and such rules shall contain limitations on the
sharing of testimony that is obscene or that includes sensitive personal information or
information that may jeopardize the health, wellness or safety of the testifier or others. The rules
relative to the public availability of written testimony adopted by the committee shall be
disclosed in the hearing agendas and shall inform testifiers that their written testimony may be
made publicly available by the committee.
Nothing contained in this rule shall prohibit a joint standing committee or special joint
committee of the Senate and the House of Representatives from taking appropriate action
including, but not limited to, the exclusion of a person from a committee meeting in order to
prevent the disruption of or interference with committee proceedings. All meetings of joint
standing committees, and special joint committees of the Senate and House of Representatives,
shall be limited to no more than 50 bills to be discussed in a hearing, unless it can be determined
that all of the bills being considered are of the same subject matter.
A meeting of a committee may be recorded by a person in attendance by means of a recorder or
any other means of audio/visual reproduction except when a meeting is held in executive session;
provided, that a person seeking to record a meeting of a committee notifies the chairs of the
committee prior to commencing such recording; and provided further that during such recording
there is no interference with the conduct of the meeting.
The chairs of each committee shall preserve decorum and order during each committee hearing.
Persons attending hearings shall be required to maintain electronic and communication devices
on silent mode. The use of visual aids including, without limitation, posters, displays, or charts
shall be permitted only upon approval of the chairs.

At any time after a matter has had a hearing, a chair of a committee may initiate a vote thereon if
the matter is filed in the branch of said chair; provided, however, a co-chair shall notify their co-
chair that a vote shall be taken as a courtesy prior to the vote. Said vote shall be taken from each
member of the branch of said chair, and if a majority of the members of said branch voting on
the matter vote in support of the matter, then the matter shall be reported favorably and referred
to the branch of origination. The Senate chair and the Senate members of the committee shall
have no authority or ability to impede the vote on a bill in the committee that was filed in the
House, and the House chair and the House members shall have no authority or ability to impede
the vote on a bill in the committee that was filed in the Senate
Notwithstanding the previous paragraph, money bills filed in the Senate, constitutional
amendments filed in the House, and any matters not filed by a member of the General Court,
including, but not limited to, matters filed by the Governor and other constitutional officers, shall
have a hearing and a vote scheduled upon agreement of the co-chairs of the committee. Said vote
shall be taken from each member of the committee and if a majority of the members of the
committee voting on the matter vote in support of the matter, then the bill shall be reported
favorably and, unless otherwise agreed to by the chairs, referred to the branch in which the
matter was originally introduced except that reports on money bills shall be made to the House
and reports on constitutional amendments shall be made to the Senate. Bills engrossed by one
branch, after being read in the opposite branch and subsequently referred to a joint committee,
shall be voted on by members of the branch that made the referral, notwithstanding the branch
where the matter was originally filed.
A chair of the committee shall provide to the members of their branch on the committee a
comprehensive summary and redrafted text, if any, of each matter prior to a vote thereon. Any
vote of a committee on a matter shall be taken by roll call or electronic poll of each member of
the branch calling the vote; provided, however, that the committee shall cause the record of such
roll call or electronic poll to be available on the official website of the General Court within 48
hours of such roll call [Adopted June 3, 1985. Amended June 12, 1995; Feb. 20, 2007; Mar. 14,

to health care to evaluate the appropriateness and fiscal effect of such legislation. A matter
within the jurisdiction of said committee may, if appropriate, initially be referred to another joint
standing committee sharing jurisdiction of the subject-matter. Any matter reported favorably by
such joint standing committee shall be referred to the joint committee on Health Care Financing;
provided, however, that notwithstanding any rule to the contrary, any such matter so reported
shall not be read a first time in the branch in which the report was received. The next favorable
report on any such matter, if made by a joint committee, shall be made in accordance with Joint
Rule 1D. Such next favorable report shall be considered the first reading. The branch of origin
for any such bill so reported shall be the branch receiving such favorable report.

Care Financing when reporting on bills shall include a fiscal note prepared under section 3A of
chapter 29 of the General Laws, showing the estimated cost or the fiscal effect of the proposed
legislation, if, in the opinion of said committee, such cost or fiscal effect exceeds the sum of

Financing with a fiscal effect of less than $100,000 shall not be referred, under the rules, to the

Commonwealth. The committee shall periodically review and hold open public hearings,
accepting oral and written testimony on the status of the bonds and notes of the Commonwealth,
including (1) general obligation debt; (2) dedicated income tax debt; and (3) special obligation

bonds for such purpose shall, prior to its reference to the committee on Ways and Means, be
referred to the committee on Bonding, Capital Expenditures and State Assets for report on its
relationship to the finances of the Commonwealth. A measure may initially be referred to
another joint committee with jurisdiction over the subject matter before being referred to the
committee on Bonding, Capital Expenditures and State Assets; provided, however, that
notwithstanding any rule to the contrary, any such matter so reported shall not be read a first time
in the branch in which the report was received. The next favorable report on any such matter by
the committee on Bonding, Capital Expenditures and State Assets shall be considered the first
reading. The branch of origin for any such bill so reported shall be the branch receiving such
favorable report.
The provisions of Joint Rule 4 shall apply to all matters referred to the joint committee on
Bonding, Capital Expenditures and State Assets, except that where constitutionally prohibited.

waived notice. In case a bill or resolve is reported upon such a petition, after proof of such
waiver of notice, this fact shall be set forth in the report of the committee. When an adverse
report is made by a committee, on account of failure to give the required notice, no bill or resolve
shall be substituted for such report, nor shall such report be recommitted or referred to another

earlier than 90 days after it has become law. Procedure shall be otherwise under the joint rules
and the rules of the Senate and the House of Representatives. [Adopted Feb. 21, 1919. Amended

in the Journal of the respective branches, with an adverse report under this rule; and shall then be
placed on file in the office of the Clerk of the Senate. For further information of the members of
the Senate and House of Representatives, the respective Clerks shall also place all such matters
under a separate heading in the Calendar of each branch, as soon as is practicable. In each branch
the report shall be read and forthwith placed on file; and no further legislative action shall be
taken on the measure unless consideration in joint session is called for by vote of either branch,

an amendment to the Constitution made by the Governor or contained in a report authorized to
be made to the General Court may report on the recommendation a proposal for a legislative
18 of 34

amendment, which shall be deemed to have been introduced by the member of the Senate who
reports for the committee; and the procedure as regards reporting, filing and subsequent action
shall be that provided for legislative amendments by this rule. Or the joint committee may report
ought not to pass for the reason that no legislation is necessary or that the recommendation ought
not to pass; and in such cases the usual procedure as regards similar reports by joint committees
shall be followed. If such an adverse report is amended in the Senate by substituting a proposal
for a legislative amendment, notice of the Senate’s action shall be sent to the House and said
proposal, together with the official papers relating to the subject, shall be in the custody of the
Clerk of the Senate; and if said report is so amended in the House, the proposal, duly endorsed,
together with the other papers, shall be sent to the Senate for its information and shall be kept in
the custody of its Clerk. No further legislative action shall be taken in either branch on a proposal
so substituted unless consideration in joint session is called for under the Constitution. If either
branch calls for the consideration of any proposal in joint session, notice of its action shall be
sent to the other branch; and it shall then be the duty of the Senate and the House of
Representatives to arrange for the holding of the joint session not later than the second
Wednesday in May. Subject to the requirements of the Constitution, joint sessions or
continuances of joint sessions of the 2 branches to consider proposals for specific amendments to
the Constitution, and all rules or procedures, shall be determined only by concurrent votes of the
2 branches. The rules relative to joint conventions shall apply to the joint sessions of the 2
houses. [Adopted Feb. 21, 1919. Amended March 30, 1921; April 11, 1935; Jan. 12, 1939; Jan.

Court present and voting, the General Court not having prorogued within 60 days from the date
of presentation by the Governor, the plan shall be approved and shall take effect as provided by
Article LXXXVII of the Amendments to the Constitution.
Within 7 days of the expiration of the 60 days from the date of presentation of said plan by the
Governor, unless the question has already been decided, the Clerks of the Senate and House of
Representatives shall place the plan in the Orders of the Day; and no motions except the motions
to take a recess, to adjourn, and previous question, or to close debate at a specified time, shall be
in order.
No such reorganization plan presented to the General Court shall be subject to change or
amendment before expiration of such 60 days. [Adopted June 13, 1967; Amended March 27,

Court, are filed with their respective Clerks, such Clerks shall forthwith notify all the members
of their respective branches to assemble at the State House in Boston, on said date at the time so
specified. When so assembled, the first business to be taken up shall be the question of the
necessity of so assembling, under Article I of Section I of Chapter I of Part the Second of the
Constitution of the Commonwealth. If 21 members of the Senate and 81 members of the House
of Representatives judge by vote taken by call of the yeas and nays that such assembling of the

services under subsections (b), (c) or (d).

Manager and the Chief Financial Officer of the Senate.

a supply or service from a vendor not on a statewide procurement contract valued at $100,000 or
more, the House Business Manager and the Chief Financial Officer of the Senate shall seek
proposals through a competitive bid process, which shall be established by the House Business
Manager and the Chief Financial Officer of the Senate. The House Business Manager and the

health, safety or convenience of the members, staff or visitors to the House of Representatives or
Senate the House Business Manager and the Senate Chief Financial Officer may make an
emergency procurement without satisfying the requirement of this rules; provided, however, that

procurement conforms to the requirements of this rule to the extent practicable under the
circumstances; provided further the House Business Manager and Chief Financial Officer of the
Senate shall keep a record of: (a) each contractor’s name, (b) the amount and the type of each
contract; (c) the supplies or services provided under each contract; (d) and basis for determining
the need for an emergency procurement.

Counsel and the House Business Manager and Chief Financial Officer of the Senate, and shall be
approved by the House and Senate Counsel.

Senate, an emergency procurement of greater than $10,000 is necessary, the House Business
Manager and the Chief Financial Officer of the Senate may procure the goods or services
immediately and create and maintain a file explaining the nature of the emergency and the goods
or services that were procured as a result. The House Business Manager and the Chief Financial
24 of 34

Officer of the Senate shall document the goods or services that were procured, the process used
to procure the goods or services, the vendors that were contacted and any other information
