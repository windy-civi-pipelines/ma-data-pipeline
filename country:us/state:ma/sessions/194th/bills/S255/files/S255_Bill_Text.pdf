An Act establishing senior psychologist licensure.
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives in General Court assembled, and by the authority

1 Section 119 of Chapter 112, as appearing in the 2022 Official Edition, is hereby amended
2 by adding at the end thereof the following new paragraph:-
3 The board shall, by no later than July 1, 2026, establish a senior psychologist category of
4 licensure to facilitate the licensure of psychologists who hold a doctoral degree in psychology
5 and have been licensed and practicing as a psychologist in another state for an extended period of
6 time, but whose paper records of training and education may no longer be available.
7 The board shall, by regulation, determine the requirements for licensure as a senior
8 psychologist. Such requirements shall specify the regionally accredited institution granting the
9 doctoral degree in psychology; the number of years an applicant has been licensed by one or
1 of 2

10 more states or provincial psychology boards that are members of the Association of State and
11 Provincial Psychology Boards; the number of years the applicant has engaged in the practice of
12 psychology immediately prior to the date of application; and the number of years prior to the
13 date of application during which the applicant has been free from any disciplinary sanctions.
14 The board may include requirements for senior psychologists that are comparable to
15 those required of other applicants, such as the requirement to take the state jurisprudence exam,
16 provided they do not add an unreasonable or undue burden on the senior psychologist applicant.
