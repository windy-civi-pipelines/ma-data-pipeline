5 Section 2. Twenty Five (25) registered voters of the town may file with the Town Clerk
6 an affidavit containing the name of the officer sought to be recalled and a statement of the
7 grounds for recall. Once the names that appear on the affidavit are certified by the Board of
8 Registrars of Voters, the Town Clerk shall thereupon deliver to the voter first named on such
9 affidavit a sufficient number of copies of petition blanks demanding such recall. The petition
10 blanks shall be issued by the Town Clerk with the Town Clerk's signature and official seal of the
11 Town attached thereto. They shall be dated and addressed to the Board of Selectmen; shall
12 contain the name of the person to whom they are issued, the number of petition blanks so issued,
1 of 4
13 the name of the person whose recall is sought, and the grounds for recall as stated in the
14 affidavit; and shall demand the election of a successor to such office. The affidavit shall be kept
15 with the town records in the office of the Town Clerk.
16 Section 3. The recall petition shall bear the signatures and residential addresses of at least
17 fifteen percent of registered voters of each precinct eligible to vote in the most recent Town
18 Election. The recall petition shall be returned to the Town Clerk within twenty (20) business
19 days after the Clerk issues the petition. The petitions containing the signatures requesting a recall
20 election need not all be submitted at the same time. A copy of each petition shall be maintained
21 with the records of the subject recall election.
22 Section 4. The Town Clerk shall within five business days of receipt submit the petition
23 to the Registrars of Voters in the Town, and the Registrars shall within seven business days
24 certify thereon the number of signatures which are names of registered eligible voters.
25 Section 5. If the Town Clerk determines that the certified petitions meet the requirements
26 as described in the previous sections, he/she shall give notice without delay, in writing, by

28 affidavit and the recall petition form together with notice of the number of qualified voters
29 certified by the Town Clerk who signed the recall petition forms and the total number of
30 qualified voters in the Town as of the most recent Town election.

38 from the Town Clerk, the recall election shall be postponed and shall be held at such time in
39 conjunction with such other election. If a vacancy occurs in the office for any reason after a
40 recall election has been ordered by the Board of Selectmen, the recall election shall nevertheless
41 proceed as provided herein.
42 Section 6: An officer whose recall is sought may be a candidate to succeed
43 himself/herself and, unless he/she requests otherwise in writing to the Town Clerk, said Town
44 Clerk shall place his/her name on the official ballot without nomination. The nomination of other
45 candidate(s), publication of the warrant for the recall election and conduct of same shall be in
46 accordance with the provisions of law of the Commonwealth relating to elections, unless
47 otherwise provided in this act.

49 election. If then re-elected he/she shall continue in office for the remainder of his/her unexpired
50 term, subject to recall as before, except as provided in section nine. If not re-elected in the recall
51 election, he/she shall be deemed removed upon qualification of his/her successor who shall hold
52 office for the remainder of the unexpired term. If the successor fails to qualify within seven days
53 after receiving notification of his/her election, the incumbent shall thereupon be deemed
54 removed and the office vacant.

61 appear the word "Candidates," the directions to voters required by section forty-two of chapter

66 counted."
