An Act establishing a sick leave bank for Carlos Borges, an employee of the department of
correction.

establish forthwith a sick leave bank for a certain employee of the department of correction,
therefore it is hereby declared to be an emergency law, necessary for the immediate preservation
of the public convenience.
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives in General Court assembled, and by the authority
of the same, as follows:
1 SECTION 1. Notwithstanding any general or special law to the contrary, the department
2 of correction shall establish a sick leave bank for Carlos Borges, an employee of the department.
3 Any employee of the department may voluntarily contribute 1 or more sick, personal or vacation
4 days to the sick leave bank for use by Carlos Borges. If Carlos Borges terminates employment
5 with the department or requests to dissolve the sick leave bank, any remaining time in the sick
6 leave bank shall be transferred to the extended illness leave bank. Sick leave bank days shall not
7 be used for absences unrelated to the illness or disability that necessitated the establishment of
8 the sick leave bank as determined by the department.
9 SECTION 2. This act shall take effect upon its passage.
