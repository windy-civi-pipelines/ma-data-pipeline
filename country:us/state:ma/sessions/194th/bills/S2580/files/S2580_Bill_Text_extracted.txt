An Act establishing a sick leave bank for Robert Tiro, an employee of the trial court of the
commonwealth.
Whereas, The deferred operation of this act would tend to defeat its purpose, which is to
establish forthwith a sick leave bank for a certain employee of the trial court of the
commonwealth, therefore it is hereby declared to be an emergency law, necessary for the
immediate preservation of the public convenience.
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives in General Court assembled, and by the authority
of the same, as follows:
1 Notwithstanding any general or special law to the contrary, the trial court of the
2 commonwealth shall establish a sick leave bank for Robert Tiro, an employee of the trial court.
3 Any employee of the trial court may voluntarily contribute 1 or more sick, personal, or vacation
4 days to the sick leave bank for use by Robert Tiro to care for his spouse. If Robert Tiro
5 terminates employment with the trial court or requests to dissolve the sick leave bank, any
6 remaining time in the sick leave bank shall be transferred to the trial court paid leave bank. Sick
7 leave bank days shall not be used for absences unrelated to the illness or disability that
8 necessitated the establishment of the sick leave bank as determined by the trial court
