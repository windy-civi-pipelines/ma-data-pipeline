615 vacancy shall be filled for the unexpired term by a majority vote of the remaining members of

650 Section 8-2: RESIDENT INITIATIVE MEASURES

653 city council or the school committee, shall contain a request for the passage of a particular
654 measure which shall be set forth in full in the petition and shall be physically signed by a number
655 of voters which is equal to 5 per cent of the total number of registered voters as of the date of the
656 most recent city election. The petition shall be accompanied by an affidavit signed by 10 voters
657 and containing their residential addresses stating they will constitute the petitioners committee
658 and be responsible for circulating the petition and filing it in proper form. Voters will be required
659 to provide the number and street of their residence along with their signature on the form.
660 Signatures to an initiative petition need not all be on 1 paper. The elections department shall
661 certify the voter signatures not more than 14 days after the final day of filing; provided, however,
662 that the petition shall be considered filed whenever the persons responsible for its filing notify
32 of 47
663 the board in writing that the filing is complete; provided further, that before receiving such
664 notice, the board may, but shall not be required to, certify signatures on the sheets of the petition
665 already filed. If the number of certified voter signatures on the petition equals 5 per cent of the
666 total number of registered voters as of the date of the most recent city election, the board of
667 election commissioners shall attach to the petition a certificate showing the results of the
668 elections department’s examination and shall send the petition to the city clerk and mail a copy
669 of the certificate to the petitioners committee.

673 the city solicitor shall advise the city council or the school committee in writing whether the
674 measure as proposed may lawfully utilize the initiative process and whether, in its present form,
675 it may be lawfully adopted by the council. If the opinion of the city solicitor is that the measure
676 is not in proper form or may not be lawfully adopted by the city council or the school committee,
677 the city solicitor shall state in the reply the reasons for this opinion in full and mail a copy of the
678 opinion to the petitioners committee.
679 If the opinion of the city solicitor is that the petition is in a proper form and may be
680 lawfully adopted by the city council or the school committee, not more than 60 days following
681 the city solicitor’s opinion, the city council or the school committee shall act with respect to each
682 initiative petition by passing it without change, by passing a measure which is stated to be in lieu
683 of the initiative measure or by rejecting it. The passage of a measure which is in lieu of an
684 initiative measure shall be considered to be a rejection of the initiative measure. If the city
685 council or school committee fails to act with respect to any initiative measure that is presented to
33 of 47
686 it within 60 days of the date it has been notified by the city solicitor that it is in proper form and
687 may be lawfully adopted by the city council or school committee, the initiative measure shall be
688 considered to have been approved on the sixty-first day. If an initiative measure is rejected, the
689 city clerk shall promptly give notice to the petitioners committee by certified mail.
690 Thirty days after the date an initiative petition has been rejected by the council or school
691 committee, a supplemental initiative petition may be filed with the elections department, but only
692 by persons constituting the original petitioners committee. The elections department shall certify
693 the voter signatures not more than 14 days after the final day of filing; provided, however, that
694 the supplemental petition shall be considered filed whenever the persons responsible for its filing
695 notify the board in writing that the filing is complete; provided further, that before receiving such
696 notice, the board may, but shall not be required to, certify signatures on the sheets of the
697 supplemental petition already filed. The supplemental initiative petition shall be physically
698 signed by a number of additional voters which is equal to 15 per cent of the total number of
699 registered voters as of the date of the most recent city election. If the number of signatures to the
700 supplemental petition is found to be sufficient by the elections department, such petition shall be
701 placed on the ballot at the next municipal election held not less than 90 days from the date of
702 certification.
703 The ballots used when voting on a measure proposed by the voters pursuant to this
704 section shall contain a question in substantially the following form:

725 and street of their residence along with their signature on the form. Signatures to a referendum
726 petition need not all be on 1 paper. The elections department shall certify the voter signatures not

728 shall be considered filed whenever the persons responsible for its filing notify the board in
729 writing that the filing is complete; provided further, that before receiving such notice, the board
35 of 47
730 may, but shall not be required to, certify signatures on the sheets of the referendum petition
731 already filed. If the number of certified voter signatures on the petition equals not less than 15
732 per cent of the total number of registered voters as of the date of the most recent city election, the
733 board of election commissioners shall attach to the petition a certificate showing the results of
734 the elections department’s examination and shall send the petition to the city clerk.

736 petition was submitted shall be suspended from taking effect and the city council or the school
737 committee, as the case may be, shall reconsider such measure or part thereof not more than 20
738 days after said submission and certification. The city council or school committee shall act with
739 respect to each referendum petition by upholding its passage, passing a measure which is stated
740 to be in lieu of the recission requested in the referendum petition or rescinding the measure.
741 Failure to act within said 20-day period shall constitute rejection of the referendum petition. If
742 such measure or part thereof is not entirely rescinded within said 20-day period, the board of
743 election commissioners shall submit the same to a vote of the registered voters of the city at the
744 next regular municipal election not less than 90 days after the expiration of said 20-day period.

664 notice, the board may, but shall not be required to, certify signatures on the sheets of the petition

676 is not in proper form or may not be lawfully adopted by the city council or the school committee,
677 the city solicitor shall state in the reply the reasons for this opinion in full and mail a copy of the

682 initiative petition by passing it without change, by passing a measure which is stated to be in lieu
683 of the initiative measure or by rejecting it. The passage of a measure which is in lieu of an

686 it within 60 days of the date it has been notified by the city solicitor that it is in proper form and

693 the voter signatures not more than 14 days after the final day of filing; provided, however, that
694 the supplemental petition shall be considered filed whenever the persons responsible for its filing
695 notify the board in writing that the filing is complete; provided further, that before receiving such
696 notice, the board may, but shall not be required to, certify signatures on the sheets of the
697 supplemental petition already filed. The supplemental initiative petition shall be physically
698 signed by a number of additional voters which is equal to 15 per cent of the total number of
699 registered voters as of the date of the most recent city election. If the number of signatures to the
700 supplemental petition is found to be sufficient by the elections department, such petition shall be
701 placed on the ballot at the next municipal election held not less than 90 days from the date of
702 certification.

743 election commissioners shall submit the same to a vote of the registered voters of the city at the
744 next regular municipal election not less than 90 days after the expiration of said 20-day period.

865 the following day.

890 with the charter. If it shall appear to the city council that the city manager is not following the
891 charter, it shall, by resolution, direct the attention of the city manager to those areas in which it
892 believes there is a failure to comply with the charter. The procedures under chapter 231A of the
