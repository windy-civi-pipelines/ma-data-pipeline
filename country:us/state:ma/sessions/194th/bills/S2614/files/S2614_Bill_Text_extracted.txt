4 In any fiscal year, no public school district's total charter school tuition payment to

8 necessary to support current and previously authorized charter school enrollment, and provided
9 further that no new charter school seats shall be authorized by the board for said district so long
10 as its total charter school tuition payment exceeds said 9 per cent. The commonwealth shall incur
11 charter school tuition payments for siblings attending commonwealth charter schools to the

48 providing for the option to participate virtually, in which the proposed expansion would take
49 place, in accordance with the public hearing requirements outlined in subsection (h).
50 The board shall establish criteria for the approval of a charter school expansion request,
