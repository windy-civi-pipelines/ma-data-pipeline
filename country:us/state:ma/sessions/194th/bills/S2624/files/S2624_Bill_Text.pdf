Senate Clerk Hurley and House Clerk Timothy Carroll:
Pursuant to M.G.L. c. 128A, § 9B and M.G.L. c. 6, § 222, the Massachusetts Gaming Commission
(“Commission”) hereby files 205 CMR 3.00: Harness Horse Racing, specifically, 205 CMR 3.11:
General Rules, and 205 CMR 3.14: Licenses, Registrations and Fees for Participants in Racing with the
Clerks of the Senate and the House of Representatives.
The Commission has amended these sections to remove the term “obnoxious” from within 205 CMR
3.11(8) and 205 CMR 3.14 (5)(8) and (9), respectively. As a descriptor of conduct, the term does not have
broad use or application in many other horse racing jurisdictions. The term “unbecoming” has been
selected as a replacement, as it more broadly encompasses the kind of conduct that may reflect poorly on
a licensee or racing participant; and mirrors similar standards used within other U.S. racing jurisdictions.
These regulations are authorized by M.G.L. c. 128A, §§ 9 and 9B. A public hearing was held regarding
these proposed amendments on September 9, 2025. The Commission voted to authorize the final draft of
the regulation and its filing with your offices, on September 25, 2025. If you have any questions or need
additional information, please feel free to reach me at judith.young@massgaming.gov or (857) 406 -
4277. Thank you for your attention to this matter.
Respectfully submitted,
Massachusetts Gaming Commission

205 CMR: MASSACHUSETTS GAMING COMMISSION
3.14 : Licenses, Registrations and Fees for Participants in Racing
(1) The following persons shall be required to take out a license from the Commission, and pay the
current applicable annual fee: Driver, Trainer, Owner, Authorized Agent, Stable Employees,
Veterinarian, Blacksmith, Vendors and Racing Officials.
(2) The fee shall accompany each application for license or registration. They expire December
31st of the year of issue, except stable employees whose license expire on March 31st.
(3) All applications for license and registrations to participate in racing shall be made to the
Commission on forms supplied by the Commission. Any person making any false or misleading
statements on an application for license or registration may be denied such a license or registration
or may be assessed a fine, suspension or both. If already in possession of a license, said license may
be revoked.
(4) Such application shall be submitted first to the Judges. In considering each application for a
license the Judges may require the applicant, as well as his or her endorsers, to appear before them
and show that said applicant is qualified in every respect to receive the license requested. Ability as
well as integrity must be clearly shown by the applicant in order to receive the Judges' recommendation
for the granting of the license.
(5) Before recommending any application for a license it shall be the duty of the Judges,
individually and collectively, to ascertain if the applicant is qualified as to ability, integrity and right
to the license applied for. And further, no application for a license shall be recommended by the
Judges if the applicant's previous conduct in Massachusetts or elsewhere is considered to have been
objectionable, unbecoming or detrimental to the best interest of racing.
(6) No application for a license or registration shall be recommended by the Judges and no license
or registration will be issued by the Commission unless satisfactory evidence first is presented to the
Judges that the person so applying will participate in the meeting over which the Judges have
supervision.
(7) The Commission may refuse to license any applicant who has been refused a license by any other
State Gaming or Racing Commission, the United States Trotting Association or turf governing body.
(8) The Commission may refuse to license any applicant whose previous conduct in
Massachusetts or elsewhere in connection with horse racing is considered by the Commission to
have been objectionable, unbecoming or detrimental to the best interest of racing.
(9) The Commission may also revoke any license if the holder of the same has violated any rule or
regulation of the Commission governing his or her conduct in connection with horse racing, or where
such conduct is objectionable, unbecoming or detrimental to the best interest of racing.
(10) All licenses granted shall be subject to the conditions set forth in the application therefor and
the Commission shall have full discretion to suspend or revoke the same for any infraction of the
conditions of the application of license and 205 CMR 3.00.
(11) No owner, trainer or agent shall start a horse unless all licenses and registrations required by
205 CMR 3.14(1) have been filed. Violators of 205 CMR 3.14(11) may be subject to suspension or
a forfeiture.
(12) No application, except a license for ownership, will be considered for or granted to a person
under 16 years of age. If younger than 18 years of age, an applicant for an owner's license shall submit
a notarized affidavit from his or her parent or legal guardian stating that the parent or legal guardian
assumes responsibility for the applicant's financial, contractual and other obligations relating to the
applicant's participation in racing within the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.
(13) When an ownership is in the name of both husband and wife, both shall be licensed.
(14) Temporary Owner Licenses may be issued to Trainers acting as agents for their owners or to
authorized agents representing their owners. Temporary licenses will be valid for a period of 30 days
from date of approval. Every Temporary Owner's License must be followed by an application from
