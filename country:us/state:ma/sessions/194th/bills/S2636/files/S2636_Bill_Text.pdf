6 of 36

113 enacted by the Commission to administer the Compact; and (j) accept Licensees from other

115 Member States may charge a fee for granting a license to practice Cosmetology.
116 Individuals not residing in a Member State shall continue to be able to apply for a Member
117 State’s Single-State License as provided under the laws of each Member State. However, the
118 Single-State License granted to these individuals shall not be recognized as granting a Multistate
119 License to provide services in any other Member State. Nothing in this Compact shall affect the
120 requirements established by a Member State for the issuance of a Single-State License. A
121 Multistate License issued to a Licensee by a Home State to a resident of that State shall be
122 recognized by each Member State as authorizing a Licensee to practice Cosmetology in each
123 Member State. At no point shall the Commission have the power to define the educational or
124 professional requirements for a license to practice Cosmetology. The Member States shall retain
125 sole jurisdiction over the provision of these requirements.
126 Section 4. To be eligible to apply to their Home State’s State Licensing Authority for an
127 initial Multistate License under this Compact, a Licensee must hold an active and unencumbered
128 Single-State License to practice Cosmetology in their Home State. Upon the receipt of an
129 application for a Multistate License, according to the Rules of the Commission, a Member
130 State’s State Licensing Authority shall ascertain whether the applicant meets the requirements
131 for a Multistate License under this Compact. If an applicant meets the requirements for a
132 Multistate License under this Compact and any applicable Rules of the Commission, the State
133 Licensing Authority in receipt of the application shall, within a reasonable time, grant a
134 Multistate License to that applicant, and inform all Member States of the grant of said Multistate
135 License. A Multistate License to practice Cosmetology issued by a Member State’s State
7 of 36

136 Licensing Authority shall be recognized by each Member State as authorizing the practice
137 thereof as though that Licensee held a Single-State License to do so in each Member State,
138 subject to the restrictions herein. A Multistate License granted pursuant to this Compact may be
139 effective for a definite period of time, concurrent with the licensure renewal period in the Home
140 State. To maintain a Multistate License under this Compact, a Licensee must (a) agree to abide
141 by the rules of the State Licensing Authority, and the State scope of practice laws governing the
142 Practice of Cosmetology, of any Member State in which the Licensee provides services, (b) pay
143 all required fees related to the application and process, and any other fees which the Commission
144 may by Rule require, and (c) comply with any and all other requirements regarding Multistate
145 Licenses which the Commission may by Rule provide.
146 A Licensee practicing in a Member State is subject to all scope of practice laws
147 governing Cosmetology Services in that State. The Practice of Cosmetology under a Multistate
148 License granted pursuant to this Compact will subject the Licensee to the jurisdiction of the State
149 Licensing Authority, the courts, and the laws of the Member State in which the Cosmetology
150 Services are provided.
151 Section 5. A Licensee may hold a Multistate License, issued by their Home State, in only
152 one Member State at any given time. If a Licensee changes their Home State by moving between
153 two Member States:
154 1. The Licensee shall immediately apply for the reissuance of their Multistate License in
155 their new Home State. The Licensee shall pay all applicable fees and notify the prior Home State
156 in accordance with the Rules of the Commission.
8 of 36

157 2. Upon receipt of an application to reissue a Multistate License, the new Home State
158 shall verify that the Multistate License is active, unencumbered and eligible for reissuance under
159 the terms of the Compact and the Rules of the Commission. The Multistate License issued by the
160 prior Home State will be deactivated and all Member States notified in accordance with the
161 applicable Rules adopted by the Commission.
162 3. If required for initial licensure, the new Home State may require a Background Check
163 as specified in the laws of that State, or the compliance with any Jurisprudence Requirements of
164 the new Home State.
165 4. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Compact, if a Licensee does not meet the
166 requirements set forth in this Compact for the reissuance of a Multistate License by the new
167 Home State, then the Licensee shall be subject to the new Home State requirements for the
168 issuance of a Single-State License in that State.
169 If a Licensee changes their primary state of residence by moving from a Member State to
170 a non-Member State, or from a non-Member State to a Member State, then the Licensee shall be
171 subject to the State requirements for the issuance of a Single-State License in the new Home
172 State. Nothing in this Compact shall interfere with a Licensee’s ability to hold a Single-State
173 License in multiple States; however, for the purposes of this Compact, a Licensee shall have
174 only one Home State, and only one Multistate License. Nothing in this Compact shall interfere
175 with the requirements established by a Member State for the issuance of a Single-State License.
176 Section 6. A. Nothing in this Compact, nor any Rule or regulation of the Commission,
177 shall be construed to limit, restrict, or in any way reduce the ability of a Member State to enact
178 and enforce laws, regulations, or other rules related to the Practice of Cosmetology in that State,
9 of 36

179 where those laws, regulations, or other rules are not inconsistent with the provisions of this
180 Compact.
181 B. Insofar as practical, a Member State’s State Licensing Authority shall cooperate with
182 the Commission and with each entity exercising independent regulatory authority over the
183 Practice of Cosmetology according to the provisions of this Compact.
184 C. Discipline shall be the sole responsibility of the State in which Cosmetology Services
185 are provided. Accordingly, each Member State’s State Licensing Authority shall be responsible
186 for receiving complaints about individuals practicing Cosmetology in that State, and for
187 communicating all relevant Investigative Information about any such Adverse Action to the other
188 Member States through the Data System in addition to any other methods the Commission may
189 by Rule require.
190 Section 7. A. A Licensee’s Home State shall have exclusive power to impose an Adverse
191 Action against a Licensee’s Multistate License issued by the Home State.
192 B. A Home State may take Adverse Action on a Multistate License based on the
193 Investigative Information, Current Significant Investigative Information, or Adverse Action of a
194 Remote State.
195 C. In addition to the powers conferred by State law, each Remote State’s State Licensing
196 Authority shall have the power to:
197 1. Take Adverse Action against a Licensee’s Authorization to Practice Cosmetology
198 through the Multistate License in that Member State, provided that:
10 of 36

199 a. Only the Licensee’s Home State shall have the power to take Adverse Action against
200 the Multistate License issued by the Home State; and
201 b. For the purposes of taking Adverse Action, the Home State’s State Licensing
202 Authority shall give the same priority and effect to reported conduct received from a Remote
203 State as it would if such conduct had occurred within the Home State. In so doing, the Home
204 State shall apply its own State laws to determine the appropriate action.
205 2. Issue cease and desist orders or impose an Encumbrance on a Licensee’s Authorization
206 to Practice within that Member State.
207 3. Complete any pending investigations of a Licensee who changes their primary state of
208 residence during the course of such an investigation. The State Licensing Authority shall also be
209 empowered to report the results of such an investigation to the Commission through the Data
210 System as described herein.
211 4. Issue subpoenas for both hearings and investigations that require the attendance and
212 testimony of witnesses, as well as the production of evidence. Subpoenas issued by a State
213 Licensing Authority in a Member State for the attendance and testimony of witnesses or the
214 production of evidence from another Member State shall be enforced in the latter State by any
215 court of competent jurisdiction, according to the practice and procedure of that court applicable
216 to subpoenas issued in proceedings before it. The issuing State Licensing Authority shall pay any
217 witness fees, travel expenses, mileage, and other fees required by the service statutes of the State
218 in which the witnesses or evidence are located.
11 of 36

219 5. If otherwise permitted by State law, recover from the affected Licensee the costs of
220 investigations and disposition of cases resulting from any Adverse Action taken against that
221 Licensee.
222 6. Take Adverse Action against the Licensee’s Authorization to Practice in that State
223 based on the factual findings of another Remote State.
224 D. A Licensee’s Home State shall complete any pending investigation(s) of a
225 Cosmetologist who changes their primary state of residence during the course of the
226 investigation(s). The Home State shall also have the authority to take appropriate action(s) and
227 shall promptly report the conclusions of the investigations to the Data System.
228 E. If an Adverse Action is taken by the Home State against a Licensee’s Multistate
229 License, the Licensee’s Authorization to Practice in all other Member States shall be deactivated
230 until all Encumbrances have been removed from the Home State license. All Home State
231 disciplinary orders that impose an Adverse Action against a Licensee’s Multistate License shall
232 include a statement that the Cosmetologist’s Authorization to Practice is deactivated in all
233 Member States during the pendency of the order.
234 F. Nothing in this Compact shall override a Member State’s authority to accept a
235 Licensee’s participation in an Alternative Program in lieu of Adverse Action. A Licensee’s
236 Multistate License shall be suspended for the duration of the Licensee’s participation in any
237 Alternative Program.
238 G. Joint Investigations
12 of 36

243 furtherance of any joint or individual investigation initiated under the Compact.

247 their spouse is on active duty assignment.
248 Section 9. A. The Compact Member States hereby create and establish a joint
249 government agency whose membership consists of all Member States that have enacted the
250 Compact known as the Cosmetology Licensure Compact Commission. The Commission is an

22 of 36

439 person against whom the claim is made had a reasonable basis for believing occurred within the
440 scope of Commission employment, duties or responsibilities; provided that nothing in this
441 paragraph shall be construed to protect any such person from suit or liability for any damage,
442 loss, injury, or liability caused by the intentional or willful or wanton misconduct of that person.
443 The procurement of insurance of any type by the Commission shall not in any way compromise
444 or limit the immunity granted hereunder.

460 did not result from the intentional or willful or wanton misconduct of that person.
23 of 36

461 4. Nothing herein shall be construed as a limitation on the liability of any Licensee for
462 professional malpractice or misconduct, which shall be governed solely by any other applicable
463 State laws.
464 5. Nothing in this Compact shall be interpreted to waive or otherwise abrogate a Member
465 State’s State action immunity or State action affirmative defense with respect to antitrust claims
466 under the Sherman Act, Clayton Act, or any other State or federal antitrust or anticompetitive
467 law or regulation.

495 Investigative Information pertaining to a Licensee in any Member State will only be available to
496 other Member States.
497 F. It is the responsibility of the Member States to monitor the database to determine

506 from the Data System.
507 Section 11. A. The Commission shall promulgate reasonable Rules in order to effectively
508 and efficiently implement and administer the purposes and provisions of the Compact. A Rule
509 shall be invalid and have no force or effect only if a court of competent jurisdiction holds that the
510 Rule is invalid because the Commission exercised its rulemaking authority in a manner that is
511 beyond the scope and purposes of the Compact, or the powers granted hereunder, or based upon
512 another applicable standard of review.
513 B. The Rules of the Commission shall have the force of law in each Member State,
514 provided however that where the Rules of the Commission conflict with the laws of the Member
515 State that establish the Member State’s scope of practice laws governing the Practice of
516 Cosmetology as held by a court of competent jurisdiction, the Rules of the Commission shall be
517 ineffective in that State to the extent of the conflict.
518 C. The Commission shall exercise its rulemaking powers pursuant to the criteria set forth
519 in this section and the Rules adopted thereunder. Rules shall become binding as of the date
520 specified by the Commission for each Rule.
521 D. If a majority of the legislatures of the Member States rejects a Rule or portion of a
522 Rule, by enactment of a statute or resolution in the same manner used to adopt the Compact
26 of 36

523 within four (4) years of the date of adoption of the Rule, then such Rule shall have no further
524 force and effect in any Member State or to any State applying to participate in the Compact.
525 E. Rules shall be adopted at a regular or special meeting of the Commission.
526 F. Prior to adoption of a proposed Rule, the Commission shall hold a public hearing and
527 allow persons to provide oral and written comments, data, facts, opinions, and arguments.
528 G. Prior to adoption of a proposed Rule by the Commission, and at least thirty (30) days
529 in advance of the meeting at which the Commission will hold a public hearing on the proposed
530 Rule, the Commission shall provide a notice of proposed rulemaking:
531 1. On the website of the Commission or other publicly accessible platform;
532 2. To persons who have requested notice of the Commission’s notices of proposed
533 rulemaking; and
534 3. In such other way(s) as the Commission may by Rule specify.
535 H. The notice of proposed rulemaking shall include:
536 1. The time, date, and location of the public hearing at which the Commission will hear
537 public comments on the proposed Rule and, if different, the time, date, and location of the
538 meeting where the Commission will consider and vote on the proposed Rule;
539 2. If the hearing is held via telecommunication, video conference, or other electronic
540 means,
541 the Commission shall include the mechanism for access to the hearing in the notice of
542 proposed rulemaking;
27 of 36

543 3. The text of the proposed Rule and the reason therefor;
544 4. A request for comments on the proposed Rule from any interested person; and
545 5. The manner in which interested persons may submit written comments.
546 I. All hearings will be recorded. A copy of the recording and all written comments and
547 documents received by the Commission in response to the proposed Rule shall be available to
548 the public.
549 J. Nothing in this section shall be construed as requiring a separate hearing on each Rule.
550 Rules may be grouped for the convenience of the Commission at hearings required by this
551 section.
552 K. The Commission shall, by majority vote of all members, take final action on the
553 proposed Rule based on the rulemaking record and the full text of the Rule:
554 1. The Commission may adopt changes to the proposed Rule provided the changes do not
555 enlarge the original purpose of the proposed Rule.
556 2. The Commission shall provide an explanation of the reasons for substantive changes
557 made to the proposed Rule as well as reasons for substantive changes not made that were
558 recommended by commenters.
559 3. The Commission shall determine a reasonable effective date for the Rule. Except for
560 an emergency as provided in section 11.L, the effective date of the Rule shall be no sooner than
561 forty-five (45) days after the Commission issuing the notice that it adopted or amended the Rule.
28 of 36

562 L. Upon determination that an emergency exists, the Commission may consider and
563 adopt an emergency Rule with five (5) days’ notice, with opportunity to comment, provided that
564 the usual rulemaking procedures provided in the Compact and in this section shall be
565 retroactively applied to the Rule as soon as reasonably possible, in no event later than ninety (90)
566 days after the effective date of the Rule. For the purposes of this provision, an emergency Rule is
567 one that must be adopted immediately to:
568 1. Meet an imminent threat to public health, safety, or welfare;
569 2. Prevent a loss of Commission or Member State funds;
570 3. Meet a deadline for the promulgation of a Rule that is established by federal law or
571 rule; or
572 4. Protect public health and safety.
573 M. The Commission or an authorized committee of the Commission may direct revisions
574 to a previously adopted Rule for purposes of correcting typographical errors, errors in format,
575 errors in consistency, or grammatical errors. Public notice of any revisions shall be posted on the
576 website of the Commission. The revision shall be subject to challenge by any person for a period
577 of thirty (30) days after posting. The revision may be challenged only on grounds that the
578 revision results in a material change to a Rule. A challenge shall be made in writing and
579 delivered to the Commission prior to the end of the notice period. If no challenge is made, the
580 revision will take effect without further action. If the revision is challenged, the revision may not
581 take effect without the approval of the Commission.
582 N. No Member State’s rulemaking requirements shall apply under this Compact.
29 of 36

583 Section 12. A. Oversight
584 1. The executive and judicial branches of State government in each Member State shall
585 enforce this Compact and take all actions necessary and appropriate to implement the Compact.
586 2. Venue is proper and judicial proceedings by or against the Commission shall be
587 brought solely and exclusively in a court of competent jurisdiction where the principal office of
588 the Commission is located. The Commission may waive venue and jurisdictional defenses to the
589 extent it adopts or consents to participate in alternative dispute resolution proceedings. Nothing
590 herein shall affect or limit the selection or propriety of venue in any action against a Licensee for
591 professional malpractice, misconduct or any such similar matter.
592 3. The Commission shall be entitled to receive service of process in any proceeding
593 regarding the enforcement or interpretation of the Compact and shall have standing to intervene
594 in such a proceeding for all purposes. Failure to provide the Commission service of process shall
595 render a judgment or order void as to the Commission, this Compact, or promulgated Rules.
596 B. Default, Technical Assistance, and Termination
597 1. If the Commission determines that a Member State has defaulted in the performance of
598 its obligations or responsibilities under this Compact or the promulgated Rules, the Commission
599 shall provide written notice to the defaulting State. The notice of default shall describe the
600 default, the proposed means of curing the default, and any other action that the Commission may
601 take, and shall offer training and specific technical assistance regarding the default.
602 2. The Commission shall provide a copy of the notice of default to the other Member
603 States.
30 of 36

604 3. If a State in default fails to cure the default, the defaulting State may be terminated
605 from
606 the Compact upon an affirmative vote of a majority of the delegates of the Member
607 States, and all rights, privileges and benefits conferred on that State by this Compact may be
608 terminated on the effective date of termination. A cure of the default does not relieve the
609 offending State of obligations or liabilities incurred during the period of default.
610 4. Termination of membership in the Compact shall be imposed only after all other
611 means of securing compliance have been exhausted. Notice of intent to suspend or terminate
612 shall be given by the Commission to the governor, the majority and minority leaders of the
613 defaulting State’s legislature, the defaulting State’s State Licensing Authority and each of the
614 Member States’ State Licensing Authority.
615 5. A State that has been terminated is responsible for all assessments, obligations, and
616 liabilities incurred through the effective date of termination, including obligations that extend
617 beyond the effective date of termination.
618 6. Upon the termination of a State’s membership from this Compact, that State shall
619 immediately provide notice to all Licensees who hold a Multistate License within that State of
620 such termination. The terminated State shall continue to recognize all licenses granted pursuant
621 to this Compact for a minimum of one hundred eighty (180) days after the date of said notice of
622 termination.
623 7. The Commission shall not bear any costs related to a State that is found to be in default
624 or that has been terminated from the Compact, unless agreed upon in writing between the
625 Commission and the defaulting State.
31 of 36

626 8. The defaulting State may appeal the action of the Commission by petitioning the
627 United States District Court for the District of Columbia or the federal district where the
628 Commission has its principal offices. The prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such
629 litigation, including reasonable attorney’s fees.
630 C. Dispute Resolution
631 1. Upon request by a Member State, the Commission shall attempt to resolve disputes 51
632 related to the Compact that arise among Member States and between Member and non-Member
633 States.
634 2. The Commission shall promulgate a Rule providing for both mediation and binding
635 dispute resolution for disputes as appropriate.
636 D. Enforcement
637 1. The Commission, in the reasonable exercise of its discretion, shall enforce the
638 provisions of this Compact and the Commission’s Rules.
639 2. By majority vote as provided by Commission Rule, the Commission may initiate legal
640 action against a Member State in default in the United States District Court for the
641 District of Columbia or the federal district where the Commission has its principal offices
642 to enforce compliance with the provisions of the Compact and its promulgated Rules. The relief
643 sought may include both injunctive relief and damages. In the event judicial enforcement is
644 necessary, the prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable
645 attorney’s fees. The remedies herein shall not be the exclusive remedies of the Commission. The
32 of 36

646 Commission may pursue any other remedies available under federal or the defaulting Member
647 State’s law.
648 3. A Member State may initiate legal action against the Commission in the United States
649 District Court for the District of Columbia or the federal district where the Commission has its
650 principal offices to enforce compliance with the provisions of the Compact and its promulgated
651 Rules. The relief sought may include both injunctive relief and damages. In the event judicial
652 enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation,
653 including reasonable attorney’s fees.
654 4. No individual or entity other than a Member State may enforce this Compact against
655 the Commission.
656 Section 13. A. The Compact shall come into effect on the date on which the Compact
657 statute is enacted into law in the seventh Member State.
658 1. On or after the effective date of the Compact, the Commission shall convene and
659 review the enactment of each of the Charter Member States to determine if the statute enacted by
660 each such Charter Member State is materially different than the model Compact statute.
661 a. A Charter Member State whose enactment is found to be materially different from the
662 model Compact statute shall be entitled to the default process set forth in section 12.
663 b. If any Member State is later found to be in default, or is terminated or withdraws from
664 the Compact, the Commission shall remain in existence and the Compact shall remain in effect
665 even if the number of Member States should be less than seven (7).
33 of 36

666 2. Member States enacting the Compact subsequent to the Charter Member States shall
667 be subject to the process set forth in section 9.C.24 to determine if their enactments are
668 materially different from the model Compact statute and whether they qualify for participation in
669 the Compact.
670 3. All actions taken for the benefit of the Commission or in furtherance of the purposes of
671 the administration of the Compact prior to the effective date of the Compact or the Commission
672 coming into existence shall be considered to be actions of the Commission unless specifically
673 repudiated by the Commission.
674 4. Any State that joins the Compact shall be subject to the Commission’s Rules and
675 bylaws as they exist on the date on which the Compact becomes law in that State. Any Rule that
676 has been previously adopted by the Commission shall have the full force and effect of law on the
677 day the Compact becomes law in that State.
678 B. Any Member State may withdraw from this Compact by enacting a statute repealing
679 that State’s enactment of the Compact.
680 1. A Member State’s withdrawal shall not take effect until one hundred eighty (180) days
681 after enactment of the repealing statute.
682 2. Withdrawal shall not affect the continuing requirement of the withdrawing State’s
683 State Licensing Authority to comply with the investigative and Adverse Action reporting
684 requirements of this Compact prior to the effective date of withdrawal.
685 3. Upon the enactment of a statute withdrawing from this Compact, a State shall
686 immediately provide notice of such withdrawal to all Licensees within that State.
34 of 36

687 Notwithstanding any subsequent statutory enactment to the contrary, such withdrawing State
688 shall continue to recognize all licenses granted pursuant to this Compact for a minimum of one
689 hundred eighty (180) days after the date of such notice of withdrawal.
690 C. Nothing contained in this Compact shall be construed to invalidate or prevent any
691 licensure agreement or other cooperative arrangement between a Member State and a non-
692 Member State that does not conflict with the provisions of this Compact.
693 D. This Compact may be amended by the Member States. No amendment to this
694 Compact shall become effective and binding upon any Member State until it is enacted into the
695 laws of all Member States.
696 Section 14. A. This Compact and the Commission’s rulemaking authority shall be
697 liberally construed so as to effectuate the purposes, and the implementation and administration of
698 the Compact. Provisions of the Compact expressly authorizing or requiring the promulgation of
699 Rules shall not be construed to limit the Commission’s rulemaking authority solely for those
700 purposes.
701 B. The provisions of this Compact shall be severable and if any phrase, clause, sentence
702 or provision of this Compact is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be contrary to the
703 constitution of any Member State, a State seeking participation in the Compact, or of the United
704 States, or the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or circumstance is held to
705 be unconstitutional by a court of competent jurisdiction, the validity of the remainder of this
706 Compact and the applicability thereof to any other government, agency, person or circumstance
707 shall not be affected thereby.
35 of 36

708 C. Notwithstanding section 14.B, the Commission may deny a State’s participation in the
709 Compact or, in accordance with the requirements of section 12, terminate a Member State’s
710 participation in the Compact, if it determines that a constitutional requirement of a Member State
711 is a material departure from the Compact. Otherwise, if this Compact shall be held to be contrary
712 to the constitution of any Member State, the Compact shall remain in full force and effect as to
713 the remaining Member States and in full force and effect as to the Member State affected as to all
714 severable matters.
715 Section 15. A. Nothing herein shall prevent or inhibit the enforcement of any other law of
716 a Member State that is not inconsistent with the Compact.
717 B. Any laws, statutes, regulations, or other legal requirements in a Member State in
718 conflict with the Compact are superseded to the extent of the conflict.
719 C. All permissible agreements between the Commission and the Member States are
720 binding in accordance with their terms.”
