An Act to allow peer-to-peer cardrooms.
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives in General Court assembled, and by the authority
of the same, as follows:
1 SECTION 1. The Massachusetts General Laws, as so appearing, are hereby amended by
2 adding the following new chapter:-
3 CHAPTER 128D
4 Peer-to-Peer Cardrooms for Class II Gaming
5 Section 1. Intent
6 It is the intent of the Legislature to provide additional entertainment choices for the
7 residents of and visitors to the commonwealth, promote tourism, and provide additional revenues
8 through the authorization of the playing of certain games at facilities known as cardrooms which
9 are to be located at licensed pari-mutuel facilities. To ensure the public confidence in the
10 integrity of authorized cardroom operations, this act is designed to strictly regulate the facilities,
1 of 15
11 persons, and procedures related to cardroom operations. Furthermore, the Legislature finds that
12 authorized games as herein defined are considered to be pari-mutuel style games and not casino

131 Section 5. Operation of Cardroom
132 (a) A cardroom may be operated only at the location specified on the cardroom license

139 (c) A cardroom operator must at all times employ and provide a nonplaying dealer for
140 each table on which authorized card games which traditionally use a dealer are conducted at the
141 cardroom. Such dealers may not have a participatory interest in any game other than the dealing
142 of cards and may not have an interest in the outcome of the game. The providing of such dealers
143 by a licensee does not constitute the conducting of a banking game by the cardroom operator.
144 (d) A cardroom operator may award giveaways, jackpots, and prizes to a player who
145 holds certain combinations of cards specified by the cardroom operator, including a progressive
146 jackpot in which a player makes an optional wager and a winning player is awarded a jackpot
147 from funds that have accumulated from various poker games.
148 (e) Each cardroom operator shall conspicuously post upon the premises of the cardroom
149 a notice which contains a copy of the cardroom license; a list of authorized games offered by the
150 cardroom; the wagering limits imposed by the house, if any; any additional house rules regarding
151 operation of the cardroom or the playing of any game; and all costs to players to participate,
152 including any rake by the house. In addition, each cardroom operator shall post at each table a
153 notice of the minimum and maximum bets authorized at such table and the fee for participation
154 in the game conducted.
8 of 15
155 (f) The cardroom facility is subject to inspection by the division or any law
156 enforcement agency during the licensee’s regular business hours.
157 (g) A cardroom operator may refuse entry to or refuse to allow any person who is
158 objectionable, undesirable, or disruptive to play, but such refusal may not be on the basis of race,
159 creed, color, religion, gender, sexual orientation, national origin, marital status, physical
160 handicap, or age, except as provided in this section.
161 (h) Poker games played in a peer-to-peer player manner in which every player’s hand at
162 the table competes with every other player’s hand at the table and must comply with the
163 following restrictions:
164 1. Poker games to be played in a peer-to-peer player manner must have been identified
165 in cardroom license applications approved by the division.
166 2. There may not be more than nine players, nor less than two players, and the
167 nonplayer dealer at each table.
168 Section 6. Wagers; Limitations
169 (a) No wagering may be conducted using money or other negotiable currency. Games
170 may only be played utilizing a wagering system whereby all players’ money is first converted by
171 the house to tokens or chips which shall be used for wagering only at that specific cardroom.
172 (b) The cardroom operator may limit the amount wagered in any game or series of
173 games.
174 (c) A tournament shall consist of a series of games. The entry fee for a tournament may

9 of 15
176 provided to all participants in exchange for an entry fee and any subsequent re-buys. All players
177 must receive an equal number of tournament chips for their entry fee. Tournament chips have no
178 cash value and represent tournament points only. There is no limitation on the number of
179 tournament chips that may be used for a bet except as otherwise determined by the cardroom
180 operator. Tournament chips may never be redeemed for cash or for any other thing of value. The
181 distribution of prizes and cash awards must be determined by the cardroom operator before entry
182 fees are accepted. For purposes of tournament play only, the term “gross receipts” means the
183 total amount received by the cardroom operator for all entry fees, player re-buys, and fees for
184 participating in the tournament less the total amount paid to the winners or others as prizes.
185 Section 7. Bond Requirement
186 The holder of a cardroom license shall be financially and otherwise responsible for the
187 operation of the cardroom and for the conduct of any manager, dealer, or other employee
188 involved in the operation of the cardroom. Prior to the issuance of a cardroom license, each
189 applicant for such license shall provide evidence of a surety bond in the amount of $50,000,
190 payable to the commonwealth, furnished by a corporate surety authorized to do business in the
191 state or evidence that the licensee’s pari-mutuel bond required by chapter 128C has been
192 expanded to include the applicant’s cardroom operation. The bond shall guarantee that the
193 cardroom operator will redeem, for cash, all tokens or chips used in games. Such bond shall be
194 kept in full force and effect by the operator during the term of the license.
195 Section 8. Fees for and Prohibitions from Participation
196 (a) The cardroom operator may charge a fee for the right to participate in games
197 conducted at the cardroom. Such fee may be either a flat fee or hourly rate for the use of a seat at
10 of 15
198 a table or a rake subject to the posted maximum amount but may not be based on the amount
199 won by players. The rake-off, if any, must be made in an obvious manner and placed in a
200 designated rake area which is clearly visible to all players. Notice of the amount of the
201 participation fee charged shall be posted in a conspicuous place in the cardroom and at each table
202 at all times.
203 (b) A cardroom operator may not have any direct economic interest in a poker game
204 played in a peer-to-peer player manner, except for the rake.
205 (c) A cardroom operator may not receive any portion of the winnings of a poker game
206 played in a peer-to-peer player manner, except for the rake. Nothing herein prohibits a cardroom
207 operator from collecting optional wagers made by players and a predetermined amount of the pot
208 to be used for awarding progressive jackpots, provided that amount to be collected is posted in a
209 conspicuous place at the table and the entire amount collected by the cardroom operator is
210 awarded to jackpot winners.
211 Section 9. Records and Reports
212 (a) Each licensee operating a cardroom shall keep and maintain permanent daily
213 records of its cardroom operation and shall maintain such records for a period of not less than
214 three years. These records shall include all financial transactions and contain sufficient detail to
215 determine compliance with the requirements of this section. All records shall be available for
216 audit and inspection by the division or other law enforcement agencies during the licensee’s
217 regular business hours. The information required in such records shall be determined by division
218 rule.
11 of 15
219 (b) Each licensee operating a cardroom shall file with the division a report containing
220 the required records of such cardroom operation. Such report shall be filed monthly by licensees.
221 The required reports shall be submitted on forms prescribed by the division and shall be due at
222 the same time as the monthly pari-mutuel reports are due to the division, and such reports shall
223 contain any additional information deemed necessary by the division, and the reports shall be
224 deemed public records once filed.
225 Section 10. Prohibited Activities
226 (a) No person licensed to operate a cardroom may conduct any banking game or any
227 game not specifically authorized by this section or operate any game that are authorized by

229 approved by the Commonwealth on March 19, 2013.

239 the cardroom operation’s monthly gross receipts.
12 of 15

241 licensee’s cardroom facility is imposed on each person entering the cardroom. This admission
242 tax shall apply only if a separate admission fee is charged for entry to the cardroom facility. The
243 cardroom licensee shall be responsible for collecting the admission tax. An admission tax is
244 imposed on any free passes or complimentary cards issued to guests by licensees in an amount
245 equal to the tax imposed on the regular and usual admission charge for entrance to the licensee’s
246 cardroom facility. A cardroom licensee may issue tax-free passes to its officers, officials, and
247 employees or other persons actually engaged in working at the cardroom, including accredited
248 press representatives such as reporters and editors, and may also issue tax-free passes to other
249 cardroom licensees for the use of their officers and officials.
250 (c) Payment of the admission tax and gross receipts tax imposed by this section shall be
251 deposited as follows: 80% into the Gaming Local Aid Fund established by section 63 of chapter

254 taxes remitted during the preceding calendar month. Such report shall, under oath, indicate the
255 total of all admissions, the cardroom activities for the preceding calendar month, and such other

257 (e) The failure of any licensee to make payments as prescribed in this section may be
258 subjected by the division to a civil penalty of up to $1,000 for each day the tax payment is not
259 remitted. If a licensee continues to fail to make payments as prescribed in this section for 30 days
260 or more, the division may suspend or revoke the license of the cardroom operator or deny
261 issuance of any further license to the cardroom operator.
13 of 15
262 (f) The cardroom shall be deemed an accessory use to a licensed pari-mutuel operation
263 and, except as otherwise provided, a municipality, county, or political subdivision may not assess
264 or collect any additional license tax, sales tax, or excise tax on such cardroom operation.
265 Section 12. Suspension, Revocation, or Denial of License; Fine
266 (a) The division may deny a license or the renewal thereof, or may suspend or revoke
267 any license, when the applicant has: violated or failed to comply with the provisions of this

269 with another to cause any person to violate this section or any rules adopted pursuant thereto; or
270 obtained a license or permit by fraud, misrepresentation, or concealment; or if the holder of such

272 (b) If a pari-mutuel permitholder’s pari-mutuel permit or license is suspended or
273 revoked by the division pursuant to chapter 128C, the division may, but is not required to,
274 suspend or revoke such permitholder’s cardroom license. If a cardroom operator’s license is
275 suspended or revoked pursuant to this section, the division may, but is not required to, suspend
276 or revoke such licensee’s pari-mutuel permit or license.
277 (c) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the division may impose an
278 administrative fine not to exceed $1,000 for each violation against any person who has violated
279 or failed to comply with the provisions of this section or any rules adopted pursuant thereto.

of the same, as follows:
1 SECTION 1. The Massachusetts General Laws, as so appearing, are hereby amended by
2 adding the following new chapter:-
3 CHAPTER 128D
4 Peer-to-Peer Cardrooms for Class II Gaming
5 Section 1. Intent
6 It is the intent of the Legislature to provide additional entertainment choices for the
7 residents of and visitors to the commonwealth, promote tourism, and provide additional revenues
8 through the authorization of the playing of certain games at facilities known as cardrooms which
9 are to be located at licensed pari-mutuel facilities. To ensure the public confidence in the
10 integrity of authorized cardroom operations, this act is designed to strictly regulate the facilities,
1 of 15

11 persons, and procedures related to cardroom operations. Furthermore, the Legislature finds that
12 authorized games as herein defined are considered to be pari-mutuel style games and not casino
13 gaming because the participants play against each other instead of against the house.

139 (c) A cardroom operator must at all times employ and provide a nonplaying dealer for
140 each table on which authorized card games which traditionally use a dealer are conducted at the
141 cardroom. Such dealers may not have a participatory interest in any game other than the dealing
142 of cards and may not have an interest in the outcome of the game. The providing of such dealers
143 by a licensee does not constitute the conducting of a banking game by the cardroom operator.
144 (d) A cardroom operator may award giveaways, jackpots, and prizes to a player who
145 holds certain combinations of cards specified by the cardroom operator, including a progressive
146 jackpot in which a player makes an optional wager and a winning player is awarded a jackpot
147 from funds that have accumulated from various poker games.

156 enforcement agency during the licensee’s regular business hours.
157 (g) A cardroom operator may refuse entry to or refuse to allow any person who is

165 in cardroom license applications approved by the division.

177 must receive an equal number of tournament chips for their entry fee. Tournament chips have no
178 cash value and represent tournament points only. There is no limitation on the number of
179 tournament chips that may be used for a bet except as otherwise determined by the cardroom
180 operator. Tournament chips may never be redeemed for cash or for any other thing of value. The
181 distribution of prizes and cash awards must be determined by the cardroom operator before entry
182 fees are accepted. For purposes of tournament play only, the term “gross receipts” means the
183 total amount received by the cardroom operator for all entry fees, player re-buys, and fees for
184 participating in the tournament less the total amount paid to the winners or others as prizes.
185 Section 7. Bond Requirement
186 The holder of a cardroom license shall be financially and otherwise responsible for the
187 operation of the cardroom and for the conduct of any manager, dealer, or other employee
188 involved in the operation of the cardroom. Prior to the issuance of a cardroom license, each
189 applicant for such license shall provide evidence of a surety bond in the amount of $50,000,
190 payable to the commonwealth, furnished by a corporate surety authorized to do business in the
191 state or evidence that the licensee’s pari-mutuel bond required by chapter 128C has been
192 expanded to include the applicant’s cardroom operation. The bond shall guarantee that the
193 cardroom operator will redeem, for cash, all tokens or chips used in games. Such bond shall be
194 kept in full force and effect by the operator during the term of the license.
195 Section 8. Fees for and Prohibitions from Participation
196 (a) The cardroom operator may charge a fee for the right to participate in games
197 conducted at the cardroom. Such fee may be either a flat fee or hourly rate for the use of a seat at
10 of 15

198 a table or a rake subject to the posted maximum amount but may not be based on the amount
199 won by players. The rake-off, if any, must be made in an obvious manner and placed in a
200 designated rake area which is clearly visible to all players. Notice of the amount of the
201 participation fee charged shall be posted in a conspicuous place in the cardroom and at each table
202 at all times.
203 (b) A cardroom operator may not have any direct economic interest in a poker game
204 played in a peer-to-peer player manner, except for the rake.
205 (c) A cardroom operator may not receive any portion of the winnings of a poker game
206 played in a peer-to-peer player manner, except for the rake. Nothing herein prohibits a cardroom
207 operator from collecting optional wagers made by players and a predetermined amount of the pot
208 to be used for awarding progressive jackpots, provided that amount to be collected is posted in a
209 conspicuous place at the table and the entire amount collected by the cardroom operator is
210 awarded to jackpot winners.

215 determine compliance with the requirements of this section. All records shall be available for
216 audit and inspection by the division or other law enforcement agencies during the licensee’s
217 regular business hours. The information required in such records shall be determined by division
218 rule.
11 of 15

219 (b) Each licensee operating a cardroom shall file with the division a report containing
220 the required records of such cardroom operation. Such report shall be filed monthly by licensees.
221 The required reports shall be submitted on forms prescribed by the division and shall be due at
222 the same time as the monthly pari-mutuel reports are due to the division, and such reports shall
223 contain any additional information deemed necessary by the division, and the reports shall be
224 deemed public records once filed.

260 or more, the division may suspend or revoke the license of the cardroom operator or deny
261 issuance of any further license to the cardroom operator.
13 of 15

263 and, except as otherwise provided, a municipality, county, or political subdivision may not assess
264 or collect any additional license tax, sales tax, or excise tax on such cardroom operation.
265 Section 12. Suspension, Revocation, or Denial of License; Fine
