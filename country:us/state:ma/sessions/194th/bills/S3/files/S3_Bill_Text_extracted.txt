Dear Members of the Massachusetts State Senate,
great honor and distinct privilege to present the Committee’s annual recommendations for the
General Appropriations Act—the Fiscal Year 2026 (FY 2026) Budget.
Thank you to Senate President Karen Spilka for her enduring partnership and continued
confidence in me to lead the Committee as we work together to advance a fiscally responsible and
sound budget plan for FY 2026. Faced with rising federal uncertainty, our budget strives to protect
core services for our most vulnerable populations and chart a sustainable pathway forward for the
Commonwealth.
I would like to also thank our friends in the House Committee on Ways & Means,
especially Chair Aaron Michlewitz and his staff as well as our counterparts in the Healey-Driscoll
Administration, Secretary Matthew Gorzkowicz and his staff in the Executive Office for
Administration and Finance. Because of their ongoing partnership, our diligent efforts to
collaborate and remain clear-eyed over these last few years have allowed us to preserve our state’s
fiscal health and responsibly meet the needs of our residents.
Today, we find ourselves in an “all-hands on deck” situation as discussions about major
federal funding plans to cut billions in spending have ramped up in Washington and fueled further
uncertainty. Clouding the Commonwealth’s short- and long-term fiscal outlook, the plans being
contemplated at the federal level represent a visibly growing threat that could impact nearly $16
billion in federal financial assistance, primarily related to MassHealth, which is used to support
our most vulnerable populations. While Congress has yet to act, significant concerns persist about
the future of the second largest revenue source, which we rely upon to balance the state budget,
potentially undermining our capacity to navigate uncharted fiscal terrain if reductions to federal
Medicaid funding become reality.
Additionally, the ongoing trade war propelled by the federal government is driving the
economy towards the precipice of a possible downturn. Simply considering the costs alone brought
on by federally imposed trade barriers could have far-reaching ripple effects for the health of our
economy, further burdening our residents, sapping business confidence, hurting Main Street, and
blunting our ongoing work to advance the state’s competitiveness and tackle affordability
challenges. Moreover, highlighting the uncertain fiscal climate before us, tax revenue collections
– after spiking to record highs during the pandemic – have regressed to a more modest pre-
pandemic level of revenue growth, arriving at a time when significant cost pressures have
intensified, and the future of available federal financial assistance has grown murkier.
Mindful of our current challenges, the fog of federal uncertainty, and stiff economic
headwinds, a steady and stable hand is essential as we adjust to the evolving landscape without
undermining the fiscal integrity of the Commonwealth. To that end, I present the Senate
Committee on Ways and Means FY 2026 budget recommendations for your respectful
consideration. The Committee’s FY 2026 budget proposal reflects the advocacy of residents across
the Commonwealth, considers the voices of every single Senator, and underscores the diligent
work of the dedicated staff at Senate Ways and Means, whose commitment to public service is
exemplary.
Anchored in the principle of fiscal responsibility, the Committee’s budget reflects the
Senate’s deep and steadfast desire to achieve long-term sustainability and protect core services for
our most vulnerable populations during this increasingly volatile and uncertain economic time.
Built on a sensible consensus revenue tax estimate, the Committee’s budget recommends an
approach that endeavors to address several areas essential to reinforcing and strengthening the
Commonwealth’s broader economic foundation, investing significant resources into education,
transportation, local aid, health and human services, housing, public safety and other vital areas,
while further ensuring that we never forget state government’s solemn responsibility to care for,
help, and support the residents of this Commonwealth, especially our most vulnerable populations.
Again, thank you to my good friend, Senate President Karen Spilka, for her steadfast
leadership and continued confidence in me to lead the Committee. I would also like to thank all
the members of the Senate Committee on Ways and Means, especially Vice Chair Senator Jo Ann
Comerford of Northampton, Assistant Vice Chair Senator Paul Feeney of Foxboro, and Ranking
Minority Member Senator Patrick O’Connor of Weymouth for providing their invaluable input
and help in writing the Committee’s FY 2026 budget recommendations.
Finally, thank you to all my colleagues for lending your voices and sharing your concerns
throughout this process. The time, effort, and dedication that went into crafting and producing this
Committee budget reflect your thoughtfulness, sincerity, and passion for addressing our shared
priorities, helping our constituents, and supporting policy making that upholds Senate values.
In the days and weeks ahead, I am confident that we – in the Senate – will all work together
to pass a balanced and fiscally responsible FY 2026 budget plan that strives to protect core services
for our most vulnerable and charts a sustainable pathway forward as we navigate rising uncertainty
without undermining the fiscal integrity of the Commonwealth.
For the Committee,
Michael J. Rodrigues
Chair, Senate Committee on Ways and Means
Senate Committee on Ways and Means
Fiscal Year 2026 Budget Recommendations
on the
Executive Summary
As we adapt, plan, and chart a way forward through the fog of uncertainty and stiffening economic
headwinds, the Senate Committee on Ways and Means Fiscal Year 2026 (FY 2026)
recommendations take a fiscally responsible approach. It strives to collectively manage increasing
cost pressures and adjust to slower revenue growth, while we – in the Senate - remain vigilant
about the growing threat of potential federal actions that represent a clear and present danger to
the underlying health and well-being of our residents and the continued stability of our
Commonwealth’s broader economy.
Reflecting the advocacy and priorities of each Senator, the Committee’s FY 2026 budget proposes
to safeguard the state’s fiscal health, achieve long-term sustainability, and protect core services for
our most vulnerable residents. Prioritizing prudent budget management, the Committee’s
recommendations invest heavily in education, health and human services, housing, local aid, and
transportation, ensuring we never forget our responsibility to care for, help, and support the people
of this great Commonwealth during this incredibly turbulent and volatile time.
In accordance with the consensus revenue agreement reached in January, this responsible and
prudent spending recommendation is based on a tax revenue estimate of $41.214 billion for FY
2026, representing a 2.25 percent increase over the current Fiscal Year 2025 (FY 2025)
benchmark. Ensuring state spending is responsibly aligned with the estimated level of tax revenue
growth while meeting our fiduciary commitments, the Committee’s budget recommends a total of
$61.33 billion in spending, a $3.61 billion increase over the FY 2025 General Appropriations Act
(GAA) and $627 million below the Governor’s FY 2026 budget proposal in House 1.
The Committee’s budget also includes $1.95 billion in estimated revenues generated from the Fair
Share surtax to support education and transportation initiatives, an increase of $650 million in
additional surtax funds available to invest over FY 2025. In addition, the Committee’s budget plan
does not raise taxes on our residents, nor does it draw from the “Rainy-Day fund,” preserving
readily available reserves for potential use in the event of a future economic downturn.
With these budget recommendations, our economic and fiscal foundation will remain firmly
anchored as we navigate the increasing uncertainty without undermining the fiscal integrity of the
Commonwealth.
1
Maximizing Fair Share Investments to Improve Education and Transportation
In accordance with the consensus revenue agreement reached in January, the FY 2026 budget
includes $1.95 billion in estimated revenues generated from the Fair Share surtax. This represents
the third year in which the Committee’s budget dedicates these revenues to fund a host of initiatives
that will further reinforce two vital cornerstones of our state’s economic foundation by boosting
support for quality public education investments and bolstering the state’s transportation
infrastructure. These investments combine with $1.28 billion in critical education and
transportation projects recently funded in the Senate’s Fair Share supplemental budget, supported
by surtax collections that have exceeded expectations in recent years.
As we brace for future federal actions, there remains significant concern for additional economic
uncertainty and ongoing market volatility, which could disproportionally impact high income
earners who are subject to the Fair Share surtax. In line with our steadfast commitment to uphold
fiscal responsibility, the Committee budget recommends depositing $165 million of the $1.95
billion currently projected to be collected in Fair Share surtax revenues into the Education and
Transportation Reserve fund. With this prudent step, we are setting aside available resources as a
downpayment to maintain our commitments to key public education programming and
transportation infrastructure in the event there are significant changes to the economy because of
future federal disruptions.
Notable Fair Share Education investments include:
• $325 million for the Commonwealth Cares for Children (C3) grant program, which is
matched with $150 million in funds from the General Fund and the Early Education and
Care Operational Grant Fund, for a total investment of $475 million.

Fare Relief, year-round ferry service and the MBTA Academy. Together with the
supplemental budget recently released, the Committee is dedicating $820 million in
operating resources to fully fund MBTA’s operations for FY 2026.
• $120 million to support Regional Transit Authorities (RTAs) across the state, which
together with the resources from General Fund funds provides a record $214 million for
RTAs. Fair Share funding includes:

• $40 million to support complete fare free fixed-route access across all Regional
Transit Authorities.

economic hubs

disabilities.
• $78 million for debt service for expanded new bond capacity for the Commonwealth
Transportation Fund (CTF) for essential transportation project across the Commonwealth.
By committing $600 million to the CTF, the Committee budget will unlock additional bond
capacity for critical transportation projects over the next ten years.
• $52 million in operating support for the Massachusetts Department of Transportation.
Education
The Senate Ways and Means Committee budget makes strong commitments to supporting each
education sector and students of all ages by maintaining investments in high quality education to
help reinforce a foundational cornerstone of our economy. The Committee’s budget fully funds
the fifth year of the Student Opportunity Act, provides a historic funding commitment to the
Department of Early Education and Care, following the passage of the EARLY ED Act, and stands
by our public and private institutions of higher education amid this incredibly volatile time.
Early Education and Care
Building off the successful passage of last year’s EARLY ED Act, the Senate Ways and Means
Committee budget supports a significant investment of $1.7 billion to maintain accessibility and
3
affordability of our high-quality early education and care sector. With this level of funding, we are
continuing to show strong support for our early education workforce, protect early education
programming, and maintain access to affordable care across every region of the Commonwealth
during this time of rising economic anxiety for many families.

consultation services.
Elementary and Secondary Education
Supporting school districts across Massachusetts, whether it be urban, suburban, regional,
vocational–technical, or rural, has been a long-standing hallmark of the Senate, and the
Committee’s budget features our strong support for our schools and our students, dedicating
significant funds to support our public K-12 education system and respond to the urgent fiscal
challenges confronting our communities.
Chapter 70/The Student Opportunity Act. Consistent with our unyielding commitment to fully
implement the Student Opportunity Act by FY 2027, we fund Chapter 70 at its highest level ever
at $7.3 billion, representing an increase of $460 million over FY 2025. Aware of the significant
financial challenges and constraints facing all school districts, the Committee’s budget also
increases minimum aid for school districts to a historic level of $150 per pupil, devoting an
additional $39.6 million in resources for FY 2026 to extend a much-needed helping hand to school
districts confronting the increasing costs and feeling the weight of immense fiscal pressures that
come with the responsibility of delivering high-quality public education to all students across the
Commonwealth.
4
School District Reimbursements. The Committee’s budget provides additional resources to
support school districts with extraordinary costs of special education, charter school tuition,
regional school transportation, and educating students in our rural communities. Consequently, the
Committee’s budget allocates $492 million for the Special Education Circuit Breaker in addition
to the $190 million included in the Fair Share supplemental budget recently released by the
Committee. Together, with the Fair Share supplemental funding, the Committee is recommending
$740 million to reimburse school districts for the high cost of educating students with disabilities.
It also includes $183 million to reimburse school districts for costs incurred when students leave
to attend charter schools, $103.7 million for regional school transportation from both General Fund
and Fair Share resources, along with study language to address how to contain rising school
transportation costs, and it includes $16 million in funding for rural school aid.

emotional learning programs and services for students.
• $3 million for the Genocide Education Trust Fund to support ongoing efforts to educate

• $1 million for Hate Crimes Prevention Grants to support K-12 schools with the education
and prevention of hate crimes and incidences of bias in public schools.
Higher Education
As a long-standing cornerstone of the Commonwealth’s economic foundation, our public higher
education institutions are under constant duress brought forth by the actions of the current federal
government. Recognizing the current upheaval, along with stiffening cost pressures, the
Committee’s budget dedicates resources to maintain support and protect access to our public
higher education system, consisting of 15 community colleges, 12 state universities, and the 5
campuses of the University of Massachusetts, our flagship state university system, all of which are
incredibly vital to meeting the education and employment needs of our citizens, and critical to the
core of our state’s resilient economic ecosystem.

2022 public higher education access law throughout our public higher education system.
Free Community College. For the second year, the Committee’s budget dedicates necessary
resources to fully fund the Commonwealth’s universal community college program — free of
tuition and fees. Maintaining last year’s success in fulfilling the Senate President’s vision, the
Committee’s budget invests $120 million to continue support for this vital educational access and
workforce development initiative in a regionally equitable manner across the Commonwealth and
includes funding to support efforts to address workforce shortages and training access to those
looking for opportunities as paramedics and EMTs.
Local and Regional Aid
Highlighting the Senate’s enduring and unyielding commitment to a strong and productive state-
local partnership, the Committee’s budget once again provides significant resources to support all
our cities and towns, further ensuring that we protect the needs of every region, city, and town,
and leave no corner of our Commonwealth behind during this incredibly volatile time.
Unrestricted General Government Aid (UGGA). To sustain this productive partnership, the
Committee’s budget provides certainty for cities and towns, funding UGGA at $1.337 billion, an
increase of $28.7 million over FY 2025. With this level of funding, cities and towns will receive
funds to maintain public services as they collectively manage municipal budgets and confront
increased fiscal constraints at a time when they’re experiencing limited growth in municipal
revenues.
Special Commission on UGGA. The Committee’s budget establishes a special commission to
study the distribution method used to allocate UGGA to municipalities, evaluate the effectiveness
and equity of the method and make recommendations to maximize the equity of the distribution
for our communities.
6
Regional Transit Authorities (RTAs). As an essential public service, our RTAs connect cities,
towns, and regions, providing a crucial connection for commuters, students, seniors, and people
with disabilities. Doubling down on our commitment to regional equity, the Committee’s budget
provides $214 million to support our regional public transit system, including $120 million from
Fair Share funds, to maintain and continue expansions to regional bus service, sustain systemwide
fare free transit service, and support RTA commuter operations.
Codifying RTA Fare Free. The Committee’s budget includes provisions codifying fare free RTA
service, requiring all RTAs to eliminate passenger fares for fixed route and ADA required
paratransit service.
PILOT. Supplementing conventional sources of local aid, the Committee’s budget increases
resources for payments in lieu of taxes (PILOT) for state-owned land to impacted municipalities,
providing $54.5 million in additional revenue to help ease the budgets of cities and towns, ensuring
they can fund essential local services.
Arts, Culture and Libraries. Across Massachusetts, our arts, culture, and libraries are institutions
that remain core to the fabric of our communities during this incredibly turbulent and uncertain
economic time. Ensuring that arts and culture programs are sustained locally, while maintaining
access to a range of information, services, and programs that local libraries provide, the
Committee’s budget includes $52.4 million for libraries, including $19 million for regional library
local aid, $20 million for municipal libraries and $6.2 million for technology and automated
resource networks, and $26 million for the Massachusetts Cultural Council to support local
creative initiatives.
Health & Human Services
Protecting access to high-quality health care and human services, the Committee’s budget makes
a range of investments to further maintain our state’s safety net, protect core services, and ensure
care, help, and support for our most vulnerable citizens is not disrupted during this incredibly
uncertain and volatile time. Additionally, to address the Commonwealth’s ongoing health and
human services workforce challenges, the Committee budget invests in direct-care providers
across the continuum of care by increasing Chapter 257 service rates with $207 million in FY

Section 2:
2026. Subsequently, recognizing the growing costs of the state’s Personal Care Attendant (PCA)
program, the Committee’s budget extends the PCA task force created in FY 2025 to report on
long-term sustainability including recommending cost-growth targets and requiring the Executive
Office of Health Human Services to create a plan and timeline to implement the recommendations.
These important investments and reforms underscore the Committee’s strong commitment to
ensuring accessible, sustainable, and quality health and human services for Massachusetts
residents despite the current federal uncertainty.
7
MassHealth
The Committee’s budget funds MassHealth, the state’s Medicaid and Children’s Health Insurance
Program (CHIP), at a total of $22.41 billion ($8.48 billion net), a gross increase of $2.34 million
(11.7%) over the FY 2025 funding level. Amid uncertainty in Washington, the Committee’s
budget maintains access to comprehensive health care coverage for over 2 million of our
Commonwealth’s residents. MassHealth covers more than 1 in 4 residents, nearly half of all
children and 7 out of every 10 nursing facility residents.
• $1.73 billion to support the Personal Care Attendant program and the historic collective
bargaining agreement which raised the wage scale to $25 an hour.

additional $112 million in expanded base rates to maintain competitive wages in the
Commonwealth’s nursing facility workforce.

last session’s Long-Term Care Act, Chapter 197 of the Acts of 2024.
• $13.8 million to expand the state’s primary care investment strategy through enhanced
primary care sub-capitation rates.
• $5.3 million to enhance access to outpatient behavioral health and addiction services.
Mental Health
Throughout the course of Senate President Spilka’s tenure, the Senate has been a leader on
expanding and protecting access to behavioral and mental health care. As we sustain our efforts to
maintain the landmark success of the 2022 Mental Health ABC Act, the Committee’s budget
safeguards the delivery of mental health care and services in an accessible and equitable manner,
protecting over $1.3 billion in a wide range of investments in mental health services and prevention
programs vital to the overall health and well-being of adults and children in need.
• $690 million for Adult Support Services, including $15.5 million to support jail diversion
initiatives to divert individuals with mental illness and substance use disorders from the
criminal justice system and connect them with appropriate treatment.

adults.

a variety of behavioral health initiatives.

forgiveness.
Public Health
Undoubtedly, the Senate’s commitment to supporting our state’s public health infrastructure and
maintaining the quality of life for our residents continues to remain vital during this volatile time.
To that end, the Committee’s budget makes significant investments to further protect public health
programs and services that support wellness, combat illness and promote healthier communities
across the Commonwealth, regardless of race, income or zip code.

of the Pappas Rehabilitation Hospital for Children for FY 2026.

infrastructure, and safety.
9
People with Disabilities
Protecting equal access to opportunities and dignity for people with disabilities is more critically
important now than ever before as we face a federal government hellbent on dismantling the
disability community. As such, the Committee’s budget invests over $3.2 billion into a diverse
array of services and programs for people with intellectual, physical, and developmental
disabilities, ensuring Massachusetts remains a more equitable, accessible, and inclusive place for
people with disabilities in the face of ongoing uncertainty and mounting federal threats.

Aging and Independence
Recognizing that we must continue to support our increasingly aging population despite existing
federal uncertainty, the Committee’s budget dedicates meaningful resources to reinforce and
sustain support for several programs and services that focus on the health and wellness of our aging
residents, further supporting their right to live independently and remain in their homes within the
community.

Protecting Children and Working Families
As we brace for future federal actions and move forward in the face of stiff economic headwinds,
the Committee’s budget takes steps to provide direct assistance and maintain support for our most
vulnerable citizens and working families. As such, this budget sustains our past progresses and
protects investments in child assistance, food security, and economic security initiatives.
TAFDC/EAEDC Benefits. The Committee’s budget annualizes a 10 percent increase from FY
2025 for Transitional Aid to Families with Dependent Children (TAFDC) and Emergency Aid to
the Elderly, Disabled and Children (EAEDC), which maintains crucial benefits for individuals and
working families experiencing deep poverty. This annualization signals that the Senate will
continue to uphold its commitment to support working families, amidst the ongoing uncertainty.
School Clothing Allowance. The Committee’s budget once again recognizes the challenges
associated with raising a child in a high-cost state, especially for low-income families. In response,
our budget provides funding to support a $500 per child clothing allowance, ensuring vital

In the face of challenging fiscal circumstances, the Senate continues to faithfully uphold its
commitment to support the brave men and women who have served our nation honorably to protect
our liberty and our way of life. Last year, the Legislature passed the historic HERO Act, which
included comprehensive reforms that increased benefits and modernized services for veterans
residing in Massachusetts. The Committee’s budget recommendations for the Executive Office of
Veterans’ Services continue the Senate’s faithful support for our veteran population.
This includes funding support for the core services under the Executive Office, including veteran
outreach centers, shelters for homeless veterans, and veterans’ benefits, as well continued support

enacting the Affordable Homes Act, which provides over $5 billion in capital authorization to
bolster affordable housing development and access across Massachusetts.
As such, the Committee’s budget further compliments last year’s successful efforts and invests

property be paid by the contracting agent, ensuring that buyers are not burdened with unexpected
and extraordinary costs.

Supporting Economic and Workforce Development
The Senate recognizes that the economic and workforce development needs of every community,
every region, and every employer are intrinsically connected to supporting the Commonwealth’s
long-term economic health and success. On the heels of last year’s successful passage of the Mass
Leads Act, which infused nearly $4 billion into the Commonwealth’s economy while making a
host of wide-ranging policy changes to make Massachusetts more competitive, the Committee’s
budget maintains investments in programs that support workforce opportunities for residents,

farmers, and advancing clean energy remain critically important priorities for the Senate. To that
end, the Committee’s budget invests $470.3 million to deliver on our commitments to protect our

Section 78:
SECTION 3. Notwithstanding any general or special law to the contrary, for the fiscal year ending June
30, 2026 the distribution of unrestricted general government aid to cities and towns of the balance of the
State Lottery and Gaming Fund, as paid from the General Fund in accordance with clause (c) of the
second paragraph of section 35 of chapter 10 of the General Laws, and additional funds from the General
Fund and the Gaming Local Aid Fund, shall be $1,337,505,369 and shall be apportioned to cities and
towns in accordance with this section.
For fiscal year 2026 the total amounts to be distributed and paid to each city, town and regional school
district from item 7061-0008 of section 2 and item 1596-2450 of section 2F, shall be as set forth in the
following lists. If there is conflict between the language of this section and the distribution listed below,
the distribution below shall control. The specified amounts distributed from said item 7061-0008 of said

Section 79:
section 2 and said item 1596-2450 of said section 2F shall be deemed in full satisfaction of the amounts
due under chapter 70 of the General Laws.
For fiscal year 2026, a district’s school aid shall be calculated according to the provisions of said chapter
70, as most recently amended by Chapter 132 of the Acts of 2019, also known as the Student Opportunity
Act. The foundation budget category of “low-income enrollment” for the purpose of calculating
foundation enrollment shall be determined by financial eligibility for certain federal programs, as defined
by the provisions of section 2 of said chapter 70, and including a number of students identified and
approved as low income through the supplemental claiming system established and posted by the
department for that purpose, as well as students identified and approved as homeless for purposes of
calculating the McKinney-Vento homelessness grant program administered by the department,
consistent with the conditions provided for in said section 2. Provided further, that the assumed special
education enrollment percentage for vocational school students shall be set at 4.97 per cent and the
assumed special education enrollment percentage for non-vocational school students shall be set at 3.97
per cent.
The per-pupil rates for the employee benefits and fixed charges allotments shall be adjusted by the
foundation employee benefits inflation rate and the per-pupil rates for all other foundation allotments
shall be adjusted by the foundation inflation index. Foundation increments shall be the additional
resources provided for the education of students designated as English learners or low-income; provided,
however, that for low-income students the amount of the foundation increment shall be determined by
the low-income group into which each district is assigned. Foundation budget rates for employee benefits
and fixed charges, guidance and psychological services, special education out-of-district tuition, English
learners and low-income students shall be increased by five-sixths of the gap between the rates used in
fiscal year 2021 and the rates established in tables 1 and 2 of section 3 of said chapter 70, consistent with
adjustments prescribed in said section 3 and set at the rates identified in the table below. Required local
contributions shall be calculated pursuant to said chapter 70; provided, that municipal revenue growth
factors shall be calculated in a manner consistent with calculations made in fiscal year 2025; provided
further, that the total statewide target local contribution shall be 59 percent and the effort reduction
percentage shall be 100 percent; and provided further that the minimum aid per pupil dollar amount shall
be $150.
Chapter 70 aid for fiscal year 2026 shall be the greater of: (i) foundation aid, or (ii) the sum of base aid
and minimum aid. No non-operating district shall receive chapter 70 aid in an amount greater than the
district’s foundation budget.
The department of elementary and secondary education shall not consider health care costs for retired
teachers to be part of net school spending for any district in which such costs were not considered part
of net school spending in fiscal year 1994 and for any district that has not accepted the provisions of

Section 80:
section 260 of chapter 165 of the acts of 2014; provided, however, that any district for whom such costs
are not so considered shall have included as part of net school spending an amount equal to the increase
in the foundation budget for the district associated with health care costs of retired teachers.
No payments to cities, towns or counties maintaining an agricultural school under this section shall be
made after November 30 of the fiscal year until the commissioner of revenue certifies acceptance of the
prior fiscal year’s annual financial reports submitted under section 43 of chapter 44 of the General Laws.
Advance payments shall be made for some or all of periodic local reimbursement or assistance programs
to any city, town, regional school district or independent agricultural school that demonstrates an
emergency cash shortfall, as certified by the commissioner of revenue and approved by the secretary of
administration and finance, under guidelines established by the secretary.

447 (a) A tax is hereby imposed upon the transfer of the estate of each person dying on or
448 after January 1, 1997 who, at the time of death, was a resident of the commonwealth. The
449 amount of the tax shall be equal to the credit for state death taxes that would have been allowable
450 to a decedent’s estate as computed under section 2011 of the Code, as in effect on December 31,
451 2000, hereinafter referred to as the “credit”. The credit shall be determined based on the value of
452 the federal gross estate after such estate is increased by the value of any property: (i) not
453 included in the federal gross estate; (ii) in which the decedent had at death a qualifying income
454 interest for life described in subsection (c) of section 3A; (iii) for which a deduction was allowed

21
Senate Committee on Ways and Means Fiscal Year 2026 Budget Recommendations
456 decedent; and (iv) which is not real or tangible personal property located outside of the
457 commonwealth at the time of death. If the federal gross estate of a person includes real or
458 tangible personal property located outside of the commonwealth at the time of death, the credit
459 shall be determined based on the value of the federal gross estate after such estate is reduced by
460 the value of such real or tangible personal property located outside of the commonwealth and
461 increased by the value of any property: (A) not included in the federal gross estate; (B) in which
462 the decedent had at death a qualifying income interest for life described in subsection (c) of
463 section 3A; (C) for which a deduction was allowed for Massachusetts estate tax purposes with
464 respect to the transfer of such property to the decedent; and (D) which is not real or tangible
465 personal property located outside of the commonwealth at the time of death; provided, however,
466 that for the purposes of calculating the federal taxable estate, no deduction shall be allowed that
467 is attributable to such real or tangible personal property located outside of the commonwealth.
468 (b) A tax is hereby imposed upon the transfer of real property situated in this
469 commonwealth and upon tangible personal property having an actual situs in this commonwealth
470 of every person who at the time of their death was not a resident of this commonwealth. The
471 amount of this tax is the amount of the credit calculated based upon a federal gross estate that is
472 equal to the sum of: (i) the value of the estate’s real or tangible personal property located in the
473 commonwealth; and (ii) the value of any real or tangible property: (A) not included in the federal
474 gross estate; (B) in which the decedent had at death a qualifying income interest for life
475 described in subsection (c) of section 3A; (C) for which a deduction was allowed for
476 Massachusetts estate tax purposes with respect to the transfer of such property to the decedent;
477 and (D) which is not located outside of the commonwealth at the time of death. Under this
478 subsection, for the purposes of calculating the federal taxable estate, no deduction shall be
22

479 allowed that is attributable to property other than such real or tangible personal property located
480 in the commonwealth.

Dear Members of the Massachusetts State Senate,
For the seventh time as the Chair of the Senate Committee on Ways and Means, I have the
great honor and distinct privilege to present the Committee’s annual recommendations for the
General Appropriations Act—the Fiscal Year 2026 (FY 2026) Budget.
Thank you to Senate President Karen Spilka for her enduring partnership and continued
confidence in me to lead the Committee as we work together to advance a fiscally responsible and
sound budget plan for FY 2026. Faced with rising federal uncertainty, our budget strives to protect
core services for our most vulnerable populations and chart a sustainable pathway forward for the
Commonwealth.
I would like to also thank our friends in the House Committee on Ways & Means,
especially Chair Aaron Michlewitz and his staff as well as our counterparts in the Healey-Driscoll
Administration, Secretary Matthew Gorzkowicz and his staff in the Executive Office for
Administration and Finance. Because of their ongoing partnership, our diligent efforts to
collaborate and remain clear-eyed over these last few years have allowed us to preserve our state’s
fiscal health and responsibly meet the needs of our residents.
Today, we find ourselves in an “all-hands on deck” situation as discussions about major
federal funding plans to cut billions in spending have ramped up in Washington and fueled further
uncertainty. Clouding the Commonwealth’s short- and long-term fiscal outlook, the plans being
contemplated at the federal level represent a visibly growing threat that could impact nearly $16
billion in federal financial assistance, primarily related to MassHealth, which is used to support
our most vulnerable populations. While Congress has yet to act, significant concerns persist about
the future of the second largest revenue source, which we rely upon to balance the state budget,
potentially undermining our capacity to navigate uncharted fiscal terrain if reductions to federal
Medicaid funding become reality.
Additionally, the ongoing trade war propelled by the federal government is driving the
economy towards the precipice of a possible downturn. Simply considering the costs alone brought
on by federally imposed trade barriers could have far-reaching ripple effects for the health of our
economy, further burdening our residents, sapping business confidence, hurting Main Street, and
blunting our ongoing work to advance the state’s competitiveness and tackle affordability
challenges. Moreover, highlighting the uncertain fiscal climate before us, tax revenue collections
– after spiking to record highs during the pandemic – have regressed to a more modest pre-
pandemic level of revenue growth, arriving at a time when significant cost pressures have
intensified, and the future of available federal financial assistance has grown murkier.
Mindful of our current challenges, the fog of federal uncertainty, and stiff economic
headwinds, a steady and stable hand is essential as we adjust to the evolving landscape without
undermining the fiscal integrity of the Commonwealth. To that end, I present the Senate
Committee on Ways and Means FY 2026 budget recommendations for your respectful
consideration. The Committee’s FY 2026 budget proposal reflects the advocacy of residents across

the Commonwealth, considers the voices of every single Senator, and underscores the diligent
work of the dedicated staff at Senate Ways and Means, whose commitment to public service is
exemplary.
Anchored in the principle of fiscal responsibility, the Committee’s budget reflects the
Senate’s deep and steadfast desire to achieve long-term sustainability and protect core services for
our most vulnerable populations during this increasingly volatile and uncertain economic time.
Built on a sensible consensus revenue tax estimate, the Committee’s budget recommends an
approach that endeavors to address several areas essential to reinforcing and strengthening the
Commonwealth’s broader economic foundation, investing significant resources into education,
transportation, local aid, health and human services, housing, public safety and other vital areas,
while further ensuring that we never forget state government’s solemn responsibility to care for,
help, and support the residents of this Commonwealth, especially our most vulnerable populations.
Again, thank you to my good friend, Senate President Karen Spilka, for her steadfast
leadership and continued confidence in me to lead the Committee. I would also like to thank all
the members of the Senate Committee on Ways and Means, especially Vice Chair Senator Jo Ann
Comerford of Northampton, Assistant Vice Chair Senator Paul Feeney of Foxboro, and Ranking
Minority Member Senator Patrick O’Connor of Weymouth for providing their invaluable input
and help in writing the Committee’s FY 2026 budget recommendations.
Finally, thank you to all my colleagues for lending your voices and sharing your concerns
throughout this process. The time, effort, and dedication that went into crafting and producing this
Committee budget reflect your thoughtfulness, sincerity, and passion for addressing our shared
priorities, helping our constituents, and supporting policy making that upholds Senate values.
In the days and weeks ahead, I am confident that we – in the Senate – will all work together
to pass a balanced and fiscally responsible FY 2026 budget plan that strives to protect core services
for our most vulnerable and charts a sustainable pathway forward as we navigate rising uncertainty
without undermining the fiscal integrity of the Commonwealth.
For the Committee,
Michael J. Rodrigues
Chair, Senate Committee on Ways and Means

Senate Committee on Ways and Means
Fiscal Year 2026 Budget Recommendations
on the
Executive Summary
As we adapt, plan, and chart a way forward through the fog of uncertainty and stiffening economic
headwinds, the Senate Committee on Ways and Means Fiscal Year 2026 (FY 2026)
recommendations take a fiscally responsible approach. It strives to collectively manage increasing
cost pressures and adjust to slower revenue growth, while we – in the Senate - remain vigilant
about the growing threat of potential federal actions that represent a clear and present danger to
the underlying health and well-being of our residents and the continued stability of our
Commonwealth’s broader economy.
Reflecting the advocacy and priorities of each Senator, the Committee’s FY 2026 budget proposes
to safeguard the state’s fiscal health, achieve long-term sustainability, and protect core services for
our most vulnerable residents. Prioritizing prudent budget management, the Committee’s
recommendations invest heavily in education, health and human services, housing, local aid, and
transportation, ensuring we never forget our responsibility to care for, help, and support the people
of this great Commonwealth during this incredibly turbulent and volatile time.
In accordance with the consensus revenue agreement reached in January, this responsible and
prudent spending recommendation is based on a tax revenue estimate of $41.214 billion for FY
2026, representing a 2.25 percent increase over the current Fiscal Year 2025 (FY 2025)
benchmark. Ensuring state spending is responsibly aligned with the estimated level of tax revenue
growth while meeting our fiduciary commitments, the Committee’s budget recommends a total of
$61.33 billion in spending, a $3.61 billion increase over the FY 2025 General Appropriations Act
(GAA) and $627 million below the Governor’s FY 2026 budget proposal in House 1.
The Committee’s budget also includes $1.95 billion in estimated revenues generated from the Fair
Share surtax to support education and transportation initiatives, an increase of $650 million in
additional surtax funds available to invest over FY 2025. In addition, the Committee’s budget plan
does not raise taxes on our residents, nor does it draw from the “Rainy-Day fund,” preserving
readily available reserves for potential use in the event of a future economic downturn.
With these budget recommendations, our economic and fiscal foundation will remain firmly
anchored as we navigate the increasing uncertainty without undermining the fiscal integrity of the
Commonwealth.
1

Maximizing Fair Share Investments to Improve Education and Transportation
In accordance with the consensus revenue agreement reached in January, the FY 2026 budget
includes $1.95 billion in estimated revenues generated from the Fair Share surtax. This represents
the third year in which the Committee’s budget dedicates these revenues to fund a host of initiatives
that will further reinforce two vital cornerstones of our state’s economic foundation by boosting
support for quality public education investments and bolstering the state’s transportation
infrastructure. These investments combine with $1.28 billion in critical education and
transportation projects recently funded in the Senate’s Fair Share supplemental budget, supported
by surtax collections that have exceeded expectations in recent years.
As we brace for future federal actions, there remains significant concern for additional economic
uncertainty and ongoing market volatility, which could disproportionally impact high income
earners who are subject to the Fair Share surtax. In line with our steadfast commitment to uphold
fiscal responsibility, the Committee budget recommends depositing $165 million of the $1.95
billion currently projected to be collected in Fair Share surtax revenues into the Education and
Transportation Reserve fund. With this prudent step, we are setting aside available resources as a
downpayment to maintain our commitments to key public education programming and
transportation infrastructure in the event there are significant changes to the economy because of
future federal disruptions.
Notable Fair Share Education investments include:
• $325 million for the Commonwealth Cares for Children (C3) grant program, which is
matched with $150 million in funds from the General Fund and the Early Education and
Care Operational Grant Fund, for a total investment of $475 million.
• $265 million for Student Opportunity Act Expansion, as part of a $460 million increase
from FY 2025 to support the fifth year of the implementation of the Student Opportunity
Act and provide $150 in minimum per pupil aid.
• $170 million for Universal Free School Meals.
• $120 million for universal free community college across the Commonwealth, including
non-credit tuition funding for those seeking to become EMTs and paramedics.
• $100 million to maintain financial aid programs for in-state students attending state
universities through MASSGrant Plus, which is in addition to the $175.2M for scholarships
funded through the General Fund.
• $98 million for Child Care Supports, coupled with a $192.8 million increase in the General
Fund to maintain the current capacity and rates of the child care financial assistance
program.
• $50 million for school transportation reimbursement costs.
• $14 million for State University SUCCESS Funding.
2

• $10 million for the CPPI Pre-K Initiative, matching $17.6 million in funds from the General
Fund, for a total of $27.6 million to support a pathway to universal pre-kindergarten
expansion, including in Gateway Cities and the Summer Step Up program.
• $20 million for Early Literacy Initiatives and Programs.
• $8 million for the Reimagining High School Initiative.
• $5 million for School-based Mental Health Supports and Wraparound Services.
Notable Fair Share Transportation investments include:
• $350 million, for a total of $500 million in funding to support the operation of the
Massachusetts Bay Transit Authority (MBTA), including key initiatives like Low-Income
Fare Relief, year-round ferry service and the MBTA Academy. Together with the
supplemental budget recently released, the Committee is dedicating $820 million in
operating resources to fully fund MBTA’s operations for FY 2026.
• $120 million to support Regional Transit Authorities (RTAs) across the state, which
together with the resources from General Fund funds provides a record $214 million for
RTAs. Fair Share funding includes:
• $66 million in direct operating support for Regional Transit Authorities
• $40 million to support complete fare free fixed-route access across all Regional
Transit Authorities.
• $10 million to incentivize connections between regional transit routes and local
economic hubs
• $4 million to support expanded mobility options for the elderly and people with
disabilities.
• $78 million for debt service for expanded new bond capacity for the Commonwealth
Transportation Fund (CTF) for essential transportation project across the Commonwealth.
By committing $600 million to the CTF, the Committee budget will unlock additional bond
capacity for critical transportation projects over the next ten years.
• $52 million in operating support for the Massachusetts Department of Transportation.
Education
The Senate Ways and Means Committee budget makes strong commitments to supporting each
education sector and students of all ages by maintaining investments in high quality education to
help reinforce a foundational cornerstone of our economy. The Committee’s budget fully funds
the fifth year of the Student Opportunity Act, provides a historic funding commitment to the
Department of Early Education and Care, following the passage of the EARLY ED Act, and stands
by our public and private institutions of higher education amid this incredibly volatile time.
Early Education and Care
Building off the successful passage of last year’s EARLY ED Act, the Senate Ways and Means
Committee budget supports a significant investment of $1.7 billion to maintain accessibility and
3

affordability of our high-quality early education and care sector. With this level of funding, we are
continuing to show strong support for our early education workforce, protect early education
programming, and maintain access to affordable care across every region of the Commonwealth
during this time of rising economic anxiety for many families.
• $517.6 million for Income-Eligible Child Care and $448.2 million for DCF and DTA
Related Child Care, providing critical services for families eligible for subsidized care, in
addition to $98 million on Fair Share to maintain rate increases that are crucial to
supporting the early education workforce.
• $475 million for the Commonwealth Cares for Children (C3) operational grant program
for the third year in a row, supporting critical operational and workforce needs across the
early education sector.
• $44.9 million for EEC Quality Improvement Initiatives.
• $27.6 million for the Commonwealth Preschool Partnership Initiative to maintain access
to universal pre-kindergarten and preschool opportunities in underserved areas.
• $20 million for Childcare Resource and Referral Centers to support parents, childcare
providers, employers, and community groups in navigating the state’s early education and
care landscape.
• $20 million for grants to Head Start programs to promote school readiness for young
children in low-income households.
• $5 million for grants to early education and care providers for childhood mental health
consultation services.
Elementary and Secondary Education
Supporting school districts across Massachusetts, whether it be urban, suburban, regional,
vocational–technical, or rural, has been a long-standing hallmark of the Senate, and the
Committee’s budget features our strong support for our schools and our students, dedicating
significant funds to support our public K-12 education system and respond to the urgent fiscal
challenges confronting our communities.
Chapter 70/The Student Opportunity Act. Consistent with our unyielding commitment to fully
implement the Student Opportunity Act by FY 2027, we fund Chapter 70 at its highest level ever
at $7.3 billion, representing an increase of $460 million over FY 2025. Aware of the significant
financial challenges and constraints facing all school districts, the Committee’s budget also
increases minimum aid for school districts to a historic level of $150 per pupil, devoting an
additional $39.6 million in resources for FY 2026 to extend a much-needed helping hand to school
districts confronting the increasing costs and feeling the weight of immense fiscal pressures that
come with the responsibility of delivering high-quality public education to all students across the
Commonwealth.
4

School District Reimbursements. The Committee’s budget provides additional resources to
support school districts with extraordinary costs of special education, charter school tuition,
regional school transportation, and educating students in our rural communities. Consequently, the
Committee’s budget allocates $492 million for the Special Education Circuit Breaker in addition
to the $190 million included in the Fair Share supplemental budget recently released by the
Committee. Together, with the Fair Share supplemental funding, the Committee is recommending
$740 million to reimburse school districts for the high cost of educating students with disabilities.
It also includes $183 million to reimburse school districts for costs incurred when students leave
to attend charter schools, $103.7 million for regional school transportation from both General Fund
and Fair Share resources, along with study language to address how to contain rising school
transportation costs, and it includes $16 million in funding for rural school aid.
• $58.9 million for Adult Basic Education.
• $29.9 million for the Metropolitan Council for Educational Opportunity (METCO)
program.
• $14.2 million for Early College Programs and $13.1 million for Dual Enrollment, along
with $8 million for Reimagining High School, further empowering high school students to
pursue opportunities by taking college courses prior to graduation.
• $5.9 million for Social Emotional Learning Grants to help K-12 schools support social
emotional learning programs and services for students.
• $3 million for the Genocide Education Trust Fund to support ongoing efforts to educate
middle and high school students on the historical significance of genocide.
• $2.5 million for the Civics Education Trust Fund to maintain a statewide civic
infrastructure, provide professional development to teachers, and ensure that every student
can access high quality civics education.
• $1 million for Hate Crimes Prevention Grants to support K-12 schools with the education
and prevention of hate crimes and incidences of bias in public schools.
Higher Education
As a long-standing cornerstone of the Commonwealth’s economic foundation, our public higher
education institutions are under constant duress brought forth by the actions of the current federal
government. Recognizing the current upheaval, along with stiffening cost pressures, the
Committee’s budget dedicates resources to maintain support and protect access to our public
higher education system, consisting of 15 community colleges, 12 state universities, and the 5
campuses of the University of Massachusetts, our flagship state university system, all of which are
incredibly vital to meeting the education and employment needs of our citizens, and critical to the
core of our state’s resilient economic ecosystem.

university system.

2022 public higher education access law throughout our public higher education system.
Free Community College. For the second year, the Committee’s budget dedicates necessary
resources to fully fund the Commonwealth’s universal community college program — free of
tuition and fees. Maintaining last year’s success in fulfilling the Senate President’s vision, the
Committee’s budget invests $120 million to continue support for this vital educational access and
workforce development initiative in a regionally equitable manner across the Commonwealth and
includes funding to support efforts to address workforce shortages and training access to those
looking for opportunities as paramedics and EMTs.
Local and Regional Aid
Highlighting the Senate’s enduring and unyielding commitment to a strong and productive state-
local partnership, the Committee’s budget once again provides significant resources to support all
our cities and towns, further ensuring that we protect the needs of every region, city, and town,
and leave no corner of our Commonwealth behind during this incredibly volatile time.
Unrestricted General Government Aid (UGGA). To sustain this productive partnership, the
Committee’s budget provides certainty for cities and towns, funding UGGA at $1.337 billion, an
increase of $28.7 million over FY 2025. With this level of funding, cities and towns will receive
funds to maintain public services as they collectively manage municipal budgets and confront
increased fiscal constraints at a time when they’re experiencing limited growth in municipal
revenues.
Special Commission on UGGA. The Committee’s budget establishes a special commission to
study the distribution method used to allocate UGGA to municipalities, evaluate the effectiveness
and equity of the method and make recommendations to maximize the equity of the distribution
for our communities.

Regional Transit Authorities (RTAs). As an essential public service, our RTAs connect cities,
towns, and regions, providing a crucial connection for commuters, students, seniors, and people
with disabilities. Doubling down on our commitment to regional equity, the Committee’s budget
provides $214 million to support our regional public transit system, including $120 million from
Fair Share funds, to maintain and continue expansions to regional bus service, sustain systemwide
fare free transit service, and support RTA commuter operations.
Codifying RTA Fare Free. The Committee’s budget includes provisions codifying fare free RTA
service, requiring all RTAs to eliminate passenger fares for fixed route and ADA required
paratransit service.
PILOT. Supplementing conventional sources of local aid, the Committee’s budget increases
resources for payments in lieu of taxes (PILOT) for state-owned land to impacted municipalities,
providing $54.5 million in additional revenue to help ease the budgets of cities and towns, ensuring
they can fund essential local services.
Arts, Culture and Libraries. Across Massachusetts, our arts, culture, and libraries are institutions
that remain core to the fabric of our communities during this incredibly turbulent and uncertain
economic time. Ensuring that arts and culture programs are sustained locally, while maintaining
access to a range of information, services, and programs that local libraries provide, the
Committee’s budget includes $52.4 million for libraries, including $19 million for regional library
local aid, $20 million for municipal libraries and $6.2 million for technology and automated
resource networks, and $26 million for the Massachusetts Cultural Council to support local
creative initiatives.
Health & Human Services
Protecting access to high-quality health care and human services, the Committee’s budget makes
a range of investments to further maintain our state’s safety net, protect core services, and ensure
care, help, and support for our most vulnerable citizens is not disrupted during this incredibly
uncertain and volatile time. Additionally, to address the Commonwealth’s ongoing health and
human services workforce challenges, the Committee budget invests in direct-care providers
across the continuum of care by increasing Chapter 257 service rates with $207 million in FY
2026. Subsequently, recognizing the growing costs of the state’s Personal Care Attendant (PCA)
program, the Committee’s budget extends the PCA task force created in FY 2025 to report on
long-term sustainability including recommending cost-growth targets and requiring the Executive
Office of Health Human Services to create a plan and timeline to implement the recommendations.
These important investments and reforms underscore the Committee’s strong commitment to
ensuring accessible, sustainable, and quality health and human services for Massachusetts
residents despite the current federal uncertainty.

MassHealth
The Committee’s budget funds MassHealth, the state’s Medicaid and Children’s Health Insurance
Program (CHIP), at a total of $22.41 billion ($8.48 billion net), a gross increase of $2.34 million
(11.7%) over the FY 2025 funding level. Amid uncertainty in Washington, the Committee’s
budget maintains access to comprehensive health care coverage for over 2 million of our
Commonwealth’s residents. MassHealth covers more than 1 in 4 residents, nearly half of all

Mental Health
Throughout the course of Senate President Spilka’s tenure, the Senate has been a leader on
expanding and protecting access to behavioral and mental health care. As we sustain our efforts to
maintain the landmark success of the 2022 Mental Health ABC Act, the Committee’s budget
safeguards the delivery of mental health care and services in an accessible and equitable manner,
protecting over $1.3 billion in a wide range of investments in mental health services and prevention
programs vital to the overall health and well-being of adults and children in need.

important now than ever before as we face a federal government hellbent on dismantling the
disability community. As such, the Committee’s budget invests over $3.2 billion into a diverse

protects investments in child assistance, food security, and economic security initiatives.

2025 for Transitional Aid to Families with Dependent Children (TAFDC) and Emergency Aid to

residing in Massachusetts. The Committee’s budget recommendations for the Executive Office of

every region, and every employer are intrinsically connected to supporting the Commonwealth’s
long-term economic health and success. On the heels of last year’s successful passage of the Mass
Leads Act, which infused nearly $4 billion into the Commonwealth’s economy while making a
host of wide-ranging policy changes to make Massachusetts more competitive, the Committee’s

are not so considered shall have included as part of net school spending an amount equal to the increase
in the foundation budget for the district associated with health care costs of retired teachers.

404 provide information about their identity to the adopted person shall, except in extraordinary
405 circumstances, be considered sufficient evidence to warrant the granting of an order for release
406 of the information contained in the birth certificate registered prior to adoption. If the corrected,
407 amended or supplemented record is that of a person who has acquired the status of a marital
408 child or whose record has been amended through an adoption decree or whose record has been
409 amended through addition of a named parent or whose record has been amended pursuant to

450 to a decedent’s estate as computed under section 2011 of the Code, as in effect on December 31,
451 2000, hereinafter referred to as the “credit”. The credit shall be determined based on the value of
452 the federal gross estate after such estate is increased by the value of any property: (i) not
453 included in the federal gross estate; (ii) in which the decedent had at death a qualifying income
454 interest for life described in subsection (c) of section 3A; (iii) for which a deduction was allowed

21

Senate Committee on Ways and Means Fiscal Year 2026 Budget Recommendations
456 decedent; and (iv) which is not real or tangible personal property located outside of the
457 commonwealth at the time of death. If the federal gross estate of a person includes real or
458 tangible personal property located outside of the commonwealth at the time of death, the credit
459 shall be determined based on the value of the federal gross estate after such estate is reduced by
460 the value of such real or tangible personal property located outside of the commonwealth and
461 increased by the value of any property: (A) not included in the federal gross estate; (B) in which
462 the decedent had at death a qualifying income interest for life described in subsection (c) of

464 respect to the transfer of such property to the decedent; and (D) which is not real or tangible
465 personal property located outside of the commonwealth at the time of death; provided, however,
466 that for the purposes of calculating the federal taxable estate, no deduction shall be allowed that
467 is attributable to such real or tangible personal property located outside of the commonwealth.
468 (b) A tax is hereby imposed upon the transfer of real property situated in this
469 commonwealth and upon tangible personal property having an actual situs in this commonwealth
470 of every person who at the time of their death was not a resident of this commonwealth. The
471 amount of this tax is the amount of the credit calculated based upon a federal gross estate that is
472 equal to the sum of: (i) the value of the estate’s real or tangible personal property located in the
473 commonwealth; and (ii) the value of any real or tangible property: (A) not included in the federal
474 gross estate; (B) in which the decedent had at death a qualifying income interest for life
475 described in subsection (c) of section 3A; (C) for which a deduction was allowed for

478 subsection, for the purposes of calculating the federal taxable estate, no deduction shall be
22

479 allowed that is attributable to property other than such real or tangible personal property located
480 in the commonwealth.
