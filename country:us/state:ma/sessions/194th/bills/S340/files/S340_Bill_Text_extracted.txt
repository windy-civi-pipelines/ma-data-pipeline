3 Section 1E ½. Each city, town, regional school district, vocational school district and
4 charter school shall file a biennial report regarding sexual health education, which shall include,
5 but not be limited to, for each city, town, regional school district, vocational school district and
6 charter school, by grade level: (i) the name and a description of any sexual health education
7 curriculum offered; (ii) the approximate number of hours spent on sexual health education; (iii)
8 the number of students enrolled in sexual health education; and (iv) the number of students who
9 withdrew from sexual health education under section 32A of chapter 71. The report shall be filed
1 of 5
10 with the board of elementary and secondary education each even-numbered year by a date and in
11 a format to be determined by the board.
12 The commissioner shall make the data collected under this section available to the public
13 on the department’s website and transmit the data to the department of public health within 30
14 days of the date established by the board for the filing of biennial reports under this section.

19 adopt a written policy ensuring that parents and guardians are notified of: (i) the comprehensive
20 sexual health education offered by the school; (ii) the right of a parent or guardian to withdraw a
21 student from all or part of the instruction; and (iii) the process for a parent or guardian to notify
22 the school of a student’s withdrawal. The policy shall include a process for a parent or guardian,
23 at the parent or guardian’s request, to inspect the instruction materials prior to the start of the
24 course.
25 To the extent possible, such notifications shall be provided in English and in other
