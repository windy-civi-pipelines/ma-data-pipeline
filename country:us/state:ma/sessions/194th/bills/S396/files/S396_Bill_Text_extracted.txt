9 focused on the need for basic, and improved curriculum standards.
1 of 3
10 2.) This legislation, seeks to spare the negative effects of the Common Core Curriculum,
11 and establish certain new standards for curriculum in schools.
12 Therefore, the language below is proposed, and upon passage, is adopted:
13 SECTION 2. Notwithstanding the provisions of any general or special law to the
14 contrary, the vote taken by the Massachusetts Board of Elementary and Secondary Education on
15 July 21, 2010, to adopt the Common Core State Standards for Mathematics and English
16 Language Arts is hereby rescinded. The curriculum frameworks in Mathematics and English
17 Language Arts that were in effect prior to that date are hereby restored.
18 SECTION 3. Section 1D of Chapter 69 is hereby amended in the second paragraph by
19 inserting after the first sentence, the following new sentences:
20 The process shall include committees made up exclusively of public school teachers and
21 academics from private and public colleges and universities established and operated in
22 Massachusetts. The Commissioner shall copyright the frameworks, which shall be wholly owned
23 by the Department; permission shall be granted to copy any or all parts of these frameworks for
24 non-commercial educational purposes.
25 SECTION 4. Said section 1D of chapter 69 is hereby further amended in the second
26 paragraph by inserting after the third sentence the following new sentences:

33 vote that the frameworks are equivalent to the standards of the most educationally advanced
34 nations as determined by the Trends in Mathematics and Sciences Study. No framework shall be
35 approved by the board without such a warrant. – This means that standards should be at the
36 highest International Standards.
37 SECTION 5. Section 1I of Chapter 69 is hereby amended in the third paragraph by
38 inserting after the second sentence, the following new sentence:
39 In order to better inform the teachers and administrators about the diagnostic
