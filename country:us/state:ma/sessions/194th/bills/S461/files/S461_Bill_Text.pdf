6 devices, tablets, or computers.

1 of 4

12 internet, or a cellular or Wi-Fi network, including but not limited to smartphones, cellular
13 phones, bluetooth enabled devices, tablets, smartwatches or other wearables, and gaming
14 devices. Personal electronic communication devices do not include school owned devices
15 provided to the student in accordance with the limitations placed herein.
16 “School” any public school, charter school, or vocational-technical school in
17 Massachusetts that provides full-time education programs for any grade from preK-12.
18 “School-related program” any school-sponsored or approved activity, event, or function

21 District.
22 “Social media” any public-facing website, online service, online application, mobile
23 application, or gaming application, used primarily for the purpose of posting and viewing user-
24 generated content. For the purposes of this section, social media does not include: (i) an online

31 related news, events, and updates.
32 “Student” an individual currently enrolled or registered at a school as defined under
33 subdivision (d) of this section.

34 (b) Each school board or governing body shall develop, adopt, and ensure
35 implementation of and make available to the department of elementary and secondary education
36 a policy:
37 (1) requiring all personal electronic devices be turned off, securely locked away, and
38 inaccessible to students for the entire school day -- from “first bell to last bell” -- and while under
39 the supervision of an employee of the school district for a school-related program;
40 (i) examples of storage devices include lockable pouches that students cannot unlock,
41 locked phone lockers, pencil pouches, or manila envelopes stored in a secure location.
42 (2) includes enforcement provisions to ensure strict compliance with the policy by
43 students and district employees; and
44 (3) provides that a student may contact their parent or caregiver during the school day if
45 needed by using a telephone made available to the student in a manner and location designated
46 by the district.
47 (c) Districts shall collect data annually to measure the impact of the policy on student
48 behavior, mental health, disciplinary incidents, school attendance, and academic performance.
49 (d) Notwithstanding subsection (b), a student shall not be prohibited from possessing or
50 using a personal electronic device under any of the following circumstances:
51 (1) when a licensed physician determines that the possession or use of a personal
52 electronic device is necessary for the health or well-being of the individual student (such as
53 diabetes monitoring); or

57 employees, and volunteers are prohibited from:
58 (1) utilizing social media for communication with students directly or indirectly;
59 (2) allowing students to access social media or gaming apps during school day hours or
60 while on school property under the supervision of a school employee;
61 (3) allowing students to access social media on school-issued electronic devices. School-
62 issued devices shall be set up to block social media sites; and
63 (4) utilizing social media to communicate with students about out-of-school sports,
64 extracurricular clubs, and any other school-sponsored activities. This does not prevent a school
65 from using social media for community communication and school-to-parent/guardian
66 communication.
67 This prohibition does not apply to work that requires shared documents, emails, or the
68 use of the Internet for the completion or enhancement of homework assignments, and the
69 electronic submission of assignments.
70 SECTION 2. This act shall take effect upon enactment.
