112 federal government or other states to the commonwealth or any of its agencies or political
113 subdivisions to prepare for, respond to, recover from or mitigate against an emergency.
114 Section 6. State of Emergency Declaration
115 (a) In reasonable anticipation of an emergency, the governor may exercise any power,
116 authority or discretion conferred on them under this chapter by issuing 1 or more executive
117 orders or directives to the Massachusetts emergency management agency, other department or
118 agency of the Commonwealth or any political subdivision thereof or other person. Any
6 of 25

119 department, agency or person so directed shall act in conformity with any orders or directives
120 prescribed by the governor.
121 (b) Upon the occurrence or imminent threat of occurrence of any emergency, the
122 governor may issue a proclamation setting forth a state of emergency. Said proclamation shall
123 serve to activate applicable emergency response, mitigation and recovery plans. The state of
124 emergency may extend throughout the commonwealth or may pertain to one or more particular
125 geographic areas. Said proclamation shall be authority for the deployment or use of any forces to
126 which the plans apply, and for the use or distribution of any supplies, equipment, materials or
127 facilities assembled, stockpiled or arranged to be made available. If the governor notes in the
128 proclamation that the emergency is one that is:
129 (i) detrimental to the public health, the commissioner of public health shall have those
130 authorities necessary to prevent disease and maintain public health set forth in section 2A of
131 chapter 17;
132 (ii) reasonably likely to impact the availability of gas, electric and water utility services,
133 the commissioner of the department of public utilities shall have those authorities necessary to
134 restore or resume service set forth in section 4B of chapter 25; or
135 (iii) a threat to the availability of essential services of transportation to such an extent as
136 to endanger the health, safety or welfare of the community, the governor shall have those
137 authorities necessary to take possession and operate set forth in section 37 of chapter 161A.
138 (c) After the governor issues a proclamation setting forth a state of emergency, the
139 governor may possess, use or employ any property, real or personal, for such time and in such
140 manner as the governor shall deem necessary to protect the commonwealth and its residents. The
7 of 25

141 emergency management or public safety authorities which seize property during an emergency
142 shall maintain a permanent record of such property and its condition when seized and shall
143 furnish a true copy of the record to the owner of the seized property. The commonwealth shall
144 pay just compensation to the owner of any facilities or materials that are permanently taken or
145 permanently appropriated by a commonwealth authority during an emergency. The
146 commonwealth shall not pay just compensation to the owner of any facilities or materials that
147 said authorities close, evacuate, decontaminate or destroy when there is reasonable cause to
148 believe that the facilities or materials endanger the public during an emergency. The amount of
149 compensation shall be calculated in the same manner as compensation due for taking of property
150 pursuant to non-emergency eminent domain procedures as provided in chapter 79.
151 (d) The declaration of emergency shall terminate when so declared by the governor, or
152 automatically after 60 days, unless renewed by the governor. Each renewal shall terminate after
153 60 days unless renewed for an additional 60 days, or unless sooner terminated.
154 Section 7. State of Emergency Authorities
155 (a) During a declared state of emergency, the governor, in addition to any other authority
156 vested in them by law, shall have and may exercise any and all authority over persons and
157 property necessary or expedient to protect the commonwealth and its residents. Without limiting
158 the foregoing, the governor shall have and may exercise the following specific authority:
159 (1) To suspend the provisions of any statute or the orders or regulations of any state
160 agency if compliance with the provisions of any such statute, order or regulation would in any
161 way prevent, hinder or delay necessary action in responding to the emergency. Any provision of
8 of 25

162 any statute, order or regulation inconsistent with an order issued or promulgated during a state of
163 emergency under this chapter shall be inoperative while such a declaration is in effect.
164 (2) To employ every agency and all persons of the government of the commonwealth or
165 of any of its political subdivisions to protect the lives and property of its residents and to enforce
166 the law, and to utilize all available resources of the state government and of its political
167 subdivisions as reasonably necessary to respond to the emergency. The governor may transfer
168 the direction, personnel or functions of commonwealth departments, agencies or units thereof for
169 the purpose of performing or facilitating emergency management functions. The governor may
170 assign to any state agency any activity concerned with disaster preparedness and relief, and it
171 shall become the duty of such agency to undertake and carry out such activity on behalf of the
172 commonwealth. All persons employed by the commonwealth or any of its political subdivisions
173 who are acting as emergency response workers shall have the same powers, duties, immunities
174 and privileges as if they were performing those duties for the commonwealth or within any of its
175 political subdivisions.
176 (3) To order that the members of the police and fire forces of the commonwealth or its
177 political subdivisions, the National Guard and other authorized agents and emergency response
178 workers performing emergency management functions including, but not limited to, health
179 agents authorized under section 30 of chapter 111 and animal control officers, while in uniform
180 or upon presentation of government-issued identification, may enter private property for the sole
181 purpose of enforcing orders or directives issued by or under authority of the governor. Nothing in
182 this section shall be construed or deemed to prohibit any entry upon private property otherwise
183 authorized by law.
9 of 25

184 (4) To order or compel the evacuation of all or part of the population from any stricken or
185 threatened area within the commonwealth if the governor deems this action necessary for the
186 preservation of life or other emergency mitigation, response or recovery efforts. Consistent with
187 this authority, the governor may prescribe routes, modes of transportation and destinations in
188 connection with evacuation. The governor shall also formulate and execute plans and rules for
189 the control of traffic in order to provide for the rapid and safe movement or evacuation over
190 public highways and streets of people, troops, vehicles or materials for national defense or for
191 use in any defense industry, and may coordinate the activities of the departments or agencies of
192 the commonwealth and the political subdivisions thereof concerned directly or indirectly with
193 public highways and streets in a manner which will best effectuate such plans. Neither the
194 commonwealth, nor any of its political subdivisions, nor any employee of the commonwealth or
195 of a political subdivision, nor any emergency response worker, shall be liable for harm to any
196 person who refuses to comply with an evacuation order.
197 (5) To allow health care practitioners who are licensed in another state and whose license
198 is in good standing to provide health care in any area affected by the emergency, notwithstanding
199 the provisions of chapter 112A or any other applicable general or special law.
200 (b) Whoever violates any provision of any order or directive issued by the governor
201 pursuant to sections 5 or 6 shall be punished by imprisonment of not more than 1 year, or by a
202 fine of not more than $500, or both, unless the conduct in question is prohibited by other existing
203 law which sets forth a greater punishment for the violation.
204 Section 8. MEMA Regions
10 of 25

205 The agency shall establish regional emergency operations centers to support coordination
206 and communication between the agency and political subdivisions. These centers shall serve as
207 regional hubs for emergency management activities, facilitating planning, response, recovery and
208 mitigation efforts.
209 Regional coordinators shall be designated by the director to act as liaisons between the
210 agency and the political subdivisions within each region. The regional emergency operations
211 centers shall operate in alignment with the commonwealth’s comprehensive emergency
212 management plan established pursuant to section 10 to ensure effective collaboration across all
213 levels of government during emergencies.
214 Section 9. State Emergency Operations Center
215 The agency shall establish a State Emergency Operations Center, hereinafter referred to
216 as the center, at a facility to serve as the central coordination hub for all emergency management
217 operations within the commonwealth. The center shall serve as the primary location for state-
218 level decision-making, resource allocation and operational coordination during emergencies and
219 disasters.
220 The center shall be responsible for ensuring a unified and effective response by
221 coordinating efforts among federal, state, local, private sector and non-profit entities. The center
222 shall also oversee the implementation of the comprehensive emergency management plan
223 established pursuant to section 10 during incidents requiring a state-level response.
224 Each state agency designated as an emergency response agency by the director shall
225 assign a minimum of 2 qualified personnel to serve as liaison officers to the center. These liaison
11 of 25

226 officers shall be tasked with facilitating communication, resource management and operational
227 support between their respective agencies and the center.
228 The center shall maintain operational readiness at all times and shall be activated by the
229 governor or director during emergencies, disasters or other significant incidents requiring state-
230 level coordination.
231 Section 10. State Emergency Management Plan
232 The director shall establish and publish a comprehensive emergency management plan
233 for the commonwealth. This plan shall establish the framework in which the emergency response
234 and recovery actions of all levels of government can be effectively integrated and coordinated.
235 The plan shall be an all-hazards document and shall provide a comprehensive approach for
236 planning for, responding to and recovering from an emergency. The plan shall encompass all
237 aspects of pre-emergency preparedness and post-emergency response, recovery and mitigation.
238 The plan shall:
239 (i) establish the fundamental policies, basic program strategies, assumptions and
240 mechanisms through which the Commonwealth shall mobilize resources and conduct activities
241 to guide and support local emergency management efforts during response, recovery and
242 mitigation;
243 (ii) coordinate regional and inter-regional evacuation and sheltering, post-disaster
244 response and recovery, rapid deployment and pre-deployment of resources, emergency exercises
245 and clearly define responsibilities for state agencies through the Massachusetts emergency
246 support functions approach to planning and operations;
12 of 25

247 (iii) establish a concept of operations for the direction and control of an emergency from
248 initial monitoring through post-disaster response and recovery;
249 (iv) define the inter-agency coordination mechanism that facilitates delivery of state
250 assistance and establishment of state direction and control over response and recovery assistance
251 provided by other states or the federal government;
252 (v) assign functional responsibilities to appropriate executive offices of the
253 commonwealth, as well as to specific state agencies, private sector groups and volunteer
254 organizations;
255 (vi) assess the various levels of emergencies likely to occur within the commonwealth
256 and the corresponding response and recovery actions needed to recover from them.
257 Section 11. Local Emergency Management Organizations
258 Each political subdivision of the commonwealth shall have an emergency management
259 director, who shall have direct responsibility for the organization, administration and operation
260 of their respective city or town's emergency management organization subject to the direction
261 and control of such appointing authority. In addition to performing emergency management
262 functions within their communities, city or town emergency management organizations shall
263 coordinate their activities with the agency and comply with the commonwealth's comprehensive
264 emergency management plan established pursuant to section 10. City or town emergency
265 management agencies may provide for mutual aid or other support to any other city or town
266 consistent with section 4J of chapter 40.
13 of 25

267 In carrying out the provisions of this chapter, each political subdivision impacted by an
268 emergency shall have the power to enter into contracts and incur obligations necessary to combat
269 such emergencies, to protect the health and safety of persons and property and to provide
270 emergency assistance to the victims of the emergency. Each political subdivision is authorized to
271 exercise the powers vested under this section in light of the exigencies of the emergency, without
272 regard to procedures or formalities prescribed by law pertaining to the performance of public
273 work, entering into contracts, the incurring of obligations, the employment of temporary
274 workers, the rental of equipment, the purchase of supplies and materials, the levying of taxes or
275 the appropriation and expenditure of public funds, unless mandated by constitutional
276 requirements.
277 Each political subdivision shall have the power to make appropriations in the manner
278 provided by law for making appropriations for the ordinary expenses of such political
279 subdivision for the payment of expenses of its emergency management operations.
280 Whenever the federal government or any agency or office thereof or any person, firm or
281 corporation shall offer to the commonwealth, or to any political subdivision thereof, services,
282 equipment, supplies, materials or funds by way of gift, grant or loan for purposes of emergency
283 management, the commonwealth acting through the governor or such political subdivision acting
284 through its governing body may accept such offer, and upon acceptance the governor or
285 governing body of such political subdivision may authorize any officer of the commonwealth or
286 of the political subdivision, as the case may be, to receive such services, equipment, supplies,
287 materials or funds on behalf of the commonwealth or such political subdivision, subject to the
288 terms of the offer and rules and regulations, if any, of the agency making the offer.
14 of 25

289 For the purpose of financing emergency management expenditures authorized under this
290 chapter, a city, town, district or county may raise such sums as may be necessary by taxation, by
291 transfer from available funds or may borrow from time to time and may issue bonds or notes
292 therefore as otherwise authorized by law. Each authorized issue shall constitute a separate loan,
293 and such loans shall be paid in not more than five years from their dates and shall bear on their
294 face the words (city, town or county) emergency management loan. The city auditor, town
295 accountant, or, if there is no such officer, the town treasurer, district treasurer and county
296 treasurer, of every city, town, district and county making expenditures under the authority of this
297 chapter shall file annually with the secretary of the executive office of administration and finance
298 in such form and detail as said secretary may require.
299 Section 12. Local State of Emergency
300 (a) During a local emergency, the governing body of a political subdivision or officials
301 designated thereby may promulgate orders necessary to provide for the protection of life and
302 property, including orders imposing a curfew within designated boundaries where necessary to
303 preserve the public order and safety. Such orders and amendments and rescissions thereof shall
304 be in writing and shall be distributed publicly.
305 (b) If, because of the emergency conditions, the governing body of a political subdivision
306 is unable to meet promptly, the chief executive officer or acting chief executive officer of any
307 political subdivision shall exercise by proclamation all of the powers conferred upon the
308 governing body under subsection (a) that appear necessary and expedient. The proclamation
309 shall be subject to ratification, alteration, modification or repeal by the governing body as soon
15 of 25

310 as that body can meet; provided, however, that the subsequent action taken by the governing
311 body shall not affect the prior validity of the proclamation.
312 Section 13. Emergency Management Resource Deployment
313 The agency is authorized to deploy emergency response personnel, teams, equipment and
314 other resources of the commonwealth, political subdivisions, non-profit or private sector as state
315 resources to support emergency management operations within or beyond the commonwealth as
316 necessary to reinforce local, regional, state or national emergency management efforts.
317 Emergency management resources, including personnel and teams, shall be deployed
318 based on the critical needs of the situation, taking into account the plans and priorities of the
319 commonwealth, the federal government and other states. Such deployments shall be initiated
320 upon the orders of the agency and shall support emergency management activities in any part of
321 the commonwealth or, under agreed conditions, in other states.
322 Personnel deployed as part of emergency management resources shall:
323 (i) if they are employees of the commonwealth, retain all powers, duties, rights,
324 privileges and immunities associated with their employment and continue to receive their regular
325 compensation;
326 (ii) if they are employees of a political subdivision of the commonwealth, retain all
327 powers, duties, rights, privileges and immunities associated with their employment and continue
328 to receive their regular compensation while serving within or beyond their political subdivision;
329 or
16 of 25

330 (iii) if they are not employees of the commonwealth or a political subdivision thereof, be
331 entitled to the same rights and immunities as provided by law for employees of the
332 commonwealth; provided, however, that compensation and reimbursement for travel and
333 subsistence expenses shall be provided in accordance with policies established by the agency
334 subject to available funds.
335 All personnel deployed under this section shall be subject to the operational control of the
336 authority in charge of emergency management activities in the area in which they are serving.
337 The agency shall issue regulations governing the standards, deployment procedures,
338 training requirements and operational responsibilities for personnel and teams deployed under
339 this program to ensure readiness and effectiveness during emergencies.
340 Section 14. Emergency Management Tax Relief
341 Any city or town that accepts the provisions of this section may establish a program to
342 abate up to $1,000 in property taxes due for any fiscal year for a resident of the city or town to
343 provide property tax relief for a non-salaried local director of emergency management and for
344 individuals who are volunteer emergency response workers as defined under this chapter. Such
345 tax relief may provide either: (i) an abatement of up to $1,000 in property taxes due for any fiscal
346 year; or (ii) an exemption applicable to the assessed value of real or personal property up to an
347 amount equal to the quotient of $1,000,000 divided by the mill rate in effect at the time of
348 assessment, expressed as a whole number of dollars per $1,000 of assessed value. A city or town
349 which has accepted the provisions of this section may enact the necessary local by-laws,
350 ordinances, rules or regulations to effectuate the provisions of this section.
351 Section 15. Emergency Response Worker Liability
17 of 25

352 Neither the commonwealth, nor any agency, political subdivision or employee thereof,
353 nor any other emergency response worker performing authorized emergency management
354 functions or engaged in emergency preparedness training programs or exercises authorized by
355 the director, shall be liable in any suit for damages as a result of any acts or omissions committed
356 by such person in the course of such emergency management functions, training or exercises,
357 unless such acts or omissions constitute willful, wanton or reckless conduct. The immunity
358 provided in this section shall not apply to any person whose act or omission caused the
359 emergency, in whole or in part. Consistent with the provisions of chapter 12, the attorney general
360 shall appear for and defend the commonwealth, any agency or political subdivision thereof and
361 any emergency response worker against any civil action brought as a result of actions taken
362 during a declared emergency or authorized training or exercises.
363 In the absence of any other benefits provided by law, all emergency response workers
364 who are killed or who sustain disability or injury while performing authorized emergency
365 management functions shall be construed to be employees of the commonwealth and shall be
366 compensated in like manner as state employees are compensated under the provisions of chapter
367 152. The same shall be true of all emergency response workers killed, disabled or injured while
368 engaged in any emergency preparedness training programs or exercises authorized by the
369 director.
370 Section 16. Emergency Shelters
371 In consultation with the secretary and the fire marshal, the director shall establish
372 standards and issue regulations for the designation of emergency shelters within each community
373 or group of communities. Facilities designated as emergency shelters may be utilized for other
18 of 25

374 functions and may not be maintained exclusively for emergency purposes but shall meet
375 minimum emergency structural, capacity and accessibility requirements. The board of building
376 regulations and standards may grant deviations from the applicable building codes to the extent
