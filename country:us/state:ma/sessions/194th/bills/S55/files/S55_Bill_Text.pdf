163 SECTION 12. Section 2A of chapter 61A of the General Laws, as appearing in the 2022
164 Official Edition, is hereby amended by inserting after subsection (d) the following subsection:-

176 consider whether any amendments to statutory, regulatory and deed-based restrictions on the
177 amount of renewable energy allowed to be generated on farmland, including but not limited to,
178 land under chapter 61A and land in the agricultural preservation restriction program established
179 pursuant to section 23 of chapter 20, would help preserve or improve farm viability. The

181 management or business practices could achieve the same or similar improvements in farm
182 viability, as well as the commonwealth’s current ability to support farmers in updating said
183 practices, in their consideration of whether and which amendments to recommend. The
184 department shall additionally factor into their review and considerations the promotion of healthy
185 soils and biodiversity, environmental sustainability and the commonwealth’s renewable energy

195 section:-
196 Section 14. Land taxed under this chapter shall not be sold for, or converted to,
197 residential, industrial or commercial use while so taxed or within 1 year after that time unless the
198 city or town in which the land is located and the department of agricultural resources has been
199 notified of the intent to sell for, or to convert to, that other use.
200 The discontinuance of agricultural or horticultural use shall not, in itself, for the purposes
201 of this section, be considered a conversion. Specific use of land for a residence for the owner, the
10 of 23

202 owner's spouse or a parent, grandparent, child, grandchild, or brother or sister of the owner, or
203 surviving husband or wife of any deceased such relative, or for living quarters for any persons
204 actively employed full-time in the agricultural or horticultural use of such land, shall not be a
205 conversion for the purposes of this section, and a certificate of the board of assessors, recorded
206 with the registry of deeds, shall conclusively establish that particular use.
207 Any notice of intent to sell for other use shall be accompanied by a statement of intent to
208 sell, a statement of proposed use of the land, the location and acreage of land as shown on a map
209 drawn at the scale of the assessors map in the city or town in which the land is situated, and the
210 name, address and telephone number of the landowner.
211 Any notice of intent to sell for other use shall be accompanied by a certified copy of an
212 executed purchase and sale agreement specifying the purchase price and all terms and conditions
213 of the proposed sale, which is limited to only the property classified under this chapter, and
214 which shall be a bona fide offer as described below.
215 Any notice of intent to sell for other use shall also be accompanied by any additional
216 agreements or a statement of any additional consideration for any contiguous land under the
217 same ownership, and not classified under this chapter, but sold or to be sold contemporaneously
218 with the proposed sale.
219 For the purposes of this chapter, a bona fide offer to purchase shall mean a good faith
220 offer, not dependent upon potential changes to current zoning or conditions or contingencies
221 relating to the potential for, or the potential extent of, subdivision of the property for residential
222 use or the potential for, or the potential extent of development of the property for industrial or
11 of 23

223 commercial use, made by a party unaffiliated with the landowner for a fixed consideration
224 payable upon delivery of the deed.
225 Any notice of intent to convert to other use shall be accompanied by a statement of intent
226 to convert, a statement of proposed use of the land, the location and acreage of land as shown on
227 a map drawn at the scale of the assessors map in the city or town in which the land is situated,
228 the name, address and telephone number of the landowner and the landowner's attorney, if any.
229 The notice of intent to sell or convert shall be sent by the landowner by certified mail or
230 hand delivered to the mayor and city council of a city, or select board of a town, and in the case
231 of either a city or a town, to its board of assessors, to its planning board and conservation
232 commission, if any, to the commissioner of the department of agricultural resources and to the
233 state forester.
234 A notarized affidavit that the landowner has mailed or delivered a notice of intent to sell
235 or convert shall be conclusive evidence that the landowner has mailed the notice in the manner
236 and at the time specified. Each affidavit shall have attached to it a copy of the notice of intent to
237 which it relates.
238 The notice of intent to sell or convert shall be considered to have been duly mailed if
239 addressed to the mayor and city council or select board in care of the city or town clerk; to the
240 planning board and conservation commission if addressed to them directly; to the department of
241 agricultural resources if addressed to the secretary of the executive office of energy and
242 environmental affairs or to the commissioner of the department of agricultural resources; to the
243 state forester if addressed to the commissioner of the department of conservation and recreation;
244 and to the assessors if addressed to them directly.
12 of 23

245 If the notice of intent to sell or convert does not contain all of the material described
246 above, then the town or city, within 30 days after receipt, shall notify the landowner in writing
247 that notice is insufficient and does not comply.
248 For a period of 120 days after the day following the latest date of deposit in the United
249 States mail of any notice which complies with this section, the city or town shall have, in the
250 case of intended sale, a first refusal option to meet a bona fide offer to purchase the land. If the
251 city or town does not exercise its option, the department of agricultural resources shall then have
252 a refusal option to meet a bona fide offer to purchase the land or assign such right.
253 In the case of intended or determined conversion not involving sale, the municipality, or
254 the department of agricultural resources if the municipality does not exercise its option, shall
255 have an option to purchase the land at full and fair market value to be determined by an impartial
256 appraisal performed by a certified appraiser hired at the expense of the municipality or its
257 assignee, or the department of agricultural resources or its assignee, the original appraisal to be
258 completed and delivered to the landowner within 30 days after the notice of conversion to the
259 municipality and the department of agricultural resources. In the event that the landowner is
260 dissatisfied with the original appraisal, the landowner may, at the landowner's expense, contract
261 for a second appraisal, to be completed within 60 days after the delivery of the notice to convert.
262 If, after completion of the second appraisal, the parties cannot agree on a consideration, the
263 parties will contract with a mutually acceptable appraiser for a third appraisal whose cost will be
264 borne equally by both parties. The third appraisal shall be delivered to both parties within 90
265 days after the notice of conversion to the municipality and shall be the final determination of
266 consideration. Upon agreement of a consideration, the city or town shall then have 120 days to
267 exercise its option. During the appraisal process, the landowner may revoke the intent to convert
13 of 23

268 at any time and with no recourse to either party. The department of agricultural resources shall
269 only have the ability to exercise its option after the municipality provides written notice of its
270 intent to not exercise its option as set forth in this section. The department of agricultural
271 resources shall have the remaining time or an additional 60 days, whichever is longer, to exercise
272 its option in the same manner and subject as the city or town.
273 The option may be exercised only after a public hearing followed by written notice
274 signed by the mayor or select board if the option is exercised by the municipality, or signed by
275 the commissioner of the department of agricultural resources if the option is exercised by the
276 department of agricultural resources, mailed to the landowner by certified mail at the address that
277 is specified in the notice of intent. Notice of public hearing shall be given in accordance with
278 section 23B of chapter 39.
279 The notice of exercise shall also be recorded at the registry of deeds and shall contain the
280 name of the record owner of the land and description of the premises adequate for identification
281 of them.
282 The notice to the landowner of the city or town's or the department of agricultural
283 resources’ election to exercise its option shall be accompanied by a proposed purchase and sale
284 contract or other agreement between the city or town or the department of agricultural resources
285 and the landowner which, if executed, shall be fulfilled within a period of not more than 90 days
286 after the date the contract or agreement, endorsed by the landowner, is returned by certified mail
287 to the mayor or select board or the commissioner of the department of agricultural resources, or
288 upon expiration of any extended period that the landowner has agreed to in writing, whichever is
289 later.
14 of 23

290 At the public hearing or a further public hearing, the city or town or the department of
291 agricultural resources may assign its option to a nonprofit conservation organization, or to the
292 commonwealth or any of its political subdivisions, or in the case of the department of
293 agricultural resources, to any individual or entity it determines is fit to ensure the continued
294 agricultural use of such land, under the terms and conditions that the mayor or select board or the
295 commissioner of the department of agricultural resources may consider appropriate. Notice of
296 public hearing shall be given in accordance with section 23B of chapter 39.
297 The assignment shall be for the purpose of maintaining not less than 70 per cent of the
298 land in use as forest land as defined in section 1 of chapter 61, as land in agricultural or
299 horticultural use as defined in sections 1 and 2 or as recreational land as defined in section 1 of
300 chapter 61B, and in no case shall the assignee develop a greater proportion of the land than was
301 proposed by the developer whose offer gave rise to the assignment. All land other than land that
302 is to be developed shall then be bound by a permanent deed restriction that meets the
303 requirements of chapter 184.
304 If the first refusal option has been assigned as provided in this section, the mayor or
305 select board or the commissioner of the department of agricultural resources shall provide
306 written notice of assignment to the landowner.
307 The notice of assignment shall state the name and address of the individual, entity,
308 organization or agency of the commonwealth which will exercise the option in addition to the
309 terms and conditions of the assignment. The notice of assignment shall be recorded with the
310 registry of deeds.
15 of 23

311 Failure to record either the notice of exercise or the notice of assignment within the 120
312 day period or the additional 60 day period if exercised by the department of agricultural
313 resources shall be conclusive evidence that the city or town or the department of agricultural
314 resources has not exercised its option.
315 If the option has been assigned to an individual, entity, nonprofit conservation
316 organization or to the commonwealth or any of its political subdivisions, the option may be
317 exercised by the assignee only by written notice to the landowner signed by the assignee, mailed
318 to the landowner by certified mail at the address that is specified in the notice of intent. The
319 notice of exercise shall also be recorded with the registry of deeds and shall contain the name of
320 the record owner of the land and description of the premises adequate for identification of them.
321 The notice of exercise to the landowner shall be accompanied by a proposed purchase
322 and sale contract or other agreement between the assignee and landowner which, if executed,
323 shall be fulfilled within a period of not more than 90 days, or upon expiration of any extended
324 period the landowner has agreed to in writing, from the date the contract or agreement, endorsed
325 by the landowner, is returned by certified mail to the assignee.
326 During the 120 day period or the additional 60 day period, the city or town or the
327 department of agricultural resources or its assignees, shall have the right, at reasonable times and
328 upon reasonable notice, to enter upon the land for the purpose of surveying and inspecting the
329 land, including, but not limited to, soil testing for purposes of Title V and the taking of water
330 samples.
331 The city or town or the department of agricultural resources or its assignee shall have all
332 rights assigned to the buyer in the purchase and sale agreement contained in the notice of intent.
16 of 23

333 If the city or town or the department of agricultural resources elects not to exercise the
334 option, and not to assign its right to exercise the option, the city or town or the department of
335 agricultural resources shall send written notice of nonexercise, signed by the mayor or select
336 board or the commissioner of the department of agricultural resources, to the landowner by
337 certified mail at the address that is specified in the notice of intent. The notice of nonexercise
338 shall contain the name of the owner of record of the land and description of the premises
339 adequate for identification of them and shall be recorded with the registry of deeds.
340 No sale or conversion of the land shall be consummated until the option period has
341 expired or the notice of nonexercise has been recorded with the registry of deeds, and no sale of
342 the land shall be consummated if the terms of the sale differ in any material way from the terms
343 of the purchase and sale agreement which accompanied the bona fide offer to purchase as
344 described in the notice of intent to sell except as provided in this section.
345 This section shall not apply to a mortgage foreclosure sale, but the holder of a mortgage
