365 (d) A proposed budget outlining the anticipated costs of operating the program, including
366 identification of any start-up costs that will not be ongoing and a description of the method by
367 which the PRO intends to determine and collect producer payments during the start-up period of
368 program operation, and to reimburse or require additional payments by those producers
369 subsequent to the start-up period based on producer reporting of the actual amount of covered
370 material sold, offered for sale or distributed for sale in or into the commonwealth by each
371 producer during the start-up period. The proposed budget should describe how the PRO will
372 maintain a financial reserve sufficient to operate the program in a fiscally prudent and
373 responsible manner, such that it considers historical variations in market values of post-consumer
374 packaging types. The proposed budget under this paragraph may overestimate the cost of
375 operating the program during the start-up period of operation but must describe the method and
376 basis for any overestimation.

511 which must be verified through a third-party audit paid for by the PRO.
512 (c) To pay into the sustainable packaging trust all applicable fees required by the
513 department under section 343(e).
514 (d) To invest in education and infrastructure that support the reduction, recycling and
515 reuse of covered material in the commonwealth must be approved by the department prior to any
516 such expenditures, and must incorporate input from the advisory committee. Of the expenditures
517 from the fund for a fiscal year, the PRO shall ensure that not less than two (2) percent is used for
518 education and not less than eight (8) percent is used for infrastructure described under this
519 section and in compliance with the approved plan under section 335. These amounts may be
520 adjusted with approval by the department based on progress toward the achievement of the
521 reduction and recycling targets in section 334 paragraph (c).
522 (1) The department shall promulgate regulations setting approval criteria for the
523 evaluation of proposed expenditures under this paragraph.
524 (2) The department shall approve or deny a proposed expenditure under this paragraph
525 within sixty days of receipt of the proposal.
526 (e) To fulfill any other obligation required by the plan, including representative audits of
527 covered materials from materials recovery facilities, solid waste facilities, and litter.
26 of 41
528 (f) Expenditures from the fund shall be used only for the uses described in this section;
529 and shall not be used to pay penalties imposed under section 343, any costs associated with
530 litigation against the commonwealth, or any lobbying efforts.
531 (g) If for any reason sections 330 to 346 are repealed, or the PRO ceases operation, the
532 entire fund balance shall be transferred by the PRO to the Commonwealth of Massachusetts to be
533 deposited into the sustainable packaging trust.
534 Section 339. Alternative collection program. In accordance with the requirements of this
535 section and the regulations promulgated by the department, a producer or group of producers
536 may develop and operate an alternative collection program to collect and manage a type or types
537 of covered material sold, offered for sale or distributed for sale in or into the commonwealth by
538 the producer or producers. A producer that manages a type of covered material under an
539 approved alternative collection program through reduction, reuse, recycling may wholly or
540 partially offset the producer's payment obligations under the packaging and paper product
541 program with respect to that same type of covered material only.
542 (a) Once a PRO has a plan approved by the department for the creation of a packaging
543 reduction program, a producer or group of producers seeking to implement an alternative
544 collection program shall submit a proposal for the establishment of that program to the
545 department for approval. The department shall provide an opportunity for public review and
546 comment on the proposal or deny the proposal within ninety (90) days of receipt. The department
547 may approve an alternative collection program for a term of five (5) years and, at the expiration
548 of such term, the producer or group of producers operating the program may submit an updated
549 proposal to the department for approval.
27 of 41
550 (b) In determining whether to approve a proposed alternative collection program, the
551 department shall consider:
552 (1) Whether the alternative collection program will provide convenient, free, statewide
553 collection opportunities for the types of packaging material to be collected under that program.
554 (2) To what extent the alternative collection program intends to manage those types of
555 covered material to be collected under the program through reduction, reuse for an original
556 purpose, recycling or disposal at an incineration facility. The department may not approve an
557 alternative collection program that proposes management of a covered material type through
558 disposal at an incineration facility unless that covered material is not readily recyclable as
559 defined by the department pursuant to section 343 and the program proposes a process to begin
560 reuse or recycling of that type of covered material within a period of 3 years or less. The
561 program shall ensure that a combined reduction and recycling rate is achieved of no less than
562 sixty-five (65) percent by weight by July 1, 2030, no less than eighty (80) percent by weight by
563 July 1, 2035, and no less than ninety (90) percent by weight by July 1, 2040 of covered materials
564 managed by the PRO.
565 (3) Whether the education and outreach strategies proposed for the alternative collection
566 program can be expected to significantly increase consumer awareness of the program
567 throughout the commonwealth.
568 (4) How the alternative collection program intends to accurately measure the amount of
569 each covered material type collected, reused, recycled, disposed at an incineration facility or
570 otherwise managed under the program.
28 of 41
571 (5) To what extent the alternative collection program may: (i) disproportionately impact
572 one community over another; (ii) impact environmental justice populations, as defined in section
573 62 of chapter 30, and (iii) provide equitable regional access to the program.
574 (c) A proposed modification to an approved alternative collection program must be
575 submitted to the department for written approval. The department shall approve or deny a
576 proposed modification based on application of the criteria described in paragraph (b).
577 (d) A producer or producers managing an approved alternative collection program shall
578 report annually and concurrent with the reporting required by section 340 to the PRO and to the
579 department the following information:
580 (1) The total tons of each type of covered material collected, reused, recycled, disposed at
581 a landfill or municipal waste combustor or otherwise managed under the alternative collection
582 program in the prior twelve months, including a breakdown of the total tons of each type of
583 material to be credited to each producer participating in the alternative collection program.
584 (2) A list of the collection opportunities in the commonwealth for the types of covered
585 material managed under the alternative collection program that were made available in the prior
586 twelve months.
587 (3) A description of the education and outreach strategies implemented by the alternative
588 collection program in the prior calendar year to increase consumer awareness of the program
589 throughout the commonwealth.

594 alternative collection program shall make a payment into the sustainable packaging trust for the
595 department’s administrative costs of operating the program as determined by the department
596 pursuant to section 343(f).
597 (f) If the department determines that an approved alternative collection program is not
598 operating in a manner consistent with the proposal approved under this section or the provisions
599 of this section, the department shall provide written notice to the producer or producers operating
600 the alternative collection program regarding the nature of the deficiency, the actions necessary to
601 correct the deficiency and the time by which such actions must be implemented. If the
602 department determines that the producer or group of producers have failed to implement the
603 actions described in the written notice within the required time frame, the department shall notify
604 the producers or group of producers as well as the PRO in writing that the producer or group of
605 producers are ineligible to offset payment obligations under the packaging and paper product
606 program based on covered material managed under the alternative collection program. The
607 department may also bring enforcement actions against the producer or group of producers under
608 section 344.
609 Section 340. Annual reporting by packaging reduction PRO. The PRO shall submit an
610 annual report to the department on a regular schedule determined by the department for the

638 provisions of this section and the regulations promulgated by the department, a collector may
639 elect to, but is not required to, participate in the program under sections 330 to 346.
640 All collectors, regardless of participation status, shall provide convenient collection and
641 recycling of readily recycled materials covered recyclables to all covered entities to which they
642 provide disposal service at a single cost incorporated in the trash collection rate.
643 The PRO shall reimburse participating collectors for incurred net costs associated with
644 processing and recycling of covered materials from covered entities. The PRO shall ensure that,
645 in the event no collector has elected to participate in the program in a given jurisdiction,
646 convenient, equitable and free access to recycling services is available to all covered entities
647 within that jurisdiction. Participating collectors shall not charge fees to covered entities for
648 reimbursable costs.
649 (a) To be eligible for reimbursement of costs under sections 342 as a participating
650 collector, a collector must provide for the collection and recycling of covered materials that are
651 generated by all covered entities using its service and that are readily recyclable as listed
652 regularly by the department and that are not collected by an alternative collection program in
32 of 41
653 accordance with section 339, and must quarterly report to the PRO all information necessary for
654 the PRO, on a form provided by or approved by the department, to determine the collector’s
655 incurred net costs associated with processing and recycling of covered materials from covered
656 entities, including the number of tons delivered..
657 (b) Two or more municipalities, a regional refuse district or association, a municipally
658 owned processing facility or quasi-municipal entity that manages materials on behalf of a
659 municipality may elect to jointly report to the PRO and jointly receive reimbursement payments
660 from the PRO.
661 (c) The PRO shall reimburse collectors for qualifying costs within thirty (30) days of
662 submission.
663 Section 342. Disbursement of collector reimbursements. In accordance with the
664 provisions of this section, section 341, and regulations promulgated by the department, the PRO
665 shall make reimbursement payments from the fund to participating collectors for incurred costs
666 associated with municipal transfer station operation, processing and recycling of covered
667 materials from all covered entities.
668 (a) In accordance with the regulations promulgated by the department pursuant to section
669 343, the PRO shall determine the amount of reimbursements to participating collectors under this
670 section based on the following information:
671 (1) Information provided by participating collectors to the PRO or coordinating body in
672 accordance with section 341 regarding the incurred net costs associated with processing and
673 recycling of covered materials from covered entities.
33 of 41
674 (2) Any other information specified by the department by rule.
675 (b) In accordance with regulations promulgated by the department, the PRO shall use the
676 information described in paragraph (a) to determine the total tons of each covered material type
677 recycled by all collectors at each recycling establishment and the percentage of those total tons
678 attributable to each participating collector. In the case of two or more municipalities that jointly
679 send recyclable material to a recycling establishment, the PRO shall assume that an equal
680 amount of the jointly sent material is attributable to each resident of each municipality unless
681 those municipalities by agreement identify an unequal per capita division of that jointly sent
682 material for the purposes of this section.
683 Section 343. Administration and enforcement; rulemaking; fees; additional department
684 responsibilities. The department shall administer and enforce this section and shall promulgate
685 regulations as necessary to implement, administer and enforce sections 331-346. All regulations
686 developed under these sections shall be promulgated no later than twelve (12) months after the

688 (a) No later than three (3) months from enactment, the department shall establish an
689 advisory committee that represents a range of interested and engaged persons, including the
690 commissioner of the department of environmental protection or a designee, one member who
691 shall be appointed by the attorney general and who shall have expertise in consumer protection,
692 and one individual each representing producers, retailers, private waste haulers that do not
693 operate material recovery facilities, material recovery facility operators, municipalities,
694 environmental PROs, recycling advocacy organizations, health care facilities, colleges and
695 universities, entertainment venues, freshwater and marine litter programs, reuse organizations,,
34 of 41
696 and environmental and human health scientists. Each individual serving on the advisory
697 committee may represent only one (1) member of each category listed under this paragraph, and
698 the organization shall ensure that no category has a disproportionate representation on an
699 advisory committee. The department may select a third-party facilitator for the advisory

701 (b) The department shall hold an advisory meeting at least quarterly; request and consider
702 comments from the advisory committee prior to developing regulations pertaining to the plan,
703 approval of the plan and modifications to the first plan, and proposals by the PRO for
704 infrastructure and education investments; and include a summary of advisory committee
705 engagement and input in the report under section 340.
706 (c) The department shall develop a material cost differentiation system with which the
707 PRO will calculate material category-specific per-ton producer payments. The system shall be
708 based on the net cost of municipal transfer station operation, processing cost for each covered
709 material category, management cost of non-readily recyclable covered materials, and any other
710 cost factors as determined by the department. Cost calculations shall take into consideration
711 revenue generated from recyclable materials and must incentivize operational efficiency and
712 contamination reduction.
713 (d) The department shall regularly publish a schedule of adjustments to be used by the
714 PRO in determining the amount of producer payments required under section 336. The schedule
715 of adjustments shall apply to both readily and non-readily recyclable covered materials as
716 defined in paragraph (c), and shall be used to individually adjust the fees assessed for each
717 category of covered material as defined in paragraph (d). To minimize the extraction,
35 of 41
718 manufacture, use, and end-of-life-management impacts of covered materials, the schedule of
719 adjustments must be structured to incent:
720 (1) Waste reduction.
721 (2) Reuse and lifespan extension of packaging.
722 (3) Minimal life cycle impact of covered materials.
723 (4) The use of the minimum quantity of packaging necessary to effectively deliver a
724 product without damage or spoilage.
725 (5) Use of readily recyclable materials to manufacture covered materials.
726 (6) Single-material packaging with clear recycling or disposal instructions for consumers,
727 and other design characteristics that reduce contamination in recycling.
728 (7) Increased use of post-consumer recycled content material in covered materials so long
729 as it does not increase the toxicity of the packaging material.
730 (8) Reduced use of toxic substances in covered materials, which raise the lifecycle
731 environmental and societal costs of packaging.
732 (9) Domestic processing of covered materials.
733 (e) The department shall regularly publish a list of readily recyclable materials,
734 developed through coordination with the PRO and material recovery facilities or other entities
735 managing covered materials. The department shall provide for a transitional period between the
736 time that a type of covered material is determined to be readily recyclable or to not be readily
737 recyclable and the time that such determinations will be effective for the purposes of determining
36 of 41

540 partially offset the producer's payment obligations under the packaging and paper product
541 program with respect to that same type of covered material only.
542 (a) Once a PRO has a plan approved by the department for the creation of a packaging
543 reduction program, a producer or group of producers seeking to implement an alternative
544 collection program shall submit a proposal for the establishment of that program to the
545 department for approval. The department shall provide an opportunity for public review and
546 comment on the proposal or deny the proposal within ninety (90) days of receipt. The department
547 may approve an alternative collection program for a term of five (5) years and, at the expiration
548 of such term, the producer or group of producers operating the program may submit an updated
549 proposal to the department for approval.
27 of 41

550 (b) In determining whether to approve a proposed alternative collection program, the
551 department shall consider:
552 (1) Whether the alternative collection program will provide convenient, free, statewide
553 collection opportunities for the types of packaging material to be collected under that program.
554 (2) To what extent the alternative collection program intends to manage those types of
555 covered material to be collected under the program through reduction, reuse for an original
556 purpose, recycling or disposal at an incineration facility. The department may not approve an
557 alternative collection program that proposes management of a covered material type through
558 disposal at an incineration facility unless that covered material is not readily recyclable as
559 defined by the department pursuant to section 343 and the program proposes a process to begin
560 reuse or recycling of that type of covered material within a period of 3 years or less. The
561 program shall ensure that a combined reduction and recycling rate is achieved of no less than
562 sixty-five (65) percent by weight by July 1, 2030, no less than eighty (80) percent by weight by
563 July 1, 2035, and no less than ninety (90) percent by weight by July 1, 2040 of covered materials
564 managed by the PRO.
565 (3) Whether the education and outreach strategies proposed for the alternative collection
566 program can be expected to significantly increase consumer awareness of the program
567 throughout the commonwealth.
568 (4) How the alternative collection program intends to accurately measure the amount of
569 each covered material type collected, reused, recycled, disposed at an incineration facility or
570 otherwise managed under the program.
28 of 41

571 (5) To what extent the alternative collection program may: (i) disproportionately impact
572 one community over another; (ii) impact environmental justice populations, as defined in section
573 62 of chapter 30, and (iii) provide equitable regional access to the program.
574 (c) A proposed modification to an approved alternative collection program must be
575 submitted to the department for written approval. The department shall approve or deny a
576 proposed modification based on application of the criteria described in paragraph (b).
577 (d) A producer or producers managing an approved alternative collection program shall
578 report annually and concurrent with the reporting required by section 340 to the PRO and to the
579 department the following information:
580 (1) The total tons of each type of covered material collected, reused, recycled, disposed at
581 a landfill or municipal waste combustor or otherwise managed under the alternative collection
582 program in the prior twelve months, including a breakdown of the total tons of each type of
583 material to be credited to each producer participating in the alternative collection program.
584 (2) A list of the collection opportunities in the commonwealth for the types of covered
585 material managed under the alternative collection program that were made available in the prior
586 twelve months.
587 (3) A description of the education and outreach strategies implemented by the alternative
588 collection program in the prior calendar year to increase consumer awareness of the program
589 throughout the commonwealth.
590 (4) Progress toward reducing the disposed tons of the material.
591 (5) Any additional information required by the department.
29 of 41

592 (e) No later than thirty (30) days after the approval of an alternative collection program
593 under this section, and quarterly thereafter, a producer or producers participating in an approved
594 alternative collection program shall make a payment into the sustainable packaging trust for the
595 department’s administrative costs of operating the program as determined by the department
596 pursuant to section 343(f).
597 (f) If the department determines that an approved alternative collection program is not
598 operating in a manner consistent with the proposal approved under this section or the provisions
599 of this section, the department shall provide written notice to the producer or producers operating
600 the alternative collection program regarding the nature of the deficiency, the actions necessary to
601 correct the deficiency and the time by which such actions must be implemented. If the
602 department determines that the producer or group of producers have failed to implement the
603 actions described in the written notice within the required time frame, the department shall notify
604 the producers or group of producers as well as the PRO in writing that the producer or group of
605 producers are ineligible to offset payment obligations under the packaging and paper product
606 program based on covered material managed under the alternative collection program. The
607 department may also bring enforcement actions against the producer or group of producers under
608 section 344.
609 Section 340. Annual reporting by packaging reduction PRO. The PRO shall submit an
610 annual report to the department on a regular schedule determined by the department for the

622 calendar year, as determined by an independent financial audit performed by an independent
623 auditor, including information on how the PRO determined the amount of such payments in
624 conformance with regulations promulgated in accordance with section 343.
625 (f) A copy of the independent audit described in paragraph (e).
626 (g) A list of producers not participating in the program that are required to participate in
627 the program and any product specific non-compliance, if known by the PRO.
628 (h) A description of education and infrastructure investments made by the PRO in prior
629 calendar years and how those expenditures quantifiably increased access to recycling and reuse
630 of covered materials throughout the commonwealth.
631 (i) An updated assessment schedule, as required under paragraph (h) of section 334.
31 of 41

632 (j) Results of representative inbound and outbound audits of recyclable material

636 (l) Any other information the department determines to be appropriate.
637 Section 341. Requirements for collector reimbursements. In accordance with the
638 provisions of this section and the regulations promulgated by the department, a collector may
639 elect to, but is not required to, participate in the program under sections 330 to 346.
640 All collectors, regardless of participation status, shall provide convenient collection and
641 recycling of readily recycled materials covered recyclables to all covered entities to which they
642 provide disposal service at a single cost incorporated in the trash collection rate.
643 The PRO shall reimburse participating collectors for incurred net costs associated with
644 processing and recycling of covered materials from covered entities. The PRO shall ensure that,
645 in the event no collector has elected to participate in the program in a given jurisdiction,
646 convenient, equitable and free access to recycling services is available to all covered entities
647 within that jurisdiction. Participating collectors shall not charge fees to covered entities for
648 reimbursable costs.
649 (a) To be eligible for reimbursement of costs under sections 342 as a participating
650 collector, a collector must provide for the collection and recycling of covered materials that are
651 generated by all covered entities using its service and that are readily recyclable as listed
652 regularly by the department and that are not collected by an alternative collection program in
32 of 41

653 accordance with section 339, and must quarterly report to the PRO all information necessary for
654 the PRO, on a form provided by or approved by the department, to determine the collector’s
655 incurred net costs associated with processing and recycling of covered materials from covered
656 entities, including the number of tons delivered..
657 (b) Two or more municipalities, a regional refuse district or association, a municipally
658 owned processing facility or quasi-municipal entity that manages materials on behalf of a
659 municipality may elect to jointly report to the PRO and jointly receive reimbursement payments
660 from the PRO.
661 (c) The PRO shall reimburse collectors for qualifying costs within thirty (30) days of
662 submission.
663 Section 342. Disbursement of collector reimbursements. In accordance with the
664 provisions of this section, section 341, and regulations promulgated by the department, the PRO
665 shall make reimbursement payments from the fund to participating collectors for incurred costs
666 associated with municipal transfer station operation, processing and recycling of covered
667 materials from all covered entities.
668 (a) In accordance with the regulations promulgated by the department pursuant to section
669 343, the PRO shall determine the amount of reimbursements to participating collectors under this
670 section based on the following information:
671 (1) Information provided by participating collectors to the PRO or coordinating body in
672 accordance with section 341 regarding the incurred net costs associated with processing and
673 recycling of covered materials from covered entities.
33 of 41

674 (2) Any other information specified by the department by rule.
675 (b) In accordance with regulations promulgated by the department, the PRO shall use the
676 information described in paragraph (a) to determine the total tons of each covered material type
677 recycled by all collectors at each recycling establishment and the percentage of those total tons
678 attributable to each participating collector. In the case of two or more municipalities that jointly
679 send recyclable material to a recycling establishment, the PRO shall assume that an equal
680 amount of the jointly sent material is attributable to each resident of each municipality unless
681 those municipalities by agreement identify an unequal per capita division of that jointly sent
682 material for the purposes of this section.
683 Section 343. Administration and enforcement; rulemaking; fees; additional department
684 responsibilities. The department shall administer and enforce this section and shall promulgate
685 regulations as necessary to implement, administer and enforce sections 331-346. All regulations
686 developed under these sections shall be promulgated no later than twelve (12) months after the
687 passage of this act.
688 (a) No later than three (3) months from enactment, the department shall establish an
689 advisory committee that represents a range of interested and engaged persons, including the
690 commissioner of the department of environmental protection or a designee, one member who
691 shall be appointed by the attorney general and who shall have expertise in consumer protection,
692 and one individual each representing producers, retailers, private waste haulers that do not
693 operate material recovery facilities, material recovery facility operators, municipalities,
694 environmental PROs, recycling advocacy organizations, health care facilities, colleges and
695 universities, entertainment venues, freshwater and marine litter programs, reuse organizations,,
34 of 41

696 and environmental and human health scientists. Each individual serving on the advisory
697 committee may represent only one (1) member of each category listed under this paragraph, and
698 the organization shall ensure that no category has a disproportionate representation on an
699 advisory committee. The department may select a third-party facilitator for the advisory
700 committee.
701 (b) The department shall hold an advisory meeting at least quarterly; request and consider
702 comments from the advisory committee prior to developing regulations pertaining to the plan,
703 approval of the plan and modifications to the first plan, and proposals by the PRO for
704 infrastructure and education investments; and include a summary of advisory committee
705 engagement and input in the report under section 340.
706 (c) The department shall develop a material cost differentiation system with which the
707 PRO will calculate material category-specific per-ton producer payments. The system shall be
708 based on the net cost of municipal transfer station operation, processing cost for each covered
709 material category, management cost of non-readily recyclable covered materials, and any other
710 cost factors as determined by the department. Cost calculations shall take into consideration
711 revenue generated from recyclable materials and must incentivize operational efficiency and
712 contamination reduction.
713 (d) The department shall regularly publish a schedule of adjustments to be used by the
714 PRO in determining the amount of producer payments required under section 336. The schedule
715 of adjustments shall apply to both readily and non-readily recyclable covered materials as
716 defined in paragraph (c), and shall be used to individually adjust the fees assessed for each
717 category of covered material as defined in paragraph (d). To minimize the extraction,
35 of 41

718 manufacture, use, and end-of-life-management impacts of covered materials, the schedule of
719 adjustments must be structured to incent:
720 (1) Waste reduction.
721 (2) Reuse and lifespan extension of packaging.
722 (3) Minimal life cycle impact of covered materials.
723 (4) The use of the minimum quantity of packaging necessary to effectively deliver a
724 product without damage or spoilage.
725 (5) Use of readily recyclable materials to manufacture covered materials.
726 (6) Single-material packaging with clear recycling or disposal instructions for consumers,
727 and other design characteristics that reduce contamination in recycling.
728 (7) Increased use of post-consumer recycled content material in covered materials so long
729 as it does not increase the toxicity of the packaging material.
730 (8) Reduced use of toxic substances in covered materials, which raise the lifecycle
731 environmental and societal costs of packaging.
732 (9) Domestic processing of covered materials.
733 (e) The department shall regularly publish a list of readily recyclable materials,
734 developed through coordination with the PRO and material recovery facilities or other entities
735 managing covered materials. The department shall provide for a transitional period between the
736 time that a type of covered material is determined to be readily recyclable or to not be readily
737 recyclable and the time that such determinations will be effective for the purposes of determining
36 of 41

738 producer payments and collector reimbursements in accordance with secs. 330 to 346. The
739 department may amend the list of readily recyclable materials as needed.
740 (f) The department shall coordinate with the PRO to establish categories of covered
741 materials. The covered material categories shall group covered materials that have similar
742 properties such as chemical composition, shape, or other characteristics, including, but not
743 limited to: rigid or flexible plastics made of polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polyethylene (PE),
744 polyvinyl chloride (PVC), polypropylene (PP), polystyrene (PS), poly coated fiber, multi-layered
745 material, other (BPA, Compostable Plastics, Polycarbonate and LEXAN); metal, such as

748 PRO, and quarterly thereafter, all costs incurred in the administration of the packaging and paper
749 products program, including oversight, issuance of any regulations, conducting the needs
750 assessment, any third-party facilitators hired for the advisory committee, planning, plan review,
751 including proposed modifications to the plan under section 335, compliance, enforcement, and
752 sufficient staff positions to administer the program. All funds shall be deposited in the
753 sustainable packaging trust.
754 (h) Beginning at the time that a producer or producers begin an approved alternative
755 collection program pursuant to section 339(a), the department shall submit to the producer or
756 producers, and quarterly thereafter, all costs incurred in the administration of the alternative
757 collection program, including oversight, issuance of any regulations, planning, plan review,
758 including proposed modifications to the plan under section 339, compliance, enforcement, and
37 of 41

759 sufficient staff positions to administer the program. All funds shall be deposited in the
760 sustainable packaging trust.
761 (i) Beginning one (1) year after passage of secs. 330 to 346, the department shall
762 establish a toxic substance list, and may reference existing toxic or hazardous substances lists
763 created by other state agencies and the Interstate Chemicals Clearinghouse. Any person may
764 petition the department to add a chemical or chemical class substance to the list based on
765 scientific evidence. The department shall review and update the list of toxic substances at least
766 every three years.
767 (j) Upon request by the department, the PRO shall provide a list of producers that are
768 participating in the program and are compliant with the program's requirements and, if known to
769 the PRO, a list of producers that are not participating in the program and are not compliant with
770 the program's requirements.
771 (k) Based on the information provided to the department under paragraph (g) and any
772 other information considered by the department, the department shall make available on its
773 publicly accessible website a regularly updated list of producers that the department has
774 determined are compliant with all applicable requirements of this section and a list of producers
775 and, where applicable, specific producers or products that the department has determined are not
776 compliant with all applicable requirements of this section. The department shall conduct
777 outreach to retailers to ensure that retailers are aware of the information made available under
778 this paragraph and any changes to that information.
779 Section 344. Enforcement. Within thirty (30) days of approval of the plan, no producer,
780 distributor, retailer, or other responsible party for a covered material shall sell, offer for sale, use,
38 of 41

781 or distribute any covered material to any person in the commonwealth if the producer of such
782 materials is not in compliance with sections 330 to 346. No collector may provide collection for
783 disposal unless they are in compliance with section 341.
784 (a) Any producer or collector that violates this section shall be subject to a fine for each
785 violation and for each day that the violation occurs in an amount of not more than $200,000.
786 (b) The department may bring a civil action to enjoin the sale, distribution, or importation
787 into the commonwealth of a covered material in violation of this part.
788 (c) The department may bring a civil action to enjoin the operation of a collector that fails
789 to provide convenient recycling service at an all-inclusive price to covered entities.
790 (d) the department may engage the services of a multistate clearinghouse for this purpose,
791 and join multi-state civil actions.
792 (e) The penalties provided for in this section may be recovered in a civil action brought in
793 the name of the People of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts by the Commonwealth’s
794 Attorney General. Any funds collected under this section in an action in which the Attorney
795 General has prevailed shall be deposited in the sustainable packaging trust.
796 Section 345. Antitrust laws. A producer or PRO, including a producer's or PRO's officers,
797 members, employees and agents that organize a packaging and paper product program or an
