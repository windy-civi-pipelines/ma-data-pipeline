1 SECTION 1. Section 2 of chapter 132B of the General Laws, as appearing in the 2022
2 Official Edition, is hereby amended by inserting after the definition of “Animal” the following:-
3 “Anticoagulant rodenticide”, any pesticide product that has a mode of action that
4 interferes with blood clotting including, but not limited to, the following active ingredients:
5 Brodifacoum, Bromadiolone, Chlorophacinone, Difenacoum, Difethialone, Diphacinonon, or

8 hereby amended by adding at the end thereof the following paragraph:-
1 of 3

9 The department, with the approval of the board, shall by regulation establish a process
10 and standards for the limited use of anticoagulant rodenticides by licensed applicators in public
11 health emergencies, provided that such process and standards provide for one-time indoor use in
12 a single location to address an urgent public health emergency, as determined by the state
13 department of public health and such use shall: (i) be limited to 14 days; (ii) be accompanied by
14 integrated pest management actions that include non-chemical methods and exclusionary
15 measures to control rodents; (iii) require additional labeling of anticoagulant rodenticides used,
16 including but not limited to, the name of the rodenticide clearly labeled on any bait box; (iv)
17 require written rationale for the need for anticoagulant rodenticides over other non-toxic short-
18 term alternatives; and (v) require applicators to report to the department after the 14-day
19 emergency use period and include a plan for ongoing rodent control at the location.
20 Regulations shall also include provisions for the emergency use of anticoagulant
21 rodenticides to protect drinking water supply, to control vectors for mosquito-borne illness, and
22 for emergent infectious disease control.
23 SECTION 3. Section 7 of said chapter 132B of the General Laws, as so appearing, is
24 hereby amended by adding at the end thereof the following paragraph:-
25 The subcommittee as established in section 3A of this chapter shall not register or
26 reregister anticoagulant rodenticides, except that it may register or reregister anticoagulant
27 rodenticides for emergency use, as provided by the department pursuant to section 5 of this
28 chapter.
29 SECTION 4. The department shall report annually and include on its website information
30 regarding the emergency use of anticoagulant rodenticides including, but not limited to, locations

32 ongoing rodent control plans required in section 5 of chapter 132B, and relevant accompanying
