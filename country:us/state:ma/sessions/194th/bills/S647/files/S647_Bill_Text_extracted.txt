16 organization’s contracted partners to comply with all applicable federal, state and local laws and
17 any regulations and ordinances for the protection of human health and the environment. These
18 procedures shall address adequate record keeping, tracking and documenting of the final

93 was offered for sale, the manufacturer is listed on the department’s website as implementing or
94 participating in an approved program or if the paint brand is listed on the department’s website as
95 being included in the program.

120 this section in accordance with the requirements of the paint stewardship program in lieu of any
