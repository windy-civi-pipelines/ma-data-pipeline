202 establishing a collection program, either individually or in cooperation with other producers, to
10 of 25

203 collect these discarded products as established in this chapter. A producer establishing an
204 independent collection program for reuse or recycling either individually or in cooperation with
205 other producers shall recover 1 or more electronic products. A producer establishing an
206 independent recycling program either individually or in cooperation with other producers shall
207 meet either of the following criteria to be able to continue the program. In order for an
208 independent recycling program to maintain good standing with the department, the program must
209 either of the following:
210 (i) A program must provide collection services for covered electronic products of all
211 product types and produced by any manufacturer that are reasonably convenient and available to
212 all citizens of the state residing within its geographic boundaries, including both rural and urban
213 areas. Each program must provide collection service in every county of the state. A program may
214 provide collection services jointly with another plan or plans.
215 (a) For any city or town with a population of greater than ten thousand, each program
216 shall provide a minimum of one collection site or alternate collection service described in
217 subsection (3) of this section or a combination of sites and alternate service that together provide
218 at least one collection opportunity for all product types. A collection site for a county may be the
219 same as a collection site for a city or town in the county.
220 (b) Collection sites may include electronics recyclers and repair shops, recyclers of other
221 commodities, reuse organizations, charities, retailers, government recycling sites, or other
222 suitable locations.

11 of 25

225 (2) A program may limit the number of covered electronic products or covered electronic
226 products by product type accepted per customer per day or per delivery at a collection site or
227 service. All covered entities may use a collection site as long as the covered entities adhere to
228 any restrictions established in the plans.
229 (3) A program may provide collection services in forms different than collection sites,
230 such as curbside services, if those alternate services provide equal or better convenience to
231 citizens and equal or increased recovery of unwanted covered electronic products.
232 (4) For rural areas without commercial centers or areas with widely dispersed population,
233 a program may provide collection at the nearest commercial centers or solid waste sites,
234 collection events, mail-back systems, or a combination of these options.
235 (5) For small businesses, small governments, charities, and school districts that may have
236 large quantities of covered electronic products that cannot be handled at collection sites or
237 curbside services, a program may provide alternate services. At a minimum, a program must
238 provide for processing of these large quantities of covered electronic products at no charge to the
239 small businesses, small governments, charities, and school districts.
240 The department shall provide a report no later than December 31, 2021, to the Joint

243 but not be limited to, the effectiveness of the independent collection program requirements,
244 independent collection program compliance, and collection rates of independent programs.
245 A producer establishing an independent recycling program either individually or in
246 cooperation with other producers will register as a collector pursuant to section 7 of this chapter
12 of 25

247 or a processor pursuant to section 10 of this chapter; however, an additional registration fee will

250 incorporation with other producers shall provide the following information to the department:
251 (a) Contact information for the responsible party and a comprehensive list of all
252 manufacturers participating in the plan and their contact information;
253 (b) A description of the collection, transportation, and recycling systems and service
254 providers used, including a description of how the PRO or responsible party will:
255 (i) Seek to use businesses within the state, including retailers, charities, processors, and

261 plan will provide for collection services in each county of the state and for a minimum of one
262 collection site or alternate collection service for each city or town with a population greater than
263 ten thousand. A collection site for a county may be the same as a collection site for a city or town
264 in the county;
265 (d) A description of how the plan will provide service to small businesses, small
266 governments, charities, and school districts in the state;

270 processing standards established under [appropriate state law];
271 (g) A description of the accounting and reporting systems that will be employed to track
272 progress toward the plan's equivalent share;
273 (h) A timeline describing start-up, implementation, and progress towards milestones with

277 (j) A description of how manufacturers participating in the plan will communicate and
278 work with processors utilized by that plan to promote and encourage design of electronic
279 products and their components for recycling. The plan shall address how it will incorporate and
280 fairly compensate registered collectors providing curbside or premium services such that they are
281 not compensated at a lower rate for collection costs than the compensation offered other
282 collectors providing drop-off collection sites in that geographic area.
283 All transporters, collectors, and processors used to fulfill the requirements of this section
284 must be registered as described in this law.
285 A producer establishing an independent collection program shall submit an annual report

375 (2) the address; (3) the telephone number; and (4) the location of the business of the processor’s

390 Electronics,” the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s “Responsible Recycling” (R2)

407 application, the department shall issue a registration, which shall expire in 3 years. Any holder of
408 a registration who fails to file a renewal application within 60 days after notification by the
409 department that his registration has expired shall, prior to engaging in business as a processor
410 within the commonwealth, be required to register anew and pay a late fee in addition to said
411 renewal fee.

413 registration, or for any annual renewal thereof, shall be determined every three years by the
414 department, but in no case shall any registration or renewal fee exceed $5000.
415 Section 13. (a) The department shall annually: (1) determine the return share for each

417 weight of covered electronic products identified for each producer by the total weight of covered
418 electronic products identified for all producers; provided further, that said calculation shall be
419 based on the reports generated by processors of covered electronic products in the
20 of 25

420 commonwealth; provided further, that for the first program year, the return share of covered
421 electronic products identified for each producer shall be based on the best available public return
422 share data from the United States, including data from other states, for covered electronic
423 products from persons; provided further, that for the second and subsequent program years, the
424 return share of covered electronic products identified for each producer shall be based on the
425 previous year’s reported data as described herein; and provided further, that the department shall

429 share of orphan waste shall be equivalent to its percentage of return share for non-orphan
430 covered electronic products, multiplied by the total amount of orphan waste collected in the
431 program year; and provided further, that the department, in determining the producer’s orphan
432 waste share, may take into account electronic products, including orphan waste, voluntarily
433 collected by the producer; (3) determine the market share allocation for each television producer
434 by determining the total weight of televisions recycled in the previous year, multiplied by the

436 share identified for each television producer shall be based on the best available data regarding
437 the total number of televisions sold in the commonwealth for the previous calendar year; (4)
438 maintain a list of producers registered pursuant to this chapter; and (5) conduct periodic audits of
439 processors and collectors at a frequency determined by the department, to assure accuracy of
