17 is established, whether authorization is based on a signature, a personal identification number, or

56 as part of the authorization or settlement process for the electronic payment transaction. The

58 process to avoid being charged interchange fees on the tax or gratuity amount of an electronic
59 payment transaction.

61 this section may submit tax documentation for the electronic payment transaction to the acquirer
62 bank or its designee no later than 180 days after the date of the electronic payment transaction,
63 and, within 30 days after the merchant submits the necessary tax documentation, the issuer must
64 credit to the merchant the amount of interchange fees charged on the tax or gratuity amount of
65 the electronic payment transaction.
66 (d) This section does not create liability for a payment card network regarding the
67 accuracy of the tax or gratuity data reported by the merchant.
68 (e) It shall be unlawful for an issuer, a payment card network, an acquirer bank, or a
69 processor to alter or manipulate the computation and imposition of interchange fees by
70 increasing the rate or amount of the fees applicable to or imposed upon the portion of a credit or
71 debit card transaction not attributable to taxes or other fees charged to the merchant.
72 (f) An issuer, a payment card network, an acquirer bank, a processor, or other designated
73 entity that has received the tax or gratuity amount data and violates this section is subject to a
74 civil penalty of $1,000 per electronic payment transaction, and the issuer must refund the
75 merchant the interchange fee calculated on the tax or gratuity amount relative to the electronic
76 payment transaction.

77 (g) The provisions of this section are severable. If any provision therein is declared
78 unconstitutional or invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the validity of the remaining
79 provisions shall not be affected.
