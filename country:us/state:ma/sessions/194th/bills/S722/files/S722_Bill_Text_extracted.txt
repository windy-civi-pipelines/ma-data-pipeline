5 of 20
90 (2) by investing with the care, skill, prudence, and diligence under the prevailing
91 circumstances that a prudent person acting in a like capacity and familiar with those matters
92 would use in the conduct of an enterprise of a like character and with like aims.
93 SECTION 8. In addition to the other duties and responsibilities stated in this Act, the
94 Board shall:
95 (a) Cause the Program to be designed, established and operated in a manner that:
96 (1) accords with best practices for retirement savings vehicles;

108 Fund, including, but not limited to, retaining and contracting with investment managers, private
6 of 20
109 financial institutions, other financial and service providers, consultants, actuaries, counsel,
110 auditors, third-party administrators, and other professionals as necessary.
111 (e) Conduct a review of the performance of any investment vendors no less frequently
112 than every 4 years, including, but not limited to, a review of returns, fees, and customer service.
113 A copy of reviews conducted under this subsection shall be posted to the Board's Internet
114 website.
115 (f) Determine the number and duties of staff members needed to administer the Program
116 and assemble such a staff, including, as needed, employing staff, appointing a Program
117 administrator, and entering into contracts with the State Treasurer to make employees of the
118 State Treasurer's Office available to administer the Program.
119 (g) Cause moneys in the Fund to be held and invested as pooled investments with a view
120 to achieving cost savings through efficiencies and economies of scale.
121 (h) Evaluate and establish the process by which an enrollee is able to contribute a portion
122 of his or her wages to the Program for automatic deposit of those contributions and the process
123 by which the participating employer provides a payroll deposit retirement savings arrangement to
124 forward those contributions and related information to the Program, including, but not limited to,
125 contracting with financial service companies and third-party administrators with the capability to
126 receive and process employee information and contributions for payroll deposit retirement
127 savings arrangements or similar arrangements.
128 (i) Design and establish the process for enrollment under Section 14 of this Act, including
129 the default contribution rate, account type, investment option, and automatic escalation rate. The
130 Board shall also design and establish the process by which an employee can:
7 of 20
131 (1) opt not to participate in the Program; (2) select a contribution rate, account type,
132 investment option, or escalation rate different than the default options set by the Board; or (3)
133 terminate participation in the Program.

135 and make contributions to the Program.
136 (k) Accept any grants, appropriations, or other moneys from the Commonwealth, any unit

138 solely for deposit into the Fund, whether for investment or administrative purposes.

140 connection with the property, assets, or activities of the Program, and indemnify as needed each
141 member of the Board from personal loss or liability resulting from a member's action or inaction
142 as a member of the Board.
143 (m) Make provisions for the payment of administrative costs and expenses for the
144 creation, management, and operation of the Program. Subject to appropriation, the
145 Commonwealth may pay administrative costs associated with the creation and management of
146 the Program until sufficient assets are available in the Fund for that purpose. Thereafter, all
147 administrative costs of the Fund, including repayment of any start-up funds provided by the
148 State, shall be paid only out of moneys on deposit therein. However, private funds or federal
149 funding received in order to implement the Program until the Fund is self-sustaining shall not be
150 repaid unless those funds were offered contingent upon the promise of such repayment. The
151 Board shall keep annual administrative expenses as low as possible and is authorized to charge

164 purposes, objectives, and provisions of this Act pertaining to the Program.
165 (t) Deposit into the Massachusetts Secure Choice Administrative Fund all grants, gifts,
166 donations, fees, and earnings from investments from the Massachusetts Secure Choice Savings
167 Program Fund that are used to recover administrative costs. All expenses of the Board shall be
168 paid from the Massachusetts Secure Choice Administrative Fund.
169 SECTION 9. The Board shall prepare and adopt a written statement of investment policy
170 that includes a risk management and oversight program. This investment policy shall prohibit the
171 Board, Program, and Fund from borrowing for investment purposes. The risk management and
172 oversight program shall be designed to ensure that an effective risk management system is in
9 of 20
173 place to monitor the risk levels of the Program and Fund portfolio, to ensure that the risks taken
174 are prudent and properly managed, to provide an integrated process for overall risk management,
175 and to assess investment returns as well as risk to determine if the risks taken are adequately
176 compensated compared to applicable performance benchmarks and standards. The Board shall
177 consider the statement of investment policy and any changes in the investment policy at a public
178 hearing.
179 SECTION 10. (a) The Board shall engage, after an open bid process, an investment
180 manager or managers to invest the Fund and any other assets of the Program. Moneys in the
181 Fund may be invested or reinvested by the State Treasurer's Office or may be invested in whole
182 or in part under contract with the State Board of Investment, private investment managers, or
183 both, as selected by the Board. In selecting the investment manager or managers, the Board shall
184 take into consideration and give weight to the investment manager's fees and charges in order to
185 reduce the Program's administrative expenses.
186 (b) The investment manager or managers shall comply with any and all applicable federal
187 and state laws, rules, and regulations, as well as any and all rules, policies, and guidelines
188 promulgated by the Board with respect to the Program and the investment of the Fund, including,
189 but not limited to, the investment policy.
190 (c) The investment manager or managers shall provide such reports as the Board deems
191 necessary for the Board to oversee each investment manager's performance and the performance
192 of the Fund.
193 SECTION 11. (a) The Board shall establish as an investment option a life-cycle fund
194 with a target date based upon the age of the enrollee. This shall be the default investment option
10 of 20
195 for enrollees who fail to elect an investment option unless and until the Board designates by rule
196 a new investment option as the default.
197 (b) The Board may also establish additional investment options, including, but not limited
198 to, any of the following:
199 (1) a conservative principal protection fund;
200 (2) a growth fund;
201 (3) a secure return fund whose primary objective is the preservation of the safety of
202 principal and the provision of a stable and low-risk rate of return; if the Board elects to establish
203 a secure return fund, the Board may procure any insurance, annuity, or other product to insure
204 the value of individuals' accounts and guarantee a rate of return; the cost of such funding
205 mechanism shall be paid out of the Fund; under no circumstances shall the Board, Program,
206 Fund, the State, or any participating employer assume any liability for investment or actuarial
207 risk; the Board shall determine whether to establish such investment options based upon an
208 analysis of their cost, risk profile, benefit level, feasibility, and ease of implementation;
209 (4) an annuity fund.
210 SECTION 12. (a) The Board may enter into an intergovernmental agreement or
211 memorandum of understanding with the State and any agency of the State to receive outreach,
212 technical assistance, enforcement and compliance services, collection or dissemination of
213 information pertinent to the Program (subject to such obligations of confidentiality as may be
214 agreed or required by law), or other services or assistance. The State and any agencies of the
215 State that enter into such agreements or memoranda of understanding shall collaborate to provide
11 of 20
216 the outreach, assistance, information, and compliance or other services or assistance to the
217 Board. The memoranda of understanding may cover the sharing of costs incurred in gathering
218 and disseminating information and the reimbursement of costs for any enforcement activities or
219 assistance.
220 (b) All agencies of the Commonwealth shall cooperate as requested by the Program in the
221 performance of its duties under this Act, including, unless otherwise prohibited, the sharing of
222 relevant data as the parties shall mutually agree.
223 (c) The Board shall assess the feasibility of multistate or regional agreements to
224 administer the Program through shared administrative and operational resources and may enter
225 into those agreements if deemed beneficial to the Program.
226 Section 13. (a) The Board shall design and disseminate an employer information packet
227 and an employee information packet, which shall include background information on the
228 Program, appropriate disclosures for employees, and information regarding the Internet website
229 described in Section 8 of this Act.
230 (b) The employee information packet shall include a disclosure form. The disclosure
231 form shall explain, but not be limited to, all of the following:
232 (1) the benefits and risks associated with making contributions to the Program;
233 (2) the mechanics of how to make contributions to the Program;
234 (3) how to opt out of the Program;

236 the default contribution rate.
12 of 20
237 (5) the process for withdrawal of retirement savings;
238 (6) how to obtain additional information about the Program;
239 (7) that employees seeking financial advice should contact financial advisors, that
240 participating employers are not in a position to provide financial advice, and that participating
241 employers are not liable for decisions employees make pursuant to this Act;
242 (8) that the Program is not an employer-sponsored retirement plan; and
243 (9) that the Program Fund is not guaranteed by the Commonwealth.
244 (c) The employee information packet shall also include a form for an employee to note
245 his or her decision to opt out of participation in the Program or elect to participate with a level of
246 employee contributions other than the default rate set by the Board.
247 (d) Participating employers shall supply the employee information packet to employees
248 after the employer has registered for the Program. Participating employers shall supply the
249 employee information packet to new employees at the time of hiring, and new employees may
250 opt out of participation in the Program or elect to participate with a level of employee
251 contributions other than the default contribution rate at that time.
252 SECTION 14. The Program shall be implemented, and enrollment of employees shall
253 begin, within 24 months after the effective date of this Act. The provisions of this Section shall
254 be in force after the Board opens the Program for enrollment.
255 (a) Each employer shall establish a payroll deposit retirement savings arrangement to
256 allow each employee to participate in the Program on a timeline set by the Board.
13 of 20
257 (b) Employers shall automatically enroll in the Program each of their employees who has
258 not opted out of participation in the Program and shall provide payroll deduction retirement
259 savings arrangements and deposit, on behalf of such employees, these funds into the Program.
260 (c) Enrollees shall have the ability to select a contribution level into the Fund. This level
261 may be expressed as a percentage of wages or as a dollar amount up to the deductible amount for
262 the enrollee's taxable year under Section 219(b)(1)(A) of the Internal Revenue Code. Enrollees
263 may change their contribution level at any time, subject to rules promulgated by the Board. If an
264 enrollee fails to select a contribution level using the form prescribed by the Board, then he or she
265 shall contribute the default contribution rate of his or her wages to the Program.
266 (d) Enrollees may select an investment option from the permitted investment options
267 listed in Section 11 of this Act. Enrollees may change their investment option at any time,
268 subject to rules promulgated by the Board. In the event that an enrollee fails to select an
269 investment option, that enrollee shall be placed in the investment option selected by the Board as
270 the default.
271 (e) Employers shall retain the option at all times to set up any type of employer-
272 sponsored retirement plan, such as a defined benefit plan or a 401(k), Simplified Employee
273 Pension (SEP) plan, or Savings Incentive Match Plan for Employees (SIMPLE) plan, instead of
274 having a payroll deposit retirement savings arrangement to allow employee participation in the
275 Program.
276 (f) An enrollee may terminate his or her participation in the Program at any time in a
277 manner prescribed by the Board.
14 of 20

280 payroll deposit retirement savings arrangements established by the Board, either:
281 (1) on or before the last day of the month following the month in which the compensation
282 otherwise would have been payable to the employee in cash; or
283 (2) before such later deadline prescribed by the Board for making such payments, but not
284 later than the due date for the deposit of tax required to be deducted and withheld relating to
285 collection of income tax at source on wages or for the deposit of tax required to be paid under the
286 unemployment insurance system for the payroll period to which such payments relate.
287 SECTION 16. (1) The State, the Board, each member of the Board or other State official,
288 other State boards, commissions, or agencies, any member, officer, or employee thereof, and the
289 Program --
290 (a) have no responsibility for compliance by individuals with the conditions and other

292 tax-favored contributions to IRAs, in what amount, and in what time frame and manner,

299 any gain, or any other adverse consequences, including without limitation any adverse tax
300 consequences or loss of favorable tax treatment, public assistance or other benefits, incurred by
301 any person as a result of participating in the Program.
302 (2) The debts, contracts, and obligations of the Program or the Board are not the debts,
303 contracts, and obligations of the State, and neither the faith and credit nor the taxing power of the
304 State is pledged directly or indirectly to the payment of the debts, contracts, and obligations of
305 the Program or the Board.
306 SECTION 17. (a) Participating employers shall not have any liability for an employee's
307 decision to participate in, or opt out of, the Program or for the investment decisions of the Board
308 or of any enrollee.

324 consultants, independent contractors, and any other persons who are not State employees for the
325 administration of the Program.

327 periodic reports at least annually to enrollees, reporting contributions and investment income
328 allocated to, withdrawals from, and balances in their Program accounts for the reporting period.
329 Such reports may include any other information regarding the Program as the Board may
330 determine.
331 SECTION 19. Penalties.
332 (a) An employer who fails without reasonable cause to enroll an employee in the Program
333 within the time prescribed under this Act shall be subject to a penalty equal to:
334 (1) $250 for each employee for each calendar year or portion of a calendar year during
335 which the employee neither was enrolled in the Program nor had elected out of participation in
336 the Program; and the employee or any appropriate official of the State may bring a civil action to
337 require the employer to enroll the employee and shall recover such costs and reasonable
338 attorney’s fees as may be allowed by the court; and
17 of 20
339 (2) for each calendar year beginning after the date a penalty has been assessed with
340 respect to an employee, $500 for any portion of that calendar year during which such employee
341 continues to be unenrolled without electing out of participation in the Program.
342 (3) No penalty shall be imposed under subsection 19(a) on any failure for which it is
343 established that the employer subject to liability for the penalty did not know that the failure
344 existed and exercised reasonable diligence to meet the requirements of this Act.
345 (4) No penalty shall be imposed under subsection 19(a) on any failure if:
346 (A) the employer subject to liability for the penalty exercised reasonable diligence to
347 meet those requirements; and
348 (B) the employer complies with those requirements with respect to each employee by the
349 end of the 90-day period beginning on the first date the employer knew, or exercising reasonable
350 diligence would have known, that the failure existed.
351 (5) In the case of a failure that is due to reasonable cause and not to willful neglect, all or
352 part of the penalty may be waived to the extent that the payment of the penalty would be
353 excessive or otherwise inequitable relative to the failure involved.
354 (6) Provide that, if a participating employer fails to transmit a payroll deduction
355 contribution to the Program on the earliest date the amount withheld from the enrollee’s
356 compensation can reasonably be segregated from the participating employer’s assets, but not
357 later than the 15th day of the month following the month in which the enrollee’s contribution
358 amounts are withheld from his or her paycheck, the failure to remit such contributions on a
18 of 20
359 timely basis shall be subject to the same sanctions as employer misappropriation of employee
360 wage withholdings and to the penalties specified in subsection 19(a) above.
361 (b) Except as provided in this subsection, all information received by the Department
362 from returns filed by an employer or from any investigation conducted under the provisions of
363 this Act shall be confidential, except for official purposes within the Department or pursuant to
364 official procedures for collection of penalties assessed under this Act. Nothing contained in this
365 subsection shall prevent the Commissioner from publishing or making available to the public
366 reasonable statistics concerning the operation of this Act wherein the contents of returns are
367 grouped into aggregates in such a way that the specific information of any employer shall not be
368 disclosed. Nothing contained in this subsection shall prevent the Commissioner from divulging
369 information to an authorized representative of the employer or to any person pursuant to a
370 request or authorization made by the employer or by an authorized representative of the
371 employer.
372 (c) Civil penalties collected under this Act and fees collected pursuant to subsection (d)
373 of this Section shall be deposited into the Tax Compliance and Administration Fund. The
374 Department may, subject to appropriation, use moneys in the fund to cover expenses it incurs in
375 the performance of its duties under this Act. Interest attributable to moneys in the Tax
376 Compliance and Administration Fund shall be credited to the Tax Compliance and
377 Administration Fund.
378 (d) The Department may charge the Board a reasonable fee for its costs in performing its
379 duties under this Section to the extent that such costs have not been recovered from penalties
380 imposed under this Section.
19 of 20
381 (e) This Section shall go into effect 9 months after the Board notifies the Commissioner
382 that the Program has been implemented. Upon receipt of such notification from the Board, the
383 Department shall immediately post on its Internet website a notice stating that this Section is in
384 effect. This notice shall include a statement that rather than enrolling employees in the Program
385 under this Act, employers may sponsor an alternative arrangement, including, but not limited to,
386 a defined benefit plan, 401(k) plan, a Simplified Employee Pension (SEP) plan, or a Savings
387 Incentive Match Plan for Employees (SIMPLE) plan. The Board shall provide a link to the
388 vendor Internet website.
389 SECTION 20. The Department shall adopt rules and regulations, in accordance with the
390 Massachusetts Administrative Procedure Act (Mass. Gen. Laws Ch. 30A), that may be necessary
391 to implement this Act.
392 SECTION 21. If the Board does not obtain adequate funds to implement the Program
393 within the time frame set forth under Section 14 of this Act, the Board may delay the
394 implementation of the Program.
395 SECTION 22. The Board shall request in writing an opinion or ruling from the
396 appropriate entity with jurisdiction over the federal Employee Retirement Income Security Act
397 regarding the applicability of the federal Employee Retirement Income Security Act to the
398 Program. The Board may not implement the Program if the IRA arrangements offered under the
399 Program fail to qualify for the favorable federal income tax treatment ordinarily accorded to
400 IRAs under the Internal Revenue Code or if it is determined that the Program is an employee
401 benefit plan and State or employer liability is established under the federal Employee Retirement
402 Income Security Act.

5 of 20

90 (2) by investing with the care, skill, prudence, and diligence under the prevailing
91 circumstances that a prudent person acting in a like capacity and familiar with those matters
92 would use in the conduct of an enterprise of a like character and with like aims.
93 SECTION 8. In addition to the other duties and responsibilities stated in this Act, the
94 Board shall:

96 (1) accords with best practices for retirement savings vehicles;
97 (2) maximizes participation, savings, and sound investment practices;

108 Fund, including, but not limited to, retaining and contracting with investment managers, private
6 of 20

109 financial institutions, other financial and service providers, consultants, actuaries, counsel,
110 auditors, third-party administrators, and other professionals as necessary.
111 (e) Conduct a review of the performance of any investment vendors no less frequently
112 than every 4 years, including, but not limited to, a review of returns, fees, and customer service.
113 A copy of reviews conducted under this subsection shall be posted to the Board's Internet
114 website.
115 (f) Determine the number and duties of staff members needed to administer the Program
116 and assemble such a staff, including, as needed, employing staff, appointing a Program
117 administrator, and entering into contracts with the State Treasurer to make employees of the
118 State Treasurer's Office available to administer the Program.
119 (g) Cause moneys in the Fund to be held and invested as pooled investments with a view
120 to achieving cost savings through efficiencies and economies of scale.
121 (h) Evaluate and establish the process by which an enrollee is able to contribute a portion
122 of his or her wages to the Program for automatic deposit of those contributions and the process
123 by which the participating employer provides a payroll deposit retirement savings arrangement to
124 forward those contributions and related information to the Program, including, but not limited to,
125 contracting with financial service companies and third-party administrators with the capability to
126 receive and process employee information and contributions for payroll deposit retirement
127 savings arrangements or similar arrangements.
128 (i) Design and establish the process for enrollment under Section 14 of this Act, including
129 the default contribution rate, account type, investment option, and automatic escalation rate. The
130 Board shall also design and establish the process by which an employee can:
7 of 20

131 (1) opt not to participate in the Program; (2) select a contribution rate, account type,
132 investment option, or escalation rate different than the default options set by the Board; or (3)
133 terminate participation in the Program.
134 (j) Evaluate and establish the process by which an individual may voluntarily enroll in
135 and make contributions to the Program.
136 (k) Accept any grants, appropriations, or other moneys from the Commonwealth, any unit
137 of federal, State, or local government, or any other person, firm, partnership, or corporation
138 solely for deposit into the Fund, whether for investment or administrative purposes.
139 (l) Evaluate the need for, and procure as needed, insurance against any and all loss in
140 connection with the property, assets, or activities of the Program, and indemnify as needed each
141 member of the Board from personal loss or liability resulting from a member's action or inaction
142 as a member of the Board.
143 (m) Make provisions for the payment of administrative costs and expenses for the
144 creation, management, and operation of the Program. Subject to appropriation, the
145 Commonwealth may pay administrative costs associated with the creation and management of
146 the Program until sufficient assets are available in the Fund for that purpose. Thereafter, all
147 administrative costs of the Fund, including repayment of any start-up funds provided by the
148 State, shall be paid only out of moneys on deposit therein. However, private funds or federal
149 funding received in order to implement the Program until the Fund is self-sustaining shall not be
150 repaid unless those funds were offered contingent upon the promise of such repayment. The
151 Board shall keep annual administrative expenses as low as possible and is authorized to charge

152 and collect reasonable administrative fees from enrollees. (n) Allocate administrative fees to

159 Program under the Internal Revenue Code, including tax qualification requirements or any other
160 applicable law and accounting requirements.
161 (r) Carry out the duties and obligations of the Program in an effective, efficient, and low-
162 cost manner.
163 (s) Exercise any and all other powers reasonably necessary for the effectuation of the
164 purposes, objectives, and provisions of this Act pertaining to the Program.
165 (t) Deposit into the Massachusetts Secure Choice Administrative Fund all grants, gifts,
166 donations, fees, and earnings from investments from the Massachusetts Secure Choice Savings
167 Program Fund that are used to recover administrative costs. All expenses of the Board shall be
168 paid from the Massachusetts Secure Choice Administrative Fund.
169 SECTION 9. The Board shall prepare and adopt a written statement of investment policy
170 that includes a risk management and oversight program. This investment policy shall prohibit the
171 Board, Program, and Fund from borrowing for investment purposes. The risk management and
172 oversight program shall be designed to ensure that an effective risk management system is in
9 of 20

173 place to monitor the risk levels of the Program and Fund portfolio, to ensure that the risks taken
174 are prudent and properly managed, to provide an integrated process for overall risk management,
175 and to assess investment returns as well as risk to determine if the risks taken are adequately
176 compensated compared to applicable performance benchmarks and standards. The Board shall
177 consider the statement of investment policy and any changes in the investment policy at a public
178 hearing.
179 SECTION 10. (a) The Board shall engage, after an open bid process, an investment
180 manager or managers to invest the Fund and any other assets of the Program. Moneys in the
181 Fund may be invested or reinvested by the State Treasurer's Office or may be invested in whole
182 or in part under contract with the State Board of Investment, private investment managers, or
183 both, as selected by the Board. In selecting the investment manager or managers, the Board shall
184 take into consideration and give weight to the investment manager's fees and charges in order to
185 reduce the Program's administrative expenses.
186 (b) The investment manager or managers shall comply with any and all applicable federal
187 and state laws, rules, and regulations, as well as any and all rules, policies, and guidelines
188 promulgated by the Board with respect to the Program and the investment of the Fund, including,
189 but not limited to, the investment policy.
190 (c) The investment manager or managers shall provide such reports as the Board deems
191 necessary for the Board to oversee each investment manager's performance and the performance
192 of the Fund.
193 SECTION 11. (a) The Board shall establish as an investment option a life-cycle fund
194 with a target date based upon the age of the enrollee. This shall be the default investment option
10 of 20

195 for enrollees who fail to elect an investment option unless and until the Board designates by rule
196 a new investment option as the default.
197 (b) The Board may also establish additional investment options, including, but not limited
198 to, any of the following:
199 (1) a conservative principal protection fund;
200 (2) a growth fund;
201 (3) a secure return fund whose primary objective is the preservation of the safety of
202 principal and the provision of a stable and low-risk rate of return; if the Board elects to establish
203 a secure return fund, the Board may procure any insurance, annuity, or other product to insure
204 the value of individuals' accounts and guarantee a rate of return; the cost of such funding
205 mechanism shall be paid out of the Fund; under no circumstances shall the Board, Program,
206 Fund, the State, or any participating employer assume any liability for investment or actuarial
207 risk; the Board shall determine whether to establish such investment options based upon an
208 analysis of their cost, risk profile, benefit level, feasibility, and ease of implementation;
209 (4) an annuity fund.
210 SECTION 12. (a) The Board may enter into an intergovernmental agreement or
211 memorandum of understanding with the State and any agency of the State to receive outreach,
212 technical assistance, enforcement and compliance services, collection or dissemination of
213 information pertinent to the Program (subject to such obligations of confidentiality as may be
214 agreed or required by law), or other services or assistance. The State and any agencies of the
215 State that enter into such agreements or memoranda of understanding shall collaborate to provide
11 of 20

216 the outreach, assistance, information, and compliance or other services or assistance to the
217 Board. The memoranda of understanding may cover the sharing of costs incurred in gathering
218 and disseminating information and the reimbursement of costs for any enforcement activities or
219 assistance.
220 (b) All agencies of the Commonwealth shall cooperate as requested by the Program in the
221 performance of its duties under this Act, including, unless otherwise prohibited, the sharing of
222 relevant data as the parties shall mutually agree.
223 (c) The Board shall assess the feasibility of multistate or regional agreements to
224 administer the Program through shared administrative and operational resources and may enter
225 into those agreements if deemed beneficial to the Program.
226 Section 13. (a) The Board shall design and disseminate an employer information packet
227 and an employee information packet, which shall include background information on the
228 Program, appropriate disclosures for employees, and information regarding the Internet website
229 described in Section 8 of this Act.
230 (b) The employee information packet shall include a disclosure form. The disclosure
231 form shall explain, but not be limited to, all of the following:
232 (1) the benefits and risks associated with making contributions to the Program;
233 (2) the mechanics of how to make contributions to the Program;
234 (3) how to opt out of the Program;
235 (4) how to participate in the Program with a level of employee contributions other than
236 the default contribution rate.
12 of 20

237 (5) the process for withdrawal of retirement savings;
238 (6) how to obtain additional information about the Program;
239 (7) that employees seeking financial advice should contact financial advisors, that
240 participating employers are not in a position to provide financial advice, and that participating
241 employers are not liable for decisions employees make pursuant to this Act;
242 (8) that the Program is not an employer-sponsored retirement plan; and
243 (9) that the Program Fund is not guaranteed by the Commonwealth.
244 (c) The employee information packet shall also include a form for an employee to note
245 his or her decision to opt out of participation in the Program or elect to participate with a level of
246 employee contributions other than the default rate set by the Board.
247 (d) Participating employers shall supply the employee information packet to employees
248 after the employer has registered for the Program. Participating employers shall supply the
249 employee information packet to new employees at the time of hiring, and new employees may
250 opt out of participation in the Program or elect to participate with a level of employee
251 contributions other than the default contribution rate at that time.
252 SECTION 14. The Program shall be implemented, and enrollment of employees shall
253 begin, within 24 months after the effective date of this Act. The provisions of this Section shall
254 be in force after the Board opens the Program for enrollment.
255 (a) Each employer shall establish a payroll deposit retirement savings arrangement to
256 allow each employee to participate in the Program on a timeline set by the Board.
13 of 20

257 (b) Employers shall automatically enroll in the Program each of their employees who has
258 not opted out of participation in the Program and shall provide payroll deduction retirement
259 savings arrangements and deposit, on behalf of such employees, these funds into the Program.
260 (c) Enrollees shall have the ability to select a contribution level into the Fund. This level
261 may be expressed as a percentage of wages or as a dollar amount up to the deductible amount for
262 the enrollee's taxable year under Section 219(b)(1)(A) of the Internal Revenue Code. Enrollees
263 may change their contribution level at any time, subject to rules promulgated by the Board. If an
264 enrollee fails to select a contribution level using the form prescribed by the Board, then he or she
265 shall contribute the default contribution rate of his or her wages to the Program.
266 (d) Enrollees may select an investment option from the permitted investment options
267 listed in Section 11 of this Act. Enrollees may change their investment option at any time,
268 subject to rules promulgated by the Board. In the event that an enrollee fails to select an
269 investment option, that enrollee shall be placed in the investment option selected by the Board as
270 the default.
271 (e) Employers shall retain the option at all times to set up any type of employer-
272 sponsored retirement plan, such as a defined benefit plan or a 401(k), Simplified Employee
273 Pension (SEP) plan, or Savings Incentive Match Plan for Employees (SIMPLE) plan, instead of
274 having a payroll deposit retirement savings arrangement to allow employee participation in the
275 Program.
276 (f) An enrollee may terminate his or her participation in the Program at any time in a
277 manner prescribed by the Board.

300 consequences or loss of favorable tax treatment, public assistance or other benefits, incurred by
301 any person as a result of participating in the Program.
302 (2) The debts, contracts, and obligations of the Program or the Board are not the debts,
303 contracts, and obligations of the State, and neither the faith and credit nor the taxing power of the
304 State is pledged directly or indirectly to the payment of the debts, contracts, and obligations of
305 the Program or the Board.
306 SECTION 17. (a) Participating employers shall not have any liability for an employee's
307 decision to participate in, or opt out of, the Program or for the investment decisions of the Board
308 or of any enrollee.

323 include, but is not limited to, direct and indirect costs attributable to the use of outside
324 consultants, independent contractors, and any other persons who are not State employees for the
325 administration of the Program.
326 (b) In addition to any other statements or reports required by law, the Board shall provide
327 periodic reports at least annually to enrollees, reporting contributions and investment income
328 allocated to, withdrawals from, and balances in their Program accounts for the reporting period.
329 Such reports may include any other information regarding the Program as the Board may
330 determine.
331 SECTION 19. Penalties.
332 (a) An employer who fails without reasonable cause to enroll an employee in the Program
333 within the time prescribed under this Act shall be subject to a penalty equal to:
334 (1) $250 for each employee for each calendar year or portion of a calendar year during
335 which the employee neither was enrolled in the Program nor had elected out of participation in
336 the Program; and the employee or any appropriate official of the State may bring a civil action to
337 require the employer to enroll the employee and shall recover such costs and reasonable
338 attorney’s fees as may be allowed by the court; and
17 of 20

339 (2) for each calendar year beginning after the date a penalty has been assessed with
340 respect to an employee, $500 for any portion of that calendar year during which such employee
341 continues to be unenrolled without electing out of participation in the Program.
342 (3) No penalty shall be imposed under subsection 19(a) on any failure for which it is
343 established that the employer subject to liability for the penalty did not know that the failure
344 existed and exercised reasonable diligence to meet the requirements of this Act.
345 (4) No penalty shall be imposed under subsection 19(a) on any failure if:
346 (A) the employer subject to liability for the penalty exercised reasonable diligence to
347 meet those requirements; and
348 (B) the employer complies with those requirements with respect to each employee by the
349 end of the 90-day period beginning on the first date the employer knew, or exercising reasonable
350 diligence would have known, that the failure existed.
351 (5) In the case of a failure that is due to reasonable cause and not to willful neglect, all or
352 part of the penalty may be waived to the extent that the payment of the penalty would be
353 excessive or otherwise inequitable relative to the failure involved.
354 (6) Provide that, if a participating employer fails to transmit a payroll deduction
355 contribution to the Program on the earliest date the amount withheld from the enrollee’s
356 compensation can reasonably be segregated from the participating employer’s assets, but not
357 later than the 15th day of the month following the month in which the enrollee’s contribution
358 amounts are withheld from his or her paycheck, the failure to remit such contributions on a
18 of 20

359 timely basis shall be subject to the same sanctions as employer misappropriation of employee
360 wage withholdings and to the penalties specified in subsection 19(a) above.
361 (b) Except as provided in this subsection, all information received by the Department
362 from returns filed by an employer or from any investigation conducted under the provisions of
363 this Act shall be confidential, except for official purposes within the Department or pursuant to
364 official procedures for collection of penalties assessed under this Act. Nothing contained in this
365 subsection shall prevent the Commissioner from publishing or making available to the public
366 reasonable statistics concerning the operation of this Act wherein the contents of returns are
367 grouped into aggregates in such a way that the specific information of any employer shall not be
368 disclosed. Nothing contained in this subsection shall prevent the Commissioner from divulging
369 information to an authorized representative of the employer or to any person pursuant to a
370 request or authorization made by the employer or by an authorized representative of the
371 employer.
372 (c) Civil penalties collected under this Act and fees collected pursuant to subsection (d)
373 of this Section shall be deposited into the Tax Compliance and Administration Fund. The
374 Department may, subject to appropriation, use moneys in the fund to cover expenses it incurs in
375 the performance of its duties under this Act. Interest attributable to moneys in the Tax
376 Compliance and Administration Fund shall be credited to the Tax Compliance and
377 Administration Fund.
378 (d) The Department may charge the Board a reasonable fee for its costs in performing its
379 duties under this Section to the extent that such costs have not been recovered from penalties
380 imposed under this Section.
19 of 20

381 (e) This Section shall go into effect 9 months after the Board notifies the Commissioner
382 that the Program has been implemented. Upon receipt of such notification from the Board, the
383 Department shall immediately post on its Internet website a notice stating that this Section is in
384 effect. This notice shall include a statement that rather than enrolling employees in the Program
385 under this Act, employers may sponsor an alternative arrangement, including, but not limited to,
386 a defined benefit plan, 401(k) plan, a Simplified Employee Pension (SEP) plan, or a Savings
387 Incentive Match Plan for Employees (SIMPLE) plan. The Board shall provide a link to the
388 vendor Internet website.
389 SECTION 20. The Department shall adopt rules and regulations, in accordance with the
390 Massachusetts Administrative Procedure Act (Mass. Gen. Laws Ch. 30A), that may be necessary
391 to implement this Act.
392 SECTION 21. If the Board does not obtain adequate funds to implement the Program
393 within the time frame set forth under Section 14 of this Act, the Board may delay the
394 implementation of the Program.
395 SECTION 22. The Board shall request in writing an opinion or ruling from the
396 appropriate entity with jurisdiction over the federal Employee Retirement Income Security Act
397 regarding the applicability of the federal Employee Retirement Income Security Act to the
398 Program. The Board may not implement the Program if the IRA arrangements offered under the
399 Program fail to qualify for the favorable federal income tax treatment ordinarily accorded to
400 IRAs under the Internal Revenue Code or if it is determined that the Program is an employee
401 benefit plan and State or employer liability is established under the federal Employee Retirement
402 Income Security Act.
