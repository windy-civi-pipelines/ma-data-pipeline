117 regulation made by the commissioner under any provision of sections 96 to 114, inclusive, or
118 any other law applicable to the conduct of the business; or
6 of 40
119 (ii) any fact or condition exists which, if it had existed at the time of the original
120 application for the license, would have warranted the commissioner in refusing to issue the
121 license.
122 Except as provided in section 103A, no license shall be revoked or suspended except
123 after notice and a hearing thereon pursuant to chapter 30A.
124 A licensee may surrender a license by delivering to the commissioner written notice that
125 it thereby surrenders the license, but the surrender shall not affect the civil or criminal liability of
126 the licensee for acts committed before the surrender.
127 No revocation, suspension or surrender of any license shall impair or affect the obligation
128 of any pre-existing lawful contract between the licensee and any person.
129 The penalty provision of this section shall be in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other
130 provision of law applicable to a licensee or other person for violating section 96, 97, 98, 100,

135 made by the commissioner under section 97 or 106, or any other law applicable to the conduct of
136 the business, the commissioner may order the licensee to cease and desist from the unlawful act
137 or practice and take affirmative action as in the commissioner’s judgment will effect the purpose
138 of sections 97, 98, 100, 101, 102, 104 or 109, or any rule or regulation made by the
139 commissioner under section 97 or 106, or any other law applicable to the conduct of the

144 commissioner shall promptly notify, in writing, the licensee affected thereby that the order has
145 been so entered, the reasons therefor, and that within 20 days after receipt of a written request

383 The commissioner may, in the commissioner’s discretion, furnish to regulatory agencies of the
384 federal government, of other states, or of foreign countries, and any law enforcement agency,
385 such information, reports, inspections and statements relating to the licensees under the

402 adopted hereunder, or any other law applicable to the conduct of its business; or
403 (ii) any fact or condition exists which, if it had existed at the time of the original
404 application for such license, would have warranted the commissioner in refusing to issue such
405 license.
406 Except as provided in section 8, no license shall be revoked or suspended except after
407 notice and a hearing thereon pursuant to 30A.
408 A licensee may surrender a license by delivering to the commissioner written notice that
409 it thereby surrenders such license, but such surrender shall not affect the civil or criminal liability
410 of the licensee for acts committed before such surrender.
411 No revocation, suspension or surrender of any license shall impair or affect the obligation
412 of any pre-existing lawful contract between the licensee and any person.
413 SECTION 18. Said chapter 255B, as so appearing, is hereby amended by striking out
414 section 8 and inserting in place thereof the following two sections:-

20 of 40
420 (b) If the commissioner makes written findings of fact that the public interest will be
421 irreparably harmed by delay in issuing an order under subsection (a) the commissioner may issue

428 the commissioner. If a hearing is requested or ordered, the commissioner, after giving notice of
429 and opportunity for a hearing to the licensee subject to the order, shall, by written finding of facts
430 and conclusions of law, vacate, modify or make permanent the order.

460 or restitution in a court of competent jurisdiction.

513 under a subsidiary or different company name, who provides premium financing only to their
514 own customers for purposes of financing payment of premiums on contracts of insurance, which

552 A licensee may surrender a license by delivering to the commissioner written notice that
553 it thereby surrenders the license, but the surrender shall not affect the civil or criminal liability of

734 adopted hereunder, or any other law applicable to the conduct of its business; or

745 SECTION 32. Said chapter 255D, as so appearing, is hereby further amended by striking

755 commissioner shall promptly notify, in writing, the licensee affected thereby that the order has

811 thereon. The hearing shall be fixed for a date not more than 30 days after the date of service upon
812 the commissioner of the request for a hearing. If the person fails to submit a request for a hearing
813 within 20 days of service of notice under subsection (a), or otherwise fails to appear in person or
814 by a duly authorized representative, the party shall be deemed to have consented to the issuance
815 of an order of prohibition in accordance with the notice.

819 appropriate.

824 commissioner or a court of competent jurisdiction.
825 (e) Except as consented to in writing by the commissioner, any person who, pursuant to
826 an order issued under subsection (b) or (c), has been prohibited from participating in whole or in
827 part in the conduct of the affairs of a sales finance company in Massachusetts may not, while the
828 order is in effect, continue or commence to perform in the capacity of a principal employee, or
829 otherwise participate in any manner, if so prohibited by order of the commissioner, in the
830 conduct of the affairs of:
831 (1) any licensee under this chapter;
832 (2) any other business which requires a license from the commissioner; and
833 (3) any bank, as defined under section 1 of chapter 167, or any subsidiary thereof.

835 amended by adding the following paragraph:-
836 The commissioner, or the commissioner’s examiners, or other assistants as the
837 commissioner may designate, may summon the directors, officers or agents of a licensee, or any
838 other witnesses, and examine them relative to the affairs, transactions and condition of the
839 licensee, and, for that purpose, may administer oaths. Whoever, without justifiable cause, refuses
840 to appear and testify when so required or obstructs the person making the examination in the
841 performance of their duty, shall be punished by a fine of not more than $1,000 or by
842 imprisonment for not more than 1 year.
