An Act requiring wireless infrastructure insurance to support electrical, mechanical, and non-
ionizing radiation safety.
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives in General Court assembled, and by the authority
of the same, as follows:
1 SECTION 1. The legislature finds and confirms all of the following:-
2 Whereas, decades of research indicates wireless can impair health, with numerous studies
3 showing damage to DNA, to fertility, and increases in cancer, in addition to a growing list of
4 studies showing harm to mental health, diabetes risk, increased dementia, etc.
5 Whereas, wireless facilities are a fire risk due to overloaded poles, poorly maintained
6 equipment, and electrical engineering failures causing dangerous electrical fires near homes that
7 block escape routes and may require an hour or so before utilities shut off power and allow
8 firefighters to put out the fire with resulting loss of emergency call access as power is gone as
9 has been especially problematic in large fires.

10 Whereas, the Pittsfield Board of Health in April 2022 issued an an Emergency Order to
11 Verizon to turn off a cell tower because of sick residents.
12 Whereas, the Massachusetts Association for Boards of Health now includes cell tower
13 risks in the last four pages of the Legal Handbook and Public Health Guidebook for
14 Massachusetts Boards of Health (2021) and also filed an amicus brief in support the injured
15 Pittsfield citizens (referenced above).
16 Whereas, in 2020, Boston in FCC’s 19-226 docket stated: 'Boston believes that the
17 concerns of the public are real and that the Commission has done a disservice to itself, local
18 government, consumers, and even the wireless industry in failing to understand and respond to
19 the broadly shared mistrust of the safety of RF emissions.'
20 Whereas, the Federal Communications Commission has routinely undercut local control,
21 promoted hasty installation, mandated residential antennas, and allowed small 5G antennas
22 serving other users to be placed on private residences without permit under the satellite TV or
23 “OTARD” rule.
24 Resolved, that the policy goals of this act shall be to provide a minimum floor of
25 insurance requirements for wireless infrastructure within the commonwealth to serve as an
26 incentive for insurers to regulate and require safety.
