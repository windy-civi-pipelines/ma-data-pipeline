349 control, and supervision of the Executive Director of the Trust. The director of the quality
350 assurance division shall be appointed by the Executive Director of the Trust, with the approval of
351 the Board of Trustees, and may, with like approval, be removed. The director may, at the

354 public.
355 (b) The quality assurance division shall support the establishment of a universal, best
356 quality of standard of care using best practices with respect to: (1) appropriate hospital staffing
357 levels for quality care; (2) evidence-based best clinical practices developed from analysis of
358 outcomes of medical interventions; appropriate medical technology; (3) design and scope of
359 work in the health workplace; and development of clinical practices that lead toward elimination
360 of medical errors; (4) timely access to needed medical and dental care; (5) development of
361 medical homes that provide efficient patient-centered integrated care; and (6) compassionate
362 end-of-life care that provides comfort and relief of pain in an appropriate setting evidence-based
363 best clinical practices.
364 (c) The director shall conduct a comprehensive annual review of the quality of health care
365 services and outcomes throughout the Commonwealth and submit such recommendations to the
366 Board of Trustees as may be required to maintain and improve the quality of health care service
367 delivery and the overall health of Massachusetts residents. In making its reviews, the quality
368 assurance division shall consult with the regional, administrative, and planning divisions and
18 of 35
369 hold public hearings throughout the state on quality of care issues. The division shall submit to
370 the Board of Trustees its final annual review and recommendations on how to ensure the highest
371 quality health care service delivery by October 1. Subject to Board approval, the Trust shall
372 adopt the recommendations.
373 Section 12. Eligible Participants
374 (a) The following persons shall be eligible participants in the Massachusetts Health Care
375 Trust:

377 (2) all non-residents who:
378 (i) work 20 hours or more per week in Massachusetts;
379 (ii) pay all applicable Massachusetts personal income and payroll taxes; and

382 provided, however, that the Trust shall recoup expenses for such patients wherever possible.
383 (b) Payment for emergency care of Massachusetts residents obtained out of state shall be
384 at prevailing rates where service occurred. Payment for non-emergency care of Massachusetts
385 residents obtained out of state shall be according to rates and conditions established by the
386 Executive Director. The Executive Director may require that a resident be transported back to

388 transportation is safe for the patient in light of the patient’s medical condition.
19 of 35
389 (c) Visitors to Massachusetts shall be billed for all services received under the system.
390 The Executive Director of the Trust may establish intergovernmental arrangements with other
391 states and countries to provide reciprocal coverage for temporary visitors.
392 Section 13. Eligible Health Care Providers
393 (a) Eligible health care providers shall include an agency, facility, corporation,
394 individual, or other entity directly rendering any covered benefit to an eligible patient: provided,
395 however, that the health care provider:
396 (1) is licensed to operate or practice in the Commonwealth;
397 (2) does not accept payment from other sources for services provided for by the Trust;
398 (3) furnishes a signed agreement that:
399 (i) all health care services will be provided without discrimination on the basis of factors
400 including, but not limited to age, sex, race, national origin, sexual orientation, gender identity,
401 income status, preexisting condition, or citizenship status;
402 (ii) the health care provider will comply with all state and federal laws regarding the
403 confidentiality of patient records and information;
404 (iii) no balance billing or out-of-pocket charges will be made for covered services unless
405 otherwise provided in this chapter; and
406 (iv) the health care provider will furnish such information as may be reasonably required
407 by the Trust for making payment, verifying reimbursement and rebate information, utilization

409 law;
410 (4) meets state and federal quality guidelines including guidance for safe staffing, quality
411 of care, and efficient use of funds for direct patient care; and
412 (5) meets whatever additional requirements that may be established by the Trust.
413 (6) Since a hospital’s purpose is to serve patients and not to enrich private shareholders,
414 the department of public health shall not issue a license or renew a license for a hospital under
415 section 51 of chapter 111 unless said hospital is organized as a non-profit entity under section
416 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code .
417 Section 14. Budgeting and Payments to Eligible Health Care Providers
418 (a) To carry out this Act there are established on an annual basis:
419 (1) an operating budget;
420 (2) a capital expenditures budget;
421 (3) reimbursement levels for non-institutional providers consistent with rates set by the
422 Trust that ensure that: (i) the total costs of all services offered by or through the provider are
423 reasonable; and (ii) the aggregate rates of the provider are related reasonably to the aggregate
424 costs of the health care provider; and
425 (4) budgets for institutional providers. These budgets shall consist of an operating and a
426 capital budget. An institution’s annual budget shall be set to cover its anticipated health care
427 services for the next year based on past performance and projected changes in prices and health
21 of 35
428 care service and utilization levels. The annual budget for each individual institutional provider
429 shall be set separately. The board shall not set a joint budget for a group of more than one
430 institutional provider nor for a parent corporation that owns or operates one or more institutional
431 providers.
432 (b) The operating budget shall be used for:
433 (1) payment for services rendered by physicians and other clinicians and non-institutional
434 providers;
435 (2) budgets for institutional providers; and
436 (3) administration of the Trust.
437 (c) Payments for operating expenses shall not be used to finance capital expenditures or
438 for activities to assist, promote, deter, or discourage union organizing. Any prospective payments
439 made in excess of actual costs for covered services shall be returned to the Trust. Prospective
440 payment rates and schedules shall be adjusted annually to incorporate retrospective adjustments.
441 Except as provided in Section 15 of this chapter, reimbursement for covered services by the
442 Trust shall constitute full payment for the services rendered.
443 (d) The Trust shall provide for retrospective adjustment of payments to eligible health
444 care providers to:
445 (1) assure that payments to such health care providers reflect the difference between
446 actual and projected use and expenditures for covered services; and
447 (2) protect health care providers who serve a disproportionate share of eligible
448 participants whose expected use of covered health care services and expected health care
22 of 35
449 expenditures for such services are greater than the average use and expenditure rates for eligible
450 participants statewide.
451 (e) The capital expenditures budget shall be used for funds needed for:
452 (1) the construction or renovation of health facilities; and
453 (2) major equipment purchases.
454 (f) Payment provided under this section shall be used only to pay for the capital costs of
455 eligible health care providers, including reasonable expenditures, as determined through budget
456 negotiations with the Trust, for the replacement and purchase of equipment.
457 (g) The Trust shall provide funding for payment of debt service on outstanding bonds as
458 of the effective date of this Act and shall be the sole source of future funding, whether directly or
459 indirectly, through the payment of debt service, for capital expenditures by health care providers
460 covered by the Trust in excess of a threshold amount to be determined annually by the Executive
461 Director.
462 Section 15. Covered Benefits
463 (a) The Trust shall pay for all professional services provided by eligible health care
464 providers to eligible participants needed to:

25 of 35
509 Section 16. Wraparound Coverage for Federal Health Programs
510 (a) Prior to obtaining any federal program's waivers to receive federal funds through the
511 Health Care Trust, the Trust shall seek to ensure that participants eligible for federal program
512 coverage receive access to care and coverage equal to that of all other Massachusetts
513 participants. It shall do so by (1) paying for all services enumerated under Section 15 not covered
514 by the relevant federal plans; (2) paying for all such services during any federally mandated gaps
515 in participants’ coverage; and (3) paying for any deductibles, co-payments, co-insurance, or
516 other cost sharing incurred by such participants.
517 Section 17. Establishment of the Health Care Trust Fund
518 (a) In order to support the Trust effectively, there is hereby established the health care
519 trust fund, hereinafter the Trust Fund, which shall be administered and expended by the
520 Executive Director of the Trust subject to the approval of the Board. The Trust Fund shall consist
521 of all revenue sources defined in Section 19, and all property and securities acquired by and
522 through the use of monies deposited to the Trust Fund, and all interest thereon less payments
523 therefrom to meet liabilities incurred by the Trust in the exercise of its powers and the
524 performance of its duties.
525 (b) All claims for health care services rendered shall be made to the Trust Fund and all
526 payments made for health care services shall be disbursed from the Trust Fund.
527 Section 18. Purpose of the Trust Fund
528 (a) Amounts credited to the Trust Fund shall be used for the following purposes:
529 (1) to pay eligible health care providers covered services rendered to eligible individuals;
26 of 35
530 (2) to fund capital expenditures for eligible health care providers for approved capital
531 investments in excess of a threshold amount to be determined annually by the Executive
532 Director;
533 (3) to pay for preventive care, education, outreach, and public health risk reduction
534 initiatives, not to exceed 5% of Trust income in any fiscal year;
535 (4) to supplement other sources of financing for education and training of the health care
536 workforce, not to exceed 2% of Trust income in any fiscal year;
537 (5) to supplement other sources of financing for medical research and innovation, not to
538 exceed 1% of Trust income in any fiscal year;
539 (6) to supplement other sources of financing for training and retraining programs for
540 workers displaced as a result of administrative streamlining gained by moving from a multi-
541 payer to a single payer health care system, not to exceed 2% of Trust income in any fiscal year:
542 provided, however, that eligible workers must have enrolled by June 20 of the third year
543 following full implementation of this chapter;
544 (7) to fund a reserve account to finance anticipated long-term cost increases due to
545 demographic changes, inflation, or other foreseeable trends that would increase Trust Fund
546 liabilities, and for budgetary shortfall, epidemics, and other extraordinary events, not to exceed
547 1% of Trust income in any fiscal year: provided, however, that the Trust reserve account shall at
548 no time constitute more than 5% of total Trust assets;
549 (8) to pay the administrative costs of the Trust which, within two years of full
550 implementation of this chapter shall not exceed 5% of Trust income in any fiscal year.
27 of 35
551 (b) Unexpended Trust assets shall not be deemed to be “surplus” funds as defined by
552 chapter twenty-nine of the general laws.
553 Section 19. Funding Sources
554 (a) The Trust shall be the repository for all health care funds and related administrative
555 funds. A fairly apportioned, dedicated health care tax on employers, workers, and residents will
556 replace spending on insurance premiums and out-of-pocket spending for services covered by the
557 Trust. The Trust shall enable the state to pass lower health care costs on to residents and
558 employers through savings from administrative simplification, negotiating prices, discounts on
559 pharmaceuticals and medical supplies, and through early detection and intervention by
560 universally available primary and preventive care. Additionally, collateral sources of revenue –
561 such as from the federal government, non-residents receiving care in the state, or from personal
562 liability – shall be recovered by the Trust. The Trust shall be funded by dedicated revenue
563 streams and its budget shall not affect other public health programs run by the state. Lastly, the
564 Trust shall enact provisions ensuring a smooth transition to a universal health care system for
565 employers and residents.
566 (b) The following dedicated health care taxes will replace spending on insurance
567 premiums and out-of-pocket spending for services covered by the Trust. Prior to each state fiscal
568 year of operation, the Trust will prepare for the Legislature a projected budget for the coming
569 fiscal year, with recommendations for rising or declining revenue needs.
570 (1) An employer payroll tax of 7.5 percent will be assessed on employee W-2 wages,
571 exempting the first $20,000 of payroll per establishment, replacing previous spending by
28 of 35
572 employers on health premiums. An additional employer payroll tax of 0.5 per cent will be
573 assessed on establishments with 100 or more employees;
574 (2) An employee payroll tax of 2.5 percent will be assessed, exempting the first $20,000
575 of income, replacing previous spending by employees on health premiums and out-of-pocket
576 expenses; all W-2 wages will be combined for each taxpayer and one $20,000 exemption will be
577 allowed;
578 (3) A 10 percent payroll tax on the self-employed, including general partnership income
579 and other income subject to self-employment tax for Federal purposes, will be assessed,
580 exempting the first $20,000 of payroll per self-employed taxpayer; income from all sources
581 subject to tax in this section shall be combined and allowed one $20,000 exemption per taxpayer;
582 and
583 (4) For the purposes of sections (2) and (3) above, each taxpayer will combine all income
584 reported on from IRS Form W-2s and self-employment income and be allowed one $20,000
585 exemption. The exemption will apply first to W-2 income and then to self-employment income.
586 (5) A 10 percent tax on taxable unearned income and all other income not specifically
587 excluded will be assessed on such income above $20,000. Exclusions not taxed: Social Security,
588 Supplemental Security Income (SSI), Social Security Disability Income (SSDI), unemployment
589 benefits, workers compensation benefits, sick pay, paid family and medical leave, capital gains
590 resulting from the sale of owner-occupied two- or three-family rental property, and defined
591 contribution and defined benefit pension payments. Capital gains from the portion attributed to a
592 primary residence in excess of the exclusion allowed by Massachusetts law will be subject to the
593 tax. The $20,000 exemption for this section shall be applied to each individual taxpayer.
29 of 35
594 (c) An employer, private or public, may agree to pay all or part of an employee’s payroll
595 tax obligation. Such payment shall not be considered income to the employee for Massachusetts
596 income tax purposes.
597 (d) Default, underpayment, or late payment of any tax or other obligation imposed by the
598 Trust shall result in the remedies and penalties provided by law, except as provided in this
599 section.
600 (e) Eligibility for benefits shall not be impaired by any default, underpayment, or late
601 payment of any tax or other obligation imposed by the Trust.
602 (f) It is the intent of this act to establish a single public payer for all health care in the
603 Commonwealth. Towards this end, public spending on health insurance shall be consolidated
604 into the Trust to the greatest extent possible. Until such time as the role of all other payers for
605 health care has been terminated, health care costs shall be collected from collateral sources
606 whenever medical services provided to an individual are, or may be, covered services under a
607 policy of insurance, health care service plan, or other collateral source available to that
608 individual, or for which the individual has a right of action for compensation to the extent
609 permitted by law.
610 (g) The Legislature shall be empowered to transfer funds from the General Fund
611 sufficient to meet the Trust’s projected expenses beyond projected income from dedicated tax
612 revenues. This lump transfer shall replace current General Fund spending on health benefits for
613 state employees, services for patients at public in-patient facilities, and all means- or needs-tested
614 health benefit programs.
30 of 35
615 (h) The Trust shall receive all monies paid to the Commonwealth by the federal
616 government for health care services covered by the Trust. The Trust shall seek to maximize all
617 sources of federal financial support for health care services in Massachusetts. Accordingly, the
618 Executive Director shall seek all necessary waivers, exemptions, agreements, or legislation, if
619 needed, so that all current federal payments for health care shall, consistent with the federal law,
620 be paid directly to the Trust Fund. In obtaining the waivers, exemptions, agreements, or
621 legislation, the Executive Director shall seek from the federal government a contribution for
622 health care services in Massachusetts that shall not decrease in relation to the contribution to
623 other states as a result of the waivers, exemptions, agreements, or legislation.
624 (i) As used in this section, “collateral source” includes all of the following:
625 (1) insurance policies written by insurers, including the medical components of
626 automobile, homeowners, workers’ compensation, and other forms of insurance;
627 (2) health care service plans and pension plans;
628 (3) employee benefit contracts;
629 (4) government benefit programs;
630 (5) a judgment for damages for personal injury;

634 (1) a contract or plan that is subject to federal preemption; and
31 of 35
635 (2) any governmental unit, agency, or service, to the extent that subrogation is prohibited
636 by law.
637 (k) An entity described as a collateral source is not excluded from the obligations
638 imposed by this section by virtue of a contract or relationship with a governmental unit, agency,
639 or service.
640 (l) Whenever an individual receives health care services under the Trust and the
641 individual is entitled to coverage, reimbursement, indemnity, or other compensation from a
642 collateral source, the individual shall notify the health care provider and provide information
643 identifying the collateral source other than federal sources, the nature and extent of coverage or
644 entitlement, and other relevant information. The health care provider or facility shall forward this
645 information to the Executive Director. The individual entitled to coverage, reimbursement,
646 indemnity, or other compensation from a collateral source shall provide additional information as
647 requested by the Executive Director.
648 (m) The Trust shall seek reimbursement from the collateral source for services provided
649 to the individual, and may institute appropriate action, including suit, to recover the costs to the
650 Trust. Upon demand, the collateral source shall pay to the Trust Fund the sums it would have
651 paid or expended on behalf of the individuals for the health care services provided by the Trust.
652 (n) If a collateral source is exempt from subrogation or the obligation to reimburse the
653 Trust as provided in this section, the Executive Director may require that an individual who is
654 entitled to medical services from the collateral source first seek those services from that source
655 before seeking those services from the Trust.
32 of 35
656 (o) To the extent permitted by federal law, contractual retiree health benefits provided by
657 employers shall be subject to the same subrogation as other contracts, allowing the Trust to
658 recover the cost of services provided to individuals covered by the retiree benefits, unless and
659 until arrangements are made to transfer the revenues of the benefits directly to the Trust.
660 (p) The Trust shall retain:
661 (1) all charitable donations, gifts, grants, or bequests made to it from whatever source
662 consistent with state and federal law;
663 (2) payments from third party payers for covered services rendered by eligible health care
664 providers to non-eligible patients but paid for by the Trust; and
665 (3) income from the investment of Trust assets, consistent with state and federal law.
666 (q) Any employer who has a contract with an insurer, health services corporation, or
667 health maintenance organization to provide health care services or benefits for its employees,
668 which is in effect on the effective date of this section, shall be entitled to an income tax credit
669 against premiums otherwise due in an amount equal to the Trust Fund tax due pursuant to this
670 section.
671 (r) Any insurer, self-insured employers, union health and welfare fund, health services
672 corporation, or health maintenance organization which provides health care services or benefits
673 under a contract with an employer or group of employers, which is in effect on the effective date
674 of this act, shall pay to the Trust Fund an amount equal to the Health Care Trust employer
675 payroll tax based on the number of employees of each employer.
33 of 35
676 (s) Six months prior to the establishment of the Health Care Trust, all laws and
677 regulations requiring health insurance carriers to maintain cash reserves for purposes of
678 commercial stability (such as under Chapter 176G, Section 25 of the General Laws) shall be
679 repealed. In their place, the Executive Director of the Trust shall assess an annual health care
680 stabilization fee upon the same carriers, amounting to the same sum previously required to be
681 held in reserves, which shall be credited to the Health Care Trust Fund.
682 Section 20. Insurance Reforms
683 Insurers regulated by the division of insurance are prohibited from charging premiums to
684 eligible participants for coverage of services already covered by the Trust. The commissioner of
685 insurance shall adopt, amend, alter, repeal, and enforce all such reasonable rules and regulations
686 and orders as may be necessary to implement this section.
687 Section 21. Health Care Trust Regulatory Authority
688 The Trust shall adopt and promulgate regulations to implement the provisions of this
689 chapter. The initial regulations may be adopted as emergency regulations but those emergency
690 regulations shall be in effect only from the effective date of this chapter until the conclusion of

396 (1) is licensed to operate or practice in the Commonwealth;
397 (2) does not accept payment from other sources for services provided for by the Trust;
398 (3) furnishes a signed agreement that:

401 income status, preexisting condition, or citizenship status;
402 (ii) the health care provider will comply with all state and federal laws regarding the
403 confidentiality of patient records and information;
404 (iii) no balance billing or out-of-pocket charges will be made for covered services unless
405 otherwise provided in this chapter; and
406 (iv) the health care provider will furnish such information as may be reasonably required

414 the department of public health shall not issue a license or renew a license for a hospital under
415 section 51 of chapter 111 unless said hospital is organized as a non-profit entity under section
416 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code .
417 Section 14. Budgeting and Payments to Eligible Health Care Providers
418 (a) To carry out this Act there are established on an annual basis:
419 (1) an operating budget;
420 (2) a capital expenditures budget;
421 (3) reimbursement levels for non-institutional providers consistent with rates set by the
422 Trust that ensure that: (i) the total costs of all services offered by or through the provider are
423 reasonable; and (ii) the aggregate rates of the provider are related reasonably to the aggregate
424 costs of the health care provider; and
425 (4) budgets for institutional providers. These budgets shall consist of an operating and a
426 capital budget. An institution’s annual budget shall be set to cover its anticipated health care
427 services for the next year based on past performance and projected changes in prices and health
21 of 35

428 care service and utilization levels. The annual budget for each individual institutional provider
429 shall be set separately. The board shall not set a joint budget for a group of more than one
430 institutional provider nor for a parent corporation that owns or operates one or more institutional
431 providers.
432 (b) The operating budget shall be used for:
433 (1) payment for services rendered by physicians and other clinicians and non-institutional
434 providers;
435 (2) budgets for institutional providers; and
436 (3) administration of the Trust.

438 for activities to assist, promote, deter, or discourage union organizing. Any prospective payments
439 made in excess of actual costs for covered services shall be returned to the Trust. Prospective
440 payment rates and schedules shall be adjusted annually to incorporate retrospective adjustments.
441 Except as provided in Section 15 of this chapter, reimbursement for covered services by the
442 Trust shall constitute full payment for the services rendered.
443 (d) The Trust shall provide for retrospective adjustment of payments to eligible health
444 care providers to:
445 (1) assure that payments to such health care providers reflect the difference between
446 actual and projected use and expenditures for covered services; and
447 (2) protect health care providers who serve a disproportionate share of eligible
448 participants whose expected use of covered health care services and expected health care
22 of 35

449 expenditures for such services are greater than the average use and expenditure rates for eligible
450 participants statewide.
451 (e) The capital expenditures budget shall be used for funds needed for:
452 (1) the construction or renovation of health facilities; and
453 (2) major equipment purchases.

455 eligible health care providers, including reasonable expenditures, as determined through budget
456 negotiations with the Trust, for the replacement and purchase of equipment.
457 (g) The Trust shall provide funding for payment of debt service on outstanding bonds as
458 of the effective date of this Act and shall be the sole source of future funding, whether directly or
459 indirectly, through the payment of debt service, for capital expenditures by health care providers
460 covered by the Trust in excess of a threshold amount to be determined annually by the Executive
461 Director.
462 Section 15. Covered Benefits
463 (a) The Trust shall pay for all professional services provided by eligible health care
464 providers to eligible participants needed to:
465 (1) provide high quality, appropriate, and medically necessary health care services;

509 Section 16. Wraparound Coverage for Federal Health Programs
510 (a) Prior to obtaining any federal program's waivers to receive federal funds through the
511 Health Care Trust, the Trust shall seek to ensure that participants eligible for federal program
512 coverage receive access to care and coverage equal to that of all other Massachusetts
513 participants. It shall do so by (1) paying for all services enumerated under Section 15 not covered
514 by the relevant federal plans; (2) paying for all such services during any federally mandated gaps
515 in participants’ coverage; and (3) paying for any deductibles, co-payments, co-insurance, or
516 other cost sharing incurred by such participants.
517 Section 17. Establishment of the Health Care Trust Fund
518 (a) In order to support the Trust effectively, there is hereby established the health care
519 trust fund, hereinafter the Trust Fund, which shall be administered and expended by the
520 Executive Director of the Trust subject to the approval of the Board. The Trust Fund shall consist
521 of all revenue sources defined in Section 19, and all property and securities acquired by and
522 through the use of monies deposited to the Trust Fund, and all interest thereon less payments
523 therefrom to meet liabilities incurred by the Trust in the exercise of its powers and the
524 performance of its duties.
525 (b) All claims for health care services rendered shall be made to the Trust Fund and all
526 payments made for health care services shall be disbursed from the Trust Fund.
527 Section 18. Purpose of the Trust Fund
528 (a) Amounts credited to the Trust Fund shall be used for the following purposes:
529 (1) to pay eligible health care providers covered services rendered to eligible individuals;
26 of 35

530 (2) to fund capital expenditures for eligible health care providers for approved capital
531 investments in excess of a threshold amount to be determined annually by the Executive
532 Director;

540 workers displaced as a result of administrative streamlining gained by moving from a multi-
541 payer to a single payer health care system, not to exceed 2% of Trust income in any fiscal year:
542 provided, however, that eligible workers must have enrolled by June 20 of the third year
543 following full implementation of this chapter;

545 demographic changes, inflation, or other foreseeable trends that would increase Trust Fund
546 liabilities, and for budgetary shortfall, epidemics, and other extraordinary events, not to exceed
547 1% of Trust income in any fiscal year: provided, however, that the Trust reserve account shall at
548 no time constitute more than 5% of total Trust assets;
549 (8) to pay the administrative costs of the Trust which, within two years of full
550 implementation of this chapter shall not exceed 5% of Trust income in any fiscal year.
27 of 35

551 (b) Unexpended Trust assets shall not be deemed to be “surplus” funds as defined by
552 chapter twenty-nine of the general laws.
553 Section 19. Funding Sources
554 (a) The Trust shall be the repository for all health care funds and related administrative
555 funds. A fairly apportioned, dedicated health care tax on employers, workers, and residents will
556 replace spending on insurance premiums and out-of-pocket spending for services covered by the
557 Trust. The Trust shall enable the state to pass lower health care costs on to residents and
558 employers through savings from administrative simplification, negotiating prices, discounts on
559 pharmaceuticals and medical supplies, and through early detection and intervention by
560 universally available primary and preventive care. Additionally, collateral sources of revenue –
561 such as from the federal government, non-residents receiving care in the state, or from personal
562 liability – shall be recovered by the Trust. The Trust shall be funded by dedicated revenue
563 streams and its budget shall not affect other public health programs run by the state. Lastly, the
564 Trust shall enact provisions ensuring a smooth transition to a universal health care system for
565 employers and residents.
566 (b) The following dedicated health care taxes will replace spending on insurance
567 premiums and out-of-pocket spending for services covered by the Trust. Prior to each state fiscal
568 year of operation, the Trust will prepare for the Legislature a projected budget for the coming
569 fiscal year, with recommendations for rising or declining revenue needs.
570 (1) An employer payroll tax of 7.5 percent will be assessed on employee W-2 wages,
571 exempting the first $20,000 of payroll per establishment, replacing previous spending by
28 of 35

572 employers on health premiums. An additional employer payroll tax of 0.5 per cent will be
573 assessed on establishments with 100 or more employees;
574 (2) An employee payroll tax of 2.5 percent will be assessed, exempting the first $20,000
575 of income, replacing previous spending by employees on health premiums and out-of-pocket
576 expenses; all W-2 wages will be combined for each taxpayer and one $20,000 exemption will be
577 allowed;
578 (3) A 10 percent payroll tax on the self-employed, including general partnership income
579 and other income subject to self-employment tax for Federal purposes, will be assessed,
580 exempting the first $20,000 of payroll per self-employed taxpayer; income from all sources
581 subject to tax in this section shall be combined and allowed one $20,000 exemption per taxpayer;
582 and
583 (4) For the purposes of sections (2) and (3) above, each taxpayer will combine all income
584 reported on from IRS Form W-2s and self-employment income and be allowed one $20,000
585 exemption. The exemption will apply first to W-2 income and then to self-employment income.
586 (5) A 10 percent tax on taxable unearned income and all other income not specifically
587 excluded will be assessed on such income above $20,000. Exclusions not taxed: Social Security,
588 Supplemental Security Income (SSI), Social Security Disability Income (SSDI), unemployment
589 benefits, workers compensation benefits, sick pay, paid family and medical leave, capital gains
590 resulting from the sale of owner-occupied two- or three-family rental property, and defined
591 contribution and defined benefit pension payments. Capital gains from the portion attributed to a
592 primary residence in excess of the exclusion allowed by Massachusetts law will be subject to the
593 tax. The $20,000 exemption for this section shall be applied to each individual taxpayer.
29 of 35

594 (c) An employer, private or public, may agree to pay all or part of an employee’s payroll
595 tax obligation. Such payment shall not be considered income to the employee for Massachusetts
596 income tax purposes.
597 (d) Default, underpayment, or late payment of any tax or other obligation imposed by the
598 Trust shall result in the remedies and penalties provided by law, except as provided in this
599 section.
600 (e) Eligibility for benefits shall not be impaired by any default, underpayment, or late
601 payment of any tax or other obligation imposed by the Trust.
602 (f) It is the intent of this act to establish a single public payer for all health care in the
603 Commonwealth. Towards this end, public spending on health insurance shall be consolidated
604 into the Trust to the greatest extent possible. Until such time as the role of all other payers for
605 health care has been terminated, health care costs shall be collected from collateral sources
606 whenever medical services provided to an individual are, or may be, covered services under a
607 policy of insurance, health care service plan, or other collateral source available to that
608 individual, or for which the individual has a right of action for compensation to the extent
609 permitted by law.
610 (g) The Legislature shall be empowered to transfer funds from the General Fund
611 sufficient to meet the Trust’s projected expenses beyond projected income from dedicated tax
612 revenues. This lump transfer shall replace current General Fund spending on health benefits for
613 state employees, services for patients at public in-patient facilities, and all means- or needs-tested
614 health benefit programs.
30 of 35

615 (h) The Trust shall receive all monies paid to the Commonwealth by the federal
616 government for health care services covered by the Trust. The Trust shall seek to maximize all
617 sources of federal financial support for health care services in Massachusetts. Accordingly, the
618 Executive Director shall seek all necessary waivers, exemptions, agreements, or legislation, if
619 needed, so that all current federal payments for health care shall, consistent with the federal law,
620 be paid directly to the Trust Fund. In obtaining the waivers, exemptions, agreements, or
621 legislation, the Executive Director shall seek from the federal government a contribution for
622 health care services in Massachusetts that shall not decrease in relation to the contribution to
623 other states as a result of the waivers, exemptions, agreements, or legislation.
624 (i) As used in this section, “collateral source” includes all of the following:
625 (1) insurance policies written by insurers, including the medical components of
626 automobile, homeowners, workers’ compensation, and other forms of insurance;
627 (2) health care service plans and pension plans;
628 (3) employee benefit contracts;
629 (4) government benefit programs;
630 (5) a judgment for damages for personal injury;
631 (6) any third party who is or may be liable to an individual for health care services or
632 costs;
633 (j) As used in this section, “collateral sources” does not include either of the following:
634 (1) a contract or plan that is subject to federal preemption; and
31 of 35

635 (2) any governmental unit, agency, or service, to the extent that subrogation is prohibited
636 by law.
637 (k) An entity described as a collateral source is not excluded from the obligations
638 imposed by this section by virtue of a contract or relationship with a governmental unit, agency,
639 or service.
640 (l) Whenever an individual receives health care services under the Trust and the
641 individual is entitled to coverage, reimbursement, indemnity, or other compensation from a
642 collateral source, the individual shall notify the health care provider and provide information
643 identifying the collateral source other than federal sources, the nature and extent of coverage or
644 entitlement, and other relevant information. The health care provider or facility shall forward this
645 information to the Executive Director. The individual entitled to coverage, reimbursement,
646 indemnity, or other compensation from a collateral source shall provide additional information as
647 requested by the Executive Director.
648 (m) The Trust shall seek reimbursement from the collateral source for services provided
649 to the individual, and may institute appropriate action, including suit, to recover the costs to the
650 Trust. Upon demand, the collateral source shall pay to the Trust Fund the sums it would have
651 paid or expended on behalf of the individuals for the health care services provided by the Trust.
652 (n) If a collateral source is exempt from subrogation or the obligation to reimburse the
653 Trust as provided in this section, the Executive Director may require that an individual who is
654 entitled to medical services from the collateral source first seek those services from that source
655 before seeking those services from the Trust.
32 of 35

656 (o) To the extent permitted by federal law, contractual retiree health benefits provided by
657 employers shall be subject to the same subrogation as other contracts, allowing the Trust to
658 recover the cost of services provided to individuals covered by the retiree benefits, unless and
659 until arrangements are made to transfer the revenues of the benefits directly to the Trust.
660 (p) The Trust shall retain:
661 (1) all charitable donations, gifts, grants, or bequests made to it from whatever source
662 consistent with state and federal law;
663 (2) payments from third party payers for covered services rendered by eligible health care
664 providers to non-eligible patients but paid for by the Trust; and
665 (3) income from the investment of Trust assets, consistent with state and federal law.
