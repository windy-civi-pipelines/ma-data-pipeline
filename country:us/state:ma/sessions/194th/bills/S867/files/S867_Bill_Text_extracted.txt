64 recommendations and propose legislation necessary to carry out its recommendations.
65 (d) The board shall, in consultation with the center, define the data required to satisfy the
66 contents of this section. The center shall adopt regulations to require providers and private and
67 public health care payers to submit data or information necessary for the board to fulfill its duties
68 under this section. Any data collected shall be public and available through the Massachusetts
69 Primary Care Dashboard maintained by the center and Massachusetts Health Quality Partners,
70 Inc.
71 (e)(1) The board shall propose a standard all-payer primary care capitation model, under
72 which private payers shall pay participating providers or provider organizations a prospective,
73 per-member per-month payment for patients attributed to the participating provider or provider
74 organization for primary care. The proposed model shall include, but not be limited to: (i)
75 definitions of primary care services, codes, and providers; (ii) per-member per-month rate
76 methodology; (iii) enhanced payments for advanced primary care services and investments; (iv)
77 patient cost-sharing limits for primary care; (v) member attribution methodology; (vi) primary
4 of 45
78 care quality measures; (vii) primary care reimbursement and spending reporting requirements for
79 participating providers or provider organizations; and (viii) audits of participating providers or
80 provider organizations.
81 (2) In developing the per-member per-month rate methodology, the board may consider
82 the historical monthly primary care spending per patient at the primary care provider or provider
83 organization level, the historical monthly primary care spending per patient statewide, the
84 primary care expenditure data published in the center’s annual report under section 16 of chapter
85 12C, and any other factors deemed relevant by the board. The per-member per-month payment
86 may be adjusted based on: (i) a participating provider or provider organization’s adoption of
87 advanced primary care services and investment in primary care services; (ii) the quality of
88 patient care delivered by a participating provider or provider organization; and (iii) the clinical
89 and social risk of patients attributed to a participating provider or provider organization for
90 primary care. The board shall consider the per-member per-month rate methodology established
91 in the MassHealth primary care sub-capitation program.
92 (3) The board shall identify advanced primary care services and investments in primary
93 care delivery that may qualify participating providers or provider organizations for enhanced
94 payments under the all-payer primary care capitation model. Advanced primary care services and
95 investments shall be evidence-informed or evidence-based, improve primary care quality,
96 increase primary care access, enhance a patient’s primary care experience, or promote health
97 equity in primary care. Advanced primary care services and investments shall include, but not be
98 limited to: (i) employing community health workers or health coaches as part of the primary care
99 team; (ii) investing in social determinants of health; (iii) collaborating with primary care-based
100 clinical pharmacists; (iv) integrating behavioral health care with primary care; (v) offering
5 of 45
101 substance use disorder treatment, including medication-assisted treatment, telehealth services,
102 including telehealth consultations with specialists, medical interpreter services, home care,
103 patient advisory groups, and group visits; (vi) using clinician optimization programs to reduce
104 documentation burden, including, but not limited to, medical scribes and ambient voice
105 technology; (vii) investing in care management, including employing social workers to help
106 manage the care for patients with complicated health needs; (viii) establishing systems to
107 facilitate end of life care planning and palliative care; (ix) developing systems to evaluate patient
108 population health to help determine which preventative medicine interventions require patient
109 outreach; (x) offering walk-in or same-day care appointments or extended hours of availability;
110 and (xi) any other primary care service deemed relevant by the board. The board shall consider
111 care delivery requirements established in the MassHealth primary care sub-capitation program.
112 (4) The board shall develop clinical tiers with minimum care delivery standards based on
113 advanced primary care services and investments identified in paragraph (3) and establish
114 enhanced payment rates for each clinical tier under the all-payer primary care capitation model.
115 In determining the enhanced payment rates, the board shall consider the strength of evidence that
116 the advanced service or investment will: (i) improve patient health; (ii) enhance patient
117 experience; (iii) improve clinician experience, including reducing administrative burden; (iv)
118 decrease total medical expense; and (v) promote health equity. The board shall consider the
119 clinical tiers established in the MassHealth primary care sub-capitation program.
120 (5) The board shall identify not more than 8 quality measures related to: (i) care
121 continuity, comprehensiveness, and coordination; (ii) patient access to primary care; and (iii)
122 patient experience. 4 of the 8 quality measures shall be measures of patient experience and 1
123 shall be a person-centered primary care measure. Each quality measure shall be patient-centered,
6 of 45
124 appropriate for a primary care setting, and supported by peer-reviewed, evidence-based research
125 that the measure is actionable and that its use will lead to improvements in patient health. The
126 board shall develop standard reporting requirements for the quality measures and standard per-
127 member per-month rate adjustment methodology based on quality measures. The board shall
128 consider MassHealth quality indicators for managed care entities.
129 (6) The board shall identify measures of clinical and social complexity that promote
130 health equity and minimize opportunities to artificially increase the clinical and social
131 complexity of a patient panel. The board shall develop standard per-member per-month rate
132 adjustment methodology based on measures of clinical and social complexity.
133 (7) The board shall develop member attribution methodology to assign patients to
134 participating providers or provider organizations for primary care under the all-payer primary
135 care capitation model. The board shall consider the member attribution process established in the
136 MassHealth primary care sub-capitation program.
137 (8) The board shall develop an attestation, reporting and audit process for participating
138 providers or provider organizations. The board shall consider the attestation, reporting and audit
139 process established in the MassHealth primary care sub-capitation program.
140 SECTION 4. Section 8 of said chapter 6D, as so appearing, is hereby amended by
141 striking out subsection (a) and inserting in place thereof the following subsection:-
142 (a) Not later than October 1 of every year, the commission shall hold public hearings
143 based on the report submitted by the center under section 16 of chapter 12C comparing the
144 growth in total health care expenditures to the health care cost growth benchmark for the
145 previous calendar year and comparing the growth in actual aggregate primary care expenditures
7 of 45
146 for the previous calendar year to the aggregate primary care expenditure target. The hearings
147 shall examine health care provider, provider organization and private and public health care
148 payer costs, prices and cost trends, with particular attention to factors that contribute to cost
149 growth within the commonwealth’s health care system and challenge the ability of the
150 commonwealth’s health care system to meet the benchmark established under section 9 or the
151 aggregate primary care expenditure target established under section 9A.
152 SECTION 5. Said section 8 of said chapter 6D, as so appearing, is hereby further
153 amended by inserting after the word “health”, in line 95, the following words:- and primary care.
154 SECTION 6. Said chapter 6D is hereby further amended by inserting after section 9 the

157 target for the commonwealth, which the commission shall prominently publish on its website.
158 (b) The commission shall establish the aggregate primary care expenditure target and the
159 primary care expenditure target as follows:
160 (1) For the calendar year 2027, the aggregate primary care expenditure target and the
161 primary care expenditure target shall be equal to 8 per cent of total health care expenditures in
162 the commonwealth;
163 (2) For the calendar year 2028, the aggregate primary care expenditure target and the
164 primary care expenditure target shall be equal to 10 per cent of total health care expenditures in
165 the commonwealth;
8 of 45
166 (3) For the calendar year 2029, the aggregate primary care expenditure target and the
167 primary care expenditure target shall be equal to 12 per cent of total health care expenditures in
168 the commonwealth; and
169 (4) For calendar years 2030 and beyond, if the commission determines that an adjustment
170 in the aggregate primary care expenditure target and the primary care expenditure target is
171 reasonably warranted, the commission may recommend modification to such targets, provided,
172 that such targets shall not be lower than 12 per cent of total health care expenditures in the
173 commonwealth.
174 (c) Prior to making any recommended modification to the aggregate primary care
175 expenditure target and the primary care expenditure target under paragraph (4) of subsection (b),
176 the commission shall hold a public hearing. The public hearing shall be based on the report
177 submitted by the center under section 16 of chapter 12C, comparing the aggregate primary care
178 expenditures to the aggregate primary care expenditure target, any other data submitted by the
179 center and such other pertinent information or data as may be available to the commission. The
180 hearings shall examine the performance of health care entities in meeting the primary care
181 expenditure target and the commonwealth’s health care system in meeting the aggregate primary
182 care expenditure target. The commission shall provide public notice of the hearing at least 45
183 days prior to the date of the hearing, including notice to the joint committee on health care
184 financing. The joint committee on health care financing may participate in the hearing. The
185 commission shall identify as witnesses for the public hearing a representative sample of
186 providers, provider organizations, payers and such other interested parties as the commission
187 may determine. Any other interested parties may testify at the hearing.
9 of 45
188 (d) Any recommendation of the commission to modify the aggregate primary care
189 expenditure target and the primary care expenditure target under paragraph (4) of subsection (b)
190 shall be approved by a two thirds vote of the board.
191 SECTION 7. Said chapter 6D, as so appearing, is hereby further amended by inserting
192 after section 10 the following section:-
193 Section 10A. (a) For the purposes of this section, “health care entity” shall mean any
194 entity identified by the center under section 18 of chapter 12C.
195 (b) The commission shall provide notice to all health care entities that have been
196 identified by the center under section 18 of chapter 12C for failure to meet the primary care
197 expenditure target. Such notice shall state that the center may analyze the performance of
198 individual health care entities in meeting the primary care expenditure target and, beginning in
199 calendar year 2027, the commission may require certain actions, as established in this section,
200 from health care entities so identified.
201 (c) In addition to the notice provided under subsection (b), the commission may require
202 any health care entity that is identified by the center under section 18 of chapter 12C for failure
203 to meet the primary care expenditure target to file and implement a performance improvement
204 plan. The commission shall provide written notice to such health care entity that they are
205 required to file a performance improvement plan. Within 45 days of receipt of such written
206 notice, the health care entity shall either:
207 (1) file a performance improvement plan with the commission; or
10 of 45
208 (2) file an application with the commission to waive or extend the requirement to file a
209 performance improvement plan.
210 (d) The health care entity may file any documentation or supporting evidence with the
211 commission to support the health care entity’s application to waive or extend the requirement to
212 file a performance improvement plan. The commission shall require the health care entity to
213 submit any other relevant information it deems necessary in considering the waiver or extension
214 application; provided, however, that such information shall be made public at the discretion of
215 the commission.
216 (e) The commission may waive or delay the requirement for a health care entity to file a
217 performance improvement plan in response to a waiver or extension request filed under
218 subsection (c) in light of all information received from the health care entity, based on a
219 consideration of the following factors: (1) the primary care baseline expenditures, costs, price
220 and utilization trends of the health care entity over time, and any demonstrated improvement to
221 increase the proportion of primary care expenditures; (2) any ongoing strategies or investments
222 that the health care entity is implementing to invest in or expand access to primary care services;
223 (3) whether the factors that led to the inability of the health care entity to meet the primary care
224 expenditure target can reasonably be considered to be unanticipated and outside of the control of
225 the entity; provided, that such factors may include, but shall not be limited to, market dynamics,
226 technological changes and other drivers of non-primary care spending such as pharmaceutical
227 and medical devices expenses; (4) the overall financial condition of the health care entity; and
228 (5) any other factors the commission considers relevant.
11 of 45
229 (f) If the commission declines to waive or extend the requirement for the health care
230 entity to file a performance improvement plan, the commission shall provide written notice to the
231 health care entity that its application for a waiver or extension was denied and the health care
232 entity shall file a performance improvement plan.
233 (g) The commission shall provide the department of public health any notice requiring a
234 health care entity to file and implement a performance improvement plan pursuant to this
235 section. In the event a health care entity required to file a performance improvement plan under
236 this section submits an application for a notice of determination of need under section 25C or 51
237 of chapter 111, the notice of the commission requiring the health care entity to file and
238 implement a performance improvement plan pursuant to this section shall be considered part of
239 the written record pursuant to said section 25C of chapter 111.
240 (h) A health care entity shall file a performance improvement plan: (1) within 45 days of
241 receipt of a notice under subsection (c); (2) if the health care entity has requested a waiver or
242 extension, within 45 days of receipt of a notice that such waiver or extension has been denied; or
243 (3) if the health care entity is granted an extension, on the date given on such extension. The
244 performance improvement plan shall identify specific strategies, adjustments and action steps the
245 entity proposes to implement to increase the proportion of primary care expenditures. The
246 proposed performance improvement plan shall include specific identifiable and measurable
247 expected outcomes and a timetable for implementation.
248 (i) The commission shall approve any performance improvement plan that it determines
249 is reasonably likely to address the underlying cause of the entity’s inability to meet the primary
250 care expenditure target and has a reasonable expectation for successful implementation.
12 of 45
251 (j) If the board determines that the performance improvement plan is unacceptable or
252 incomplete, the commission may provide consultation on the criteria that have not been met and
253 may allow an additional time period, up to 30 calendar days, for resubmission.
254 (k) Upon approval of the proposed performance improvement plan, the commission shall
255 notify the health care entity to begin immediate implementation of the performance improvement
256 plan. Public notice shall be provided by the commission on its website, identifying that the health
257 care entity is implementing a performance improvement plan. All health care entities
258 implementing an approved performance improvement plan shall be subject to additional
259 reporting requirements and compliance monitoring, as determined by the commission. The
260 commission shall provide assistance to the health care entity in the successful implementation of
261 the performance improvement plan.
262 (l) All health care entities shall, in good faith, work to implement the performance
263 improvement plan. At any point during the implementation of the performance improvement
264 plan the health care entity may file amendments to the performance improvement plan, subject to
265 approval of the commission.
266 (m) At the conclusion of the timetable established in the performance improvement plan,
267 the health care entity shall report to the commission regarding the outcome of the performance
268 improvement plan. If the performance improvement plan was found to be unsuccessful, the
269 commission shall either: (1) extend the implementation timetable of the existing performance
270 improvement plan; (2) approve amendments to the performance improvement plan as proposed
271 by the health care entity; (3) require the health care entity to submit a new performance
13 of 45
272 improvement plan under subsection (c); or (4) waive or delay the requirement to file any
273 additional performance improvement plans.
274 (n) Upon the successful completion of the performance improvement plan, the identity of
275 the health care entity shall be removed from the commission’s website.
276 (o) The commission may submit a recommendation for proposed legislation to the joint
277 committee on health care financing if the commission determines that further legislative
278 authority is needed to achieve the health care quality and spending sustainability objectives of
279 section 9A, assist health care entities with the implementation of performance improvement
280 plans or otherwise ensure compliance with the provisions of this section.
281 (p) If the commission determines that a health care entity has: (1) willfully neglected to
282 file a performance improvement plan with the commission by the time required in subsection (h);
283 (2) failed to file an acceptable performance improvement plan in good faith with the
284 commission; (3) failed to implement the performance improvement plan in good faith; or (4)
285 knowingly failed to provide information required by this section to the commission or that
286 knowingly falsifies the same, the commission may assess a civil penalty to the health care entity
287 of not more than $500,000 for a first violation, not more than $750,000 for a second violation
288 and not more than the amount by which the health care entity failed to meet the primary care
289 expenditure target for a third or subsequent violation. The commission shall seek to promote
290 compliance with this section and shall only impose a civil penalty as a last resort.
291 (q) The commission shall promulgate regulations necessary to implement this section.
14 of 45
292 (r) Nothing in this section shall be construed as affecting or limiting the applicability of
293 the health care cost growth benchmark established under section 9, and the obligations of a
294 health care entity thereto.

64 recommendations and propose legislation necessary to carry out its recommendations.
65 (d) The board shall, in consultation with the center, define the data required to satisfy the
66 contents of this section. The center shall adopt regulations to require providers and private and
67 public health care payers to submit data or information necessary for the board to fulfill its duties
68 under this section. Any data collected shall be public and available through the Massachusetts
69 Primary Care Dashboard maintained by the center and Massachusetts Health Quality Partners,
70 Inc.
71 (e)(1) The board shall propose a standard all-payer primary care capitation model, under
72 which private payers shall pay participating providers or provider organizations a prospective,
73 per-member per-month payment for patients attributed to the participating provider or provider
74 organization for primary care. The proposed model shall include, but not be limited to: (i)
75 definitions of primary care services, codes, and providers; (ii) per-member per-month rate
76 methodology; (iii) enhanced payments for advanced primary care services and investments; (iv)
77 patient cost-sharing limits for primary care; (v) member attribution methodology; (vi) primary
4 of 45

78 care quality measures; (vii) primary care reimbursement and spending reporting requirements for
79 participating providers or provider organizations; and (viii) audits of participating providers or
80 provider organizations.
81 (2) In developing the per-member per-month rate methodology, the board may consider
82 the historical monthly primary care spending per patient at the primary care provider or provider
83 organization level, the historical monthly primary care spending per patient statewide, the
84 primary care expenditure data published in the center’s annual report under section 16 of chapter
85 12C, and any other factors deemed relevant by the board. The per-member per-month payment
86 may be adjusted based on: (i) a participating provider or provider organization’s adoption of
87 advanced primary care services and investment in primary care services; (ii) the quality of
88 patient care delivered by a participating provider or provider organization; and (iii) the clinical
89 and social risk of patients attributed to a participating provider or provider organization for
90 primary care. The board shall consider the per-member per-month rate methodology established
91 in the MassHealth primary care sub-capitation program.
92 (3) The board shall identify advanced primary care services and investments in primary
93 care delivery that may qualify participating providers or provider organizations for enhanced
94 payments under the all-payer primary care capitation model. Advanced primary care services and
95 investments shall be evidence-informed or evidence-based, improve primary care quality,
96 increase primary care access, enhance a patient’s primary care experience, or promote health
97 equity in primary care. Advanced primary care services and investments shall include, but not be
98 limited to: (i) employing community health workers or health coaches as part of the primary care
99 team; (ii) investing in social determinants of health; (iii) collaborating with primary care-based
100 clinical pharmacists; (iv) integrating behavioral health care with primary care; (v) offering
5 of 45

101 substance use disorder treatment, including medication-assisted treatment, telehealth services,
102 including telehealth consultations with specialists, medical interpreter services, home care,
103 patient advisory groups, and group visits; (vi) using clinician optimization programs to reduce
104 documentation burden, including, but not limited to, medical scribes and ambient voice
105 technology; (vii) investing in care management, including employing social workers to help
106 manage the care for patients with complicated health needs; (viii) establishing systems to
107 facilitate end of life care planning and palliative care; (ix) developing systems to evaluate patient
108 population health to help determine which preventative medicine interventions require patient
109 outreach; (x) offering walk-in or same-day care appointments or extended hours of availability;
110 and (xi) any other primary care service deemed relevant by the board. The board shall consider
111 care delivery requirements established in the MassHealth primary care sub-capitation program.
112 (4) The board shall develop clinical tiers with minimum care delivery standards based on
113 advanced primary care services and investments identified in paragraph (3) and establish
114 enhanced payment rates for each clinical tier under the all-payer primary care capitation model.
115 In determining the enhanced payment rates, the board shall consider the strength of evidence that
116 the advanced service or investment will: (i) improve patient health; (ii) enhance patient
117 experience; (iii) improve clinician experience, including reducing administrative burden; (iv)
118 decrease total medical expense; and (v) promote health equity. The board shall consider the
119 clinical tiers established in the MassHealth primary care sub-capitation program.
120 (5) The board shall identify not more than 8 quality measures related to: (i) care
121 continuity, comprehensiveness, and coordination; (ii) patient access to primary care; and (iii)
122 patient experience. 4 of the 8 quality measures shall be measures of patient experience and 1
123 shall be a person-centered primary care measure. Each quality measure shall be patient-centered,
6 of 45

124 appropriate for a primary care setting, and supported by peer-reviewed, evidence-based research
125 that the measure is actionable and that its use will lead to improvements in patient health. The
126 board shall develop standard reporting requirements for the quality measures and standard per-
127 member per-month rate adjustment methodology based on quality measures. The board shall
128 consider MassHealth quality indicators for managed care entities.
129 (6) The board shall identify measures of clinical and social complexity that promote
130 health equity and minimize opportunities to artificially increase the clinical and social
131 complexity of a patient panel. The board shall develop standard per-member per-month rate
132 adjustment methodology based on measures of clinical and social complexity.
133 (7) The board shall develop member attribution methodology to assign patients to
134 participating providers or provider organizations for primary care under the all-payer primary
135 care capitation model. The board shall consider the member attribution process established in the
136 MassHealth primary care sub-capitation program.
137 (8) The board shall develop an attestation, reporting and audit process for participating
138 providers or provider organizations. The board shall consider the attestation, reporting and audit
139 process established in the MassHealth primary care sub-capitation program.
140 SECTION 4. Section 8 of said chapter 6D, as so appearing, is hereby amended by
141 striking out subsection (a) and inserting in place thereof the following subsection:-
142 (a) Not later than October 1 of every year, the commission shall hold public hearings
143 based on the report submitted by the center under section 16 of chapter 12C comparing the
144 growth in total health care expenditures to the health care cost growth benchmark for the
145 previous calendar year and comparing the growth in actual aggregate primary care expenditures
7 of 45

146 for the previous calendar year to the aggregate primary care expenditure target. The hearings
147 shall examine health care provider, provider organization and private and public health care
148 payer costs, prices and cost trends, with particular attention to factors that contribute to cost
149 growth within the commonwealth’s health care system and challenge the ability of the
150 commonwealth’s health care system to meet the benchmark established under section 9 or the
151 aggregate primary care expenditure target established under section 9A.
152 SECTION 5. Said section 8 of said chapter 6D, as so appearing, is hereby further
153 amended by inserting after the word “health”, in line 95, the following words:- and primary care.
154 SECTION 6. Said chapter 6D is hereby further amended by inserting after section 9 the

157 target for the commonwealth, which the commission shall prominently publish on its website.
158 (b) The commission shall establish the aggregate primary care expenditure target and the
159 primary care expenditure target as follows:
160 (1) For the calendar year 2027, the aggregate primary care expenditure target and the
161 primary care expenditure target shall be equal to 8 per cent of total health care expenditures in
162 the commonwealth;
163 (2) For the calendar year 2028, the aggregate primary care expenditure target and the
164 primary care expenditure target shall be equal to 10 per cent of total health care expenditures in
165 the commonwealth;
8 of 45

166 (3) For the calendar year 2029, the aggregate primary care expenditure target and the
167 primary care expenditure target shall be equal to 12 per cent of total health care expenditures in
168 the commonwealth; and
169 (4) For calendar years 2030 and beyond, if the commission determines that an adjustment
170 in the aggregate primary care expenditure target and the primary care expenditure target is
171 reasonably warranted, the commission may recommend modification to such targets, provided,
172 that such targets shall not be lower than 12 per cent of total health care expenditures in the
173 commonwealth.
174 (c) Prior to making any recommended modification to the aggregate primary care
175 expenditure target and the primary care expenditure target under paragraph (4) of subsection (b),
176 the commission shall hold a public hearing. The public hearing shall be based on the report
177 submitted by the center under section 16 of chapter 12C, comparing the aggregate primary care
178 expenditures to the aggregate primary care expenditure target, any other data submitted by the
179 center and such other pertinent information or data as may be available to the commission. The
180 hearings shall examine the performance of health care entities in meeting the primary care
181 expenditure target and the commonwealth’s health care system in meeting the aggregate primary
182 care expenditure target. The commission shall provide public notice of the hearing at least 45
183 days prior to the date of the hearing, including notice to the joint committee on health care
184 financing. The joint committee on health care financing may participate in the hearing. The

186 providers, provider organizations, payers and such other interested parties as the commission
187 may determine. Any other interested parties may testify at the hearing.
9 of 45

188 (d) Any recommendation of the commission to modify the aggregate primary care
189 expenditure target and the primary care expenditure target under paragraph (4) of subsection (b)
190 shall be approved by a two thirds vote of the board.
191 SECTION 7. Said chapter 6D, as so appearing, is hereby further amended by inserting
192 after section 10 the following section:-
193 Section 10A. (a) For the purposes of this section, “health care entity” shall mean any
194 entity identified by the center under section 18 of chapter 12C.
195 (b) The commission shall provide notice to all health care entities that have been
196 identified by the center under section 18 of chapter 12C for failure to meet the primary care
197 expenditure target. Such notice shall state that the center may analyze the performance of
198 individual health care entities in meeting the primary care expenditure target and, beginning in
199 calendar year 2027, the commission may require certain actions, as established in this section,
200 from health care entities so identified.
201 (c) In addition to the notice provided under subsection (b), the commission may require
202 any health care entity that is identified by the center under section 18 of chapter 12C for failure
203 to meet the primary care expenditure target to file and implement a performance improvement
204 plan. The commission shall provide written notice to such health care entity that they are
205 required to file a performance improvement plan. Within 45 days of receipt of such written
206 notice, the health care entity shall either:
207 (1) file a performance improvement plan with the commission; or
10 of 45

208 (2) file an application with the commission to waive or extend the requirement to file a
209 performance improvement plan.
210 (d) The health care entity may file any documentation or supporting evidence with the
211 commission to support the health care entity’s application to waive or extend the requirement to
212 file a performance improvement plan. The commission shall require the health care entity to
213 submit any other relevant information it deems necessary in considering the waiver or extension
214 application; provided, however, that such information shall be made public at the discretion of
215 the commission.
216 (e) The commission may waive or delay the requirement for a health care entity to file a
217 performance improvement plan in response to a waiver or extension request filed under
218 subsection (c) in light of all information received from the health care entity, based on a
219 consideration of the following factors: (1) the primary care baseline expenditures, costs, price
220 and utilization trends of the health care entity over time, and any demonstrated improvement to
221 increase the proportion of primary care expenditures; (2) any ongoing strategies or investments
222 that the health care entity is implementing to invest in or expand access to primary care services;
223 (3) whether the factors that led to the inability of the health care entity to meet the primary care
224 expenditure target can reasonably be considered to be unanticipated and outside of the control of
225 the entity; provided, that such factors may include, but shall not be limited to, market dynamics,
226 technological changes and other drivers of non-primary care spending such as pharmaceutical
227 and medical devices expenses; (4) the overall financial condition of the health care entity; and
228 (5) any other factors the commission considers relevant.
11 of 45

229 (f) If the commission declines to waive or extend the requirement for the health care
230 entity to file a performance improvement plan, the commission shall provide written notice to the
231 health care entity that its application for a waiver or extension was denied and the health care
232 entity shall file a performance improvement plan.
233 (g) The commission shall provide the department of public health any notice requiring a
234 health care entity to file and implement a performance improvement plan pursuant to this
235 section. In the event a health care entity required to file a performance improvement plan under
236 this section submits an application for a notice of determination of need under section 25C or 51
237 of chapter 111, the notice of the commission requiring the health care entity to file and
238 implement a performance improvement plan pursuant to this section shall be considered part of
239 the written record pursuant to said section 25C of chapter 111.
240 (h) A health care entity shall file a performance improvement plan: (1) within 45 days of
241 receipt of a notice under subsection (c); (2) if the health care entity has requested a waiver or
242 extension, within 45 days of receipt of a notice that such waiver or extension has been denied; or
243 (3) if the health care entity is granted an extension, on the date given on such extension. The
244 performance improvement plan shall identify specific strategies, adjustments and action steps the
245 entity proposes to implement to increase the proportion of primary care expenditures. The
246 proposed performance improvement plan shall include specific identifiable and measurable
247 expected outcomes and a timetable for implementation.
248 (i) The commission shall approve any performance improvement plan that it determines
249 is reasonably likely to address the underlying cause of the entity’s inability to meet the primary
250 care expenditure target and has a reasonable expectation for successful implementation.
12 of 45

251 (j) If the board determines that the performance improvement plan is unacceptable or
252 incomplete, the commission may provide consultation on the criteria that have not been met and
253 may allow an additional time period, up to 30 calendar days, for resubmission.
254 (k) Upon approval of the proposed performance improvement plan, the commission shall
255 notify the health care entity to begin immediate implementation of the performance improvement
256 plan. Public notice shall be provided by the commission on its website, identifying that the health
257 care entity is implementing a performance improvement plan. All health care entities
258 implementing an approved performance improvement plan shall be subject to additional
259 reporting requirements and compliance monitoring, as determined by the commission. The
260 commission shall provide assistance to the health care entity in the successful implementation of
261 the performance improvement plan.
262 (l) All health care entities shall, in good faith, work to implement the performance
263 improvement plan. At any point during the implementation of the performance improvement
264 plan the health care entity may file amendments to the performance improvement plan, subject to
265 approval of the commission.
266 (m) At the conclusion of the timetable established in the performance improvement plan,
267 the health care entity shall report to the commission regarding the outcome of the performance
268 improvement plan. If the performance improvement plan was found to be unsuccessful, the
269 commission shall either: (1) extend the implementation timetable of the existing performance
270 improvement plan; (2) approve amendments to the performance improvement plan as proposed
271 by the health care entity; (3) require the health care entity to submit a new performance
13 of 45

272 improvement plan under subsection (c); or (4) waive or delay the requirement to file any
273 additional performance improvement plans.
274 (n) Upon the successful completion of the performance improvement plan, the identity of
275 the health care entity shall be removed from the commission’s website.
276 (o) The commission may submit a recommendation for proposed legislation to the joint
277 committee on health care financing if the commission determines that further legislative
278 authority is needed to achieve the health care quality and spending sustainability objectives of
279 section 9A, assist health care entities with the implementation of performance improvement
280 plans or otherwise ensure compliance with the provisions of this section.
281 (p) If the commission determines that a health care entity has: (1) willfully neglected to
282 file a performance improvement plan with the commission by the time required in subsection (h);
283 (2) failed to file an acceptable performance improvement plan in good faith with the
284 commission; (3) failed to implement the performance improvement plan in good faith; or (4)
285 knowingly failed to provide information required by this section to the commission or that
286 knowingly falsifies the same, the commission may assess a civil penalty to the health care entity
287 of not more than $500,000 for a first violation, not more than $750,000 for a second violation
288 and not more than the amount by which the health care entity failed to meet the primary care
289 expenditure target for a third or subsequent violation. The commission shall seek to promote
290 compliance with this section and shall only impose a civil penalty as a last resort.
291 (q) The commission shall promulgate regulations necessary to implement this section.
14 of 45

292 (r) Nothing in this section shall be construed as affecting or limiting the applicability of
293 the health care cost growth benchmark established under section 9, and the obligations of a
294 health care entity thereto.
