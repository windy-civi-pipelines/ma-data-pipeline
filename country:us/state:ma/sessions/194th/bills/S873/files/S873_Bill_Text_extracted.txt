25 and review comments submitted by others.
26 The state health plan shall identify needs of the commonwealth in healthcare services,

64 provided, however, that no report shall be referred to the attorney general under subsection (f).
65 The commission shall report the findings of a review conducted pursuant to this subsection,
66 including any preliminary findings, to the commissioner of public health. The executive director

68 share documentation provided by the hospital relative to the proposed closure or discontinuation
69 to reduce duplicative reporting requirements by the hospital.
70 SECTION 7. Section 8 of chapter 12C of the General Laws is hereby amended in

96 without justifiable cause, refused to furnish information required by sections 8, 9 and 10 or any
5 of 11
97 regulation promulgated by the center thereunder, it shall issue an order directing the payer, third-

114 (4) (a) Any hospital shall give notice to the department 180 days prior to the curtailment,
115 discontinuance or relocation of any essential health service provided therein. The department
116 shall by regulation define “essential health service” for the purposes of this section and may
117 establish distinct definitions for each health planning region as defined pursuant to section 16T
6 of 11
118 of chapter 6A. The hospital proposing the discontinuance shall provide, with initial notice to the
119 department, (i) evidence of having given notice to municipal officials from each municipality to
120 which it provides the service as a healthcare resource as determined pursuant to section 16T of
121 chapter 6A of the General Laws and of having allowed reasonable opportunity for comment by a
122 stated deadline; and (ii) evidence of a plan to give public notice, including a plan allowing for a
123 reasonable opportunity for public comment, within 10 days of submission of initial notice to the
124 department. Any information given without meeting the requirements of this paragraph shall not
125 constitute notice to the department for the purpose of establishing the earliest date on which the
126 hospital discontinued the essential health service. The department shall forward any notice
127 received under this section to the local health department, secretary of labor and workforce
128 development and health policy commission.
129 (b) Any hospital shall give notice to the department 180 days prior to the closure of the
130 hospital. The hospital undergoing the closure shall provide, with initial notice to the department:
131 (i) evidence of having given notice to municipal officials from each municipality to which it
132 provides the service as a health care resource, as determined pursuant to section 16T of chapter

138 a plan to give public notice, including a plan allowing for a reasonable opportunity for comment
139 from the public and primary service area stakeholders pursuant to (ii) within 10 days of
140 submission of their initial notice to the department. Any information given without meeting the
7 of 11
141 requirements of this paragraph shall not constitute notice to the department for the purpose of
142 establishing the earliest date on which the hospital may close. The department shall forward any
143 notice received under this section to the secretary of labor and workforce development and to the
144 health policy commission.
145 (c) The department shall, in the event that a hospital intends to close or proposes to
146 discontinue an essential health service or services, determine whether any closed or discontinued
147 services are necessary for preserving access and health status in the hospital’s service area,
148 require hospitals to submit a plan for ensuring access to such necessary services following the
149 hospital’s closure or discontinuation of the service and ensure continuing access to such services
150 in the event that the department determines that closure will significantly reduce access to
151 necessary services. If the hospital’s plan for ensuring continued access to a necessary service
152 relies upon the availability of similar services at another hospital or health facility with which it
153 does not share common ownership, the department shall require the hospital to submit with said
154 plan a statement from each other hospital or health facility listed in the plan affirming capacity to
155 provide continued access as described in the plan. The department shall conduct a public hearing
156 prior to a determination on the closure of said essential services or of the hospital. The public
157 hearing shall include, but not be limited to: (i) an explanation by the controlling persons of the
158 hospital of the reasons for ceasing or curtailing operations, relocating health services or ceasing
159 to offer any of the listed health services; (ii) a description of the actions that the controlling
160 persons of the hospital will take to ensure that residents in the hospital or campus service area
161 have continued access to the health services being eliminated or curtailed and have continued
162 access to the health services being eliminated, curtailed or relocated; (iii) an opportunity for
163 public testimony on the scheduled cessation or curtailment of operations, relocation of health
8 of 11
164 services or cessation in offering any of the listed health services, and on the hospital's or
165 campus's plan to ensure continued access to those health services being eliminated, curtailed or
166 relocated; and (iv) an opportunity for the controlling persons of the hospital to respond to
167 questions from interested parties.
168 (d) The department, in conducting any assessment and prior to making any determination
169 pursuant to paragraph (c), shall refer to the state health plan and regional considerations
170 established pursuant to section 16T of chapter 6A, and shall also request and consider
171 information presented by the health policy commission pursuant to section 13 of chapter 6D.
172 (e) If a hospital closes or discontinues an essential health service without a plan approved
173 by the department pursuant to paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, that hospital shall not be
174 eligible to have an application approved pursuant to section 25C of chapter 111 for a period of
175 two years from the date the service is discontinued, until the essential health service is restored
176 or until such time as the department is satisfied that a plan is in place that, at the time of the
177 discontinuance, would have met the requirements of paragraph (b). If the closed hospital or the
178 hospital discontinuing the essential health service is part of a network of hospitals under common
179 ownership, the same restrictions shall apply against each hospital owned, managed or controlled
180 by the hospital network. The commissioner may waive a restriction established pursuant to this
181 subsection if the application of such restriction causes an imminent hazard to the public health.
182 (f) If a hospital executes a plan to close or to discontinue an essential health service, said
183 plan not having been approved by the department pursuant to paragraphs (a) and (b) of this
184 section, that hospital shall not be eligible to receive funding under sections 2PPP or 2GGGG of
185 chapter 29, or under section 2G of Chapter 111, for a period of two years from the date the
9 of 11
186 service is discontinued, until the essential health service is restored or until such time as the
187 department is satisfied that a plan is in place that, at the time of the discontinuance, would have
188 met the requirements of paragraph (b). If the closed hospital or the hospital discontinuing the
189 essential health service is part of a network of hospitals under common ownership, the same
190 restrictions shall apply against each hospital owned, managed or controlled by the hospital
191 network. The commissioner may waive a restriction established pursuant to this subsection if the
192 application of such restriction causes an imminent hazard to the public health.
193 (g) No original license shall be granted to establish or maintain an acute-care hospital, as
194 defined by section 25B of chapter 111, unless the applicant submits a plan, to be approved by the
195 department, for the provision of community benefits, including the identification and provision
196 of essential health services. In approving the plan, the department may consider the applicant’s
197 existing commitment to primary and preventive healthcare services and community contributions
198 as well as the primary and preventive healthcare services and community contributions of the
199 predecessor hospital. The department may waive this requirement, in whole or in part, at the
200 request of the applicant.
201 SECTION 13. Said section 51G of said chapter 111 is hereby amended by inserting after
202 subsection (6) the following subsection:-
203 (7) A demonstrated plan for financial sustainability shall include:
204 (a) a needs assessment that identifies the current state of contracting, current and
205 projected resources for coordination and delivery of care, areas for additional education and
206 assessments of technology and analytic resources;
10 of 11
207 (b) an implementation plan listing activities aimed at supporting and improving the
208 delivery of healthcare services delivered by the licensee, including any clinical affiliations as
209 defined in section 1 of chapter 12C of the General Laws, and how well those activities are
210 supported by their current resources;
211 (c) a financial plan that includes an evidence-based budget, contains proof of sources of
212 revenue to cover expenses and is based on a hospital’s past financial performance, or in the case
213 of a new hospital, comparable to a hospital of similar size, providing same or similar services, in
214 a similar geographic area, and with a similar anticipated case mix based on epidemiological
215 surveillance data; and
216 (d) any other documentation that the department sees fit to evaluate the sustainability of
217 essential health services at said hospital.
218 SECTION 14. Section 56 of said chapter 111 is hereby amended by inserting after the
219 second sentence the following new sentences:-
220 Whoever, being licensed under section 51, discontinues an essential health service or
221 closes a hospital under said license and in violation of section 51G shall, for a first offense, be
222 punished by a fine of not more than $150,000 and for a subsequent offense by a fine of not more
223 than $300,000 or by imprisonment for not more than 2 years or both. Any licensee under section
224 51 that closes a hospital under said license and in violation of section 51G shall be punished by a
225 fine of not more than $500,000, by imprisonment for not more than 2 years or both; provided,
226 that if a closed hospital is part of a network of hospitals under common ownership the penalties
227 herein described shall be levied against the authority, entity or corporation having control of the
228 hospital network.

114 (4) (a) Any hospital shall give notice to the department 180 days prior to the curtailment,
115 discontinuance or relocation of any essential health service provided therein. The department
116 shall by regulation define “essential health service” for the purposes of this section and may
117 establish distinct definitions for each health planning region as defined pursuant to section 16T
6 of 11

118 of chapter 6A. The hospital proposing the discontinuance shall provide, with initial notice to the
119 department, (i) evidence of having given notice to municipal officials from each municipality to
120 which it provides the service as a healthcare resource as determined pursuant to section 16T of
121 chapter 6A of the General Laws and of having allowed reasonable opportunity for comment by a
122 stated deadline; and (ii) evidence of a plan to give public notice, including a plan allowing for a
123 reasonable opportunity for public comment, within 10 days of submission of initial notice to the
124 department. Any information given without meeting the requirements of this paragraph shall not
125 constitute notice to the department for the purpose of establishing the earliest date on which the
126 hospital discontinued the essential health service. The department shall forward any notice
127 received under this section to the local health department, secretary of labor and workforce
128 development and health policy commission.
129 (b) Any hospital shall give notice to the department 180 days prior to the closure of the
130 hospital. The hospital undergoing the closure shall provide, with initial notice to the department:
131 (i) evidence of having given notice to municipal officials from each municipality to which it
132 provides the service as a health care resource, as determined pursuant to section 16T of chapter

134 to primary service area stakeholders including, but not limited to: (a) the hospital’s patient and
135 family council; (b) all staff members of the hospital; (c) any labor organization that is currently
136 representing any members of the hospital’s workforce; and (d) any members of the General
137 Court who represent the city or town in the hospital’s primary service area; and (iii) evidence of
138 a plan to give public notice, including a plan allowing for a reasonable opportunity for comment
139 from the public and primary service area stakeholders pursuant to (ii) within 10 days of
140 submission of their initial notice to the department. Any information given without meeting the
7 of 11

141 requirements of this paragraph shall not constitute notice to the department for the purpose of
142 establishing the earliest date on which the hospital may close. The department shall forward any
143 notice received under this section to the secretary of labor and workforce development and to the
144 health policy commission.
145 (c) The department shall, in the event that a hospital intends to close or proposes to
146 discontinue an essential health service or services, determine whether any closed or discontinued
147 services are necessary for preserving access and health status in the hospital’s service area,
148 require hospitals to submit a plan for ensuring access to such necessary services following the
149 hospital’s closure or discontinuation of the service and ensure continuing access to such services
150 in the event that the department determines that closure will significantly reduce access to
151 necessary services. If the hospital’s plan for ensuring continued access to a necessary service
152 relies upon the availability of similar services at another hospital or health facility with which it
153 does not share common ownership, the department shall require the hospital to submit with said
154 plan a statement from each other hospital or health facility listed in the plan affirming capacity to
155 provide continued access as described in the plan. The department shall conduct a public hearing
156 prior to a determination on the closure of said essential services or of the hospital. The public
157 hearing shall include, but not be limited to: (i) an explanation by the controlling persons of the
158 hospital of the reasons for ceasing or curtailing operations, relocating health services or ceasing
159 to offer any of the listed health services; (ii) a description of the actions that the controlling
160 persons of the hospital will take to ensure that residents in the hospital or campus service area
161 have continued access to the health services being eliminated or curtailed and have continued
162 access to the health services being eliminated, curtailed or relocated; (iii) an opportunity for
163 public testimony on the scheduled cessation or curtailment of operations, relocation of health
8 of 11

164 services or cessation in offering any of the listed health services, and on the hospital's or
165 campus's plan to ensure continued access to those health services being eliminated, curtailed or
166 relocated; and (iv) an opportunity for the controlling persons of the hospital to respond to
167 questions from interested parties.
168 (d) The department, in conducting any assessment and prior to making any determination
169 pursuant to paragraph (c), shall refer to the state health plan and regional considerations
170 established pursuant to section 16T of chapter 6A, and shall also request and consider
171 information presented by the health policy commission pursuant to section 13 of chapter 6D.
172 (e) If a hospital closes or discontinues an essential health service without a plan approved
173 by the department pursuant to paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, that hospital shall not be
174 eligible to have an application approved pursuant to section 25C of chapter 111 for a period of
175 two years from the date the service is discontinued, until the essential health service is restored
176 or until such time as the department is satisfied that a plan is in place that, at the time of the
177 discontinuance, would have met the requirements of paragraph (b). If the closed hospital or the
178 hospital discontinuing the essential health service is part of a network of hospitals under common
179 ownership, the same restrictions shall apply against each hospital owned, managed or controlled
180 by the hospital network. The commissioner may waive a restriction established pursuant to this
181 subsection if the application of such restriction causes an imminent hazard to the public health.
182 (f) If a hospital executes a plan to close or to discontinue an essential health service, said
183 plan not having been approved by the department pursuant to paragraphs (a) and (b) of this
184 section, that hospital shall not be eligible to receive funding under sections 2PPP or 2GGGG of
185 chapter 29, or under section 2G of Chapter 111, for a period of two years from the date the
9 of 11

186 service is discontinued, until the essential health service is restored or until such time as the
187 department is satisfied that a plan is in place that, at the time of the discontinuance, would have
188 met the requirements of paragraph (b). If the closed hospital or the hospital discontinuing the
189 essential health service is part of a network of hospitals under common ownership, the same
190 restrictions shall apply against each hospital owned, managed or controlled by the hospital
191 network. The commissioner may waive a restriction established pursuant to this subsection if the
192 application of such restriction causes an imminent hazard to the public health.
193 (g) No original license shall be granted to establish or maintain an acute-care hospital, as
194 defined by section 25B of chapter 111, unless the applicant submits a plan, to be approved by the
195 department, for the provision of community benefits, including the identification and provision
196 of essential health services. In approving the plan, the department may consider the applicant’s
197 existing commitment to primary and preventive healthcare services and community contributions
198 as well as the primary and preventive healthcare services and community contributions of the
199 predecessor hospital. The department may waive this requirement, in whole or in part, at the
200 request of the applicant.
201 SECTION 13. Said section 51G of said chapter 111 is hereby amended by inserting after
202 subsection (6) the following subsection:-
203 (7) A demonstrated plan for financial sustainability shall include:
204 (a) a needs assessment that identifies the current state of contracting, current and
205 projected resources for coordination and delivery of care, areas for additional education and
206 assessments of technology and analytic resources;
10 of 11

207 (b) an implementation plan listing activities aimed at supporting and improving the
208 delivery of healthcare services delivered by the licensee, including any clinical affiliations as
209 defined in section 1 of chapter 12C of the General Laws, and how well those activities are
210 supported by their current resources;
211 (c) a financial plan that includes an evidence-based budget, contains proof of sources of
212 revenue to cover expenses and is based on a hospital’s past financial performance, or in the case
213 of a new hospital, comparable to a hospital of similar size, providing same or similar services, in
214 a similar geographic area, and with a similar anticipated case mix based on epidemiological
215 surveillance data; and
216 (d) any other documentation that the department sees fit to evaluate the sustainability of
217 essential health services at said hospital.
218 SECTION 14. Section 56 of said chapter 111 is hereby amended by inserting after the
219 second sentence the following new sentences:-
220 Whoever, being licensed under section 51, discontinues an essential health service or
221 closes a hospital under said license and in violation of section 51G shall, for a first offense, be
222 punished by a fine of not more than $150,000 and for a subsequent offense by a fine of not more
223 than $300,000 or by imprisonment for not more than 2 years or both. Any licensee under section
224 51 that closes a hospital under said license and in violation of section 51G shall be punished by a
225 fine of not more than $500,000, by imprisonment for not more than 2 years or both; provided,
226 that if a closed hospital is part of a network of hospitals under common ownership the penalties
227 herein described shall be levied against the authority, entity or corporation having control of the
228 hospital network.
