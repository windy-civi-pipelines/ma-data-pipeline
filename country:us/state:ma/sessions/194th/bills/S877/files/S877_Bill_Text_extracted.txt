An Act to promote an enhanced care worker minimum wage.
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives in General Court assembled, and by the authority

1 SECTION 1. Chapter 19A of the General Laws is hereby amended by adding after
2 Section 4D the following new section:-
3 Section 4E: In establishing rates of payment for homemaker and personal care
4 homemaker services pursuant to the second paragraph of section 13C of chapter 118E of the

6 minimum wage paid to employees of home care agencies providing such services shall be no less
7 than $25 per hour in the first rate year and that such minimum wage shall be adjusted by the rate
8 of inflation for each subsequent rate year. Such adjusted minimum wage rate shall be calculated
9 to the nearest cent using the consumer price index for urban wage earners and clerical workers or
10 a successor index, for the 12 months prior to each rate year as calculated by the United States
1 of 2
11 department of labor. When establishing rates of payment for homemaker and personal care
12 homemaker services, the executive office shall adjust such rates to ensure that the rates fully
13 account for the cost to providers of paying such enhanced minimum wage. Nothing in this

21 to employees of social service program providers receiving such payments shall be no less than
22 $25 per hour in the first rate year and that such minimum wage shall be adjusted by the rate of
23 inflation for each subsequent rate year. Such adjusted minimum wage rate shall be calculated to
24 the nearest cent using the consumer price index for urban wage earners and clerical workers or a
25 successor index, for the 12 months prior to each rate year as calculated by the United States
26 department of labor. When establishing rates of payment for social service programs, the
27 secretary of the executive office shall adjust such rates of payment to ensure that the rates fully
28 account for the cost to providers of paying such enhanced minimum wage.
29 SECTION 3. The executive office of health and human services shall complete the
30 processes above and file for emergency adoption of such amended regulations no later than 180
31 days after passage of this Act.
