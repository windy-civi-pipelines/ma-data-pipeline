8 The executive office shall establish separate rates for registered nurses, licensed practical nurses
9 and certified nursing assistants. The executive office may establish rates by geographic region.
10 The rates shall include an allowance for wages, payroll taxes and fringe benefits, which shall be

14 reasonable profit factor, as determined by the executive office. The executive office may exempt
15 from the rates certain categories, as defined by the executive office, of fixed-term employees that

17 services there is a contract between a facility and a nursing pool registered with the department
18 of public health. The maximum rates shall be no higher than 130% of the average hourly base
19 rate for regular registered nurses, licensed practical nurses and certified nursing assistants. The
20 executive office shall establish procedures by which nursing pools shall submit cost reports,
21 which may be subject to audit, to the executive office to establish rates. The executive office
22 shall determine the nursing pool rate contained in this paragraph by considering wage and benefit

44 following information by geographic area which the health care personnel performed the work
45 by facility type of hospital and nursing: (a) The average amount charged by nursing pools for
46 health care personnel by license type; (b) The average amount paid by the nursing pool to health

48 pool by health care personnel license type, such as payroll taxes, workers’ compensation
49 insurance, professional liability coverage, credentialling, and other employee-related costs.
50 SECTION 2. Nursing pools certified under section 72Y of chapter 111 of general laws, or
51 any of their affiliated parties, shall be prohibited from soliciting and/or hiring nursing facility
52 employees from nursing facilities in which the temporary nurse staffing agency has an active
53 contract for the period of the contract plus 12 months. Operators shall under 101 CMR 206
54 provided annual reports on their use of temporary nursing service agencies.
55 SECTION 3. The Department of Public Health shall amend the “long term care facility
56 operating regulations” (105 CMR 150) to require that temp nursing agency workers are
3 of 4
57 compliant with all applicable qualifications, and training requirements now required of nursing
58 care staff regularly employed in their position. In addition, require temporary nursing service
59 agencies pay all fines as assessed by the Department of Public Health or other regulatory body
