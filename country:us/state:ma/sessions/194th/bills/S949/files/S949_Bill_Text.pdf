59 by the general court and specifically designated to be credited to the fund; (ii) funds from public
60 and private sources, including, but not limited to gifts, grants and donations; and (iii) any interest

63 commonwealth institutions of public higher education, as defined in section 5 of chapter 15A;
64 provided, however, that, students shall not be charged fees for that portion of the debt service
65 paid out of the fund. The board of higher education, in consultation with the trustees of the
66 university of Massachusetts, shall determine the amounts to be allocated to each public higher
67 education institution to cover debt service obligations; and provided further, that funds allocated
68 from this reserve shall only be used to cover said debt service obligations and that public higher

70 hiring full-time faculty and staff, providing pay increases or other benefits for adjunct faculty,

72 income students and students of color, using methods that improve the college experience and

78 transferred by the general court and specifically designated to be credited to the fund; (ii) funds
79 from public and private sources, including, but not limited to gifts, grants and donations; and (iii)

82 College and University Building Planning Commission, established in section 46 of chapter 15A,
83 for the renovation and rehabilitation of existing buildings and new building construction to meet
84 the recommended green and healthy public higher education buildings standards.
85 SECTION 3. Notwithstanding any general or special law, rule or regulation to the
86 contrary, after January 1, 2027, the costs associated with the construction of an academic,
87 administrative or auxiliary building at a commonwealth institution of public higher education, as
88 defined in section 5 of chapter 15A of the General Laws, shall be paid in full by the
89 commonwealth from state funds or eligible federal funds and shall not be paid for with any
90 public higher education institutional funds or financed through public building authorities or
91 private entities; provided, that the costs associated with deferred maintenance and the
92 assessment, upgrade or repair of any existing academic, administrative or auxiliary building at an
93 institution of public higher education that is under the control and supervision of the department
94 of capital asset management and maintenance shall be paid in full by the commonwealth.
95 SECTION 4. The Green and Healthy Public College and University Building Planning
96 Commission, as established in section 48 of chapter 15A of the General Laws, shall create and
97 recommend a plan for all existing and new public higher education buildings to equitably meet
98 the standards for green and healthy public higher education buildings developed pursuant to
99 paragraph (c) of section 48 of said chapter 15A, by 2037. The commission shall issue
5 of 6

100 recommendations, including an analysis that summarizes the findings of its assessment of public
101 higher education buildings in the commonwealth, for implementing green and healthy public
102 higher education buildings standards for cost-effective renovation and rehabilitation of existing
103 buildings and for new building construction, and a plan for implementing these standards for all
104 public higher education buildings, by 2037. The recommendations shall prioritize addressing
105 buildings with the greatest needs first. The recommendations shall consider the unique
106 environmental conditions of buildings located in urban, industrial, and other areas facing
107 particular site challenges and shall consider the need to address historic patterns of injustice and
108 inequity in public higher education. The recommendations shall estimate the cost of bringing all
109 buildings into compliance with the standards by 2037, including the ongoing cost of maintenance
110 and repair, and recommend a plan to fund these costs, and shall also compare those costs with
111 long-term savings in health and medical costs, energy costs, maintenance, life cycle assessment
112 and other savings, and the growth in economic activity of bringing buildings to the standards,
113 including increased jobs and job training. The first plan of the commission shall be published and
114 submitted to the joint committee on ways and means and the joint committee on higher education
115 not later than December 31, 2028. Prior to completing its assessment and issuing its
116 recommendations, the commission shall conduct public hearings at every commonwealth
117 institution of public higher education and shall consult with employee organizations, as defined
118 in chapter 150E, representing employees at each institution of public higher education.
