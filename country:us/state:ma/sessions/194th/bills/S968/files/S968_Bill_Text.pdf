establish forthwith a statewide access to counsel program for evictions to promote housing
stability and prevent homelessness and, to respond to a housing emergency that the COVID-19
pandemic has exacerbated, and whereas, evictions lead to homelessness, housing instability,
overcrowding, displacement, diminished economic opportunity, and disruption of schooling for
children, all of which are associated with negative health, therefore it is hereby declared to be an
emergency law, necessary for the immediate preservation of the public safety.
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives in General Court assembled, and by the authority
of the same, as follows:
