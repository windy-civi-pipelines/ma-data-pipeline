Re: Norfolk District Attorney’s Program Plan Submitted Pursuant to G.L. c. 258B § 6
Pursuant to M.G.L. c. 258B § 6, I submit the following information to you concerning the
Norfolk District Attorney’s Victim Witness Advocate Program.
1. Description of Service
Background
The Massachusetts Rights of Victims and Witnesses of Crime Law (M.G.L. c. 258B) established
rights and services for crime victims and witnesses to ensure them a “meaningful role in the
criminal justice system.” Crime can significantly impact a victim and witnesses’ safety,
emotional and physical health, and financial security. Navigating the complex and often
intimidating criminal justice system can be overwhelming. The Rights of Victims and Witnesses
of Crime Law seeks to address the impact of crime by ensuring that crime victims and witnesses
are able to effectively participate in the criminal justice process and have access to resources to
address the short- and long-term impact of the crime.
Chapter 258B affords crime victims and witnesses the right to be informed, present, and heard
throughout the criminal justice process. Additionally, the statute outlines certain rights and
services to address their well-being. Victim and witness rights extend to family members when
the victim is a minor, deceased, or incompetent.
Certain rights within the law pertain specifically to non-victim witnesses subpoenaed to testify in
the course of a criminal matter. Serving as a witness in a criminal matter can be an intimidating
1

process. It can also impact a witnesses’ safety, financial security, and emotional and physical
health.
Victim Witness Programs in District Attorneys’ Offices
The Rights of Victims and Witnesses of Crime Law directed prosecutors’ offices and other
criminal justice officials “to create and maintain a program to afford victims and witnesses of
crimes the rights and services” established under 258B. Although many district attorneys
already offered victim services, the law created the opportunity for consistency of services
statewide.
In order to effectively serve crime victims and witnesses while ensuring that their rights are
afforded, district attorneys have created victim witness programs employing Victim Witness
Advocates (VWAs). The VWA serves as a member of the prosecution team and works in
partnership with prosecutors, police, investigators and other staff to assist victims and witnesses.
VWAs work in the District, Juvenile, Superior and Probate Courts. There are also specialized
units that address domestic violence, sexual assault, commercial sexual exploitation of children
(CSEC), community violence, and solved and unsolved homicides. VWAs provide specialized
services and resources to vulnerable populations including children, the elderly and persons with
disabilities. VWAs build relationships with both criminal justice and community-based
stakeholders to ensure victims and witnesses have access to information, assistance, and support.
VWAs regularly work with individuals and organizations on behalf of victims and witnesses
such as:
 Department of Criminal Justice Information Services (DCJIS) Victim Notification
Registry (VNR);
 Community-based domestic violence, sexual assault, homicide, legal assistance, and
trauma services;
 Probation officers;
 Parole Board staff;
 House of Correction officials;
 Department of Correction officials;
 Attorney General Victim Compensation staff;
 Department of Children and Families (DCF), Department of Transitional
Assistance (DTA), and other state and federal support services; and
 Disabled Persons Protection Commission and Elder Protective Services.
These established relationships and VWAs’ understanding of available resources ensure victims
and witnesses have access to appropriate services and reduce barriers to receiving information,
support, and additional referrals.
Affording Rights to Crime Victims and Witnesses
Right to be informed
 VWAs provide information to ensure crime victims and witnesses understand their
rights, the case they are involved in, the criminal justice process, and their role in it.
VWAs help victims and witnesses understand the potential outcomes of each step within
2

a criminal matter, the roles that individuals play within it, and often serve as the
identified liaison for the victims, witnesses and their families. They regularly provide
timely information about court dates and hearings to help minimize the impact on
victims’ and witnesses’ employment and family obligations (i.e. childcare, elder care,
etc.).
 Once a criminal matter has been resolved, whether an offender is found guilty or not
guilty, VWAs ensure that victims, witnesses, and their families understand the outcome
and the sentence that has been imposed by the court.
 VWAs assist victims and witnesses with gaining access to offender information.
Victims and witnesses are entitled to information about an offender’s release from
custody and/or conditions of probation or parole. This can include a “stay away” order
or electronic monitoring conditions requiring the offender to remain away from the
victim and/or witness.
Right to be present
 VWAs accompany crime victims and witnesses to all relevant court proceedings. VWAs
are available to answer questions and address concerns as they arise.
 VWAs strive to create a safer environment for victims and witnesses at the courthouse by
planning for potential issues that may arise in the court building during proceedings, and
working to reduce interactions amongst the various parties to the criminal matter (i.e.
defendants, their families, and the media). Additionally, VWAs serve as the entry point
to direct victims and witnesses to the designated safe and secure waiting areas provided
in all courts across the Commonwealth.
Right to be heard
 VWAs regularly guarantee the victim’s right to be heard throughout the criminal justice
process. The law recognizes the importance of victim input throughout the process, and
VWAs help victims achieve these important objectives, including:
o Opportunities to provide input to the prosecutor, the probation department,
and the court regarding sentencing;
o Delivery of a victim impact statement at sentencing that details the physical,
emotional, and financial costs of the crime; and
o Ensuring that post-conviction agencies also have access to the victim impact
statement and that the victim is registered to deliver a statement to the Parole
Board when applicable.

Helping Victims and Witnesses in the Aftermath of Crime
District Attorney Victim Witness Advocate (VWA) programs play a critical and sometimes life-
saving role for victims and witnesses outside of the courtroom. They assist victims and
witnesses in addressing the ongoing and evolving impact of the crimes committed against them.
Planning for safety
 VWAs assist victims and witnesses who live under threat to their safety to strategize,
think through and plan for potential future violent events that may be committed against
them. They help victims and witnesses to understand and access court-ordered
protection when necessary. They plan exit strategies for the victim and their children
when in danger of further violence.
 VWAs also assist victims and witnesses in relocating to a shelter or a safer community
when necessary. This can include applying to the state witness protection fund when
deemed appropriate to keep a victim and/or witness safe.
Connecting to free resources
 VWAs assist crime victims in applying for the Victim of Violent Crime Compensation
Program offered through the Attorney General’s office pursuant to M.G.L. chapter
258C. This program receives new applications each year and reimburses victims for
“out-of-pocket” costs such as medical, dental, and mental health expenses; funeral/burial
costs; security measures and other costs. A VWA’s assistance is often the first step in
order to access these critical resources to ensure the financial impacts of violent crime(s)
are addressed.
 Victims are connected to free community-based services that have been established to
serve victims of all crimes and to meet their unique needs. VWAs regularly maintain
relationships with programs serving victims of domestic violence, rape, homicide and
other crimes to access various services (i.e. shelter, counseling, or legal assistance) for
the victims and witnesses they serve.
 Trauma from violent crime and attendance at court proceedings can significantly impact a
victim’s and witness’ ability to maintain a regular schedule at school and work. VWAs
assist victims and witnesses in communicating with educators, administrators, and
employers about the impact of violence and the rights of victims and witnesses to attend
court proceedings.
