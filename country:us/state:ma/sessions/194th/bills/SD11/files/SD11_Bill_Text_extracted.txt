RE: Low-Income Services Solar Program Annual Report
Dear Clerk,
Pursuant to M.G.L. Chapter 29 Section 2LLLLL, The Executive Office of Energy and
Environmental Affairs (“EOEEA”) shall annually submit a report on the disbursements of the
trust associated with the Low-Income Services Solar Program (“LISSP”).
As of the date of this report, no disbursements from the trust have been made. With the
clarifications to the statutory authority offered by Chapter 28 of the Acts of 2023, DOER is now
developing an expanded program offering. The total budget for the LISSP is $5,650,000, of
which $650,000 was granted by the Legislature and placed into trust and $5,000,000 of
Alternative Compliance Payment funds contributed by DOER. Earlier this year, the Department
of Energy Resources (“DOER”) entered into a contract with the Center for EcoTechnology
(“CET”) for program development and administration services. A Program Manual is under
development by DOER and CET which will offer guidance on eligibility criteria and program
structure to serve as a resource for non-profit applicants and solar installers.
Through this process of program development, it became clear that a major barrier to non-
profits’ participation in any future program would be the Commonwealth’s traditional pay and
reimburse model for disbursing grant funding. Non-profits often have tight capital budgets with
little discretionary income to support large infrastructure investments. To ensure this program
has successful and equitable outcomes, DOER spent several months coordinating with
stakeholders, CET, the Operational Services Division (“OSD”), and DOER legal and fiscal
teams to identify a viable path to disburse funds that overcomes this unintended barrier to
program participation.
DOER issued a Request for Quotes (“RFQ”) on December 5, 2024 for a third-party grant
administrator that will assist in the disbursement of grant funds to awardees to mitigate the
upfront capital challenge. DOER expects to execute a contract with the grant administrator in Q1

Section 2:
2025. With such an administrator, DOER expects that the grant funds will be paid out directly to
the solar installers upon completion of each installation, unless a non-profit awardee requests to
receive the funds directly. This approach will provide flexibility for non-profits and reduce the
barriers to access for entities with a lack of upfront capital.
After executing a contract with the grant administrator and releasing the Program Manual
publicly, DOER expects to start accepting applications and approving awards within the first half
of 2025.
