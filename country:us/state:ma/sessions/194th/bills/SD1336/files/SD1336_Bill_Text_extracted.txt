In compliance with the Massachusetts General Laws, Part I, Title XVIII, Chapter 126, Section 40:
Recording and reporting of data on population of jails and houses of correction

Section 2:
Section 40. The sheriff shall record, without limitation, the following data for each person committed to
a jail or house of correction: (i) probation central file number; (ii) fingerprint-based state identification
number, if available; (iii) race and ethnicity; (iv) offense-based tracking number; (v) type of release; (vi)
type of admission; (vii) length of sentence; (viii) jail credit from pretrial incarceration; (ix) earned time;
(x) program participation and outcome during incarceration; (xi) case disposition; and (xii) bail amount
or reason if no bail set.
Aggregate data on the population of each jail and house of correction shall be assembled into a
quarterly report with the reported data covering the entire quarterly period. The reports prepared by
the sheriff shall contain no identifying information relating to an individual inmate or detainee.
Each quarter the sheriff shall deliver the report from each jail and house of correction to the secretary
of public safety and security, the house and senate chairs of the joint committee on the judiciary, the
house and senate chairs of the joint committee on public safety and homeland security and the clerks
of the house of representatives and the senate.
This report was produced in partnership with the Executive Office of Public Safety & Security by
utilizing data from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts Criminal Justice Cross-Tracking System.
Data Definitions:
Probation Central File (PCF) Number: A number assigned for identification purposes to an individual by the
Massachusetts Probation Service. The PCF is not supported by fingerprint-based identification.
State Identification Number (SID): A unique ten-character alphanumerical identifier supported by fingerprint
identification assigned to an individual by the Department of State Police through the Automated Fingerprint
Identification System (AFIS). The SID is created upon the fingerprinting of a person by a Criminal Justice Agency.
Offense-Based Tracking Number (OBTN): A unique identifier for a specific fingerprint/arrest/custody event that links
the individual to fingerprints taken. An individual may have multiple OBTNs on file when they have multiple events.
Important Data Note:
The statute requires three specific data points that are not owned by the Sheriffs' Offices. These three include: case
disposition, bail amount, and reason if no bail set, which originate with the Trial Court. As such, the Sheriffs are
unable to populate these fields. The MSA, in consultation with the Trial Court and EOPSS, are working to refine these
metrics so that they can be retrieved from the Cross-Tracking System and reported on electronically.
