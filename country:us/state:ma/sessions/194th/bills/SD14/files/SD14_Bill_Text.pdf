Dear Members of the General Court:
I am pleased to submit this Report to the Legislature: Recovery High School Programs
Legislative Report – Fiscal Year 2023. As required by the statute, the enclosed report
includes: “(i) the number of youths served per high school; (ii) outcomes measured for
youths; and (iii) recommendations for new recovery high schools in fiscal year 2023 and
fiscal year 2024.” The data provided in this report was compiled from information
submitted by schools to the Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary
Education (Department).
For adolescents in recovery from a substance use disorder, school is a setting that may
result in interactions with peer groups who are actively using alcohol or other drugs.
Unfortunately, after treatment, these students may encounter multiple risk factors when
returning to the setting where their substance use problems originated. Recovery High
School programs play an important role for these students by offering them another option
for a school setting – one in which they can feel supported in their recovery while still
working towards a high school diploma.
If you have any questions about this report, please feel free to contact Rachelle Engler
Bennett, Associate Commissioner, Student and Family Support, via
RachelleEngler.Bennett@mass.gov.
Sincerely,
Russell D. Johnston
Acting Commissioner of Elementary and Secondary Education

Introduction
The Department of Elementary and Secondary Education (Department) respectfully
submits the Report to the Legislature: Recovery High Schools Legislative Report – Fiscal
Year 2023, pursuant to Chapter 24 of the Acts of 2022, line item 7061-9607, that reads in
part:
“For …recovery high schools… provided further, that not later than April 3, 2023, the
department shall submit a report to the house and senate committees on ways and
means that shall include, but not be limited to: (i) the number of youths served per
high school; (ii) outcomes measured for the youths; and (iii) recommendations for
new recovery high schools in fiscal year 2023 and fiscal year 2024…”
Recovery High Schools (RHS) are public programs, operated by a school district or an
educational collaborative, that serve as an educational option for students in recovery
from a substance use disorder or dependency. They support students in their recovery
while the students are concurrently working towards their high school degrees.
Recovery High School programs were initially established in Massachusetts in 2006
through a grant program administered by the Department of Public Health (DPH), funded
through state line item 4512-0211. In 2009, G.L. c. 71, § 91 was enacted to clarify several
issues relating to these programs, including data reporting and fiscal responsibility. Under
G.L. c. 71, § 91, Recovery High School programs receive the state average foundation
budget per pupil for enrolled students from the students' districts of residence.
Regulations related to RHS programs, 603 CMR 54.00, were adopted by the Board of
Elementary and Secondary Education in February 2017. An advisory (SPED 2019-1) was
subsequently issued to address special education service delivery for students with
Individualized Education Programs (IEPs) who are attending RHS programs.
In July 2018, the RHS program initiative was transferred from DPH to the Department, as
directed by the Governor and Legislature through the 2019 state budget line item 7061-
9607.
There are currently five Recovery High Schools in Massachusetts (listed by date of
opening):
• William J. Ostiguy High School opened in September 2006 in downtown
Boston and is operated in partnership with the Boston Public Schools.
• Northshore Recovery High School opened in September 2007 in Beverly and
is operated by Northshore Education Consortium.
• Liberty Preparatory opened in September 2007 in Springfield and is operated
in partnership with the Springfield Public Schools.

• Independence Academy opened in September 2012 in Brockton and is
operated by North River Collaborative.
• Rockdale Recovery High School opened in September 2015 in Worcester and
is operated by Central Massachusetts Special Education Collaborative.
The Number of Students Served Per High School
Enrollment numbers vary among the five RHS programs ranging from a low of 2 (two)
students in one program to a high of 23 (twenty-three) students in another. The following

Outcomes Measured for Students
Recovery High School programs serve a complex population of students that require a
specialized approach to balance students’ unique academic and therapeutic
programming needs. These programs enroll a significantly higher number of students with
disabilities, and those who are considered low-income and high needs, as compared to
state averages for those identities. Those factors, combined with the inherent issues of a
school composed of students diagnosed with a substance use disorder, create particular
challenges to addressing each student’s needs. Recovery High School programs support
these individual needs by developing and following an individualized recovery plan while
providing a comprehensive four-year high school education that supports students to
reach success in their academic and personal lives.
Table 3: Student Group Percentages at Recovery High Schools Compared with All Districts
Recovery High Schools All Massachusetts School Districts
(Average)
Low-income 70.9% 42.3%
Students with Disabilities 43.6% 19.4%
High Needs 81.1% 55.1%
Recommendations for New Recovery High Schools in
Fiscal Year 2023 and Fiscal Year 2024
The Department is currently in discussions with school districts, RHS programs, and other
partners to determine how, collectively, to best meet the needs of students with a
substance use disorder. At this time, a new RHS program is not recommended as the
Department continues to evaluate these programs and establish best practices.
