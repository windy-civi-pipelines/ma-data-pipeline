Dear Speaker Mariano and President Spilka:
In accordance with Section 12 of Chapter 11 of the Massachusetts General Laws, we will be
conducting a performance audit of the Massachusetts General Court (House, Senate, and Joint
Legislative Committees).
The Generally Accepted Government Auditing Standards, commonly referred to as the “Yellow
Book,” are issued by the United States Government Accountability Office. The standards apply
to both financial and performance audits of government agencies. Our audit will be conducted
in accordance with these standards and will cover all of the topics we were unable to fully
review in our previous audit, due to your refusal to participate in the audit process. Our work
will start with a review of high-risk areas, such as state contracting and procurement
procedures, the use of taxpayer-funded nondisclosure agreements, and a review of your balance
forward line item - including a review of all relevant financial receipts and information.
Section 12 of Chapter 11 of the General Laws requires organizations being audited to provide our
audit team with books, documents, and other records pertaining to the audit areas. We may also
make inquiries regarding audit issues with the members of your staff responsible for the
functions involved in this audit and request, from management, written confirmation of
statements your staff made to us during the audit. We ask that all requested records and
information be made available to us within 72 hours of the date of request.
At the completion of our audit, we will provide you with a draft copy of our audit report for your
review and comments. Your comments should be forwarded to us within 15 days of notification.
Also, if you would like a formal exit meeting, please request the meeting at this time.

Please respond with some potential dates for an entrance conference to be scheduled.
Sincerely,
Diana DiZoglio
Auditor of the Commonwealth
