Dear Honorable Chairs of the House and Senate Committees on Ways and Means; Joint
Committee on Education; and Joint Committee on Mental Health, Substance Use and
Recovery:
I am pleased to submit this this report, Social Emotional Learning Grants: Fiscal Year
2024 Report on Universal Mental Health Screening Pilot, pursuant to Chapter 28 of the
Acts of 2023, line item 7061-0028, that reads in part:
“…provided further, that not later than September 3, 2024, the department shall
submit a report to the joint committee on education, the joint committee on mental
health, substance use and recovery and the house and senate committees on ways
and means that shall include: (1) a description of the participants in the pilot
program; (2) a summary of the data collected from program participants; and (3) any
recommendations to further expand the availability of mental health screenings for
students…”
This line item helps advance the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education’s
(Department/DESE) “whole student” strategic objective that includes a focus on
supporting implementation of multi-tiered systems of support (MTSS) that help all students
progress both academically and in their social, emotional, and behavioral development.
The funding provides critical resources to schools, districts, charter schools and
educational collaboratives as they build “systems of integrated student supports” to meet
the needs of historically underserved groups and communities, create culturally and
sustaining classroom and school practices and high expectations and targeted
interventions” as described in our Educational Vision. These resources are particularly
important as we continue to see student social and emotional, behavioral, and mental
health and educator mental wellness concerns.
The efforts funded through this line item helped further the ability of communities across
the Commonwealth to maximize coordination with service providers and establish more
comprehensive continuums of care. These funds helped to increase student access to
behavioral and mental health services, including grant funded services, delivered in
partnership with community-based providers, for students. In addition, professional

development coordinated by the Department and offered to school staff supported their
ability to identify students’ social and emotional and behavioral and mental health needs
as well as educators’ needs as part of comprehensive, integrated, tiered approaches to
promoting wellness for all students and educators, and to address needs of students
requiring additional supports.
The (SEL and Mental Health) grant, awarded in December 2024 provided professional
development (PD) and coaching supports to help school staff identify students in need of
services and connect those students to services as well as address the wellness needs of
staff.
If you have any questions, feel free to contact me or Jessica Leitz, Director of External
Partnerships, jessica.leitz@mass.gov. We look forward to continuing to facilitate and
coordinate this work and thank the Governor and Legislature for your commitment to the
students of the Commonwealth.
Sincerely,
Russell D. Johnston,
Acting Commissioner of Elementary and Secondary Education

This report provides information about grant activities and professional development
offered through this line item and includes the required information about (1) a description
of the participants in the pilot program; (2) a summary of the data collected from program
participants; and (3) any recommendations to further expand the availability of mental
health screenings for students.
The Department continues to work collaboratively with the Executive Office of Health and
Human Services (EOHHS), including the Departments of Public Health and Mental Health
(DPH and DMH), to leverage existing and planned initiatives and to promote
complementary and supplemental activities. The Department also continues to make
efforts to coordinate and align related opportunities where helpful, and to use multiple
funding sources where needed and appropriate to support related goals. For example, the
grant program described below includes funding from both the Social Emotional Learning
line item 7061-0028 and the Student Wellness School Supports/Supporting Healthy
Alliances Reinforcing Education line item 7061-9650.
Selection of Participating Grantees
In October 2023, the Department posted the fiscal year (FY2024) Request for Proposals
(RFP) opportunity through Fund Code (FC) 613/311 Supporting Students' Social Emotional
Learning, Behavioral and Mental Health, and Wellness through Multi-Tiered Systems of
Support (SEL and Mental Health Grant). Massachusetts public school districts, including
2

charter schools, and educational collaboratives were eligible to apply. On November 9,
2023, the Department received forty-two (42) applications requesting over $3 million. After
conducting its grant review process, the Department awarded a total of over $3 million to
all forty-two (42) applicants to implement activities district-wide or in one or more schools
that increase student access to behavioral and mental health services.
Summary Report: Piloting Universal Mental Health
Screening
The following data was collected based on criteria in the legislative line item 7061-0028,
Social Emotional Learning:
• Number of students who received mental health screenings, delineated by
demographic group and grade level;
• Number of students requiring additional support or follow-up screenings, including
students who indicated suicidal ideation or intent to self-harm;
• Length of time between the initial screening and subsequent support services
provided, and number of students referred for additional support services outside of
the school district;
• Types of screening tools used;
• Description of the participants in the pilot program;
• Summary of the data collected from the program participants; and
• Any recommendations to further expand the availability of mental health screenings
for students.
Background Data
In FY2024 a total of thirteen (13) grantees out of forty-two (42) opted in to participate in
Piloting Universal Mental Health Screening. They represent urban, suburban, and rural
school districts (referred to from this point forward as “grantees”).
In June 2024, grantees completed an end of year survey, with questions about the universal
mental health screening data they collected and their experiences piloting universal
mental health screening systems. This report presents a summary of their survey
responses, divided into two sections, with the first section focused on their data and the
second section focused on their experiences. We continue to learn about the
opportunities and challenges of conducting screenings in school settings and DESE is
continuing to offer resources such as coaching funding through this grant opportunity and
professional development to build systems to strengthen screening practices.

Section 1: FY2024 Universal Mental Health Screening Data
This section provides an overview of the FY2024 grantees’ universal mental health
screening data, detailing the total number of students screened and a breakdown by grade
and key demographic categories, in compliance with state budget requirements for this
grant.
All thirteen (13) grantees were successful in their universal mental health screening efforts.
Each grantee selected at least one universal mental health screening tool and screened at
least one group of students by the end of FY2024. By June 2024, a total of 3,056 students
had been screened across all grantees. The range of students screened varied
significantly. As this is a pilot, some districts started with a smaller number of students,
and one school screened 5 students. A larger, regional school district screened 1,347
students, which was the largest number of students and accounted for 44.1 percent of all
screenings.

According to the FY2024 data, middle school students (fifth through eighth grade)
accounted for 1,840 (60.2 percent) of the mental health screenings, reflecting a continued
emphasis on this critical transitional period in a youth's life. This marks an increase from
FY2023, where 43.4 percent of screenings targeted this demographic.
Two main factors may contribute to this trend:
• Addressing the Unique Challenges of Middle School: The middle school years are
marked by significant changes that can profoundly impact student wellbeing. During
this period, students encounter more complex social dynamics and increasing
academic pressures. Additionally, the onset of puberty triggers a host of physical and
emotional changes, necessitating greater mental health support. Targeted screening
efforts are intended to proactively identify and address the stresses associated with
these challenges, ensuring students receive the necessary interventions to support
their development and academic success.
• Targeted Screening Tools Tailored for Middle School Needs: Many of the screening
tools employed are specifically designed to detect and address the psychological and
emotional issues prevalent among youth in these grades. These tools are tailored to the
developmental milestones and potential stressors characteristic of this age group,
such as peer influence, identity exploration, and academic stress. By using age-
appropriate and contextually relevant screening instruments, grantees can improve the
accuracy and efficacy of their interventions, thereby better supporting middle school
students' mental health.

Analysis of FY2024 data for the 13 participating districts reveals that a significant
majority (82.2 percent) of screenings involved White students. Overall, white students
represent approximately 66 percent of all the students enrolled in these 13 districts, and 53
percent of all students in the Commonwealth, indicating an overrepresentation of white
students participating in these screening pilots.
The Department will continue to work with the coaches supporting districts to ensure that
districts are considering ways that they can implement screening in ways that are
accessible and equitable. Tailoring approaches to be culturally sensitive and inclusive can
help bridge any gaps in participation. In FY25, the Department will also be further
prioritizing high-needs districts by giving competitive priority to districts where a proportion
of high-needs students enrolled in school year 2023-24 was at or above the statewide
average.

Students Needing Additional Support or Follow-Up Screenings
Of the 3,056 students screened, 487 (15.9 percent) were identified as needing additional
support or follow-up screenings, including those expressing suicidal ideation or intent to
self-harm. Response times for providing these students with support or follow-up services
varied, ranging from 1 to 21 days from the initial screening. Notably, 7 students received
services on the day of or within one day of their screening, while 21 days was an outlier. The
average response time across all cases was 4 days.
Of the 487 students needing additional support, 134 (27.7 percent) were referred to
external services. Referrals were made to at least seven behavioral health organizations.
Telehealth services were provided through at least one organization, and referral and care
navigation were facilitated by at least three organizations. Also, students were referred to
youth mobile crisis intervention services, current therapists, pediatricians, and
community-based therapists via primary care providers or insurance coverage. In FY2025,
DESE will ask districts to provide additional details about why referrals to external services
may not have been made, whether because they were not needed (some students who
were screened received services within school or had existing services outside of school)
or for another reason.
Mental Health Screening Tools Utilized
Grantees reported utilizing a total of 14 mental health screening tools in FY2024. Of the 13
grantees, 6 (46.2 percent) reported implementing one screening tool 4 (30.8 percent)
reported implementing two screening tools and one grantee each (7.7 percent) reported
implementing three, four, and five screening tools.

Section 2: FY2024 Themes & Trends in Open-Ended Responses regarding Experiences
This section provides an overview of FY2024 grantees’ responses to open-ended questions
about their experiences piloting universal mental health screening systems. These
questions covered their successes, challenges, unexpected aspects of the process, plans
for future screening efforts, and beliefs in the sustainability of these efforts.
Grantees’ responses to these questions were highly informative, and a key theme emerged
almost immediately. Grantees’ self-reported successes directly align with the core
components of an effective universal mental health screening system. Conversely, their
self-reported challenges are consistent with issues that arise when these components are
missing or have not yet been fully developed.
The following are highlights from their responses about: i.) Successes; ii) Future
Considerations; and iii) Benefits of Coaching & Consultation.
i. Successes
Grantees’ responses indicate their greatest success implementing universal mental health
screening processes occurred when one or more of the following components was in
place:
• Stakeholder Buy-in
• Infrastructure & Processes
• Plans for Follow-Up
• Student & Family Engagement
STAKEHOLDER BUY-IN
Consistent with past years, grantees' responses again emphasized that stakeholder buy-in
significantly contributed to the success of their universal mental health screening efforts.
A range of stakeholders—including administrators, teachers, school support staff,
counseling staff, students, families, and community-based providers—made these efforts
possible. These stakeholders are essential for increasing acceptance, awareness, and
sustainability of screening practices.
The importance of buy-in, especially from senior administrators, cannot be overstated.
Efforts to gain or increase buy-in should specifically target senior administrators, among
others. Visible buy-in from senior leaders serves two major purposes: demonstrating the
value of screening efforts and fostering wider engagement among stakeholders. Grantees
who reported high levels of success in piloting screening systems also noted strong buy-in
from senior administrators.
9

Targeted strategies for engaging teachers and families are crucial. Several grantees have
made sure that these groups understand the goals of the mental health screening process,
the details of the screening tools, and the procedures for data storage and use.
Effective universal mental health screening efforts must account for:
• Educating and creating consensus among stakeholders about the value of screening;
• Establishing an inclusive team-based approach with team members representing a
diverse range of stakeholders, including administrators; and
• Ensuring that teams have a shared vision and a clear plan for logistics, communication,
and follow-up.
INFRASTRUCTURE AND PROCESSES
Grantees' responses indicated that, in addition to buy-in, having a robust infrastructure
and well-defined processes in place prior to screening was critical to the success of their
universal mental health screening efforts. Grantees noted that several key elements
related to infrastructure and processes were particularly important:
• Clearly Defined Purpose, Goals, and Objectives: It is vital that those responsible for
coordinating universal mental health screening efforts, along with other key
stakeholders, develop and articulate a clear understanding of the purpose, goals, and
objectives for implementing a screening process.
• Collaboration and Coordination: Relevant parties must understand the selected tool,
be trained in their roles, and be prepared to perform their responsibilities in the
screening process.
• Accessibility and Inclusivity: The selection of the tool and communication about the
selected tool must be informed by and aligned with overarching screening goals,
considering students’ developmental ages, stages, abilities, and students’ and
families’ racial, cultural, and linguistic backgrounds.
• Technology, Data Management, and Integration: Technology should be user-friendly,
cost-effective, and tailored to the selected tool and the unique needs of the staff,
students, and families. It should provide real-time data tracking, monitoring, and
analysis, include data protection and privacy safeguards, and be developed or
configured for integration with student information and other data systems.
According to many grantees, once these key elements were in place, the facilitation of the
mental health screening process tended to run smoothly and resulted in a clear
understanding of which students required follow-up.
10

PLANS FOR FOLLOW-UP
Grantees' responses indicated that many schools/districts already have routine practices,
and in some cases, more formal systems, for identifying and responding to students who
may be experiencing mental health challenges. Accordingly, when these entities
implemented universal mental health screening efforts, they typically had defined plans in
place for following up with students whose screenings suggested a potential need for
additional evaluation or more formal follow-up.
Follow-up plans for students—and often their families—included ongoing check-ins and
other personalized support options, as well as referrals to school support staff or
community-based providers. For example, one grantee stated: "We were able to use the
response data to follow up with students who indicated concerns and offer support
services to the students and their families."
STUDENT AND FAMILY ENGAGEMENT
Grantees were pleasantly surprised by the high level of student engagement in the
universal mental health screening process. Their engagement was a major contributor to
the overall success of the screening. For example:
• “We were surprised with how open-minded the students were to answering screening
questions openly and honestly and how willing they were to answer follow-up
questions with counselors.”
• “Middle school students were really interested in taking the screener and learning more
about mental health. The data was useful to inform therapeutic skill-building groups
and community organization connections for students and families.”
ii. Future Considerations
Grantees' responses revealed themes regarding areas of concern or improvement in
piloting universal mental health screening systems. These trends have been distilled into
several key areas with clear implications and considerations for future practice:
• Timing: Initiating, Staging, & Administration
• Scaling Up Communication
• Follow-Up with Identified Students & Responsive Staffing
Timing: Initiating, Staging, & Administration
A consistent theme noted by grantees was related to timing, specifically the desire to begin
piloting universal mental health screening systems as early as possible in the school year.
Starting early allows for better planning and execution of the screening process. Some
11

grantees reported that their efforts were complicated by concurrent activities, such as
MCAS administration, indicating a need for better scheduling in the future.
Scaling Up Communication
Grantees reported that scaling up communication plans for expanded mental health
screening efforts was time intensive. While building on their original communication plans,
they found that reaching newly impacted staff, students, and families required more time
and energy than initially anticipated-.
Follow-Up with Identified Students and Responsive Staffing
Grantees reported a high prevalence of students identified as needing follow-up, which
necessitated a concerted effort to leverage existing staff for timely responses. Internal
staff responsible for coordinating follow-up typically met with students within a week of
screening. Given the shortage of community-based mental health providers, grantees
found it necessary to reconfigure or redeploy staff to adequately address the students’
mental health needs.
iii. Benefits of Coaching & Consultation
All thirteen (13) grantees who received funding to pilot universal mental health screening
systems participated in professional development, coaching, and consultation offered by
DESE. Highlights from their experiences include:
• High-level orientation to piloting universal mental health screening systems
• Introduction to common issues and strategies for addressing them
• Access to toolkits with user-friendly resources
• Regularly scheduled coaching sessions and ad hoc opportunities to share updates and
receive feedback
Grantees reported that coaching provided them with a comprehensive plan for piloting
universal mental health screening systems, complete with guidance and instructions for
developing a detailed timeline, and modifying their mental health communication plans,
administration schedules, and follow-up procedures. The toolkits provided by coaches
were particularly valuable, enabling grantees to focus more on utilizing the materials and
engaging in data analysis for decision-making and reporting purposes.
Grantees expressed gratitude for the opportunities to connect with their coach and fellow
grantees, which reduced stress related to executing their pilots and increased confidence
in their ability to carry out their projects as intended. They attributed much of their success
to the support from coaches and peer support from other grantees.
12

In conclusion, the coaching and consultation provided by DESE were crucial to the
success of the grantees' mental health screening efforts and their belief in the
sustainability of these initiatives. The collaborative learning experience was highly valued,
and grantees gained significant knowledge, skills, and insights through their participation.
