Project Name: Superstructure Replacement of Maffa Way & Mystic Avenue – Boston
Owner’s Representative Contract Number: 120635
Project Number: 607670
Construction Contract Number: 119537
I EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The Maffa Way and Mystic Avenue Bridges are structurally deficient and in need of repair
and rehabilitation. First constructed in the 1950’s, the Maffa Way and Mystic Avenue Bridges
carry approximately 30,000 and 27,000 vehicles daily, respectively, providing crucial
transportation links between Somerville, the north shore, and Boston. When considering the
extent of deterioration of the steel superstructures, the bridges' age, the location and amount
of traffic volume they carry, and fatigue sensitive details, it was determined to replace the
superstructures of both bridges.
To ensure the safety of these critical structures, MassDOT retained Pare Corporation to
provide preliminary engineering services required to prepare construction bridging
documents, the Base Technical Concept, to reconstruct and reconfigure the Maffa Way and
Mystic Avenue bridge structures to a state of good repair. MassDOT chose to utilize a Best
Value Design‐Build Procurement process (BVDB) to accelerate delivery of the project. On
February 22, 2023, the project was awarded to Skanska USA Civil Northeast Inc. with Lead
Designer CHA Consulting. MassDOT is responsible for project advertisement, administering
Federal funds associated with the project and construction oversight.
The work under this project consists of the design and construction for the full removal and
replacement of the existing bridge superstructures, the rehabilitation of the existing
substructures to remain in place, moment slabs, and retaining walls. Roadway work includes
vertical and horizontal grade adjustments, full‐depth pavement reconstruction, grading,
granite curb, cement concrete sidewalks, dedicated bus and bicycle facilities, drainage,
significant utility relocations, signage, traffic signal adjustments, pavement markings, and
other related work, including the reconstruction and resurfacing of a portion of the I-93
Southbound Off Ramp onto Maffa Way. The project includes extensive coordination with the
MBTA, City of Boston, and City of Somerville.

Project Number: 607670
Construction Contract Number: 119537
The purpose of the project is to improve public safety and promote mobility for pedestrians,
cyclists, public transportation, and vehicles. Project goals include: addressing structural
deficiencies by replacing two bridge superstructures with new code compliant and low-
maintenance bridges; addressing traffic capacity and multimodal accessibility by maintaining
general purpose travel lanes on each bridge, providing separate bicycle accommodations,
improving sidewalks, and maintaining the existing bus lane on Maffa Way; and integrating
with future projects including Rutherford Avenue improvements, One Mystic development,
and completion of Assembly Square.
MassDOT and Skanska have committed to keeping the public informed as well as managing
impacts as best they can while getting the project completed. Outreach efforts will include: a
project website, informational materials provided in community facilities, informational
materials located on MBTA vehicles, public information meetings, Design Public Hearings,
and briefings with local community organizations. Public Information Meetings were held in
January and May 2024.
To minimize impacts to MBTA track operations, the contract allows for two surge periods,
one each in 2024 and 2025, consisting of nine consecutive days, where Orange Line
operations would be shut down at Sullivan Station and replaced with bussing between
Wellington and North Stations. The first surge was successfully completed early on Friday
June 28, 2024, at 11am, thus meeting Incentive Payment #1 by 68 hours. This entitled Skanska
to an incentive payment of $897,600.
As of November 30, 2024, the project is in construction. The Project contains a Contractual
Notice to Proceed date of April 3, 2023 and a Contractual Contractor Field Completion date
of December 30, 2026, resulting in a contract duration of 45 months or 3.7 years. The total
project encumbrance is $49,929,943 with a forecast cost at completion of $52,260,715. The
increase is largely due in part to the additional scope of work associated with the
Lombardi/Broadway corridor improvements.

II ANNUAL REPORT
Contract Scope of Work
The Massachusetts Department of Transportation, Highway Division (MassDOT) proposes
to replace the superstructures of the Maffa Way Bridge (B-16-067 (3GV)) and the Mystic
Avenue Bridge (B-16-068=S-17-028 (3GW)) over the Orange Line, MBTA, and Pan Am
Railways. The Maffa Way Bridge is located in the City of Boston, and the Mystic Avenue
Bridge is located on the Boston/Somerville city line. The project includes modifications to
the approach roadways for each structure, including reconstruction of existing pedestrian
accommodations and the addition of bicycle accommodations.
Built in the 1950’s, the Maffa Way Bridge consists of a two (2) span continuous structure
consisting of a reinforced concrete deck with a bituminous concrete wearing surface supported
by rolled steel stringers. The superstructure is supported by reinforced concrete gravity wall
abutments and one reinforced concrete wall pier supported on a spread footing. Maffa Way is
classified as an urban principal arterial that runs east to west between Somerville/Boston City
Lines and the Alford Street/Rutherford Avenue (Route 99)/ Main Street rotary. Additionally,
this bridge is under MassDOT jurisdiction and is also part of the National Highway System
(NHS).
The Maffa Way Bridge structure has an overall curb to curb width of 60 feet and an out-to-
out width of approximately 83 feet. Within the curb-to-curb width, 50 feet is allotted for traffic
from Broadway and the I-93 ramp combined while the remaining 10 feet on the northern is a
crosshatched shoulder to dissuade vehicular use. The bridge has an existing 8.5-foot sidewalk
with granite curing on either side of the bridge.
Also built in the early 1950’s, the Mystic Avenue Bridge consists of a three (3) span
continuous structure consisting of a reinforced concrete deck with a bituminous wearing
surface supported on rolled steel stringers. The superstructure is supported by a concrete
4

Project Number: 607670
Construction Contract Number: 119537
abutment on the east approach, a stone masonry abutment with a concrete beam seat on the
west approach, and two reinforced concrete wall piers supported on spread footings. Mystic
Avenue is a one-way urban principal arterial that runs east to west between Bailey Road in
Somerville and Main Street in Boston, Massachusetts. It is under MassDOT jurisdiction and
is also part of the National Highway System (NHS).
The Mystic Avenue Bridge has an overall curb to curb width varies from approximately 51-
feet wide to 58-feet wide and the out-to-out width varies from 55-feet wide to 64-feet wide.
Within the curb-to-curb width, at the start of the bridge 30-feet is allotted for motorist while
the remainder is blocked off to prevent motorist from trying to enter using the parking lot to
the southeast of the bridge. On the bridge the entire curb-to-curb width is used for motorists
to navigate the roadway. The bridge has an 8.5-foot concrete sidewalk on the north side. There
is no posted speed limit prior to or within the project area therefore a speed limit of 25 miles
per hour is assumed, as both the cities of Boston and Somerville have opted into the state’s
policy regarding thickly settled or business districts.
When considering the extent of deterioration of the steel superstructures, the bridges' age, the
location and amount of traffic volume they carry, and fatigue sensitive details, replacement
of the superstructures proved to be a reasonable option. With both bridges nearing their
expected service life, especially in a high-volume area, the existing superstructures would not
be able to maintain a satisfactory level of service without major rehabilitation.
The scope of work includes both design and construction for the full removal and replacement
of the existing bridge superstructures, the rehabilitation of the existing substructures to remain
in place, moment slabs, and retaining walls. Roadway work includes vertical and horizontal
grade adjustments, full-depth pavement reconstruction, grading, granite curb, cement concrete
sidewalks, bicycle facilities, drainage, utilities, signage, traffic signal adjustments, pavement
markings, and other related work, including the reconstruction and resurfacing of a portion of
the I-93 Southbound Off Ramp onto Maffa Way.

The Project includes significant utility relocations with multiple utility companies,
coordination with the MBTA Orange Line and MBTA Commuter Rail/CSX Railroads for
work within their railroad facilities, coordination with adjacent construction projects, and
coordination with the Cities of Boston and Somerville.
A Best Value Design‐Build Procurement process (BVDB) was utilized for the Project and
consisted of a two‐phase selection process. The first phase consisted of creating a short list of
qualified Design‐Builders and the second phase consisted of the submission of Technical and
Price Proposals in response to a Request for Proposal (RFP). MassDOT established a
Selection Committee approved by the Chief Engineer who was responsible for evaluating and
ranking all Proposals on the basis of the evaluation criteria set forth in the RFP. In November
2022, the Design-Build team of Skanska USA/CHA Consulting was selected as the apparent
winning team and on February 22, 2023 was subsequently awarded the contract.

1, 2024 and the second Orange Line Surge anticipated to occur between May 9, 2025 and
May 19, 2025. The Surges consist of nine consecutive days, beginning at 10:00 PM on Friday
evening, with work occurring 24 hours per day until the end of the Surge at 5:00 AM on
Monday of the following week, where Orange Line operations would be shut down at Sullivan
Station. The MBTA agreed that bussing would be used to divert subway passengers between
Wellington and North Stations. Coordination and scheduling of these Surges is the
responsibility of the Design-Builder who will work closely with MassDOT Highway, MBTA,
and the Cities of Boston and Somerville. The cost of bussing for the diversion will be borne
by MassDOT Highway.

Critical Path
The Maffa Way / Mystic Ave Superstructure Replacement Project Critical Path has been
revised when comparing the October 1, 2024 Monthly Progress Schedule Update 15 to the
November 1, 2024 Monthly Progress Schedule Update 16. The Maffa Way/Mystic Avenue
Superstructure Replacement Project critical path begins with Skanska constructing the Maffa
Way Phase 1A northeast retaining wall. It then travels through the construction of the Maffa
Way Phase 1B east abutment approach slab and paving of the Phase 1B Maffa Way bridge
deck.
The critical path then travels through preparatory work preceding Maffa Way Phase 2A
demolition. The critical path then travels through the second 9-Day Surge which is forecasted
to occur in July 2025. The critical path continues with saw cutting and demolishing the Maffa
Way bridge deck and removing beams over MBTA Tracks 6 & 7 which occurs during the
11

Project Name: Superstructure Replacement of Maffa Way & Mystic Avenue – Boston
Owner’s Representative Contract Number: 120635
Project Number: 607670
Construction Contract Number: 119537
week and during MBTA weekend closures. This is followed by additional Maffa Way east
abutment work including FRP bridge seats and sidewalks. The critical path continues with
Skanska/CHA completing the east abutment approach slab followed by setting at-grade
curbing, sidewalk, and lighting. The critical path then travels through completing the Maffa
Way concrete median and removing the temporary traffic set up and completing paving Maffa
Way and Mystic Ave.
The critical path ends with Skanska/CHA completing final striping to achieve Milestone 2,
Substantial Completion which is followed by punch list items to attain Milestone 1,
Contractor Field Completion.
It is important to note that there are no critical path activities progressing from January 23,
2025 thru April 1, 2025 due to the restrictive no winter paving calendar assigned to paving
the Maffa Way Phase 1B bridge deck. There are no critical path activities progressing from
December 1, 2025 to April 1, 2026 due to the restrictive no winter concrete calendar assigned
to placing concrete sidewalks at Maffa Way.
Areas and Issues of Concern
As of November 30, 2024 the contract is projected to be completed above the encumbered
amount with additional funds being needed in the amount of $2,330,772. This does not include
anticipated MBTA bussing cost associated with the 2025 9-day Orange Line surge (see
below), however, it does include partial costs associated with the incorporation of a dedicated
bus lane on Lombardi Street, currently being tracked as PCO-004.
The following list represents potential areas of concern identified for the project that may
impact the project budget and/or schedule:
 Increased MBTA costs associated with management, flagging, and bussing. The Memorandum
of Agreement between MassDOT and the MBTA indicates a cost of $3.6M. MBTA has noted
12

Project Name: Superstructure Replacement of Maffa Way & Mystic Avenue – Boston
Owner’s Representative Contract Number: 120635
Project Number: 607670
Construction Contract Number: 119537
that costs could be in excess of $9M for such services for the 2024 Surge. MassDOT has
requested documentation supporting MBTA's cost increase, however, as of November 30, 2024
MBTA has yet to produce such justification. On April 25, 2024 MBTA provided single line cost
for bussing for May and June shutdowns. MBTA indicated MassDOT share of cost as
$8,067,000 which includes 100% share of May/June shutdowns and 50% share of May
shutdown. Should increased costs for the aforementioned items be approved, the original project
budget will be adversely impacted. It is anticipated that there will be similar MBTA cost for the
2025 9-day Orange Surge that is currently not accounted for in the project budget.
 Execution of Memorandum of Agreements (MOA) with the City of Boston and City of
Somerville. Both Cities have expressed concerns with the BTC design and may not sign MOA's
until their respective demands are met. The City of Boston raised concerns about Maintenance
consisting of snow removal, de-icing, street sweeping, graffiti removal, landscaping, pavement
marking and delineator maintenance, and trash removal for the bike lane and shared-use
sidewalks. The City of Boston has also expressed concerns with safety and usage. The City of
Somerville is seeking a reduced speed limit of 25 mph (design speed utilized was 30 mph),
narrower vehicle lanes (10'), an added bike lane on Maffa Way, and wider sidewalks. MassDOT
and Pare have been proactively and extensively evaluating the feasibility of implementing the
City of Boston and City of Somerville design requests. As of November 30, 2024, the City of
Boston and City of Somerville have agreed to MassDOT's suggested alternative that implements
intent of Cities design requests. Execution of the Memorandum of Agreements with both cities
is still pending.
 Removal of City of Boston installed traffic signal and pedestrian pedestal near
Sullivan Square. The signal was installed as part of an agreement with the MBTA and
Encore and serves as a major entrance for MBTA buses. The City of Boston controls
and operates the traffic signal. MassDOT Traffic has determined that the signal does
not meet traffic signal warrants and should therefore be removed. Additionally, the
proposed roadway geometry necessitates that both the traffic signal and pedestrian
pedestal be removed. As of September 30, 2022, the City of Boston has noted that
they plan to remove the equipment. Coordination between City of Boston and Design-
13

Project Name: Superstructure Replacement of Maffa Way & Mystic Avenue – Boston
Owner’s Representative Contract Number: 120635
Project Number: 607670
Construction Contract Number: 119537
Builder needs to be closely monitored to minimize schedule impacts. On November
6, 2024 BTD indicated that they would relocate the signal post. As of November 30,
2024 this has yet to be done.
 Coordination with MBTA and allowable work windows associated with work on and
over the tracks
 Inability to gain sufficient ROW access (to work from tracks or foul the clearance
envelope) in a timely manner to support construction activities
 Providing accommodations for pedestrian, bicycle, transit, and vehicles (during
construction). There is strong local advocacy for the first three as expressed at the
Public Hearing and in subsequent letters to MassDOT
 Temporary traffic control requirements in the congested area surrounding the project
 Coordination with One Mystic Developer to accommodate anticipated concurrent
work at the Northeast Quadrant of the Mystic Avenue bridge.
 Traffic management coordination with adjacent on-going construction projects
(present and future) including Eversource Mystic-Woburn 115 kVA underground
transmission project, Rutherford Avenue improvements, North Washington Street
Bridge replacement, One Mystic development, and completion of Assembly Square.
The aforementioned issues will be monitored throughout the construction phase to mitigate
potential impacts to project cost and construction schedule.

Project Name: North Washington Street Bridge Project
Owner’s Representative Contract Number: 120635
Project Number: 604173
Construction Contract Number: 102269
I EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The North Washington Street Bridge was a historic structure constructed in 1898. The bridge
consisted of 10 approach spans and a swing span, which was not operational. The bridge was
deemed structurally deficient and was posted for restricted loads. There had been extensive
emergency repairs done to the bridge over the past decade which led to closure of the two
center lanes on the swing span due to steel deterioration. The City of Boston Public Works
Department proposed to replace the bridge and retained Alfred Benesch & Company to
provide engineering services required to prepare construction documents for the bridge
replacement. MassDOT is responsible for project advertisement, administering Federal funds
associated with the project, and construction oversight.
The work under this project consists of the design and construction of the replacement of the
twelve (12) span, 1087’ long bridge with an ‘iconic’ 1100’ long by 101.5’ wide bridge that
will include four (4) lanes of traffic, two (2) in each direction, one (1) dedicated bus lane,
dedicated bicycle lanes, pedestrian walkways, an architectural trellis structure on each side
of the bridge, full length planters along the barrier for each side of the bridge and trees.
Project goals include: replacement of structurally deficient bridge, incorporation of new
multi-modal bridge as a complete City street over water, improvements to deficient bike and
pedestrian accommodations, improvements to intersections safety and functionality,
improvements to navigational channel, design of context sensitive bridge in important
waterfront and historic bridge location, creation of a visually appealing bridge design that
complements the Zakim Bridge.
The construction contract was awarded to JF White Contracting Company (JFW) in April
2018. In May 2018, JFW submitted a full length temporary vehicular bridge value
engineering cost proposal (VECP) as a schedule reduction measure. MassDOT evaluated the
merits of the proposal and provided JFW with approval to proceed provided all necessary
permits could be secured by JFW. In May 2019 all permits had been approved by the
respective permitting agencies and construction of a temporary utility bridge and a combined
pedestrian and vehicular bridge commenced. Vehicular and pedestrian traffic were diverted
onto the temporary bridge on July 17, 2020 and remained in this configuration until
December 9, 2023 when vehicular and pedestrian traffic shifted onto the new permanent
bridge.

Project Name: North Washington Street Bridge Project
Owner’s Representative Contract Number: 120635
Project Number: 604173
Construction Contract Number: 102269
MassDOT and JFW have committed to keeping the public informed as well as managing
impacts as best they can while getting the project completed. On-going public outreach and
engagement efforts included bi-weekly updates on the project website, two-week
construction look-ahead emails, traffic advisories, media outlet outreach, social media, and
public information meetings.
In October 2021 systemic cracks were found in complete joint penetration (CJP) welds at
internal diaphragms in fabricated North Washington Street Bridge tub box girders (located
both at Casco Bay Steel facility and within those installed in the field). JFW was
subsequently directed to cease all contract work associated with tub girders until a root cause
analysis was performed and subsequent corrective action measures were developed and
approved. Upon approval of a corrective action plan, field activities to repair weld cracks in
tub girders, that were located at both the Casco Bay facility and at the project site,
commenced in September 2022. On January 13, 2023, field activities to repair weld cracks
in tub girders, located at both the Casco Bay facility and the project site, were completed.
JFW filed Claim No. 6-102269-003 and put MassDOT on notice that they will have incurred
cost attributable to the weld crack issue and associated delay in the amount of $16.3M. On
December 12, 2022, MassDOT denied JFW claim No. 6-102269-003 and maintained the
position that weld cracking was a direct result of the Contractor’s fabrication process and
lack of sufficient quality control. As of November 30, 2024, a determination as to culpability
has yet to be decided.
As of November 30, 2024, construction is approximately 90% complete. The original
contract duration was approximately 5.25 years with a contractual substantial completion
date of August 9, 2023. Substantial completion is currently forecasted to be May 9, 2025, or
-639 days behind schedule. The total project encumbrance is $204,385,945 of which
$182,288,119 relates to MassDOT work and $22,097,826 relates to Municipal work.
Excluding the potential cost of $16.6M associated with the weld crack issue, the project is
currently within budget. On October 21, 2024, the City of Boston formally renamed the
Washington Street Bridge after Bill Russell. The bridge is now known as the William Felton
“Bill” Russell Bridge.

Critical Path Discussion
The Critical Path is driven by painting outside tub girders bolts and weld connections and
then travels through JFW touch up painting inside tub girders to attain Full Beneficial Use,
Substantial Completion and Punch List to complete the Project. Touch up painting is to
continue through winter months.
Areas and Issues of Concern
There are currently no areas of concern regarding projected cost, however, MassDOT has
potential risk to financial exposure if the root cause of the tub girder diaphragm weld crack
issue is determined to have been a result of the requirements contained within the contract
documents. As of November 30, 2024 a determination as to culpability has yet to be
determined. JFW has informed MassDOT that they will have incurred cost attributable to the
weld crack issue and associated delay in the amount of $16,665,583.24. The project team
developed an acceptable corrective action plan and as of January 13, 2023 all weld crack
repairs at both the Casco Bay facility and project site have been completed. On February 1,
2023, MassDOT approved JFW proposal to fabricate a new tub girder 5G1B, however,
MassDOT reiterated their position that all costs associated with fabrication of the new tub
girder are the responsibility of JFW as these costs are attributed to the Internal Diaphragms
Weld Cracks issue which are a direct result of the JFW's fabrication processes and lack of
sufficient quality control protocols. JFW indicated that the cost to fabricate a new tub girder
is $385,000 (this cost is inclusive of the $16,665,583.24 cost noted above). As of November
30, 2024 JFW has installed all remaining tub girders.
As of November 30, 2024 the contract is projected to be completed below the encumbered
amount with no additional funds needed, however, should MassDOT be determined to be
culpable for weld cracks and have to pay JFW $16,665,583.24 (as submitted by JFW), then
an additional $4,158,691, would be needed. Although this OR believes that weld cracks were
a direct result of fabrication issues, the maximum known exposure, at this time, is being
carried as a potential contract modification. On December 12, 2022, MassDOT denied JFW
claim No. 6-102269-003 and maintained the position that weld cracking was a direct result
of the Contractor’s fabrication process and lack of sufficient quality control.

The following list represents potential areas of concern identified for the project that may
impact the project budget and/or schedule:
 Cracks found in the welds connecting the end diaphragms to the girder webs in tub
girders, first identified in the September 2021 Monthly Report, remains an ongoing
concern that has the potential to adversely affect the project schedule. Through
Deficiency Report (DR) No. 001, issued on October 1, 2021, JFW was advised that
no further work may proceed that would in any way obstruct their ability to correct
this deficiency or the Department's ability to inspect the area until the deficiency has
been corrected and approved by the Department. JFW was also advised that any
associated costs to the Department related to this deficiency may be back-charged to
JFW. Furthermore, on October 27, 2021 MassDOT issued formal direction to JFW to
cease all work activities on the North Washington Street bridge structure to include
ceasing the installation of the NGRID Gas line, installation of the SIP deck pans, and
any and all bolting that may add additional loading to the superstructure and the tub
girders. JFW was also directed to execute and carry out any and all measures to make
the bridge structure safe and secure. JFW was informed that all other Contract work
outside of the bridge, warehouse span repairs, and work to close the slip lane to
Chelsea Street may continue to proceed. On October 28, 2021 MassDOT directed JFW
to conduct a thorough engineering analysis to determine the root cause(s) that resulted
in vertical cracking in welds encountered in the tub girders at the Casco Bay
fabrication plant and on the project site. JFW provided the results of their root cause
analysis to MassDOT on March 10, 2022, which included an opinion from SGH.
Additionally, on March 25, 2022 JFW's steel fabricator, Casco Bay, and Casco Bay's
consultant WJE, issued their own root cause analysis. On April 4, 2022 JFW issued
Letter No. 216 regarding Internal Diaphragm Weld Cracks Draft Testing, Mapping,
and Corrective Action Procedures by Casco Bay Steel Structure’s (CBSS). On April
19, 2022 MassDOT issued response to JFW Letter NO. 216 regarding Internal
Diaphragm Weld Cracks Draft Testing and Corrective Action Plan submitted by JFW.
MassDOT noted that they reviewed JFW Letter No. 216 and subsequently request
JFW to provide responses to the questions/comments contained in IOM from
MassDOT’s Bridge Group Boston Construction Engineering Department. MassDOT

Owner’s Representative Contract Number: 120635
Project Number: 604173
Construction Contract Number: 102269
Bridge Group noted that JFW’s corrective procedure to only address cracks identified
to date is not acceptable and that JFW should revise the corrective action procedure to
including the Heat Affected Zone (HAZ) of the CJP welds, regardless of whether a
crack has formed at this time, to address the increased hardness and embrittled
microstructure. On May 19, 2022 a Step 1 Claims meeting was held by MassDOT. On
June 24, 2022 JFW provided MassDOT with an itemized statement of claim noting
that through May 31, 2022 they have incurred $2,841,473.54 of costs attributable to
the weld crack issue and associated delay. JFW also notes time impacts of 221 days
of delay. In August 2022 JFW and Casco Bay performed 2 independent weld crack
repair mock-ups, both producing favorable results. As of March 31, 2023 this matter
remains on-going, however, field activities to repair weld cracks in tub girders that are
located at both Casco Bay and at the project site have been completed. On March 15,
2023 JFW requested a Step 2 hearing with MassDOT's Claims Committee. On
September 27, 2023 MassDOT's Owner Representative recommended that talks be
initiated regarding inspection of tub box girders prior to the opening of the bridge to
the general public, now that the tub girders have experienced substantial dead load, as
well as live loads with construction vehicles. MassDOT concurred and a meeting with
MassDOT Bridge Group, HNTB, Benesch, and technical experts was held October 4,
2023, at which time it was mutually agreed that HRV would perform visual
inspections of all vertical welds, MT all full depth diaphragms, and spot check partial
depth diaphragms, of all constructed tub girders. On November 3, 2023 HRV
completed their inspection and noted the presence of one small crack (1/2" long). It
was determined that this crack was likely missed during the previous rounds of UT
testing and repairs. As of November 30, 2024 the crack was repaired in accordance
with previously approved procedures.
 NGRID original Force Account agreement budget exceeded. Phase I of the NGRID’s
gas scope included the installation of the 24” temporary gas line on the temporary
utility bridge for the NWS Replacement Project. Actual costs for the temporary gas
line exceeded NGRID’s original estimate by approximately $1.1 million. As a result,
MassDOT may require additional funding to complete NGRID Force Account
agreement scope as the permanent gas line work has not been completed. It should be
noted that the original design did not include scope for a temporary vehicular bridge
as proposed, designed, and constructed by JFW. The incorporation of JFW's VECP
temporary bridge resulted in NGRID incurring time delays and additional
10

Owner’s Representative Contract Number: 120635
Project Number: 604173
Construction Contract Number: 102269
mobilizations which were not memorialized in their original force account agreement
with MassDOT. MassDOT may seek reimbursement from JFW to help mitigate the
additional cost incurred by NGRID and on January 31, 2022 MassDOT informed
FHWA additional funding would be required. On May 25, 2022 MassDOT reminded
FHWA that additional funds will be required. On September 27, 2023 MassDOT
requested payment in the amount $1,120,061 for the remaining payment for NGRID
Phase I work. On October 18, 2023 MassDOT recommended that partial payment, in
the amount of $851,000, be issued to NGRID with additional funds of approximately
$268,000 be withheld until NGRID provides further justification of overhead costs.
On May 1, 2024 MassDOT requested that NGRID issue a partial payment invoice to
close out this phase of the project. On June 24, 2024 NGRID submitted a partial
payment invoice in the amount of $3,238,551.39 bringing total amount invoiced,
through June 15, 2024, equal to $5,523,136.63 (Total amount paid in Phase I =
$2,284,585.24). As the total amount on the original agreement was $3,229,017.21, As
a result of the overrun, $2,294,119.42 additional funding will be needed for the
NGRID force account agreement. As of November 30, 2024 MassDOT has requested
and awaits documentation from NGRID that supports their invoices.
 Schedule of future TD Garden events have the potential to impact the construction
schedule
 Maintenance of vehicular, pedestrian and bike traffic throughout construction
 Maintain navigational waterways and clearances throughout construction
 Satisfying the needs of abutters including but not limited to Constitution Marina

schedule goals.
Value Engineering
In June 2015 MassDOT commissioned Jacobs Engineering Group Inc. (Jacobs) to
perform a 5-day Value Engineering study for the North Washington Street Bridge
Replacement Project. The Value Engineering (VE) Team included representatives from
Jacobs, Huie Construction Services, Green International and this OR. The VE Team
focused on opportunities for value improvement including, but not limited to project
alternatives and respective costs, maintaining traffic flow, marine work environment and
foundation options, optimization of construction schedule and staging, bridge aesthetics,
and accommodations to pedestrians, bicycles, and the Freedom Trail.
Cost Recovery
At this point in time, no issues have been specifically identified as Cost Recovery issues.
However, it should be noted that any initial identification of a Cost Recovery issue does
not necessarily mean that cost recovery is due; a formal evaluation process must still be
followed. The undersigned Owner’s Representative will continue to monitor issues and,
with MassDOT Highway Division, will discuss referral to the Cost Recovery Standing
Committee. For any issue referred for Cost Recovery, the current MassDOT Highway
Division Cost Recovery Procedure (SOP No. HED-70-01-1-000, dated 8/7/17) shall
govern. In order to perform the legislative mandate of being the Primary Manager of Cost
Recovery, the Owner’s Representative will follow the referenced SOP. This SOP, as
modified for projects with an Owner’s Representative, describes the role of the Owner’s
Representative and includes a Cost Recovery Standing Committee. This committee
oversees the work of separate and issue-specific Cost Recovery Review Panels and Cost
Recovery Evaluation Committees, which will be convened as necessary.

I. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The primary purpose of the project is to preserve the existing bridge structures to maintain the safe
operation of the Commuter Rail and I-90 while MassDOT completes the design and environmental
process for the larger, I-90 Allston Multimodal Project.
Interstate 90 is a vital East-West link between the City of Boston and the western suburbs. It is also a
crucial link for freight from the Port of Boston to the rest of the United States. While a full
replacement is being planned, this viaduct will have to remain in service for several years to come.
The structural rate of deterioration is exceeding normal maintenance activities. The scope of
preservation work will prioritize only those elements necessary to preserve the structures for an
additional 10-15 years. For example, the cleaning and painting of steel is focused on the beam ends
and exterior beams. Some elements of work may help facilitate the larger Multimodal Project
depending on final scope.

*These forecasts are based on JF White’s latest Schedule Update
Areas of Concern
Although the type of work is common to both MassDOT and the contractor, JF White, there are several
factors which increase the challenge on the Project.
This contract is designed to extend the life of the existing viaduct until the larger viaduct replacement
project is underway. Should that contract be released before this scope is complete, it is anticipated this
contract will be descoped and terminated, with any necessary remaining scope added to the larger
contract.
A substantial portion of this contract can be performed under the viaduct without traffic impacts. There
is work near/over the RR that requires coordination with the MBTA and flagging protection for the RR.
There is also work that must be accessed through Boston University property and therefor requires
coordination with BU. Work on the roadway deck is limited to night work with lane takings. These lane
takings must be coordinated with other work in this area. During the Winter season this contract is almost
completely shuttered except for responding to urgent deck repairs in coordination with MassDOT.
5

The length of the structure and the amount of deterioration make the scale of these repairs very large.
The amount of traffic makes working on the deck very challenging. Safety of the workforce and the
travelling passengers requires constant vigilance.
There is also the proximity to abutters. Boston University and Allston neighborhoods are very close and
require communication and coordination. The MBTA Worcester Line and Grand Junction run through
much of the site adding to the required coordination and safety vigilance.

I. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Over the next four to five years this project will update and transform the I-90/I-495 Interchange. Due to electronic
tolling and the elimination of the toll plazas, the interchange is now allowed to simplify the movements. The
bridges need replacing and MassDOT is taking the opportunity to create a safer and more efficient interchange.
This very important and heavily used interchange must maintain the movements throughout the rebuild. There are
also several other challenges unique to this location.
The interchange sits in a very environmentally sensitive area. Marshlands abound and the Sudbury River flows
through the site. The wetlands both abut the site and exist within the loop ramps.
The site also contains an archeologically sensitive area very close to the construction that must remain undisturbed.
Further complicating the site is the train line that crosses through the interchange. This is the mainline from Boston
to Worcester and points west. The line carries Amtrak, Commuter Rail and freight trains. Coordination with the
railroad will be a very important and substantial process.
2

II. ANNUAL REPORT
Project Scope of Work
The project will replace all ramps within this interchange. Due to space constraints caused primarily by
the abutting wetlands, the new interchange is still required to be more complex than a standard full
cloverleaf. However, the design does simplify most of the movements. Where possible, the design calls
for direct connections that were not available when the interchange was built with a toll plaza.
The result of this undertaking will create safer roadway conditions and increased traffic flow that benefits
business and the environment.
This project will require twelve (12) new bridges due to ramps crossing the mainline as well as bridges
over the railroad and the Sudbury River. There are a variety of structures ranging from simple to
complex.
Staging of the work is critical. Maintaining the movements between these two interstates while replacing
the entire complex requires careful planning and execution. There are four major stages and one sub-
stage.
MassDOT and their consultants and contractors are working closely with DEP on all the Environmental
Issues. Such a large construction project happening in and around a significant wetland creates many
concerns. As of this writing, the entire team is working well together to accomplish this task with as
little disruption as possible.
There are environmental benefits included in the contract as well. Control of invasive plant species was
one of the early activities undertaken.
3

Preliminary Design
The preliminary design scope by HNTB is complete except Construction Phase Services and assisting
MassDOT with review of the final designs including:
• Permitting and environmental engineering.
• Structural engineering, civil engineering, electrical engineering, bridge architecture, utility
engineering.
• Review plans and specifications.
• Review structural details.
Completed scope:
• Develop procurement documents for Design-Build process.
• Assist in procurement.
Construction (Design – Build)
The BHD-O&G-Aetna JV (BHD JV) team was procured using the Design-Build process. They are teamed
with the design firm VHB. The work to be performed by BHD JV and their designers under this contract
involves the final design and construction of the entire I-90/I-495 interchange. This scope includes:
• Advance the design from preliminary design through completion of final design – i.e., become
the designer of record for all elements.
• Maintain traffic in accordance with traffic management plans.
• Design and Construction of 12 new bridge structures.
• New ramps for all eight moves in the interchange.
• Relocate or reconstruct existing utilities.
• Install new roadways with lighting, poles, and signage.
4

Major Progress as of December 1, 2024
• The Project has nearly completed transition from Traffic Stage 1 to Traffic Stage 2. It is worth
noting that changing from stage to stage is an iterative process as movements are required at
different locations and different times.
• Baseline schedule continues to be updated monthly followed by review meetings with the
parties.
• Major work in the 495 median including earthwork and bridges have now allowed 495
Southbound traffic to be shifted onto what was the median. Demolition of the old Southbound
bridges is complete and the new substructures for 495 over the RR and 495 over I-90 are
underway. Columns and abutments are taking shape.
• Fruit Street bridge is past the halfway point with traffic running on the new structure. Traffic is
managed in both directions using a single lane with signal control. The north side has been
demolished and the center piers constructed. The abutment and wingwall foundations are being
placed.
• Ramp WN has encountered major changes with subsurface conditions. This area was well into
the wetland and therefor not very accessible for borings in preliminary design. This issue had
held up work for a time to allow a redesign. The ramp is now taking shape with the concrete
piers and abutments complete and steel erection to begin in early 2025.
• Ramp ES was the first of the new Ramps to open to the public (November 2024).
• I-90 over the RR is progressing at the east and west abutments.
• Design for Stages 3, 3B and 4 have been submitted and are in review. Design of most ramps is
complete, and the remaining packages are scheduled to be submitted before Spring.
• Whitehall Brook is also underway with demolition of the existing culvert on the south side of
the highway.
• Column and abutment work continues as available on Ramps WS and EN.

*These forecasts are based on BHD JV’s latest Baseline Schedule
Areas of Concern
The Design/Builder’s design phase is nearing completion but did not meet the baseline schedule
assumptions. Coupled with the field work to date has impacted the completion milestones. Also, much
of the float in the original schedule has been used up. This is one of the largest contracts MassDOT has
managed. Currently, the entire team is working fairly well together. There has also been a couple of
issues that appear to be Differing Site Conditions (DSCs). MassDOT, their Owner’s Engineer (HNTB),
the Engineer of Record or EOR (VHB) and the Contractor all have experienced and capable leaders.
There is active communication with the abutters, businesses, municipalities, and legislators potentially
impacted by the work. Environmental Agencies have also actively participated in the planning, design
and construction oversight.

III CHAPTER 303 OF THE ACTS OF 2008 AREAS OF INTEREST
Peer Review
During the final design/construction phase of this project, this O.R. is satisfying the peer review
obligations by attending regular project review meetings where construction issues, conflicts, and
resolutions are discussed; walking the site to observe major construction activities; and participating in
the change order process to review and concur with any proposed design changes and their impacts to
the project’s quality, budget, or schedule goals. In addition, this O.R. also participates in the review
process of the design submitted by the Design-Builder.
Value Engineering
MassDOT selected the Design-Build procurement method to gain efficiency in both cost and
schedule. This method of procurement ensures Value Engineering principles are being constantly applied
to the Project without the need for an independent report. An example would be the Contractor’s Proposal
which reduced the number of weekend closures to six from the allotted eight. By staying informed on
the design progress and changes, the OR is able to participate in the informal VE process.
Cost Recovery
No cost recovery issues have been identified. This contract is just getting underway. The only
issue of note related to coating requirements for steel members on some of the bridges. This was not a
design issue but a preference by the Commonwealth for a more robust system than specified.

Owner’s Representative Contract Number: 120635
Project Number: 606226
Construction Contract Number: N/A
I EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Built between the 1950’s and 1970’s, Rutherford Avenue, designated as Route 99 within
the project area, has a surburban highway character that is inconsistent with Charlestown’s
urban and historic character. It is classified as an Urban Principal Arterial under City of
Boston jurisdiction and is a critical connection between Boston, Charlestown, Everett and
points north. Due to the roadways regional importance, the Boston Metropolitan Planning
Organization (MPO) has prioritized this project and has allocated State Transportation
Improvement Program (TIP) funding.
To ensure the safety of this critical connection, the City of Boston has retained Tetra Tech
to provide engineering services required to prepare construction documents to reconstruct
and reconfigure Rutherford Avenue to a state of good repair. MassDOT is responsible for
project advertisement, administering Federal funds associated with the project, and
construction oversight.
Working with the City of Charlestown, abutting residents, roadway users, and other
stakeholders, the team will design a plan for construction that minimizes and mitigates
temporary construction impacts. The project team will be performing a full suite of public
outreach and community engagement, environmental justice analysis, structural and survey
analysis, and both internal and interagency coordination, to mitigate impacts associated with
the project. To date, approximately 20 public meetings have been held in addition to other
smaller meetings with the MBTA, Bunker Hill Community College, Schrafft’s Center,
Lower Mystic Regional Working Group, Mishawum Park residents, Rutherford Corridor
Coalition, Climate Ready Boston, and Friends of City Square Park.
A formal public hearing for the proposed Rutherford Avenue Reconstruction project will be
held by MassDOT following acceptance of the 25% design package. The project will also
continue to coordinate with the city’s PIC commission, Parks Department, and the BPDA
for additional public meetings and to further discussions on design development.

Project Name: Reconstruction of Rutherford Ave from City Square to Sullivan Square - Boston
Owner’s Representative Contract Number: 120635
Project Number: 606226
Construction Contract Number: N/A
The project proposes to “right‐size” the road with a road diet to achieve a safer environment
for all users with new non‐motorized options and a linear greenway to buffer the
neighborhood. It includes reconstruction and reconfiguration of the Rutherford Avenue and
Alford Street corridor between the Chelsea Street intersection at City Square and the bridge
over the Mystic River, and also includes reconstruction and reconfiguration of the street
grid at and approaching Sullivan Square from Rutherford Avenue, Main Street and Maffa
Way, as well as implementation of a center running Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) system.
Project goals include:
 Improve pedestrian connections and safety between MBTA Transit Stations and
the community
 Decrease traffic congestion
 Protect Main Street from cut-through traffic
 Create public/open space
 Provide opportunities for appropriate transit-oriented development
 Provide separated bicycle connections and improved pedestrian connections
 Increase on-street parking
 Remove Sullivan Square traffic circle and convert to a grid system to provide
for better and safer traffic flow
 Bring structural elements to state of good repair
As of November 30, 2024, Tetra Tech has commenced 25% design and anticipates issuance
of the 25% design package to MassDOT in December 2025. The current total project cost
is estimated to be approximately $177.8M, however, this value is subject to change as design
progresses. The City of Boston is targeting an advertisement date of May 2029 with
construction anticipated to commence in October 2029.

II ANNUAL REPORT
Contract Scope of Work
The work under this Contract includes the reconstruction of existing intersections and the
creation of new intersections within the following limits as follows:
 Rutherford Avenue – extending from the Alford Street Bridge over the Mystic River
to the North Washington Street Bridge over the Charles River, a distance of
approximately 7,000 feet, including 10 proposed intersections, 8 of which are
signalized.
 Arlington Avenue – extending from Rutherford Avenue to Dorrance Street, a
distance of approximately 500 feet.
 West Street – Extending from Dorrance Street to Alford Street, a distance of
approximately 500 feet.
 Main Street/Mystic Avenue – extending from Rutherford Avenue to the existing
viaduct, a distance of approximately 1,500 feet including 2 proposed intersections,
1 of which is signalized.
 Maffa Way – extending from Rutherford Avenue to the existing viaduct, a distance
of approximately 1,500 feet including 2 proposed intersections, all of which are
signalized.
 Cambridge Street – extending from a match with existing Cambridge Street at Spice
Street, a distance of approximately 300 feet including 1 signalized intersection.
 Beacham Street – extending from West Street to Cambridge Street, a distance of
approximately 900 feet.
 Alford Street – extending from Alford Street Bridge to Cambridge Street, a distance
of approximately 1,500 feet, including 2 proposed signalized intersections.
 Mishawum Street – extending from Bunker Hill Street to Rutherford Avenue, a
distance of approximately 100 feet.

 Main Street – extending from Rutherford Avenue to Bunker Hill Street, a distance
of approximately 900 feet.
 Austin Street/Gilmore Bridge – extending 200 feet including signalized intersection
at Rutherford Avenue.
 Bunker Hill Street – extending 150 feet to Main Street.
The draft concept design, which depicts the Rutherford Avenue corridor within project
limits to be entirely at-grade, includes shared bicycle facilities with two-way directional
operation, handicap accessible sidewalks, new signalized intersections, and dedicated center
lane bus lanes.
Sullivan Square is comprised of a rotary having five vehicular connections, including Alford
Street, Main Street, Maffa Way, Cambridge Street, and Rutherford Ave. The rotary, which
is functionally obsolete and unsafe, and rotary approaches will be removed and replaced
with a signalized street grid between Rutherford Ave and the Maffa Way and Mystic Ave
bridges over the MBTA. The new street grid shifts the positions of some existing street
segments into current non-street locations, enabling some construction to proceed without
adverse traffic impacts. Main Street, from Charlestown at the Schrafft’s Center, will be
realigned directly across the rotary to Main Street as it transitions to Mystic Avenue into
Somerville. The Sullivan Square MBTA Station abuts the project to the west and is not
directly affected by construction, but adjacent parking, access and bus routing to/from the
station will be affected and must be coordinated with the MBTA and City of Boston.
The future traffic condition in Sullivan Square will continue to be challenging, however the
removal of the old rotary and implementation of a normalized street network, dedicated bus
lanes, pedestrian & bicycle facilities, adaptive signals with transit signal priority, and linear
park space will allow Charlestown residents more choices for transportation. Breaking the
center median along Rutherford Avenue and creating new signalized intersections will also
allow for better access to businesses without the circuitous movements and U-turns

necessary today. Additionally, new signals will allow pedestrian travel directly from the
neighborhood to the west side of the town, including the Bunker Hill Community College.
Major Progress As of November 30, 2024
The project is being procured as a traditional design-bid-build project on which the plans,
specifications and estimates are prepared prior to the project being advertised for
construction. The City of Boston has retained Tetra Tech to provide engineering services
required to prepare construction documents for the roadway reconstruction. MassDOT is
responsible for project advertisement, administering Federal funds associated with the
project and construction oversight.
As of November 30, 2024,the designer of record, Tetra Tech, received Notice to Proceed
from the City of Boston to commence efforts associated with 25% design. Additionally,
Tetra Tech will prepare and expanded ENF, single EIR for MEPA, Functional Design
Report, Design Justification Workbook, and perform an Intersection Control Evaluation. It
is anticipated that a 25% package will be issued to MassDOT within 12 months with a 25%
Design Public Hearing to follow in the summer of 2026.
Budget
The original preliminary 25% cost estimate prepared by Tetra Tech, dated October 2, 2020,
indicated a total project value of $151,879,061.28. It is expected that overall construction
cost will be modified as a result of the new 25% design. A summary of project cost follows:

It is this OR’s understanding that although the project has been delayed, the Boston MPO
still plans to fully fund the Rutherford Avenue project in future funding programs and that
the project has been moved forward for a start in funding in Federal Fiscal Year 2024. The
Rutherford Avenue project was originally programmed to be funded in the 2021-2025 MPO
Plan. However, the Boston MPO postponed funding because the project was still not ready
to advertise. As such, the project has moved into FFYs 2024-2029 and the MPO anticipates
fully funding the project with the final year being 2029. It is anticipated that although the
current TIP doesn’t cover all funding years, the MPO still expects to fund the project. Based
upon the recent project schedule it appears as though funding may be required through FFY
2029.
Schedule/ Project Milestones
The project is not yet under construction, however, the current anticipated project
construction duration is 48 months (4 years).
A conceptual CTD is required at the 25% Design submission and on September 20, 2020,
Tetra Tech issued the 25% Contract Time Determination (CTD) Schedule and Narrative to
MassDOT. The conceptual CTD was created for initial budgeting and planning purposes

Construction Contract Number: N/A
only as the CTD will be more fully developed and refined as part of the 75% design
submission. It is anticipated that the 75% CTD will be issued in early 2028.
MassDOT will be responsible for construction oversight throughout the entire duration of
construction.
Areas and Issues of Concern
The following key issues have been identified due to their potential risk to adversely affect
the project:
 Bunker Hill Community College has indicated that they would like the
Pedestrian Bridge removed in its entirety. Removal has been accepted as part of
the Value Engineering study
 Sullivan Square Underpass is in state of disrepair and has experienced serious
deterioration. The City of Boston has expressed safety concerns with the
underpass.
 Coordination with MBTA busing and relocation of an MBTA building
 Solidify Resiliency for Main Street to limit impacts to the following: Massport
Railroad; working with the Boston Planning and Development Agency (BPDA)
for the private development proposal; Federal funding for the seawall; and
Coordination with the Parks Department to finalize the master plan for Ryan
Playground
 Finalizing Right of Way acquisitions and agreements
 Coordination and timing of installation of new Eversource transmission line
adjacent to Sullivan Square (by others)
 Coordination of utilities including BWSC, National Grid, Eversource and
MWRA

 Coordination with adjacent projects to avoid potential TMP conflicts, including
the North Washington Street Bridge Replacement Project and the Maffa Way
and Mystic Avenue Superstructure Replacement Project, both currently under
construction. The North Washington Street Bridge over Boston Inner Harbor,
located at the southerly project limit, is scheduled for completion in mid 2025,
while the Maffa Way/Mystic Avenue project is scheduled for completion in
December 2026. These projects will potentially have vehicular travel impacts
into the Rutherford Avenue project, affectively regulating the volume of traffic
that will be able to enter the proposed work area.
 Achieving a project advertising date
 FHWA funding
The aforementioned issues will be monitored throughout the design phase to mitigate
potential impacts to project cost and construction schedule.
In addition to the aforementioned issues, MassDOT initiated a Value Engineering (VE)
Study (previously referenced) whereas one of the objectives was to identify project risks. A
Risk register was subsequently developed to identify and categorize the potential impacts
of these risks to the project. The Risk register, as contained within the VE study, is shown
below:

Peer Review
In September 2019, as part of the 25% Peer review effort, several independent assessments
and evaluations were performed by Alfred Benesch & Company with respect to highway
design, structural design, and civil/traffic engineering, respectively.
During the construction phase of this project, this Owner’s Representative (O.R.) will
satisfy peer review obligations by attending regular project review meetings where
construction issues, conflicts, and resolutions are discussed; walking the site to observe
major construction activities; and participating in the change order process, to review and

comment upon any proposed design changes and their impacts to the project’s quality,
budget, or schedule goals.
Value Engineering
August 2021, Massachusetts Department of Transportation, Highway Division (MassDOT)
initiated a Value Engineering (VE) study in order to accomplish the project's goals in the
most expeditious and cost effective manner. The objective of the study was to identify
opportunities and to recommend alternatives that improve value in terms of capital cost
reductions, improved constructability and product enhancement while providing the basic
functional requirements to meet the Project intent. VHB, in association with Keville
Enterprises and Kittelson & Associates, conducted the VE study from August 9, 2021
through August 13, 2021.
The VE Team was given the task of studying a practical and workable design alternative
and providing an independent review in order to identify recommendations that would
potentially reduce the project costs or otherwise add value while maintaining the function,
performance, and quality of the original design.
On August 9, 2021, Tetra Tech and the City of Boston presented an overview of the project’s
design progress, at the time of the study, as well as project constraints, history, issues, goals,
and objectives. The VE Study results and recommendations were then presented by VHB
to MassDOT, FHWA, Tetra Tech, and the City of Boston on August 13, 2021.
The VE Team generated 43 initial ideas during the Creative Ideas phase of this study, with
consideration to the project constraints identified by MassDOT and Tetra Tech. The ideas
were then evaluated based on the following criteria: Initial Cost; Operation and Maintenance
(O&M) and Life Cycle Cost (LCC); Local Connectivity; Permanent Traffic Operations;
Improves Safety; Constructability; Development Potential; and Right of Way Impacts. The
object of the evaluation was to identify ideas with the most promise to achieve savings while
12

Construction Contract Number: N/A
preserving functions or improving operations and safety. In general, the idea evaluation
considered the constraints identified by the design team, the economic impact, other benefits
obtained, and the acceptability/effort of necessary redesign.
After evaluation of the 43 initial ideas, 13 ideas received the minimum score or greater and
were recommended by the VE team at the mid-point meeting. These 13 ideas were
presented and discussed and ultimately 6 of them were selected by MassDOT for
development.
While these 6 ideas were developed for recommendation, the VE team concluded that some
of the other ideas could potentially benefit the project design, however, were not feasible
for further development during the VE Study or did not have enough time or sufficient data
to fully develop the idea. Consequently, these ideas were selected as Design Suggestions
(DS). The 21 design suggestions have no easily quantifiable cost implications, however,
remain noteworthy to the results of the VE study. Some of the design suggestion ideas
represent changes in design approach, re-consideration of criteria, and in some cases,
modification of the project scope. Some of these design suggestions can also be developed
in conjunction with various ideas in order to further enhance the recommendations.
The following table presents a summary of the ideas developed into VE recommendations
and Design Suggestions, with cost implications identified where applicable. Since cost is
important for comparison of alternatives, the costs presented in the VE Study are based upon
the 25% design cost estimate and as revised by the VE Team. Where proposed alternate
designs included items not in the original estimate, costs from similar MassDOT projects,
published cost estimating databases, and VE team members’ experience were used. The
recommendations in the following table indicate the anticipated initial cost savings of the
proposed recommendations. Acceptance of these recommendations would improve the
value of the project, as shown below.

As of November 30, 2024, implementation of any of the ideas identified in the VE study are
on hold pending development and approval of revised 25% concept plans, however, the
status of open ideas is as follows:
 Idea No. 1 – Eliminate the BHCC Pedestrian Bridge, has been accepted

Project Name: Route 20 Corridor Improvements, Charlton-Oxford
Owner’s Representative Contract Number: 120632
Project Number: 602659
Construction Contract Number: 117832
I. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
This project consists of improvements to the Route 20 Corridor in the Towns of Charlton and
Oxford from the intersection of Route 20 with Richardson’s Corner in Charlton to the
intersection of Route 20 with Route 12 in the Town of Oxford. The project includes safety
improvements to approximately 3.2 miles of Route 20, and includes the replacement of the
bridges which carry Route 20 over the Little River in Charlton and the French River in Oxford.
Safety improvements include the construction of a center median to separate east and westbound
traffic, widening to allow for greater shoulder widths and turning lanes at intersections, traffic
signal reconstruction, traffic calming, pedestrian and bicycle accommodations and additional
roadside clearing to remove obstructions and allow for the creation of emergency pull off areas
for police enforcement and vehicle refuge. A locus map of the study area is shown in Figure 1.
This project is being constructed by the Massachusetts Department of Transportation
(MassDOT) - Highway Division with HDR Engineering, Inc. as the Preliminary Designer of
Record. The project was procured as a Design-Build Contract with Technical Proposals
reviewed in August 2022 and Price Proposals opened August 31, 2022 with the apparent Best
Value being the Design-Build Team of D W White Construction of Acushnet, MA as the Prime
Contractor and TranSystems Corporation as Design-Build Designer of Record. Notice to Proceed
was issued to D W White on November 17, 2022. Work on the project has progressed through
the design phase to 100% Highway Design and Final Bridge Design for the Little River and
French River Bridges. Construction has advanced through the culvert and bridge construction
along with all of the walls which contain the roadway embankment. Roadway work is in the final
stage with median barrier being installed through the corridor and traffic restored to four lanes of
travel through the winter season. When construction work resumes in 2025, the median barrier
will be completed along with the Roundabout at Oxbow Road and traffic signals to be installed.
The primary purpose of this project is to make safety improvements to the Route 20 Roadway
within the project limits along with upgrading the roadway infrastructure and making
environmental improvements to the resources located adjacent to the project. The intersection of
Route 20 with Route 56 is a high crash location, in the top 5% of intersections and the corridor
has a crash rate above the state average for roadways of this type in the state with 46% of these
crashes being sideswipe, head on and single vehicle type which can typically be attributed to
high travel speeds, narrow lane and shoulder widths, lack of separation between the east and
westbound traffic and geometric deficiencies. Furthermore, there are no reasonable pedestrian or
bicycle accommodations within the project limits which severely limits the mobility of any use
of the corridor by any means other than a motor vehicle.

Owner’s Representative Contract Number: 120632
Project Number: 602659
Construction Contract Number: 117832
In order to address these safety and mobility concerns, the following improvements are proposed
with this project:
• Traffic signal replacement and lane arrangements at the intersection of Route 20 and
Route 56 specifically intended to address the safety concerns identified at the Road
Safety Audit held in October 2014, report dated January 2015.
• Construction of a raised median or concrete barrier to separate the east and westbound
directions of travel.
• Widening of the lanes and shoulders to allow for sufficient space between vehicles,
drainage of the travel way and left turn lanes at the intersections.
• Improvements to the roadway horizontal and vertical alignment to provide greater sight
distance and ability to remain in the travel lanes.
• Widening of Route 20 to provide a clear zone free from hazardous obstacles, emergency
pull off areas and police parking enforcement areas to help control travel speeds.
• Installation of speed mitigation measures to assist in traffic calming.
• Construction of sidewalks and bicycle accommodations where feasible.
• Installation of guard rail in accordance with current requirements.

II. ANNUAL REPORT
Contract Scope of Work
Proposed improvements include:
• Reconstruction of the Route 20 corridor from the intersection of Route 20 with
Richardson’s Corner to the intersection of Route 20 with Route 12. Roadway
reconstruction will be a combination of mill and overlay of the existing roadway with box
widening. Full depth roadway reconstruction is proposed in areas where it is intended to
correct the roadway cross slope to match the horizontal radius.
• Construction of a concrete barrier or median to separate the east and westbound travel
ways on Route 20. A Minimum 2 foot left shoulder is proposed throughout the length of
the project to provide separation of the roadway from the barrier.
• Installation of new fully actuated traffic signals at the intersection of Route 20 with Route
56 and for Route 20 at Richardson Corner Road/Oxbow Road. Both locations have
existing signals which are intended for replacement. The intersection of Route 20 with
Route 56 is a high accident location and improvements are intended to address very
specific safety concerns raised during the Road Safety Audit held in October of 2014.
Improvements at the Route 56 intersection will also include fully accessible
improvements to facilitate pedestrian movements in accordance with the requirement of
the Americans with Disabilities Act.
• Reconstruction of the Route 20 roadway will provide the opportunity to flatten the
horizontal and vertical curvature to allow for the increasing of the available sight distance
along the roadway. This will improve driver reaction time to consider avoidance
maneuvers and avoid collisions with other vehicles as well as potential objects and
pedestrians within the travel way.
• The Route 20 roadway is to be reconstructed with wider lane and shoulder widths to
better allow for safe vehicular travel at the desired travel speeds. The increased roadway
width is intended to allow for turning lanes at the signalized intersections with adequate
left turn storage based upon updated traffic count information.

Project Name: Route 20 Corridor Improvements, Charlton-Oxford
Owner’s Representative Contract Number: 120632
Project Number: 602659
Construction Contract Number: 117832
• The reconstruction is also intended to include speed mitigation measures to help prevent
excessive speeding. This would include the construction of areas along the roadway
where police can be posted and maintain a presence which will assist in the enforcement
of speeds through the corridor. The project is also proposing speed feedback signage to
raise driver awareness of excessive speeds. Advisory signage with speed reductions will
be proposed in areas with roadway curvature or other potential features which require
extra attention or speed reduction.
• Additional safety improvements will include the construction of new pedestrian and
bicycle accommodations. The roadway within the project limits is constricted by the
presence of wetland resource areas on either side of the road however an eight foot wide
shared use path is proposed on the north side of Route 20 from the easterly intersection of
the Oxbow Road with Route 20 to the easterly project limit of Route 20 with Route 12.
• Reconstruction will also include the creation of a roadside clear zone free of roadside
hazards and to allow errant vehicles to recover and reenter the roadway. In areas where
the roadside is restricted, guard rail will be proposed to redirect vehicles back toward the
roadway and away from the non recoverable slope
• The full replacement of the two bridges carrying Route 20 traffic over the Little River (C-
06-023) and French River (O-06-002). The new structures will include full substructure
and superstructure replacements consistent with the cross section of the approach
roadways and compliant with environmental permitting and flood zones. The structures
will meet current statutory loading requirements as well as seismic requirements and all
applicable bridge design criteria.
• Extensive Stormwater Control Measures (SCM) are proposed throughout the corridor as
required under the project permitting and as required by the state Stormwater
Management Handbook prepared by the Massachusetts Department of Environmental
Protection. The closed drainage system will be designed to provide greater resiliency to
heavy storm events based upon current rainfall data and allow for better maintenance of
the system as well as provide safety improvements by limiting roadway gutter spreads
and water quality improvements by including measures to capture and treat stormwater
through infiltration or through managed wetlands.

Areas of Concern
The following represents the primary areas of concern identified in design and at this stage in
construction:
• Environmental Permitting: The project takes place within environmentally sensitive areas
and continued coordination through final design and construction will need to respect
these areas as well as permit conditions obtained in the preliminary design phase and
amended conditions obtained in concert with final design. This remains a concern as
project work draws towards completion.

Project Number: 602659
Construction Contract Number: 117832
• A future development on the north side of Route 20 is under consideration and Aquarion
Water (the Town of Oxford’s Water service agent) has indicated to the Design Builder
that there is a potential 1,100 feet of water main, east of the French River Bridge to
service this development. The Design-Builder has reached an agreement with Aquarion
to install the additional water main with work taking place without interfering with the
project milestones.
• Travel speeds along the corridor are a safety concern for both the contractor and the
motoring public. A proposed Work Zone Speed Limit regulation was requested and
signed by the State Traffic Engineer. A reduction in the regulatory speed of 5 MPH was
granted as a static work zone speed limit for the entire length of the project, and an
additional 5 MPH reduction granted as a dynamic work zone speed limit to be in effect
only in the area where active work is taking place.

III. CHAPTER 303 OF THE ACTS OF 2008 AREAS OF INTEREST
Peer Review
A peer review was not performed prior to Design Build Procurement.
Value Engineering
A Value Engineering (VE) Study of the project design concept was conducted by The Jacobs
Engineering Group in September of 2020 with thirty-eight (38) proposed alternatives with
benefits in the form of safety, operations, environmental, construction and represented either
design suggestions and/or cost savings alternatives. Of the 38 proposals, six were accepted,
twenty-two were conditionally accepted and twelve were rejected. The Base Technical Concept
and procurement documents have accounted for these in the preliminary design development.
Cost Recovery
At this point in time, no issues have been specifically identified as Cost Recovery issues.
Extra Work Orders
As of November 30, 2024, there are three approved extra work orders:
1. Additional culvert replacement to be performed in the Town of Sturbridge. This had been

Project Name: Lynn-Saugus Bridge Replacement – Route 107 over Saugus River
Owner’s Representative Contract Number: 120632
MassDOT Project Number: 604952
Construction Contract Number: 109691
I. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The Belden G. Bly Bridge is a bascule bridge carrying Route 107 over the Saugus River between the Town
of Saugus and the City of Lynn. It was originally constructed in 1912 to replace a timber bridge at the same
location. A temporary bridge incorporating a moveable span was put into service in November 2013
immediately adjacent and to the east of the existing bridge, and the original bascule span removed, all under
earlier, separate design and construction contracts. A new, heel-trunnion single span drawbridge is now
under construction in the original roadway alignment.
On November 24, 2020 a construction contract in the amount of $87,523,965 was awarded to SPS New
England, Inc., followed by a Notice to Proceed on December 1, 2020. During the first year of construction
(2021) the remaining existing superstructure and substructure elements were removed, cofferdams
installed, and work begun at both abutments. Abutment construction progressed as planned at the southern,
Saugus abutment, however on the northern Lynn side, relocation of the electrical service connection to the
temporary bridge by NGRID under a Work Order with the Contractor took longer than planned, in turn
delaying completion of the cofferdams and the abutment demolition. By the end of the year the project
schedule showed 154 calendar days of negative float on the completion milestones. During year two of the
construction (2022) abutments and wingwalls at both abutments were completed and on the Saugus side,
the Rest Pier trestle, the five drilled shafts and the pier cap of the Rest Pier were installed. On the Lynn
side the Bascule Pier trestle was installed and at the end of the year installation of the sixteen Bascule Pier
drilled shafts was set to begin. The year ended with the project schedule showing 114 days of negative float.
In year three (2023), installation of the Bascule Pier drilled shafts completed in March, followed by
construction of the pier itself and installation of the segmental and heel trunnion bearings, all of which were
complete by late July. Tower construction began in August with erection of the four tower columns and
installation of the two segmental gears completing in November. Construction of the control house
advanced in tandem with tower erection and by the end of the year the four transverse trusses tying the two
towers together were installed, the control house was framed, largely enclosed with rough mechanical and
electrical systems in place, and the machine room floor beams were installed. In year four (2024), the
channel was closed on February 1 followed by installation of the two bascule girders, the bascule span floor
beams and stringers in February, the grid deck in March, lightweight deck concrete in April and LMC
overlay in late April. Construction of Span 1 advanced in parallel with the bascule span, with precast box
beams installed in January, SIP forms in February, and reinforcing steel and deck pour in late March. Also
in March the two counterweight girders were installed followed by the counterweight boxes in March and
April and placement of counterweight concrete in early May. Installation of the operating machinery and
of core electrical systems was ongoing throughout the spring. A major project milestone was achieved on

May 13 when the bascule span was lifted into the vertical position for the first time and the channel re-
opened to marine traffic. Power required to lift the moveable span continues to be provided by an
emergency generator as procurement of the transformer by NGRID has been delayed. After the initial
opening, work on the Control House, the Machine Room, the towers and the bascule span continued through
the spring, summer and fall. In October the Bascule Pier access trestle was removed and in November the
cofferdam “island” supporting the access trestle was removed. Reconstruction of the Ballard Street
intersection began in October and is ongoing. Currently, installation of the MWRA waterline across the
channel is slated for mid-January 2025, with a full closure in place; placement of the Span 3 box girders
from the Lynn abutment to the Bascule Pier is also planned for mid-January.
To date a total of eleven Extra Work Orders have been approved for a total of $2,634,565. Three EWOs
were approved in 2024 with a total value of $114,284. The most significant to date was EWO #3, approved
in June 2022 in the amount of $1,913,312, for the removal of approximately 4,000 CY of stockpiled spoils
material found to be co-mingled with asbestos. The most significant materials price adjustment has
occurred to item 999.4490, “Structural Steel – Positive”, totaling $4,261,606 to date. At present, between
approved and pending EWOs, materials price adjustments, overruns/underruns, and contract quantities
remaining to be invoiced, $97,492,168 of the $99,282,339 Project Encumbrance (98%) has been committed
and $1,790,171 is projected to remain at project completion (20% of the original contingency amount).
Eighty-nine percent (89%) of the current contract total ($86,596,607 of $96,919,273) has been invoiced
while, as of December 1, seventy-one percent (71%) of the contractual construction duration (1461 of 2045
calendar days) has elapsed.
II. ANNUAL REPORT
Contract Scope of Work
This project replaces the temporary bridge with a heel-trunnion single-leaf bascule span. All structural,
mechanical, electrical, power and communications systems components are being replaced in the alignment
of the original bridge. The navigable channel has been increased from 40’ to 50’ in width. The four fixed
approach spans of the original bridge are being replaced by one span to each side of the moveable span,
and both approach roadways and the bridge are being reconstructed to accommodate two 11’ travel lanes
in each direction, two 6’ bicycle lanes, and two 6.5’ sidewalks. On Route 107 the southern project limit is
about 1000’ to the south of the reconstructed signalized Ballard Street intersection, and the northern limit
approximately 700’ to the north of the Lynn abutment, for an overall length along Route 107 of
approximately 2400’. In addition, about 700’ of Ballard Street will be reconstructed. Removal of the
temporary bridge is included in the contract scope.

Major Progress as of December 1, 2024
During the first year of construction (2021) the remaining existing superstructure and substructure elements
were removed, cofferdams installed, and work begun at both abutments. Abutment construction progressed
as planned at the southern, Saugus abutment however on the northern, Lynn side relocation of the electrical
service connection to the temporary bridge by NGRID under a Work Order with the Contractor took longer
than planned, in turn delaying completion of the cofferdams and the abutment demolition. By the end of
the year the project schedule showed 154 calendar days of negative float on the completion milestones.
During year two (2022) abutments and wingwalls at both abutments were completed and on the Saugus
side, the Rest Pier trestle, the five drilled shafts and the pier cap of the Rest Pier were installed. On the
Lynn side the Bascule Pier access trestle was installed and at the end of the year preparations for the
installation of the sixteen Bascule Pier drilled shafts was underway. The year ended with the project
schedule showing 114 days of negative float. In year three (2023), the Bascule Pier drilled shaft installation
completed in March followed by construction of the pier itself and installation of the segmental gear and
the heel trunnion bearings, all of which were complete by late July. In August tower construction
commenced with erection of the four tower columns completing in September, installation of the two
segmental gears completing in November, and installation of the four transverse trusses completing in
December. Construction of the Control House advanced in tandem with tower erection and the structural
steel frame, concrete floors, walls and rough mechanical and electrical systems completed. The electrical

and communication cables required for bridge operations were installed in a trench under the navigable
channel from the Rest Pier to the Bascule Pier, and the dredging operations required to widen the navigable
channel from 40 feet to 50 feet completed.
2024 (year four) has been an active year. The channel was closed on February 1 followed immediately by
installation of the two bascule girders, the bascule span floor beams and stringers, the grid deck in March,
lightweight deck concrete in April, and LMC overlay in late April. Construction of Span 1 advanced in
parallel with the bascule span, with precast box beams installed in January, SIP forms in February, and
reinforcing steel and concrete deck in late March. Also in March the two counterweight girders were
installed followed by the steel counterweight boxes in March and April and placement of counterweight
concrete in early May. Installation of the moveable span operating machinery and of the core electrical
systems was ongoing throughout the spring, and a major project milestone was achieved on May 13 when
the span was lifted into the vertical position for the first time, re-opening the channel to marine traffic.
Since the initial opening, power required to lift the span has been provided by an emergency generator as
procurement of the permanent transformer by NGRID continues to be delayed. Work on the Control House,
the Machine Room, the towers and the bascule span continued through the spring, summer and fall. In
October the bascule pier access trestle was removed and in November the cofferdam “island” supporting
the access trestle was removed. Reconstruction of the Ballard Street intersection began in October and is
ongoing. Currently, installation of the MWRA waterline across the channel is slated to begin in mid-January
with a full closure; placement of the Span 3 box girders from the Lynn abutment to the Bascule Pier is also
planned for mid-January.

Schedule/ Project Milestones
In August, 2023 the Contractor submitted a Time Entitlement Analysis (TEA) requesting a total of 141
calendar days due to third-party delay by NGRID and obstructions encountered in the driving of the north
abutment foundation piles. However, in Update #35 (data date December 1, 2023), extensive logic changes
were carried out on the network with previously sequential activities modified to take place serially, and
the negative float was eliminated; the August TEA claim for additional contract time became moot. In the
most recent schedule update (Update #46, as of November 1, 2024), MS-02, the forecasted CFC milestone

continues to be shown as occurring on March 16, 2026, the contractual completion date and MS-01,
Completion of Stage 4 Operational Support, also continues to be shown on the contractual completion date,
March 16, 2027. Throughout 2024 the schedule has shown an on-time completion with zero float on the
milestones.
Areas and Issues of Concern
At this time we have no major issues of concern. The wingwalls and retaining wall associated with the
north, Lynn-side abutment will be constructed in 2025, and as experienced previously on several occasions,
subsurface obstructions may be encountered during installation of the foundation piles which result in extra
work. Similarly, excavation for the footings for these walls may uncover ACM or other hazardous materials
requiring remediation, which again could result in an item overrun or an EWO. EWO requests are expected
for asbestos abatement associated with the removal of a ductbank adjacent to the southeast retaining wall
footing and for obstructions encountered while installing foundation piles for the southeast retaining wall.
While there is both schedule and financial risk associated with these activities, none are a source of
particular concern at this time. The remaining major construction activities, including the Span 3
construction, removal of the temporary bridge, and the installation of the 20-inch MWRA water main across
the Saugus River, while challenging, are not as complex as the construction of the moveable span and do
not appear, in our opinion, to present exceptional risks.

The peer review requirements for this project were satisfied during the design phase and are continuing
during the construction phase. Presently, the undersigned OR is satisfying the peer review obligations by
attending regular project review meetings where construction issues, conflicts, and resolutions are

discussed; walking the site to observe major construction activities; and participating in the change order
process by reviewing proposed design changes and their impacts to the project quality, budget, or schedule.
Value Engineering
The VE Workshop was conducted by Jacobs Engineering Group and held over a one-week period in
November 2016. A Preliminary VE Report was submitted to the Department in early December 2016 with
thirty-four alternatives identified. Of the thirty-four proposed, eight were accepted, seven conditionally
accepted and nineteen rejected. The revised study report was forwarded to the FHWA in late March 2017;
comments were received and a final revision re-submitted in June, 2017. MassDOT’s VE Coordinator
approved this final version and a final copy of the VE Study Report was forwarded to FHWA on November
10, 2017 for record. There have been no VE initiatives to date by the Contractor.
Cost Recovery
On October 20, 2022 EWO#5 in the amount of $21,375.42 was approved "for shop modifications to the
counterweight trunnion bore hole that were required in order to correct an error in the counterweight girder
camber table, which provided incorrect deflections". The girder was fabricated based on the approved shop
drawings and design documents however the erroneous deflection values given in the plans were significant
enough to impact the center of gravity of the counterweight assembly and it was determined that adjustment
of the two trunnion hub bore locations was the most cost-effective way to address the issue. The District
has indicated that cost recovery will be pursued.
Interferences were encountered during the initial May 13 bridge opening between the moveable span
sidewalk heel joint cover plate and the bascule pier sidewalk and tower, and as a result the span could only
be elevated to 65 degrees, 14 less than the design 78 degrees. The issues were documented in RFI#221,
"Sidewalk Heel Joint Interference with Heel Bearing, Tower and Sidewalk", submitted in late May. The
RFI response, initially responded to in June and updated in November, acknowledged the interferences and
proposed demolishing a section of the movable span concrete at the sidewalk in order to move the armored
joint several inches into the moveable span. A Notice of Change, dated August 13, was received from SPS
and an EWO request is awaited. The District has indicated that cost recovery will be pursued once the EWO
is received.
RFI, #225, "West Pinion Access Platform Interference" was submitted in June 2024 and a response
provided in July. The RFI identified a conflict between the second-floor sunscreens of the Control House
and the west pinion access platform; the response directed the Contractor to modify the sunscreens as

Project Name: Lynn-Saugus Bridge Replacement – Route 107 over Saugus River
Owner’s Representative Contract Number: 120632
MassDOT Project Number: 604952

needed to eliminate the conflict. A Notice of Change was received from SPS on August 5. The work will
be performed by SPS's subcontractor Massey's Plate Glass and Aluminum, and a cost proposal has yet to
be received. The eventual EWO will be considered for cost recovery.
Another potential candidate for cost recovery was identified in June: the extra work required per the
response to RFI #213, “Roadway Expansion Joint at Rest Pier”, and #214, "Grid Deck Heel Joint Elevation
Disparity". Both RFIs were submitted and responded to in March 2024. The RFI #213 response required
that the Contractor adjust the horizontal and vertical position of the roadway expansion joint between the
fixed Span 1 and the moveable Span 2 while the response to RFI #214 required that the Contractor remove
two roadway grid deck panels from the moveable span where it meets the Bascule Pier, shop cut the grid
and grid end plates, re-galvanize and finally reinstall the panels. The work was performed on a time and
materials basis and, based on the Contractor’s argument that the work was performed from approved shop
drawings and in accordance with the plans and specifications, an Extra Work Order request was submitted
in June for $69,454. Additional information was requested and subsequently provided, however, in July the
request was denied on the basis that the extra work resulted from the Contractor’s “mean and methods”.
The Contractor notified the Department of their intent to file a claim and a Step 1 claim meeting was held
on November 25, 2024. In the meeting the Contractor and the Engineer of Record presented their respective
positions to District personnel and the matter has been taken under advisement. Should the Contractor's
claim for additional compensation eventually result in an EWO, there is a possibility that it could become
a candidate for cost recovery.
No other issues have been identified to date as potentially cost recoverable.
An initial identification of a Cost Recovery issue does not necessarily mean that cost recovery is due, as a
formal evaluation process must still be followed. The undersigned Owner’s Representative will continue to
monitor issues and, with MassDOT Highway Division, will discuss the need for referral to the Cost
Recovery Standing Committee. In order to perform the legislative mandate of being the Primary Manager
of Cost Recovery, the OR will follow MassDOT Highway Division’s Cost Recovery Procedure (SOP No.
CSD 25-14-1-000, issued 11/1/22).

Owner’s Representative Contract Number: 120632
Project Number: 605888
Construction Contract Number: 112402
I. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
This project consists of improvements to the interchange of two state highways in southeastern
Massachusetts - Route 24 and Route 140 (Exit 17), located in the City of Taunton. The project
includes improvements to 6,500 linear feet of Route 24, 4,200 linear feet of Route 140 and
improvements to the interchange ramp system that connects the two roadways. Improvements are
also proposed at the nearby Route 140 at Industrial Road intersection to the west, and the Route 140
at Stevens Street interchange. A locus map of the study area is shown in Figure 1. Stantec
Consulting Services, Inc. (Stantec) is the designer of record. The project was advertised for
construction in August of 2020 and bids were opened November 24, 2020 with the low bidder
being Cardi Construction Industries of Warwick Rhode Island. Notice to Proceed was issued to
Cardi on February 17, 2021. Work on the site began in the Spring of 2021 and continued through
the summer of 2023 when Cardi suspended work on the project which effectively ceded the project
to the surety bonded to the project; Everest. On December 5, 2023 MassDOT’s Legal Section
reached an agreement with the surety and, an agreement was reached where Manafort Brothers
Incorporated (MBI), the surety’s replacement contractor will complete the project in accordance
with the terms of the contract. MBI began work on the site in January 2024 and has gradually
ramped up with multiple crews, ratified sub-contractor contracts and made significant progress on
the project in 2024.
The design and construction of this roadway project is being closely coordinated with MassDOT’s
South Coast Rail Project.
The purpose of this project is to address existing and future (2040) safety and operational
deficiencies at the Route 24/Route 140 interchange and the nearby vicinity. Historically, users of
the Route 24/Route 140 interchange have experienced significant vehicular delay, especially for the
movements from Route 24 southbound to Route 140 southbound and from Route 140 northbound to
Route 24 northbound. Future impacts from the South Coast Rail Project and other proposed
developments, such as the Liberty & Union Industrial Park located to the east, are projected to
cause conditions to deteriorate further. Proposed improvements within this project specifically
address impacts from these, and other, planned developments, as well as standard regional growth.
With regards to safety, the existing structure carrying Route 24 over Route 140 is structurally
deficient and does not satisfy vertical clearance requirements. At approximately 1,000 feet in
length, the existing acceleration lane for Route 24 southbound on-ramp traffic from Route 140 is
also substandard. MassDOT has identified an existing Highway Safety Improvement Program
(HSIP) crash cluster at the interchange, an indication that the interchange is in the top 5% of high

accident locations in the Southeastern Regional Planning and Economic Development District
(SRPEDD) region. In 2014, MassDOT initiated a Road Safety Audit (RSA) to identify existing
safety-related issues and target both short and long term solutions to address these issues. The RSA
Team was comprised of personnel from the Taunton Public Works Department, City of Taunton
Police and Fire Departments, the Massachusetts State Police, MassDOT and Stantec. Most of the
recommendations of the RSA are incorporated into the project design.
Improvements proposed as part of this project include:
• New Route 24 Southbound Ramp to Route 140 Northbound/Industrial Drive (Exit 17B);
• Widening of Route 24 to three travel lanes in each travel direction, plus acceleration and
deceleration lanes at interchange ramps;
• Reconstruction of interchange ramps between Routes 24 and 140, including two lane
entrance ramps from Route 140;
• Reconstruction of two bridges along Route 24 (over Route 140 and over the railroad);
• New bypass lane on Route 140 southbound, between the southbound ramps and Stevens
Street;
• Widening of Route 140 to accommodate additional turning lanes and the bypass lane.

II. ANNUAL REPORT
Contract Scope of Work
Please refer to Figure 2 for a graphic depiction of the ramp and wall nomenclature. Proposed
improvements include:
• Widening Route 24 from two to three travel lanes in each travel direction, plus acceleration
and deceleration lanes at interchange ramps. Two bridges are replaced with the widening:
Bridge T-01-047 (over the MBTA Middleborough Secondary line) and Bridge T-01-046
(Route 24 over Route 140). Bridge T-01-045 (over the MBTA South Coast Rail Stoughton
trunk line) will also be replaced. Design of this structure and approach roadways was
performed as part of the South Coast Rail Project and incorporated into this contract given
its proximity and relative timing. The bridge work will include the reconstruction of the
superstructure and substructure and will occur in stages to avoid disruption to traffic.
Widening Route 24 and replacing the bridges eliminates existing substandard design
elements and capacity constraints of mainline highway segments.
• The Route 24 southbound exit ramp at Route 140 (Exit 17) will be split into Exit 17A and
Exit 17B with the construction of a new off-ramp serving Route 140 northbound. This new
off-ramp (Ramp F) will terminate at Route 140 across from Industrial Drive, the access
point to the proposed East Taunton commuter rail station. The existing Route 24
southbound off-ramp serving Route 140 southbound will be reconstructed and extended into
a bypass lane providing continuous and exclusive travel from Route 24 southbound all the
way to the Stevens Street interchange (Route 140 Interchange Exit 19) where this bypass
lane joins mainline Route 140 southbound.
Splitting the Route 24 off-ramp into two ramps allows the Route 140 northbound traffic to
exit “ahead of” the much heavier Route 140 southbound traffic. Route 140 southbound
traffic no longer terminates at the Route 140 intersection causing delays on Route 24, but
bypasses it altogether until Stevens Street. The intersection of Route 140 at the Route 24
southbound entrance ramp will be reconstructed to serve only this movement. This proposed
reconfiguration, in conjunction with the construction of Ramp F (described above) will
allow for the elimination of a traffic signal phase at the ramp terminal at-grade intersection,
as it would no longer be necessary to provide a traffic signal phase for exiting ramp traffic
from Route 24 southbound.

Project Name: Route 24/Route 140 Interchange Improvements, Taunton
Owner’s Representative Contract Number: 120632
Project Number: 605888
Construction Contract Number: 112402
• Reconstruction and reconfiguration of the following ramps, to provide increased capacity
and meet future design requirements:
o Route 24 Southbound Entrance Ramp from Route 140 Southbound (Ramp A)
o Route 24 Northbound Exit Ramp to Route 140 Northbound (Ramp D)
o Route 24 Northbound Entrance Ramp from Route 140 Northbound (Ramp E)
• Widen Route 140 to two through travel lanes in each direction, supplemented by auxiliary
turn lanes, acceleration lanes, deceleration lanes and weaving lanes to or from Route 24 or
Stevens Street. Route 140 will also be widened to accommodate an expanded cross section
that features up to seven lanes between the Route 24 northbound and southbound ramps.
The expanded cross section includes two auxiliary left turn lanes, two northbound lanes, two
southbound lanes and a southbound bypass lane (from Route 24 southbound). The
southbound bypass lane is separated from mainline Route 140 by a cement concrete median
barrier. The widening of Route 140 will include the extension of the existing Cotley River
Culvert (T-01-054) to accommodate the widening.
• The improvements on Route 140 include the full reconstruction of the traffic signals at the
following three intersections: Route 140 at Route 24 southbound off-ramp/Industrial Drive
(designed by Vanasse Hangen Brustlin (VHB) as part of the South Coast Rail Project),
Route 140 at Route 24 southbound on-ramp, and Route 140 at Route 24 northbound on-
ramp.
• Widening the existing Route 140 southbound off-ramp to Stevens Street (Ramp H) to allow
for traffic using the ramp to access County Street and Stevens Street. This reconfiguration is
expected to reduce weaving movements on Route 140 southbound, as it allows through
traffic on Route 140 southbound to access County Street via the Exit 19A ramp. Under
existing conditions, traffic towards those destinations would have had to use the Exit 19B
ramp. The Route 140 southbound off-ramp approach will consist of two 12-foot wide travel
lanes (one dedicated auxiliary right-turn and one shared left/through lane), with 2-foot wide
left and right shoulders. The dedicated auxiliary right turn lane is proposed to be
approximately 400 feet in length. The reconfigured off-ramp is proposed to align directly
across Galleria Mall Drive. As a result of the reconfiguration of the ramp, the traffic signal
system at the intersection is proposed to be reconstructed.

• Ramp F Full Beneficial Use: January 21, 2025 (440 Days Late)
• Full Beneficial Use: May 10, 2028 (440 Days Late)
• Interim Substantial Completion: July 14, 2028 (442 Days Late)
• Substantial Completion: October 6, 2028 (337 Days Late)
• Contractor Field Completion: November 1, 2028 (342 Days Late)
The surety and MBI have produced a new baseline schedule which reflects current project schedule
and impacts to contract milestones.
A Final Time Extension Analysis was submitted on December 5, 2022 and reviewed by the
MassDOT District Schedule Engineer with comments returned January 30, 2023. The District
review of the schedule concurred with a portion of the request and determined that the Contractor
should be eligible for an extension of 170 days of time for the completion milestones established in
the contract documents. The updated accepted schedule milestones reflect the extended time as
agreed upon.
The schedule delays which are considered valid by the District Reviewer have been attributed to the
following:
• Delays in procuring structural steel as required to complete the median portion of bridge T-
01-046 and thus delaying Stage 1A.
• Unforeseen lack of pavement structure under the Route 24 paved shoulder resulting in the
need to relocate barrier, sawcut and increase the median construction that the Stage 1B
roadway pavement would be adequate for public use during this stage.
Upon completion of Milestone 05 Interim Full Beneficial Use of Ramp F, the Contractor has been
asked to produce a new baseline schedule where potential recovery can be evaluated for the
variance between updated contract milestone dates and currently forecasted dates.
Areas of Concern
The following represents the primary areas of concern identified in design and at this stage in
construction:
10

Project Name: Route 24/Route 140 Interchange Improvements, Taunton
Owner’s Representative Contract Number: 120632
Project Number: 605888
Construction Contract Number: 112402
• The project schedule had fallen behind the contractual milestones prior to abandonment and
has been put on hold for the time since the site was abandoned. The newly accepted
schedule shows slippage on the interim milestone of the opening of Ramp F. The milestones
of substantial completion and contractor field completion are the same as they were prior to
the site abandonment by Cardi.
• Work under this project must be very carefully coordinated with work under the SCR
Project which includes overlapping work zones and separate stages of construction. This
will include ensuring that the scope of construction work does not allow for gaps in contract
work or overlaps as well as carefully timed staging. This is particularly true with the work to
be done at Industrial Drive which serves as the access to the proposed East Taunton
Commuter Rail Station and involves the realignment of the road under the SCR project to be
aligned with the proposed Route 24 off ramp to Route 140 northbound. The SCR Contractor
mobilized in October 2022 and the scheduled work to be done in the overlapping work zone
has been closely coordinated. The work schedule of both projects has been coordinated to
account for the project activity under each contract without interference from either party.
Construction work on Ramp F and at the Industrial Drive intersection has been completed
and the last remaining item of work to be completed prior to opening the ramp will be the
connection of the railroad equipment cabinet to the Ramp F/Industrial Drive traffic signal
controller. An agreement has been reached on the appropriate traffic signal preemption
timing. MassDOT has subsequently been coordinating with the MBTA to make the
necessary connection between the railroad equipment cabinet and the Ramp F traffic signal
controller as required prior to the opening of the Ramp. The work to implement the timing
adjustment will need to be performed by the approved MBTA Contractor.
• Utilities: Utility relocations are necessary to remove manholes along Route 140 in the travel
way. This is to be achieved by construction of an underground duct bank by the General
Contractor for follow-on relocation by others. Completion of the duct bank is constrained by
the construction of the South Abutment of the Route 24/140 Bridge (T-01-046). This work
needs to be completed before the existing manholes can be removed, and the final pavement
along Route 140 is placed.
• Railroad access and foul times: staging bridge construction over the Railroad Bridges will
be very complex due to the limited hours of operation and multiple stages of construction.
The South Coast Rail has begun to operate freight service in the evening hours which has
the potential to impact the efficiency of contractor’s work activities within the foul zone of
the railroad bridges. The contractor does not have day time access per the contract and night
11

Project Name: Route 24/Route 140 Interchange Improvements, Taunton
Owner’s Representative Contract Number: 120632
Project Number: 605888
Construction Contract Number: 112402
time rail service may interrupt construction operations if the contractor is required to vacate
the work area during times when a train is in service. The contractor is continuing to explore
opportunities to access the two railroad bridges from the lower grade however as of this
time, access from below has not been obtained. The work to be done in the Stage 1B work
zone is accessible from the roadway grade and lower levels within the off line portion of the
new structures to be constructed. Without lower level access the remaining work will need
to be performed from above.
• Maintenance of Traffic/Construction Staging: construction staging and maintenance of
traffic continues to be a very challenging element of the project due to heavy traffic volumes
with four separate stages of construction and bridge replacements. The project is currently in
Stage 1B which enables work to the easterly portion of the Route 24 roadway and bridges as
well as the easterly portion of Route 140.
• Construction fatigue for the motoring public traveling through the work zone which is
projected to extend into 2028.

III. CHAPTER 303 OF THE ACTS OF 2008 AREAS OF INTEREST
Peer Review
Benesch Engineering, a highly respected and regarded engineering firm, provided a formal peer
review of the project at the 100% Highway/Final Bridge design stage in June of 2020.
In addition, MassDOT’s Highway, Bridge, Environmental, Landscape, Right-of-Way, and Traffic
Divisions as well as appropriate District Departments (District Engineer, Utilities, Highways,
Traffic) provided in-depth reviews of the 25% Highway/Sketch Plan, 75% Highway/First Bridge
designs, and 100% Highway Second Bridge designs and its calculations book, Specifications,
Special Provisions, and Cost Estimates as well as Construction Time Determination and Bottoms
Up Estimates.
The OR reviewed the comments made during the above and the Project team’s responses and
attended comment resolution meetings held subsequent to these submissions. The OR also attended
several coordination meetings held with the South Coast Rail project and kept notes of these
discussions as the project progressed.
Value Engineering
A Value Engineering (VE) Study of the project design concept was conducted by McMahon
Associates with nine possible cost-saving ideas identified. These were reviewed by the District
Projects and Bridge Section and of the nine proposals, one was accepted; offering alternative
precast retaining wall submittals while a second was conditionally accepted to allow a reduction to
two lanes on Route 24.
Cost Recovery
At this point in time, no issues have been specifically identified as Cost Recovery issues. However,
it should be noted that any initial identification of a Cost Recovery issue does not necessarily mean
that cost recovery is due; a formal evaluation process must still be followed. The undersigned
Owner’s Representative will continue to monitor issues and, with MassDOT Highway Division,
will discuss the need for its referral to the Cost Recovery Standing Committee. For any issue
referred for Cost Recovery, the current MassDOT Highway Division Cost Recovery Procedure
(SOP No. HED-70-01-1-000, dated 8/7/17) shall govern. In order to perform the legislative
mandate of being the Primary Manager of Cost Recovery, the Owner’s Representative will follow
26

Project Name: Route 24/Route 140 Interchange Improvements, Taunton
Owner’s Representative Contract Number: 120632
Project Number: 605888
Construction Contract Number: 112402
the referenced SOP. This SOP, as modified for projects with an Owner’s Representative, describes
the role of the Owner’s representative and includes a Cost Recovery Standing Committee. This
committee oversees the work of separate and issue-specific Cost Recovery Review Panels and Cost
Recovery Evaluation Committees, which will be convened as necessary.

1. Obstructions encountered when installing SOE at Bridge T-01-046. The Stage 1B portion of
work related to this claim has been completed. It has been agreed to begin to litigate this
claim prior to the start of Stage 2 where it is likely that similar work will need to be
performed in the installation of SOE for the remaining portions of work at this bridge.
2. Installation of debris netting under bridge T-01-046. This is stated in the project Special
Provisions to be included in the payment for Item 994.02 Temporary Protective Shielding.
This is currently being tracked as a claim.
3. Construction of a levelling pad to be placed between the drilled shafts and permanent SOE
at Bridge T-01-047 as this is clearly identified in the project Special Provisions as part of
Item 996.033 Precast Concrete Panels.3 The Surety has conceded that this is not additional
work and withdrawn this request.
4. Removal of asbestos weepholes at Bridge T-01-045. The project Special Provisions state
that the demolition of bridge item includes the handling of all hazardous materials
encountered in the demolition of the bridge. This is currently being tracked as a claim.
In addition to the requested Extra Work Orders, the Surety has been made aware of the costs
incurred by MassDOT to maintain the project site during the time period between July 2023 and
January 2024 when the site was abandoned by the previous contractor.

Project Name: Ramp Construction on I-95 (NB) & Improvements on Dedham St./Canton St.
Owner’s Representative Contract Number: 120632
MassDOT Project Number: 606146
Construction Contract Number: 90726
I. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
This project constructed a new off-ramp from I-95 northbound to Dedham Street in the Town of Canton
and widened approximately 3800’ of Dedham Street/Canton Street from two to four lanes in the Towns of
Canton, Norwood and Westwood. The two-lane bridge over I-95 (1964) has been replaced with a composite
steel plate girder superstructure with reinforced concrete deck, 5-12’ lanes comprised of two through-lanes
in each direction and a left-turning lane for traffic from Dedham Street westbound to I-95 southbound. On
Dedham Street the two-lane bridges over the Neponset River (2000) and over the MBTA/AMTRAK
Railroad (1995) have both been widened to accommodate four travel lanes, minimum 5’ shoulders, and a
6’ sidewalk on the north side.
The need to maintain traffic during the construction resulted in a fairly complex staging scheme with six
project-wide stages, each stage building upon the already completed work to channel traffic in order to open
successive bridge work-zones. The staging scheme was further complicated by the existing overhead
utilities, owned by eight separate private companies, all of which needed to move from overhead to
underground in the final condition. Utilities were first moved from overhead facilities to a combination of
permanent underground and temporary ground-level locations (completed September 2021), followed by a
second relocation once the new bridges were built out from temporary ground-level to their permanent
underground and below-deck locations (completed May, 2023).
A construction contract in the amount of $44,265,036 was awarded to SPS New England, Inc. in November
2016, and NTP issued on December 22, 2016. For a condensed history of the project from NTP through
2020, please consult prior years’ Annual Reports. After a cursory review of the earlier years the present
report summarizes progress in 2024.
The complex staging required that the corridor be turned over to the outside utility companies for
approximately one year for them to relocate their infrastructure from overhead to permanent underground
and temporary above-ground locations. However, between the NTP on December 22, 2016 and August 3,
2020 when the corridor was turned over to the utility companies, the Contract Field Completion (CFC)
milestone accumulated 571 days of negative float due to a variety of Owner and excusable third-party
delays. Some fourteen months later, when the temporary utility relocations had completed and the corridor
was turned back to the MassDOT contractor in September 2021, the negative float had increased to 869
days. In May 2021 an Interim Time Extension of 571 calendar days (time extension #1), intended to cover
the excusable delays from NTP up to the initial turnover to the utility companies, was processed as Contract

Amendment #14 and extended the initial May 5, 2022 CFC date to November 27, 2023. When the revised
completion date was incorporated into the project schedule the negative float on CFC reduced from 869 to
311 days. At the Department’s request two acceleration proposals were received in 2021 and ultimately,
in early 2022, the Department created a “bank” with EWO #14 of $950,000 to fund selected critical path
activities through the 2021/2022 and 2022/2023 winter shutdown periods.
Work continued through the 2021/2022 winter, the standard 2022 construction season and into the
2022/2023 winter however, in early spring, 2023 it became apparent that despite working through the two
winters CFC would still be delayed some ten months past the completion date. The Department requested
that SPS submit another acceleration proposal which would achieve Full Beneficial Use (FBU) “no later
than December 1, 2023”. In June, 2023 an agreement was reached establishing FBU as December 31, 2023,
and applying a daily “no-excuse” incentive payment of $25,800 up to $774,800, provided FBU was
achieved between December 1, 2023 and December 30 as well as a capped daily disincentive payment if
FBU was achieved between January 1, 2024 and January 30, 2024. As part of the agreement a second time
extension of 219 calendar days was processed (time extension #2) which extended CFC from November
27, 2023 to July 3, 2024. Funds for the acceleration in the amount of $3,574,000 were added to the contract
in August 2023. Subsequently the pace of the work increased significantly, with the final stage of the I-95
bridge as well as MSE walls #12, #13 and #14 all completing in the second half of 2023. Final paving,
sidewalk and BMP construction, project lighting and installation of the three new signalized intersections
completed in late November, and the facility was opened to traffic on December 1, 2023. The Contractor
received the full incentive amount of $774,800. In late November during the final push to open the
roadways District personnel noted that the barrier height at the retaining walls on the south side of Dedham
St. was 32” measured from the roadway surface whereas, because of the adjacent bike lane, AASHTO
recommends a minimum height of 42”. RFI #111.2 was submitted and direction provided to install a
temporary wooden handrail prior to the roadway opening with a permanent solution to follow. Aside from
punch list work, the principal activities on the project in 2024 centered around the design, procurement and
installation of permanent 36” snow fence at four locations. A time extension of 198 calendar days (time
extension #3) was processed to account for the added work, moving CFC from July 3, 2024 January 17,
2025. EWO #31 ($11,473) for temporary wooden handrail was approved in October 2024 and EWO #40
($640,730) for 655 linear feet of 36” snow fence was approved in September 2024. Both the temporary
and permanent barrier EWOs were discussed in the November 2024 meeting of the Cost Recovery Standing
Committee with the consensus being that cost recovery is merited for both.

II. ANNUAL REPORT
Contract Scope of Work
The Dedham Street project added a new off-ramp from I-95 northbound to Dedham Street in Canton to
complete the half-diamond interchange at this location (the southbound on-ramp was constructed in 2002).
Dedham Street itself has been widened from two travel lanes to four travel lanes over a distance of
approximately 3,800 feet. Five-foot shoulders are added in both directions to accommodate bicycles. Both
the bridge over the Neponset River and the bridge over the AMTRAK/MBTA railroad tracks have been
widened to accommodate the added two lanes of traffic, five-foot shoulders and a northside sidewalk. A
new, five-lane bridge carrying Dedham Street over I-95 was constructed, including an exclusive left-turn
lane from Dedham Street westbound to the existing I-95 southbound on-ramp, a move not previously
available. Coordinated traffic signal systems were installed at three locations along Dedham Street, a
sidewalk was constructed the entire length of the corridor along the northern side of the roadway, and a
new lighting system was provided along Dedham Street, from east of the Neponset River across I-95 to
Kirby Drive in Canton and along the new off-ramp. Dedham Street for much of the project alignment
traverses existing wetlands associated with the Neponset River. In order to accommodate the increased
roadway width without expanding the existing footprint, four MSE walls, three cast-in-place walls, and
four stone masonry retaining walls were constructed to support the widened embankment. An additional
three MSE walls were required along the two sides of the new NB off-ramp and one along the east side of
the widened SB on-ramp.
Major Progress as of December 1, 2024
After some five months of project acceleration in the summer and fall of 2023 the entire facility was opened
to traffic (FBU) on December 1, 2023. During the final push to open the roadways, in late November,
District personnel noted that the barrier height at the retaining walls on the south side of Dedham St. was
32” measured from the roadway surface whereas, due to the presence of the adjacent, eastbound bike lane,
AASHTO recommends a minimum height of 42”. RFI #111.2 was submitted, and direction was provided
to install a temporary wooden handrail prior to the roadway opening with a permanent solution to follow.
Aside from punch list work completed over the summer, the principal activity on the project in 2024
centered around the design, procurement and installation of permanent 36” snow fence at four locations.
Negative float of 141 days appeared in the project schedule when the added work was first recognized in
March, and grew to 198 days by July. A third time extension of 198 calendar days was subsequently
processed and CFC moved from July 3, 2024 to January 17, 2025, eliminating the negative float. EWO
#31 ($11,473) for temporary wooden handrail was approved in October and EWO #40 ($640,730) for 655

linear feet of 36” snow fence was approved in September. Potential cost recovery for both issues was
discussed in the November 2024 meeting of the Cost Recovery Standing Committee with the consensus
being that continued cost recovery efforts were merited in both cases.
Since achieving FBU the Contractor has submitted twenty-four EWO requests totaling $1,790,300, sixteen
of which have been approved ($1,672,350) and six of which remain under review ($117,950). The
Contractor has also indicated their intention to submit an additional seventeen requests and has provided
“order of magnitude” estimates for fifteen which total to $550,500.

III. CHAPTER 303 OF THE ACTS OF 2008 AREAS OF EMPHASIS
Peer Review
The peer review requirements for this project were satisfied during the design phase and are continuing
during the construction phase.
Presently the undersigned Owner’s Representative is satisfying the peer review obligations by attending
regular project review meetings where construction issues, conflicts, and resolutions are discussed, by
walking the site to observe major construction activities, and participating in the change order process by
reviewing and commenting upon any proposed design changes and their impacts to the project quality,
budget, or schedule.
Value Engineering
A Value Engineering (VE) Study was conducted in 2013 by URS Corporation and Keville Enterprises.
The study was conducted on the larger I-95/I-93 Interchange Improvement project; a study was not
conducted for the Dedham Street widening and I-95 NB off-ramp as a separate project. The final report
was submitted in January 2014.
Cost Recovery
To date three issues have been formally identified by the Cost Recovery Standing Committee as meriting
further investigation. The first is EWO #4 ($47,592) concerning diaphragm modifications as discussed in
the January 6, 2021, April 7, 2021 and February 1, 2023 meetings of the Standing Committee. EWO #4
resulted when it was determined during installation of electrical conduits under the Railroad Bridge that the
pier diaphragms needed to be re-fabricated due to interferences with the conduits. The Designer maintains
that a post-bid reduction by NGRID in the number of allowable conduit bends between pullboxes resulted
in the interferences and the need to re-fabricate. The consensus of the Committee was that the Designer
should be brought in to discuss the coordination that occurred with NGRID during project design.
The second and third issues are outlined above under Major Progress as of December 1, 2024. During the
final push to open the roadways, in late November 2023 District personnel noted that the barrier height at
the retaining walls on the south side of Dedham St. was 32” measured from the roadway surface whereas,
due to the presence of the adjacent, eastbound bike lane, AASHTO recommends a minimum height of 42”.
The Contractor was directed to provide a temporary wooden handrail prior to the December 1 roadway
opening, with a permanent solution to follow. EWO #31 ($11,473) for temporary wooden handrail was

approved in October 2024, and EWO #40 ($640,730) for 655 linear feet of 36” snow fence at four locations
was approved in September 2024. The Designers maintain that the lack of any handrail at the locations was
an “item omission” and not cost-recoverable. Similarly, they maintain that the decision to install snow
fence as opposed to the standard 1-bar steel railing as recommended represents a “betterment” and any
increase in cost is not cost-recoverable. Both EWOs were discussed during the November 6, 2024 meeting
of the Cost Recovery Standing Committee with the consensus being that continued cost recovery efforts
were merited in both cases.
Initial identification of a Cost Recovery issue does not necessarily mean that cost recovery is due as the
formal evaluation process outlined in SOP No. CSD 25-14-1-000 (November 11, 2022) must be followed.
The undersigned Owner’s Representative will continue to monitor issues and, with MassDOT Highway
Division, will discuss the need for referral to the Cost Recovery Standing Committee.

Areas of Concern
The following represents the primary areas of concern identified in design and at this stage in
construction:
• The local community continues to express concerns about paint chips, noise, dust, and
paint smell from the project. Weekly the contractor and MassDOT walk the project area
and remove paint chips that are found. The quantity of paint chips found has been
reducing through 2024 as the project has progressed. Noise and dust are monitored per
contract specifications and have been within limits. MassDOT has held regular meetings
with the public.
• The project involves rehabilitation of steel and concrete bridge elements that are difficult
to quantify during design development. As rehabilitation work progresses, additional
unseen areas of deterioration may be identified that should be addressed in this contract.
• Due to the approximately 4-year duration of this project, it is possible that areas of
deterioration will grow during that time and require additional work to address them in
this contract. The contract does have unit price items to address quantity growth.

Potential Extra Work
The following represents potential extra work that is in discussion but has not yet been
authorized.
• The existing lighting may be replaced and upgraded in this project. In mid-2024 it was
identified that this contract has good work access and traffic control that may provide the
benefit of easier access to perform this work now, as compared to a separate future
contract.
• There is a section of safety walk that was not included in previous Tobin bridge contracts
and may be included in this contract since it abuts the current work limits and uses
similar details and materials already in this contract.
• The bridge expansion joint at the northern limits of this project abut the previous Chelsea
Viaduct project and is in need of repair. The current project has a contractor mobilized
that is capable of this work and it may be advantageous to complete this work now.
Additional bridge expansion joints within the project limits have damaged rubber gland
seals and may also be repaired in this contract.
• The northbound roadway at the northern limits of this project near the Fourth Stret
offramp has approximately 300 feet of substandard temporary concrete highway barrier
that is deteriorating. It may be advantages to complete this work now since the work is
within the temporary traffic control already established for this project.

Project Name: Newton Weston I-90 over I-95 Charles River, Charles Street and MBTA/CSX
Owner’s Representative Contract Number: 120632
Project Number: 606783
Construction Contract Number: N/A
I. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
This project consists of the reconstruction of the I-90 (Massachusetts Turnpike) corridor and
adjacent ramps from approximately 700 feet west of the existing Park Road Bridge over Route I-
90 in the Town of Weston to approximately 200 feet east of the existing Route I-90 Bridge over
the MBTA/CSX Railroad in the adjacent City of Newton (See Figure 1). With this project, the
bridges within these limits along with the associated roadways and ramps are to be reconstructed
and realigned with revised lane configurations based upon future travel demands as well as
anticipated travel speeds. The load carrying capacity of the new bridge structures will be
increased to the current loading requirement for highway bridges (HL-93). The project will also
strive to increase the clearance wherever possible of the proposed structures in an effort to obtain
the minimum vertical clearance of 16'-6" and improve the roadway and shoulder widths to the
desired values as recommended by AASHTO Standards.
The I-90 bridge over the Charles River and I-95 would need to be substantially rehabilitated
within the next ten years in order to remain in service. The bridge deck is in poor condition and
there is significant deterioration at the beam ends and parapets along with concrete spalling on
the piers. This condition along with the adjacent project planned at the I-90 Allston Brighton
interchange has created the need to execute and complete this project in advance of the Allston
Brighton project.
In early November 2014, the preliminary design consultant, Greenman Pedersen Inc. (GPI)
submitted an Alternatives Analysis study for the reconstruction of the I-90 over I-95 and Charles
River Bridge which included a detailed breakdown of five separate alignment options. The study
was reviewed by the District 6 Office and the Boston Office of MassDOT and a preferred option
was selected. Notice to Proceed to advance the preferred option was given to GPI on December
23, 2015.
It has been agreed to include repairs to the existing wall supporting the embankment of the I-90
eastbound ramp (Ramp C) to I-95 southbound which had been identified as deficient by the
Geotechnical Section of MassDOT. Along with this it has also been determined to include
combined bridge (Bridge N-12-065 = W-29-035) replacements for the I-95 northbound ramp to
I-90 east and west (Ramp A) and I-90 east/west to I-95 northbound (Ramp B). Plans for the
Ramp A/B bridges were developed to final design however a contract had not been executed and
it was decided to include these bridge replacements in this contract to take advantage of the
mobilized contractor. In releasing the Design-Build Procurement Documents, the final design

Construction Contract Number: N/A
plans for the Ramp A/B Bridges were revised to conform to the preliminary format of the Base
Technical Concept Plans to allow for innovation and design development in the Design-Build
process.
In response to comments issued during the Public Information Meeting held March 31, 2022, it
has been determined to also include the repairs identified in the inspection of the Ramp A/B
Bridge over the Charles River and I-95 (N-12-064=W-29-034).
The preliminary design proceeded with the method of procurement established as Design-Build
with Technical Proposals reviewed in February 2023 and Price Proposals opened March 1, 2023.
The apparent Best Value was determined to be the Design-Build Joint Venture Team of SPS
Construction with Walsh Construction as the Prime Contractor and Jacobs Engineering as
Design-Build Designer of Record. Notice to Proceed was issued on April 22, 2023.
Design work on the project has progressed with Issued for Construction packages being accepted
for the I-90 bridges over the I-95 and the Charles River and I-90 over the MBTA/CSX Railroad
as well as two of the Ramp G Bridges. Highway Design has advanced to the 100% stage and is
currently in Rev 2 which is under review.
Construction work currently in Stage 1A including construction of the southerly portion of the
trestle which provides access to construct the southerly off line portions of the I-90 over I-95 and
the Charles River Bridge. The southerly (Stage 1A) portions of the three piers for this bridge
have been constructed and the west and east abutments are well into construction in anticipation
of the bridge girders being installed in early 2025. Construction is also under way at the I-90
over the MBTA/CSX Bridge with substructure extensions and repairs in preparation for the
superstructure replacement to be performed over the two weekend shutdowns in June of 2025.

II. ANNUAL REPORT
Contract Scope of Work
The scope of work includes but is not limited to the reconstruction of the I-90 roadway from
approximately 700 feet west of the existing Park Road Bridge over Route I-90 in the Town of
Weston to approximately 200 feet east of the existing Route I-90 Bridge over the MBTA/CSX
Railroad in the adjacent City of Newton and the associated on and off ramps between the
communities of Newton and Weston.
In addition to replacing the Route I-90 over I-95 and Charles River Bridge (Bridge N-12-066 =
W-29-036), this project proposes complete replacement of the Ramp G Bridge over Ramps A
and B (Bridge W-29-058); Ramp G Bridge over existing MWRA Aqueduct (Bridge W-29-057);
Ramp G Bridge over Route I-90 (Bridge W-29-055). The superstructure of the Route I-90 over
MBTA Railroad (Bridge N-12-067) will be replaced as well as modifications to the substructure.
Minor modifications to the Route I-90 bridge over Charles Street (Bridge N-12-073) are also
proposed to accommodate the widening of I-90 over the existing structure.
Additional elements involved in the design include but are not limited to: drainage
improvements; mechanically stabilized earth (MSE) retaining walls, expanded polystyrene
backfill rock fill; concrete median barrier; highway lighting; stormwater improvements:
overhead sign structures; full depth hot mix asphalt roadway construction; micro-milling with
hot mix asphalt overlay; paving markings and signage; utility relocations; sound barrier walls
and temporary traffic control.
It has been decided to include the replacement of the Ramp A/Ramp B bridge over the Charles
River (N-12-065 = W-29-035) in this contract. This bridge combines the ramps providing the
connection of I-95 north and south with I-90 east and west. Plans for this replacement had been
prepared all the way through the PS&E stage however a contract was not executed. In addition,
repairs to the wall supporting the embankment of the I-90 eastbound ramp (Ramp C) to I-95
southbound which had been identified as deficient by the Geotechnical Section will be included
with the improvements to be made with this project. It has also been agreed to include suggested
repairs to the Ramp A/Ramp B bridge over the Charles River and I-95 (N-12-064 = W-29-034).
The repairs include parapet replacement, partial deck reconstruction, median replacement, repair
to beam ends and bearing stiffeners the painting of the bridge and pier repair.

Areas of Concern
The following represents the primary areas of concern identified in design and in the preliminary
construction:
• I-90 over the MBTA/CSX construction and foul times: staging the I-90 bridge over the
MBTA/CSX Railroad will be very complex due to the skew angle of the bridge relative
to the travel way. A preliminary study was performed to evaluate detour routes for a

possible weekend closure of I-90 where the roadway will be narrowed to one lane in each
direction for two separate weekends. The work to be done to the superstructure will need
to be completed in time to allow for the opening of I-90 to three lanes in each direction at
the conclusion of each weekend. This also includes a shutdown of the MBTA Rail and
busing to be utilized to maintain commuter rail traffic during this period. The work will
need to be completed in time to allow for the safe re-opening of these facilities following
the shutdown period. An Incentive/Disincentive Clause based upon calculated road user
costs has been included in the procurement documents for the overall project duration and
for the opening of traffic to three lanes at the conclusion of each of the two weekend
closures to be implemented. Public outreach will be required to coordinate this with
traffic impacts to be considered in the City of Newton and properly accounted for in the
design. As of November 30, 2024, IFC plans for this structure have been completed and
work has progressed in cooperation with the MBTA and Keolis, the railroad operator in
construction of the substructure extensions and repairs. The request has been submitted to
the MBTA for the proposed shutdown of the MBTA currently scheduled for the
weekends of June 2, 2025 and June 8, 2025.
• In a meeting at the site on August 29, 2019 with MassDOT District 6 personnel, GPI and
Algonquin Gas, the project’s potential impact on the 24 inch high pressure gas line
serving Boston and Cambridge was discussed. The line goes under I-95 where it is
sleeved, most likely with a larger diameter steel pipe and has limited redundancy that
would not likely allow it to be out of service. Algonquin provided coordinates to pinpoint
the location of the line which very closely matched the location shown on the GPI design
plans. It has been agreed that this situation will be monitored to ensure that there will be
no impacts to the utility and that the necessary construction precautions are taken as the
construction proceeds.
• There is also a fiber optic cable line on the north and south sides of I-90 which will need
to be relocated with the proposed design and construction as the project proceeds. The
Design Builder has coordinated this work with the District Utilities Engineer and work to
install new conduits and manholes continues in combination with project staging and
progress.
• The Hultman Aqueduct (MWRA utility) which travels through the project site has two
overpasses and will need to be considered throughout the design. The Design-Builder has

submitted amended permit applications through the MWRA in coordination with current
design. Protective slabs have been installed over the pipeline as required to avoid damage
caused by heavy loading. This will need to continue as work proceeds to protect this
infrastructure.
• Construction staging and maintenance of traffic will be a very challenging element of the
project due to heavy traffic volumes and numerous bridge replacements within the project
limits requiring careful staged construction. The contract documents stipulate that three
lanes of travel both east and westbound must be maintained during construction.
• The Design-Builder has put forth a revised construction staging plan which is
functionally similar to previously rejected ATCs presented during procurement. The plan
introduces a separate westbound travel lane with an exit ramp to Ramp K which leads to
Park Road where the deceleration is included in the ramp and there are concerns about
the potential queueing of traffic onto the westbound roadway which would have no
separate exit roadway. The reasons cited for the need for this revised staging plan are
concerns raised over feasibility of meeting the gutter spreads stipulated in the
procurement documents and subsequent drainage which would be required. A
memorandum has been prepared by the Design-Builder which analyzes the traffic
conditions which will result from the implementation of the plan which has been
reviewed and accepted by MassDOT. The currently proposed 100% Highway Plans
propose to implement this staging plan.
• The Design-Builder has informed MassDOT that substructure reuse for Ramp A/B over
the Charles River (N-12-065) as proposed in the Base Technical Concept is not feasible.
After consideration of multiple alternatives, the Design-Builder has concluded that the
only feasible alternative for a full structure replacement is a three span structure. The
Design-Builder has prepared a memorandum documenting the evaluation of the
alternatives with a recommendation for a three span replacement structure. An order of
magnitude estimate has been prepared for this alternative of an increase in $55 million to
the contract. The Design-Builder has indicated that this work can be accomplished within
the existing contract milestones. MassDOT is reviewing this memorandum and has
directed the Design-Builder to advance the design with a full substructure replacement.
Revised Sketch Plans were submitted accepted in September 2024. First Structural plans

were submitted in October and comments are to be addressed in the Second Structural
Submittal.
• In preparing the proposed wall designs for the wall intended to replace the existing BIN
Wall supporting the embankment adjacent to Ramp C, deterioration has been observed on
Bridge W-29-032 which supports the Ramp C Roadway above the Hultman Aqueduct.
The Design-Builder has raised the concern that this deterioration may compromise the
integrity of the replacement walls. A field meeting was held to evaluate the deterioration
and investigate potential repairs to be made to the existing bridge. GPI prepared a
memorandum with recommendations MassDOT has reviewed and provided comments
which have been incorporated into a revised memorandum recommending repairs to the
existing bridge. This memorandum is currently under review by MassDOT.

Project Name: Corridor Improvements on Route 79/Davol Street
Owner’s Representative Contract Number: 120632
MassDOT Project Number: 608049
Construction Contract Number: 117658
I. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The project is reconstructing a 1.6-mile section of Route 79/Davol Street on the left bank of the Taunton
River immediately to the north of Battleship Cove in Fall River. The overall objectives of the project are
to re-establish connectivity between the neighborhoods and the waterfront, to promote economic growth
by creating developable parcels, and to create a vibrant, multi-modal corridor. Prior to the start of the
project Route 79 ran through the area as a grade-separated limited access highway with two northbound
and two southbound traffic lanes and two-lane frontage roads (Davol Street). The project relocates existing
Route 79 approximately on to the existing frontage road alignments thereby creating space for several
development parcel in the Route 79 footprint. Three new crossing streets with at-grade signalized
intersections are being constructed, at Turner Street, Hathaway Street, and Brightman Street. Existing
President Avenue between northbound and southbound Davol St. will be reconstructed. Other project
elements include shared use paths, sidewalks, ornamental lighting, extensive landscaping, a new bridge
structure near the southern project limit, several retaining walls and two new drainage outfalls into the
Taunton River.
In 2024 the Contractor has:
 Completed construction of the new bridge F-02-087 superstructure, Route 79 northbound over the
southern U-turn; the bridge was opened to traffic on November 18, 2024;
 Completed construction of the two new drainage outfalls to the Taunton River, the first off of
Remington Avenue and the second adjacent to City Pier. Installed the 9’x4’ box culvert from Davol
St. southbound along Brownell St. to the Remington Ave. outfall and extended the 12’x5’ box
culvert from the City Pier outfall across Davol. St. southbound and the median area to Davol St.
northbound;
 Continued construction of surface drainage, lighting, roadway, new sewer and water main, and
underground infrastructure for Verizon, NGRID and Comcast project-wide.
Project design by the Engineer-of-Record (EOR) advanced with the Issued-for-Construction (IFC) plans
approved in April 2024. The one exception was the Landscape IFC plans which were submitted in
November 2024 and remain under review.
To date a total of seventeen Extra Work Orders are either approved or pending in MassDOT’s tracking
system, for a total of $2,983,314. EWOs totaling ~$2.7 million were generated in 2023 while to date 2024
has seen only ~$0.3 million. Of the seventeen the three most significant are EWO #4, “Additional water

service – project wide” in the amount of $754,182; EWOs #6, in combination with EWO #10, unplanned
Comcast ductbank in the amount of $782,656; and EWO #9, “Remove and replace wall F-2-W4” in the
amount of $696,875. The first, EWO #4 ($754,182), pertains to locations where new water main is called
for in the contract plans and existing service connections for domestic water, fire suppression, and/or
hydrants are either called to be abandoned, or not shown. It was determined that at some eighteen locations
the services are active and must be reconnected to the new main. In Fall River the property owner is
responsible for the service connections up to the main, and the records of the service providers were
apparently incomplete to the extent that many services were simply overlooked during preliminary design.
The second, EWOs #6 and #10 ($782,656), pertain to unplanned installation of new ductbank for Comcast
which was discovered to be required. During preliminary design Comcast indicated that the project had no
impact on their facilities and that relocations would not be necessary. There was no work by Comcast
included in the PUC form. In a Utility Coordination Meeting on March 21, 2023 Comcast indicated that
upon investigation it was determined that their existing ductbank along portions of Davol Street
southbound, Turner Street and President Avenue were too shallow and would need to be relocated (EWO
#6). In a Utility Coordination Meeting on August 15, 2023 they indicated that additional ductbank along
Davol Street southbound would also need to be relocated (EWO #10). The third major EWO, EWO #9
($696,875), involves replacement of the existing retaining wall abutting the southeast corner of the new
Bridge F-02-087. The wall was slated to remain but during construction operations in the area extensive
cracking was discovered and it was decided to replace the entire wall with a modular block wall as planned
at the three other bridge approaches.
None of the pending or approved EWOs to date are clear candidates for cost recovery.
At present, between pending and approved EWOs, materials price adjustments and projected contract item
overruns/underruns, approximately 38% of the original contingency monies has been committed
($4,059,137 of $10,695,682) and approximately 63% of the currently estimated MassDOT contract total
has been invoiced ($71,189,714 of $112,753,372). As of December 1, 2024, 52.1% of the contractual
construction duration has elapsed (752 of 1443 calendar days).

Owner’s Representative Contract Number: 120632
MassDOT Project Number: 608049
Construction Contract Number: 117658
II. ANNUAL REPORT
Contract Scope of Work
The project relocates existing Route 79 approximately on to the existing frontage road alignments, thereby
creating space for several development parcels within the current highway layout. Three new crossing
streets with at-grade signalized intersections will be created, at Turner Street, Hathaway Street, and
Brightman Street, and the existing crossing street, President Avenue, will be reconstructed. Other project
elements include shared use paths, sidewalks, ornamental lighting, extensive landscaping, a complete new
drainage system with two new outfalls into the Taunton River, and those elements the City of Fall River’s
CSO program within the project limits. Also included is the replacement of the bridge near the southern
project limit which carried Route 79 north and southbound over a Davol Street U-Turn with a new bridge
carrying Route 79 northbound only over the reconstructed U-turn.
Major Progress as of December 1, 2024
An initial Corridor Planning Study was completed in 2014 and a design contract was signed in 2018 with
TranSystems Corporation to assist in the selection of a preferred alternative, develop the 25% Design and
to serve as Preliminary Design Consultant (PDC) during design-build procurement and construction. Three
Design-Build teams were prequalified and the Joint Venture of D. W. White - SPS New England, in
association with HNTB, was determined to offer the Best Value to the Department. A Notice to Proceed
was issued on November 10, 2022 and the Contractor was fully mobilized by early February, 2023. In 2023
the Contractor:
 Shifted Route 79 northbound and southbound traffic from the initial alignment to the existing
frontage roads;
 Demolished the three structures carrying Route 79 over surface streets, the one structure carrying
Ramp E-W over Route 79, and the five retaining walls within the project limits;
 Removed the existing roadway embankment down to final subgrade;
 Completed construction of the substructure for the new bridge F-02-087, Route 79 northbound over
the southern U-turn;
 Began construction of the two new drainage outfalls to the Taunton River and associated box
culverts;
 Began construction of surface drainage, new sewer and water main, and underground infrastructure
for Verizon, NGRID and Comcast project-wide.

Schedule/ Project Milestones
The contract includes three milestones, as follows:
Milestone #3 – Full Beneficial Use
The majority of the work complete and the asset opened for multi-modal transportation use, including all
travel lanes and auxiliary lanes in their final configuration, including ramps, final paving and lane markings,
6

Project Name: Corridor Improvements on Route 79/Davol Street
Owner’s Representative Contract Number: 120632
MassDOT Project Number: 608049
Construction Contract Number: 117658
and open to traffic: 1,332 calendar days from NTP (July 4, 2026). The current schedule update (Update
#23, as of November 10, 2024) shows this milestone as July 2, 2026 with two calendar-days of float.
Milestone #2 – Substantial Completion
A walkthrough of the entire contract work performed by the Resident Engineer and a Punch List generated.
Work associated with no more than one percent of the adjusted total contract price yet to be completed:
1,383 calendar days from NTP (August 24, 2026). As of Update #23 the milestone is shown as August 16,
2026 with seven days of float.
Milestone #1 – Contract Completion
All physical work complete, including Punch List, and Contractor has fully de-mobilized from field
operations: 1,443 calendar days from NTP (October 23, 2026). As of Update #23 the milestone is shown
as October 16, 2026 with seven days of float.
The positive float carried by the completion milestones results from the significant volume of work which
was accomplished in year 1 in advance of the timing assumed in the Baseline Schedule. This included
demolition of the existing structures, construction of the Bridge F-02-087 substructure and the partial
construction of the Brownell Street culvert and outfall. Elements of the drainage, water and sewer systems
project-wide also began significantly ahead of schedule. Compared to year 1, the Contractor has maintained
the positive float through year 2, albeit somewhat reduced.
Areas and Issues of Concern
We have no issues of concern at this time. The project continues to carry positive float and the unanticipated
additional expenses to date remain well within the original contingency budget established in the FIN681,
with 62% of the original contingency monies uncommitted. We identified two concerns in the 2023 Annual
Report, both of which one year later now represent significantly lower risks. The first was the amount of
control over project schedule exercised by third-party utility companies with outside utilities occupying
40% of the critical path. As a result of their generally timely work over the past twelve months, and of
NGRID pursuing certain of their tasks concurrently rather than in series, the utilities have fallen entirely
off of the crucial path, in most cases by several months. The second issue was the lack of an approved
Baseline more than a year after NTP. This concern became moot when Baseline Rev 05 was approved on
December 28, 2023.

III. CHAPTER 303 OF THE ACTS OF 2008 AREAS OF EMPHASIS
Peer Review
During Procurement, reviews of the PDC’s 25% design documents for the RFP were conducted by the
concerned MassDOT sections and an independent “Bottom Up” cost estimate was performed by Patrick
Engineering under contract to MassDOT. The Owner’s Representative satisfied the peer review obligations
by reviewing and commenting on the draft RFP documents and addenda, attending the confidential
Alternative Technical Concept (ATC) meetings and oral presentations with each proposer, and participating
in meetings with the PDC to discuss the RFP documents and later, the ATCs and Technical Proposals.
MassDOT and the PDC review the final design submittals from HNTB, the Design-Builder’s EOR. The
Owner’s Representative has continued oversight review of design and shop drawing submittals, RFIs and
NCRs, and attends regular project meetings where construction issues, conflicts, and resolutions are
discussed. The OR visits the site at regular intervals to observe major construction activities and
participates in the change order process by reviewing and comment upon proposed design changes and their
impacts to the project quality, budget, or schedule.
Value Engineering
A formal Value-Engineering study was not undertaken during the Procurement Phase, however
development of the ATCs by the proposers serves a similar role in that the Design-Build teams are
encouraged to develop improvements to the Base Technical Concept and present them to the Department
for approval. While the D.W. White - SPS New England Joint Venture presented two ATCs which were
subsequently accepted by the Department, once the project was awarded the Design-Builder elected to not
pursue either.
Cost Recovery
No cost recovery issues have been identified to date.

Project Name: Tunnel Lighting Replacement on I-90 - Boston
Owner’s Representative Contract Number: 120630
Project Number: 612681
Construction Contract Number: 122343
I. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The scope of the I-90 Tunnel Lighting Replacement Project (MassDOT Project #612681)
includes the removal and replacement of the tunnel lighting system in the I-90 Connector tunnels
in the section between the Prudential Tunnel and the Ted Williams Tunnel. The existing linear
fluorescent / low pressure sodium lighting will be replaced with a new LED tunnel lighting and
control system. The project purpose is to provide adequate visibility in the tunnel for driver safety
while using the least amount of energy. MassDOT is advancing this project using the Design-Bid-
Build (DBB) method of project delivery. WSP is the project’s Engineer of Record (EOR), tasked
with developing the final design and procurement documents, and providing construction phase
services. Dagle Electrical Construction Corp. is the contractor.
The lighting system is being replaced due to a series of defects including corrosion due to
dissimilar metals, detached connection clips, broken butterfly and lens clips, wireway problems,
exposed epoxy anchor sleeves, bent hanger rods, and other miscellaneous issues.
In 2022, MassDOT had been advancing two separate projects: 609318 for I-90 Eastbound,
and 609343 for I90 Westbound. 609318 had been advanced to the PS&E level, while 609343 had
been advanced to the 100% design level. Balancing issues such as funding, procurement, and
traffic impacts, MassDOT combined those two projects into one (now known as PI #612681). That
combined project PS&E was advertised in June 2023 and Dagle was awarded the project, with
NTP for this construction contract #122343 on October 5, 2023.
In 2024, Dagle has been advancing the construction, including procurement and installation
of lighting systems and fixtures. As of the date of this report, DEC has completed 28% of the work
($26.1 Million).
The contract budget has been set up at $106,050,506 (including the bid price of
$88,744,788). Funding for this project will come, in part, from the Central Artery Repair and
Maintenance (CARM) Trust Fund, as well as from MHS funding.
The contract completion milestone is within 42 months, leading to a Field Completion date
of 6/01/27. As of the date of this report, the Contractor is forecasting a delay of -108 days.

II. ANNUAL REPORT
Contract Scope of Work
The delivery of this project will be by use of the traditional Design-Bid-Build procurement
method. MassDOT has assigned WSP as the designer; they will act as the project Engineer of
Record (EOR). When ready, the project will be advertised for construction, and WSP will provide
construction phase services.
The physical scope of this project is:
• Remove existing fluorescent luminaires, wireways, and wiring
• Install structural supports
• Install new LED lighting fixtures, raceways, and junction boxes
• Install and calibrate new lighting control system
• Install new power feeders at VB 8 for five jet fans in tunnel
• Manage traffic by use of lane closures (i.e., maintain traffic during construction)
The limits of this project include the I90 tunnel system between the Prudential Tunnel and
the Ted Williams Tunnel. The roadways included in this are I90 Westbound, I90 Eastbound, and
I90 HOV-Eastbound. In addition, the following ramps are included: Ramps B, D, DN, W-SS, A,
C, F, I, L and L-CS.
The various responsible project stakeholders are:
• MassDOT Highway Division – project owner, also providing
project management; note that MassDOT is also considered the
AHJ (Authority Having Jurisdiction) regarding tunnel code
compliance issues;
• MassDOT District 6 – responsible for design and construction
oversight (supported by various MassDOT technical departments);
• WSP – final designer / Engineer of Record;
• Dagle Electrical Construction Corp. (DEC) – the construction contractor
responsible to procure and install the new lighting system

Project Number: 612681
Construction Contract Number: 122343
Major Progress as of December 1, 2024
The bulk of 2022 was spent in the design and consolidation of the two
previously advanced projects into one combined project, with the PS&E submitted
June 30, 2022. The remainder of the year was spent by MassDOT performing its
review, and the Peer Review being performed by Mott McDonald.
The work in 2023 consisted of the completion of, and reconciliation of, the
peer review followed by the resubmitted PS&E and the contract procurement
process. Ultimately, the contract was awarded to Dagle, and an NTP was achieved in
October 2023. Following NTP, Dagle mobilized and began the construction phase.
In 2024, DEC continued working on the project, primarily working during
nighttime lane closures. The field work included work in Ramps LC-S, A, D, HOV,
and I90 EB as well as work in Vent Buildings 1, 5, and 8. That work consisted of
removal of existing lights, installation of temporary lights, installation of raceway
and junction boxes, installation of light fixtures, and wiring. As of the date of this
report, DEC has completed approximately 28% of the work. Due to delays in
procurement of wire, DEC is currently forecasting a delay of 108 days but anticipate
being able to recover that delay.
Budget
In accordance with the contract award, the project budget has the following breakdown:
ITEM TOTAL
Bid $ 88,744,788
Allowance $ 3,994,000
Contingency $ 13,311,718
TOTAL $ 106,050,506
As of the date of this report, the contractor has been paid $26.1 Million.
MassDOT is funding this work from the Central Artery Repair and Maintenance (CARM)
Trust Fund in addition to MHS funding to make up for the required state funds.

Schedule / Project Milestones
The project is advancing with the following expected key milestones:
Contractor Field Completion 6/01/27
In its November 2024 update #12, DEC is projecting a delay of 108 days but is working
with MassDOT to develop methods of mitigating that delay.
Areas and Issues of Concern
• Traffic Impacts – the work is performed during lane closures, and this
project includes many roadways and ramps. Other MassDOT work is
ongoing in these roadways concurrently. Therefore, MassDOT and the
contractor must continue to carefully plan and coordinate (and
document) to ensure the traffic impacts are minimized.
• Quality control – in implementing similar projects (replacement of
tunnel lighting) throughout the downtown Boston area, MassDOT has
had the opportunity to see its QC processes evolve, including QC
oversight at off-site manufacturing facilities. This topic will continue
to be a very important focus for the project team.
• Schedule delay – MassDOT is working closely with DEC to assist in
developing methods of mitigating the current projected delay.

III CHAPTER 303 OF THE ACTS OF 2008 AREAS OF INTEREST
Peer Review
The peer review requirement for this project was satisfied by MassDOT’s use
of Mott McDonald to perform this service. As of the date of this Annual Report, Mott
McDonald’s peer review is complete, and the results were reconciled with MassDOT
and WSP before the final design package was advertised.
During the construction phase of this project, WSP, as EOR, is continuing to
provide construction phase services. In addition, this O.R. will continue to partially
satisfy the peer review obligations by attending regular project review meetings where
construction issues, conflicts, and resolutions are discussed; walking the site to
observe major construction activities; and monitoring the change order process to
ensure any proposed design changes are evaluated for their impacts to the project’s
quality, budget, or schedule goals.
Value Engineering
MassDOT did not perform a traditional Value Engineering study, due to the nature of this
project. It is important to note that this project is one of a series of projects developed to replace
the lighting system throughout the CA/T tunnels. Several projects have been completed or are
nearly complete. The technical solution for this project must essentially follow those previous
projects, as MassDOT does not want to have dissimilar systems.
Cost Recovery
At this time no items have been identified as potential cost recovery issues.

Construction Contract Number: 122343
Extra Work Orders
As of the date of this report there have been two EWOs accepted, for a total of $788,222.92.
• EWO 1: Provide Cisco switches to be consistent with MassDOT system - $168,958.42
• EWO 2: Provide 13 new light pole fixtures, 4 new cameras, remove and reset 4 (ITS) poles,
provide 4 new pole foundations for the (ITS) poles and repair the existing load center enclosure
in East Boston - $619,264.50
Cost – the estimated budget of $106 M needs to continue to be monitored during
construction, especially the status of contingency. At this time the budget appears to be
adequate for the remaining work.
Schedule - the contract requires completion by June 2027. As of November 2024, the
contractor is projecting a delay of up to 108 days due to delays in its procurement of wire.
However, there appears to be adequate time and opportunity for the contractor to recover the
delay and meet the milestone.

Construction Contract Number: 114947
I. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
As of the date of this report, the Sumner Tunnel Design-Build project has been underway for
three years and has achieved Substantial Completion. The Sumner Tunnel, first constructed in 1934, is
a critical transportation link for vehicles under Boston Harbor, from East Boston to downtown Boston.
Traffic is carried from Logan Airport and Route 1A in East Boston to either I-93 Northbound/Storrow
Drive or to the Haymarket area. Despite minor repairs through the years, the tunnel has experienced
severe deterioration.
The scope of this project (MassDOT Project No. 606476) includes the complete renovation of
this l to meet today’s safety standards. Included are structural repairs (roadway, walls, invert, and –
most critical due to overhead concrete deterioration – the concrete arch) and systems upgrades to allow
the tunnel to comply with current NFPA 502 code requirements, to the extent possible. As of the date
of this report, the Design-Builder (“DB”) has completed a significant amount of its design and construction
and has achieved Substantial Completion. The work has taken place primarily during weekend tunnel closures
as well as during an eight-week full tunnel closure in the summer of 2023 and a four-week full tunnel closure in
the summer of 2024.
The entities associated with the ongoing project include the owner (MassDOT Highway), its
preliminary design consultant (WSP), and the selected DB (JF White, with its lead designer Delve
Underground). Other key stakeholders include the City of Boston, Federal Highway Administration
(FHWA), the MBTA, and major abutters such as Logan Airport (managed by MassPort) and adjacent
municipalities.
The overall project budget encumbrance is approximately $156.7 Million, including the DB
bid price of $135.2 Million. In terms of the contract schedule, it achieved Substantial Completion in
October 2024. The current funding appears to be adequate to complete this project.
This contract includes a provision for project partnering, and the teams have held two workshops. This
OR considers project partnering to be a best practice that aids in improved communication and trust.
As of the date of this report, the DB has billed $134 M (94% complete) and is forecasting completion by
January 2025.

II. ANNUAL REPORT
Contract Scope of Work
The project 606476 scope, as of the date of this Annual Report, includes the final design and
construction services by the selected DB, in accordance with the scope of work included in the
procurement. The general scope includes repairs of the roadway deck slab, repair of the under-road
supply plenum invert, replacement of the sidewalls with new arch support pedestals, replacement of
the lighting / systems, repair of the concrete arch, removal of the existing ceiling and partial
replacement, and miscellaneous utility work. From an operational standpoint, the intent will be to
provide ventilation via normal use of the existing fans in the vent buildings.
The project scope includes the following key components:
• Repairs to the arch using precast segments backed by grout;
• Removal of wall panels, and cast-in-place concrete repair of walls as needed;
• Repairs to the roadway deck structure (originally planned to use hydro demo and Ultra High-
Performance Concrete (UHPC) but revised to include concrete patching and asphalt
pavement;
• Replacement of tunnel systems such as electrical, lighting, SCADA, CCTV, and fiber optics;
• Installation of a new non-suspended ceiling over 1200 linear feet on the East Boston side
(the remainder was determined to not be necessary). This ceiling will be designed to
accommodate future access above for future inspection and maintenance

Construction Contract Number: 114947
As of the date of this Annual Report, the selected DB team is JF White with Delve Underground
(previously known as McMillen-Jacobs) as its lead designer and Engineer of Record. WSP, the
preliminary designer, is continuing to support MassDOT as technical reviewer and Owner’s Engineer.
The Engineer of Record is responsible for advancing and finalizing the design. As with any MassDOT
DB procurement, the Design-Builder was allowed to propose confidential Alternative Technical
Concepts. The JF White team proposed, and MassDOT accepted, its ATC#1 – Enhanced Ventilation/
Precast Arch with Quarter Ceiling. This included two major alternatives: (1) an enhanced ventilation
system to allow for approximately 1200 linear feet of the tunnel ceiling to be replaced with a hollow
core ceiling, while removing the remainder of the ceiling, and (2) the use of a precast arch for the arch
repair.
During 2021, the design-build procurement took place, using the standard MassDOT Best
Value process (which includes both a technical and a price evaluation). This resulted in NTP of the
DB in December 2021, allowing the Design-Builder to proceed with its final design and construction
of the various project elements. During the DB procurement, MassDOT developed and coordinated a
plan that would allow for intermittent weekend tunnel closures, along with a four-month closure in
2023. This plan was developed by balancing impacts to the public with the needs of construction.
During 2022, the project began with the DB’s planning and development of management plans.
The DB also progressed its design, including multiple “Early Release” design packages to advance
according to its schedule. Due to the difficulty in performing this work, the contract provides for up to
36 weekend tunnel closures, followed by a full 16-week tunnel closure from May to September 2023,
followed by an additional 16 weekend tunnel closures.
During 2023, the construction work continued in earnest, primarily during weekend tunnel
closures. MassDOT, in an effort to minimize impacts to the public, elected to direct the DB to revise
the tunnel closure protocol. The originally planned one 16-week full tunnel closure (planned for 2023)
was revised to become one eight-week full tunnel closure (in 2023) followed by a second eight-week
full tunnel closure (in 2024). In addition, due to the schedule impacts, MassDOT provided a time
extension and additional weekend closures.
During 2024, the DB continued to perform the bulk of its work during weekend closures, and
additionally performed some work during nights with lane closures. In early 2024, MassDOT elected
to reduce the project risk by revising the methodology of repairing the concrete roadway deck
structure. This change required the DB to perform patch-type repairs and overlay with an asphalt
surface, in lieu of the original plan to use hydro-demolition overlaid with a Ultra High Performance

Project Name: Roadway Ceiling, Arch & Wall Reconstruction and Other Control Systems in Sumner Tunnel - Boston
Owner’s Representative Contract Number: 120630
Project Number: 606476
Construction Contract Number: 114947
Concrete (UHPC) surface. Along with that technical change, the 2024 summer tunnel closure window
was reduced from 8 weeks to 4 weeks. The DB was able to achieve Substantial Completion of the
work in October 2024. The DB is anticipating the Final Completion of all work in the first quarter of
2025.
The various responsible project stakeholders are:
• MassDOT Highway Division – project owner, also providing project management; note that
MassDOT is also considered the AHJ (Authority Having Jurisdiction) regarding tunnel code
compliance issues.
• MassDOT District 6 – responsible for design and construction oversight (supported by various
MassDOT technical departments).
• JF White / Delve Underground – Design-Builder responsible to design and construct the project
scope (note Delve Underground is the Engineer of Record) – including multiple subcontractors
and subconsultants.
• WSP – preliminary designer / owner’s engineer.
Major Progress as of December 17, 2024
During 2021, MassDOT advanced the concept for this project, and successfully procured the DB
team (using a Best Value process) with a Notice to Proceed in December 2021.
During 2022, the DB (with support and oversight from MassDOT) progressed its work
consisting of planning, design, and construction. Per the Design-Build process, these three phases
overlapped. Planning work consisted of mobilization (such as submittals via the implementation of
Sharepoint), investigation, and planning. The design work consisted of the DB breaking down the
overall work into discrete design packages and submitting them for approval. The construction work
performed during 2022 primarily occurred during weekend tunnel closures (21 total). This work
included removal of existing wall panels and ceiling panels and repairs to the existing concrete,
structural work in the below-roadway plenum, boat wall repairs, and continuing the submittal
process.
During 2023, a major decision was made when MassDOT directed that the 2023 sixteen-week
tunnel closure would be revised to include one eight-week closure in 2023 and one eight-week
closure in 2024. The DB (with support and oversight from MassDOT) continued the construction

Project Name: Roadway Ceiling, Arch & Wall Reconstruction and Other Control Systems in Sumner Tunnel - Boston
Owner’s Representative Contract Number: 120630
Project Number: 606476
Construction Contract Number: 114947
work, during weekend tunnel closures as well as during the eight-week full tunnel closure. One
significant effort during 2023 (and 2024) was an outreach initiative by MassDOT District 6. During
the weekend closures, check-in calls were held each afternoon with the various stakeholders to
ensure proper communication and coordination was taking place. Problem areas were discussed, and
solutions were put forth. In addition, during the full 8-week tunnel closure, daily calls took place.
District 6 also implemented a “war room” in its headquarters building to improve its communication
and oversight.
During 2024, the DB continued to perform its work during night lane closures, full weekend
closures, and a full 4-week summer tunnel closure. One major scope change, with positive budget
and schedule consequences was to revise the roadway deck – the original plan was to use hydro-
demolition and Ultra High-Performance Concrete; this was revised to limited repair and overlay with
hot mix asphalt. As part of this change, the original Incentive clause was agreed to be revised to be
tied to the new tunnel closure protocol. The project work consisted of the installation of the precast
arch segments, the installation of the ceiling system, the repair and repaving of the roadway deck
structure, the East Boston barrier wall and walkways, fireboard installation, fire alarm installation,
AM/FM wires, CCTV cameras and fire standpipe as well as miscellaneous structural steel, systems
work, and work in the ventilation buildings. In October 2024, the project’s Substantial Completion
milestone was achieved.

Areas of Concern
The following items are, in the opinion of the OR, the most important issues to monitor for
project success.
1. Achieve Final Completion by first quarter of 2025 – one long lead item (an overhead sign) is
driving the date to late January. In addition, the DB must complete the remaining punch list items
acceptably.
2. Resolve all outstanding change order pricing – the great majority of the items have been resolved
and have been documented in change orders, but there are a few remaining open items that require
resolution, including the final credit for the revised scope of the roadway deck.

III CHAPTER 303 OF THE ACTS OF 2008 AREAS OF INTEREST
Peer Review
The peer review requirement for this project was satisfied by MassDOT’s use of AECOM to
perform this service. AECOM submitted a report titled “Sumner Tunnel Rehabilitation Peer Review”
dated September 12, 2019. In that report, AECOM performed a peer review of the proposed
rehabilitation plans developed by WSP. AECOM noted the tunnel is in poor condition, with the most
critical need relating to overhead concrete deterioration. Subsequently, - WSP reconciled the repair
details to be used as the basis for the MassDOT Base Technical Concept, to be advanced by the DB
in their final design documents.
In addition, during the final design phase of this project, a peer review of the Design-Builder’s
design submittals has been performed by WSP, in support of MassDOT’s Highway Division forces.
This O.R. participates in the peer review process by monitoring the design submittal review process
to help ensure that any identified conflicts or errors are corrected or mitigated at each stage.
During the construction phase of this project, this O.R. also partially satisfies the peer review
obligations by attending regular project review meetings where construction issues, conflicts, and
resolutions are discussed; walking the site to observe major construction activities; and monitoring the
change order process to ensure any proposed design changes are evaluated for their impacts to the
project’s quality, budget, or schedule goals.
Value Engineering
MassDOT performed a Value Engineering study of the project in August 2016. This VE study
was performed in a series of four meetings. The result of the meetings was documented in a
spreadsheet titled “Preservation calculations”, dated November 9, 2016. As this project has been
advanced using the DB procurement process, including Alternative Technical Concepts, no additional
VE studies were required, per MassDOT policy.

Construction Contract Number: 114947
Cost Recovery
At this time no items have been identified as potential cost recovery issues;
this is not unusual in the Design-Build project delivery process. It should be noted
that any initial identification of a Cost Recovery issue does not necessarily mean
that cost recovery is due; a formal evaluation must still be followed. The
undersigned Owner’s Representative will continue to monitor issues and, with
MassDOT Highway Division, will discuss referral to the Cost Recovery Standing
Committee. For any issue referred for Cost Recovery, the new MassDOT Highway
Division Cost Recovery Procedure (SOP No. HED-70-01-1-000, dated 8/07/17)
shall govern. In order to perform the legislative mandate of being the primary
manager of Cost Recovery, the Owner’s Representative will follow the referenced
SOP. This SOP, as modified for projects with an Owner’s Representative,
describes the role of the Owner’s Representative and includes a Cost Recovery
Standing Committee, which oversees the work of separate and issue-specific Cost
Recovery Review Panels and Cost Recovery Evaluation Committees, which will
be convened as necessary. It should be noted that the resolution of cost recovery
issues typically is not completed until the end of a project. to ensure working
relationships are maintained and insurance notifications occur only once a final
decision has been made.
In addition, in moving forward with future resolution of Cost Recovery
issues, it is recommended that the resolution follow the path set forth in the recently
developed Draft MassDOT Owner’s Representative Standard Operating
Procedures.

Cost – the estimated budget (with details described above) includes a project
encumbrance of $156,676,206. Based on the work identified to date and described
above, this Owner’s Representative believes that this estimate is reflective of the
cost for the work to be performed and the budget is sufficient.
Schedule - the project duration was established by MassDOT via the use of two
independent scheduling consultants, with a reconciled completion schedule. The
key milestones were established based on (1) NTP – December 30, 2021, (2) 36
Allowable Weekend Closures – before May 2023, (3) one Full Tunnel Closure (16
weeks from May to September 2023), (3) sixteen Allowable Weekend Closures
after September 2023. With those assumptions, the original milestones were:
➢ Full Beneficial Use (MS 3) – 9/05/23
➢ Substantial Completion (MS 2) – 12/31/23
➢ DB Field Completion (MS 1) – 1/31/24

Project Name: Roadway Ceiling, Arch & Wall Reconstruction and Other Control Systems in Sumner Tunnel - Boston
Owner’s Representative Contract Number: 120630
Project Number: 606476
Construction Contract Number: 114947
As noted previously in this Report, MassDOT directed that the 16-week full tunnel closure
be revised to two separate tunnel closures – an 8-week closure in 2023 and a 4-week closure in
2024. As a result of that direction, the milestones were revised to:
➢ Full Beneficial Use (MS 3) – 8/30/24
➢ Substantial Completion (MS 2) – 10/28/24
➢ DB Field Completion (MS 1) – 11/27/24
As of the date of this Annual Report, the contractor has achieved MS 3 and
MS 2 but is forecasting completion and achievement of MS 1 in the first quarter
of 2025. MassDOT has agreed that the delay is excusable and is processing a
change order to provide a time extension.

I. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The scope of the I-93 Tunnel Ramps Lighting Replacement Project (MassDOT Project
Information #609346) includes the removal and replacement of the tunnel lighting system in the
I-93 Ramps and Vent Buildings. The existing linear fluorescent / low pressure sodium lighting
will be replaced with a new LED tunnel lighting and control system. The project purpose is to
provide adequate visibility in the tunnel for driver safety while using the least amount of energy.
MassDOT is advancing this project using the Design-Bid-Build (DBB) method of project delivery.
WSP is the project’s Engineer of Record (EOR), tasked with developing the final design and
procurement documents, and providing construction phase services. JF White is the contractor.
The lighting system is being replaced due to a series of defects including corrosion due to

(Authority Having Jurisdiction) regarding tunnel code compliance
issues;
o MassDOT District 6 – responsible for design and construction oversight
(supported by various MassDOT technical departments);
o WSP – final designer / Engineer of Record;
o Mott MacDonald – independent consultant to MassDOT, performing Peer Review
services; and
o JF White Construction Company (JF White) – the construction contractor
responsible to procure and install the new lighting system
Major Progress as of December 1, 2024
The bulk of 2024 was spent by JF White in getting the project started with
contract submittals. The contract wad awarded to JF White and notice to proceed was
achieved in April 2024. Following NTP, JF White began mobilizing including starting
the submittal process via the SharePoint program.
As part of its submittal process in August 2024, JF White received acceptance
(logic only at this point) of its baseline schedule, and has submitted its first payment
requisition.
Budget
In accordance with the contract award, the project budget has the following breakdown:
ITEM TOTAL
Bid $ 58,326,165
Allowance $ 3,138,000
Contingency $ 8,748,925
TOTAL $ 70,213,090
As of the date of this report, the contractor has not been paid.
As of the date of this report, MassDOT anticipates being able to use funding from
the Central Artery Repair and Maintenance (CARM) Trust Fund for the bulk of the funding for

the project, in addition to MHS funding to make up for the required state funds.
Schedule / Project Milestones
The project is advancing with the following expected key milestones:
Contractor Field Completion 10/12/28
In August, JF White’s baseline schedule (reflecting the above milestone date) was
accepted for logic purposes.
Areas and Issues of Concern
 Traffic Impacts – the work is intended to be performed during lane
closures, and this project includes many roadways and ramps; the
traffic impacts must be carefully planned and coordinated – both within
this project and with other projects.
 Quality control – in implementing similar projects (replacement of
tunnel lighting) throughout the downtown Boston area, MassDOT has
had the opportunity to see its QC processes evolve, including QC
oversight at off-site manufacturing facilities. This topic will continue
to be a very important focus for the project team.
Project Photographs
No Photos have been taken to date. The Contractor is just beginning the field
reconnaissance work to determine the required temporary lighting needs. No
actual physical work has begun as of this report.

III CHAPTER 303 OF THE ACTS OF 2008 AREAS OF INTEREST
Peer Review
The peer review requirement for this project is satisfied by MassDOT’s use of Mott
MacDonald to perform this service. As of the date of this Annual Report, Mott MacDonald’s peer
review is complete, and the results were reconciled with MassDOT and WSP before the final
package was advertised.
During the construction phase of this project, WSP, as EOR, will continue to provide
construction phase services. In addition, this O.R. will satisfy the peer review obligations by
attending regular project review meetings where construction issues, conflicts, and resolutions are
discussed; walking the site to observe major construction activities; and monitoring the change
order process to ensure any proposed design changes are evaluated for their impacts to the project’s
quality, budget, or schedule goals.
Value Engineering
MassDOT did not perform a traditional Value Engineering study, due to the nature of this
project. It is important to note that this project is one of a series of projects developed to replace
the lighting system throughout the CA/T tunnels. Several projects have been completed or are
nearly complete. The technical solution for this project must essentially follow those previous
projects, as MassDOT does not want to have dissimilar systems.
Another potential candidate for value engineering is the wireway. MassDOT performed a
pilot test to study whether the wireway could remain in place; unfortunately, that study determined
the wireway had to be replaced.
Cost Recovery
At this time no items have been identified as potential cost recovery issues.

Extra Work Orders
As of the date of this report there have been no EWOs accepted.
Cost – the estimated budget of $70 M needs to be monitored during construction, especially
the status of contingency.
Schedule - the project duration was established by MassDOT via the use of an independent
consultant’s time determination schedule, with a reconciled completion schedule. The final
milestone dates were reflected in the bid package. The contractor has recently received
approval (logic only at this point) of its baseline schedule, reflecting a forecast of achieving
Final Completion within the required time.

Owner’s Representative Contract Number: 120636
Project Number: 606522
Construction Contract Number: 121394
I. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The Andover-Lawrence Bridge Bundle, Replacements at I-495 over Route 28 and MBTA is a
design build project to design and construct six bridge replacements located in the town of
Andover. Bridges to be replaced include I-495 NB and SB over Route 28 NB, Route 28 SB and
the MBTA Commuter Rail just to the north of the Route 28 interchange. The project also
includes geometric and safety improvements on I-495 between Corbett Street in Andover to the
I-495/Route 114 interchange in Lawrence.
As a regionally and nationally significant roadway, I-495 sees high daily vehicle volumes. On an
average day, about 113,000 and 30,000 vehicles use I-495 and Route 28 respectively. I-495 also
saw 206 reported crashes between 2012 and 2017, including 2 fatalities. Many of these crashes
occurred while merging and diverging from I-495 at the Route 28 and Route 114 interchanges.
The project limits extend along Interstate 495 from the Corbett Street overpass in Andover to
approximately 400 feet west of the I-495 Bridge over Route 114 in Lawrence. Within these
limits are milling and overlay, minor widening, and safety improvements to I-495, the I-495
ramps to and from Route 28 NB and SB and to Route 28 NB and SB in the area under the
bridges. The approximate project length on I-495 is 1.06 miles and on Route 28 is .16 miles. The
length of the project on I-495 is primarily determined by the need for crossovers to manage
traffic during construction.
The horizontal and vertical alignment of I-495 is generally retained, except this project includes
operational and safety improvements, Shoulders within the Route 28 interchange areas will be
widened to help provide recovery area and emergency stopping/breakdown space. A full-length
acceleration and deceleration lane is proposed between the Route 28 and Route 114 interchanges
along both I-495 NB and SB to improve merge/diverge operations.
The I-495 NB and SB typical cross section within the Project consists of three 12-foot travel
lanes with 12-foot wide minimum inside shoulders and 12-foot minimum outside shoulders.
There is a 28-foot-wide grassed median. Within the Route 28 NB and SB interchange, the I-495
NB and SB typical cross section consists of three 12-foot travel lanes, a 12- foot
acceleration/deceleration lane, and a 12-foot minimum overbuild area in the median and a
minimum 10 foot inside and outside shoulder. The “overbuild” area is a result of the construction
of the bridges and crossovers in the median area during Phase 1 construction. A concrete median
barrier will separate the NB and SB barrels. A full-length acceleration and deceleration lane will
be provided between the Route 28 and the Route 114 interchanges along I-495 NB and SB.
A locus map of the study area is shown in Figure 1. This project is being constructed by the

II. ANNUAL REPORT
Contract Scope of Work
Proposed improvements include:
• The full replacement of the six bridges carrying I-495 NB and SB traffic over Route 28
NB and SB and the MBTA. The new structures will include full substructure and
superstructure replacements consistent with the cross section of the approach roadways.
The structures will meet current statutory loading requirements as well as seismic
requirements and all applicable bridge design criteria.
• Reconstruction of I-495 and Route 28. The roadway reconstruction will be a
combination of mill and overlay of the existing roadway with full depth construction to
achieve super elevation.
• Local widening of I-495 to provide wider shoulders and improved acceleration and
deceleration lanes between the Route 28 and Route 114 interchanges.
• Minor widening on Route 28 to facilitate bicycle lanes and provide ADA compliant
ramps and sidewalks.
• Highway lighting improvements to illuminate the ramps and auxiliary lanes.
• Utility coordination, protection, and relocation including coordination with utilities,
MBTA (Keolis), CSX and Amtrak for the replacement of bridges over active tracks,
coordination with National Grid for the relocation by National Grid from overhead to
underground of power lines along the MBTA right-of-way, coordination and relocation
of MBTA Positive Train Control (PTC) cable and conduit, and protection in place of
MassDOT ITS infrastructure and relocation of ITS camera and support.
• Drainage upgrades include improvements and modifications to drainage systems for
temporary and permanent conditions, construction of stormwater control measures for
water quality improvements, and installation, maintenance, and removal of all erosion

Areas of Concern
The following represents the primary areas of concern identified at this stage in construction:
Currently the project schedule shows that both substantial completion and contractor field
completion are both behind schedule by 69 days. The Middlesex Corporation is blaming this
delay solely on the fact that the MBTA right of entry permit wasn’t issued within the
contractually allotted time. However, MassDOT believes that this delay in whole or part is a
concurrent delay due to the fact that Middlesex didn’t have design approvals for the required
work.

BOSTON – Replacement of Allston I-90 Elevated Viaduct, B-16-359, Including Interchange
Reconstruction, Beacon Park Yard Layover and West Station
Project Number: 606475
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
This project is still in the preliminary design/public outreach phase, as has been the case
for the last ten years. The major hurdle consuming much of the last several years is coming
up with a “Preferred Alternative” for inclusion in the Massachusetts Environmental Policy
Act (MEPA) and National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) submittals, especially in
reference to the “throat” area. The “throat” area is the multi modal corridor between Boston
University and the Charles River. Included in this corridor are 8 lanes of I-90 Highway, 4
lanes of Soldiers Field Road, two tracks for commuter rail, two tracks connecting the Grand
Junction Railroad, and the Paul Dudley White bicycle and pedestrian path. The Draft
Environmental Impact Report (DEIR) was submitted in December 2017 which outlined the
project but was non-committal on a preferred alternative for the “throat” area of the project.
The Task Force had been pressuring for the elimination of the I-90 Viaduct, preferring that
all the modes of transportation mentioned above be at-grade.
Finally, in September 2021, the “Preferred Alternative” which eliminates the viaduct and
has all modes of transportation at-grade was selected. This was significant because now
the Design Team has one design path to focus on. MassDOT had been heavily considering
rebuilding the viaduct due to concerns of permitting construction in the Charles River. At
that time,the selected alternative included constructing a 22’ wide elevated platform over
the river to accommodate the Paul Dudley White Pathway. At this point, the design reduced
some of the lane widths in an effort to construct the pathway along the banks of the river
utilizing vertical retaining walls requiring no structure in the river.
Another significant development was that after a Bridge Inspection by the design team for
the viaduct, it was determined that a repair contract would be needed for the viaduct. It is
needed in order to continue to serve the motoring public until such time as the structure
can come down in another 10-15 years. This time frame includes time to complete the
preliminary design, time to select a Design-Build team, time for them to complete the final
design, and time for other aspects of the project to be constructed while still serving the
motoring public. This repair contract is addressed in a separate Annual Report.
The Design Team is working towards submitting the first draft of the Joint
DEIR/Supplemental Draft Environmental Impact Report (SDEIR) in the fall of 2025, the
MEPA Final Environmental Impact Report (FEIR) in summer 2026, and receiving an
Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs (EOEEA) Secretary’s Certificate
in the fall of 2026.
Procurement for a Design-Build Team is to begin in the September 0of 2026 and last until
the end of 2027. After a team has been selected, their final design could take up to two
years and thus physical construction may not begin until 2028 and is expected to last 6-8
years.
The cost of the project is currently loosely estimated to be $2.07B.

BOSTON – Replacement of Allston I-90 Elevated Viaduct, B-16-359, Including Interchange
Reconstruction, Beacon Park Yard Layover and West Station
Project Number: 606475
ANNUAL REPORT
Purpose / Background:
Initially the primary need for this project was the deterioration of the two bridge structures,
B16-359 4RX and 4RY, which are commonly referred to as the Allston Viaduct (or MTA
Structure #111) that carry Route I-90 Eastbound and Westbound over CSX Railroad,
Amtrak, and the MBTA Commuter Rail. The two separate structures each carry 4 lanes of
I-90 Eastbound and 4 lanes of I-90 Westbound. The average daily traffic counts conducted
in 2018 found that roughly 145,000 vehicles per day travel this route. Built in 1965, the
bridges are made of steel stringers/girders with a cast in place concrete deck, and consist
of 29 spans. The entire length is 2,487 linear feet, with the longest span being 115 linear
feet. The deck out-to-out widths are 54 feet each. The results of a routine bridge inspection,
dated February 2, 2015, scored the deck, superstructure, and substructure for both bridges
at a 4, which translates to poor condition due primarily to advanced section loss,
deterioration, and spalling.
Once the decision was made to go forward with All Electronic Tolling on I-90, and in
conjunction with CSX Railroad selling a portion of the Beacon Park Yard to Harvard
University, the opportunity to re-align I-90 to better meet today’s AASHTO Standards, the
opportunity to reconfigure the vastly substandard interchange, the chance to make the area
more multi-modal friendly for bicyclists, pedestrians, and a transit connection (new West
Station) all were recognized as very important goals. With the latest scheme, at least seven
more bridges will be eliminated, in addition to the viaduct itself.
Project Location:
The approximately 150-acre project site includes the area encompassed by the former
Beacon Park Yard (BPY), until recently owned by CSX-Boston and now by Harvard
University, and the existing I-90 interchange. The site is described as being somewhat
triangular in shape and bounded by Cambridge Street to the northwest, Soldiers Field Road
to the southeast extending from Cambridge Street southwardly primarily to the
Commonwealth Avenue Bridge over I-90 to the east, and bounded on the south side by I-
90 and the southern edge of BPY from the Commonwealth Avenue Bridge over I-90 to
Cambridge Street (See Figure 1).

Reconstruction, Beacon Park Yard Layover and West Station
Project Number: 606475
Figure 1 – Locus Map
Contract Scope of Work (as currently anticipated):
General
Route I-90 is to be straightened by taking advantage of aligning it through Beacon Park
Yard; reconstruction of Beacon Park Yard itself to accommodate an MBTA commuter rail
layover facility; construction of a new “West Station”; reconstruction of Cambridge Street;
construction of a new east-west roadway currently referred to as Cambridge Street South:
expansion and enhancement of parkland along the Charles River; improved and expanded
bicycle and pedestrian access including a transitway connection from Malvern Street to the
new West Station; and reconstruction of the Lincoln Street Pedestrian Bridge. The primary
goals of the project are for design and safety improvements to the roadway network,
facilitate future development in the Allston neighborhood, enhancement of multi-modal
access within and to Allston, and creation of expanded and more open space.
The approximately 150-acre project site includes the area encompassed by the former
Beacon Park Yard and bounded by Ashford Street to the south, the Commonwealth Avenue
Bridge and Soldiers Field Road to the east, and Cambridge Street to the north and west.

BOSTON – Replacement of Allston I-90 Elevated Viaduct, B-16-359, Including Interchange
Reconstruction, Beacon Park Yard Layover and West Station
Project Number: 606475
Route I-90 (MassPike) Proposal
As stated above, I-90 is to be straightened by taking advantage of aligning it through
Beacon Park Yard. Further to the east, the roadway will no longer be on an elevated
platform (viaduct) and will be reconstructed at-grade along with the Soldiers Field Road,
4 sets of railroad tracks, and the Paul Dudley White Bicycle/Pedestrian pathway. The I-90
roadway cross-section will include 4 – 11’travel lanes with 4’ shoulders on both the median
side and the low speed travel lane side; both eastbound and westbound.
Interchange/Cambridge St. Proposal
The current interchange does not meet interstate highway standards set by AASHTO
guidelines. These deficiencies include a decrease in travel lanes within the interchange
(four lanes to three), the location of piers within narrow curbed medians, improperly
designed exit ramps, insufficient acceleration and merging lengths, left-hand exits, and
non-compliant shoulder widths and lateral offsets.
With the changeover to All Electronic Tolling (AET) having taken place, the opportunity
to reconfigure the interchange and surface streets is available. The latest proposed
alternative will result in the elimination of bridges B-16-353, 354, 366, 355, 366, 357, and
359. Cambridge Street is proposed to have a slight adjustment to the alignment prior to
meeting the existing bridge over Soldiers Field Road (to remain) and will have 6 at- grade
signalized intersections that will meet with Boston’s Complete Street guidelines. A new
two-way roadway, currently referred to as Cambridge Street South, running somewhat
parallel to Cambridge Street to the south would begin at the Cambridge Street/North
Harvard Street intersection to the west and connect to Soldier’s Field Road (SFR)
eastbound and westbound on its east end. New roadways running somewhat parallel and
somewhat north and south are proposed at Seattle Street Connector, Stadium Way
Connector, Cattle Drive Connector, and East Drive Connector. Also, the above mentioned
Seattle Street Connector and Cattle Drive Connector will convey traffic to and from the
proposed West Station. A new bicycle/pedestrian access is proposed to connect the East
Street Connector to the parkland along the Charles River on the east side of SFR by sinking
SFR through the use of a “boat section”. A pedestrian, bike, and transit connection will
connect Malvern St. to the new West Station. Also, as part of this proposed project, the
Lincoln Street Pedestrian Overpass will be re-designed and re-built.
Recently the proposed Cambridge St. By-pass has been added to the project. This roadway
will begin at its intersection with Cambridge St. just to the north east of the Cambridge St.
Bridge and run easterly above the railroad tracks to connect to the new West Station.
Finally a Southside Buffer Pathway pedestrian and bike path has been added which would
connect the Lincoln Street ped bridge to the Harry Agannis Way crossing over I-90 and
SFR. This path is designed at the southernmost length of the project.

BOSTON – Replacement of Allston I-90 Elevated Viaduct, B-16-359, Including Interchange
Reconstruction, Beacon Park Yard Layover and West Station
Project Number: 606475
Commuter Rail Layover Facility Proposal
A new commuter rail layover facility will be constructed within Beacon Park Yard to meet
the current need for additional layover capacity for MBTA commuter rail operations. The
need was identified as part of the South Station Expansion Project. This will include
providing a layover area that can accommodate eight 9-car consists.
West Station Proposal
A new MBTA commuter rail station will be designed and constructed along the
Framingham/Worcester commuter rail tracks originally slated to be in the existing location
at the southern boundary of the project site, and with the commuter layover yard to be to
the north of these tracks. Harvard approached the design team about flipping the station to
the north and the layover area to the south, as it would afford more buildable air rights area.
After discussions a “modified flip” scheme was agreed upon to be studied.
The station will consist of three platforms serving 4 sets of tracks with access provided via
a station structure located at a mezzanine level over 3 platforms. Local street connections
for pedestrians and bicycles to Malvern Street and Babcock Street, as well as a bus port
with connections to the I-90 interchange via a viaduct loop over the layover facility will be
incorporated as part of this project. The major benefit to Harvard is the option for them or
others to build a “Cambridge Street Bypass”. This street would connect Cambridge Street
from just to the northeast of the Cambridge Street Bridge over I-90 to the proposed West
Station on an elevated platform over I-90 and the rail yard. The DEIR anticipated the
construction of West Station to be around the year 2040, once demand increases due to
Harvard’s buildout of the area; but due to overwhelming pressure from the stakeholders,
its construction will be included as part of the overall package. Currently the Average Daily
Trips (ADT) is around 18,000 users with some increased demand anticipated as the Allston
area is built out including on air rights Harvard University has over the Pike. A Commuter
Rail vision is still being worked on for a new rail operating model.
Soldiers Field Road Proposal
Soldiers Field Road (SFR) will be realigned southward and westward to create additional
accessible open park space closest to the Charles River, providing separation from the
roadway and the Paul Dudley White Bike Path. As mentioned above, SFR will be lowered
at a new interchange with the new proposed Cambridge Street South by using a “boat
section” and thereby providing street level access to the Paul Dudley White Parkland from
the Allston neighborhood. The proposal for the SFR outbound exit to Cambridge/River
Street is to keep the exit but only for right turns onto River Street leading to Cambridge.
Proposed Paul Dudley White Pathway
In the “throat”area which is a narrow stretch of land towards the southeast section of the
project, various options for the Paul Dudley White pathway are being considered.

Contract Status
The project is currently in the conceptual design phase and at this point is planned to be
designed and constructed through the design-build process.
Major Progress as of November 30, 2024
In order to advance the concept that was agreed upon on September 29, 2021 for the
preferred alternative (all at-grade for “throat area”) and submitted in the Notice of Project
Change as part of the MEPA process on August 1, 2022, the Task Force was split into four
separate focus groups. This strategy was done in an effort to come to agreement on the
issues individually as compared to keeping them together and not reaching decisions.
The four major groups and their area of focus are listed as follows:
Throat Area/Charles River
This group focused on shoreline treatment, the Paul Dudley White Path, and commuter
impacts.
Multimodal Local Street Network
This group focused on dedicated bus lanes, sidewalks and cycle tracks, and travel/turning
lanes.
Multimodal Local Connections
The focus of this group is the Franklin Street pedestrian bridge, Agannis pedestrian bridge,
and the South Side Buffer Path.
Rail and Transit
This group focused on rail and platform infrastructure, bus concourse configuration, and
commuter impacts.
The Design Team has continued to work through the SDEIR/DEIS process and is expected
to be submit in the fall of 2025, and completing the FEIR process by summer of 2026,
with a FEIS Record of Decision by the fall of 2026.

BOSTON – Replacement of Allston I-90 Elevated Viaduct, B-16-359, Including Interchange
Reconstruction, Beacon Park Yard Layover and West Station
Project Number: 606475
Budget:
The most recent loosely estimated construction budget for the project is 2.07 billion dollars.
In 2022, the Design Team submitted an application for Federal Discretionary Grant
Funding under the Mega Projects Designation for $1.2 billion but the project was not
selected for the grant at the time. Last year two grants were applied for under separate
designations as part of USDOT monies. One was a Mega Grant for $200M and the other
was $500M for a Reconnecting Communities and Neighborhoods (RCN) grant. The project
received a grant for $335.4M as a portion of the $500M RCN Grant above. This money
needs to be committed by September of 2026.
It is planned that $200M will come from tolls, $450M from the Fair Share tax, $470M in
bonds and loans, $90M from Harvard University, $10M from Boston University, and
$100M from a City of Boston/Harvard University agreement. It is thought that maybe the
Reconstruction of the Cambridge Street Bridge could be eligible for other funding sources
amounting to $150M.
This will present a need to cover the $165M not awarded under the RCN Grant and $130M
for the MBTA Layover yard.
Schedule:
• Project is in the Public Outreach aspect of the Preliminary Design phase and will
most likely continue into the Fall of 2026.
• Working to file a Supplemental DEIR in fall of2025, a NEPA DEIS in the fall of
2025, and MEPA FEIR in summer of 2026.
• Receive EOEEA Secretary Certificate by fall of 2026.
• Continue working on a Financing and Mitigation Plan.
• Design-Build Procurement could possibly begin in the fall of 2026 and last until
the end of 2027.
• Final Design by Design-Build Team is estimated to begin in the spring of 2028
with construction estimated to begin in the sometime in 2028 and be completed
2034-2036.
Areas and Issues of Concern
A major area of concern is the escalating cost of the project and arriving at an equitable
Financing Plan for various stakeholders in order to cover the $2B estimated construction
cost.
13

BOSTON – Replacement of Allston I-90 Elevated Viaduct, B-16-359, Including Interchange
Reconstruction, Beacon Park Yard Layover and West Station
Project Number: 606475
Another area of concern is assuring the roadways are above the 50 yr. flood plain. This has
to do with vertical geometry as it is affected by existing conditions such as meeting the
Grand Junction RR Bridge over the Charles River, especially with limitations on the
allowable slope of the railroad tracks.
Permitting the modifications to the shoreline to build the Paul Dudley White pathway on
instead of the prior proposed elevated platform in the Charles River will most likely be a
concern throughout the design process.
Earlier in the year it was stated that there would no longer be a layover area for parking of
trains during off-peak hours. Recently Amtrak indicated that they would like to see the
space back in the project and it is being reconsidered.
Another concern is that the $335M RCN Grant discussed above needs to be committed by
September of 2026. The Design Team is seeking a Categorical Exclusion from the MEPA
permitting process to in order to allow for the Cambridge Street Bridge, the Franklin Street
Pedestrian Bridge, and the sound barriers to be part of this commitment and thereby not
forfeit the Grant.
Other major concerns involving the permitting of the project include:
• Other impacts to the Charles River along the riverbank.
• Impacts to commuters
• Air quality
• Noise/vibration
• Groundwater
• Impacts to wetlands
• Impacts to waterways
• Floodplain/Resiliency
• Stormwater/Water Quality
• Historic District impacts
• Hazardous Materials
• Aesthetic/Visual Impacts

Peer Review
As part of the initial design phase for this project, a peer review will be performed at each
stage of the design by MassDOT’s Highway Division forces independent of the project
designer. As the procurement process develops, Addenda will be issued, primarily
involving better defining the final product desired. These reviews will be performed to
identify conflicts or errors that should be corrected or mitigated at each stage before the
design progresses to the next stage. The O.R. expects to participate in the peer review of
the design by reviewing and commenting on the consultant’s peer review report, attending
project review meetings, and design milestone reviews.
During the construction phase of this project, this O.R. will be satisfying the peer review
obligations by attending regular project review meetings where construction issues,
conflicts, and resolutions are discussed; walking the site to observe major construction
activities; and participating in the change order process, to review and comment upon any
proposed design changes and their impacts to the project’s quality, budget, or schedule
goals. In addition, the O.R. will also participate in the review process of the design
submitted by the Design Build Entity.

Holyoke-West Springfield
Rehabilitation of Route 5 Riverdale Road
Project No. 604209
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
This corridor rehabilitation project is along the Route 5 Corridor (Riverdale Street) and is
essentially split in to two distinct segments having differing work items. (Please refer to
page 4 for a drawing of the two specific work areas.) The first section begins at the ramp
system to Route 91 in West Springfield and runs northward for approximately 2.42 miles
to a short distance north of its intersection with Main Street in Holyoke. The work in this
section includes concrete pavement rehabilitation and full depth replacement along Route
5.
The second section begins approximately 0.64 miles south of the beginning of
section one above and runs southerly along Route 5 in West Springfield from its
intersection with Monterey Street to its intersection with East Elm Street, a distance of
approximately 0.92 miles. Work in this section consists primarily of pedestrian and
bicycle improvements.
The proposed improvements consist of narrowing the roadway from Main Street to
Highland Avenue, realignment of Brush Hill Avenue and Wayside Avenue to form “T”
intersections, traffic improvements, shared use path on the western side of the northern
section of the project, bicycle accommodations for both directions of travel, drainage
improvements, and utility modifications.
The roadway work is comprised of concrete pavement rehabilitation, full depth
cement concrete pavement, pavement narrowing, excavation, borrow, grading,
installation of hot mix asphalt pavements, installation of curb and sidewalk, removing
and replacement of highway guard rails, pavement markings, traffic signal
modifications, catch basins, and other incidental work.
As part of this project, the Town of West Springfield is upgrading their water lines under
non-participating items funding and Eversource is replacing it natural gas lines. Verizon
will also be upgrading their system.

construction conflicts and Verizon and Eversource are moving poles due to conflicts as
well.
Major Progress as of November 30, 2024
Since starting physical construction in April of this year, the focus has primarily been on
installing the waterline which is complete. Now the contractor will be working on doing
service connections into next year. Some minor drainage work was completed as well.
Eversource Gas has relocated their section of gas line due to conflicts and Eversource
Electric together with Verizon began relocating poles.

Schedule Update 10 indicates that the Contractor Field Completion is 40 days behind
schedule and is currently forecast to be on September 17, 2027 versus August 8, 2027.
The Contractor feels they can make all of this time up by working into the winter
shutdown installing drainage. The District is reviewing this because it will require much
patching and other similar items.
Areas and Issues of Concern
It is too early in the project for any concerns to have arisen. One concern may be with
the placement of the cement concrete pavement which has not been done is decades and
will require extra attention by the Contractor.

MONTGOMERY-RUSSELL –Bridge Rehabilitation Westfield River Bridge –I-90 Over U.S.-20,
Westfield River, and CSX
Project No. 606866
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Bridge M-30-008=R-13-018 is an eight-span bridge carrying two lanes of I-90 Eastbound
and two lanes of I-90 Westbound over US Route 20, the Westfield River, a CSX Railroad
track, and over other terrain, between the Towns of Montgomery and Russell. Originally
constructed in 1957, a deck replacement and minor repairs project was completed in
1990. In 2010-2011 the truss gusset plates and top flanges of some of the cantilever
brackets were repaired and some portions of the bridge were repainted under a
rehabilitation contract.
The superstructure in spans 1 and 2 consists of ten continuous rolled steel beams. The
superstructure in spans 3, 4, 5 and 8 consists of girder-floor beam-stringer system. The
superstructure in spans 6 and 7 consists of a continuous steel deck truss with built up
riveted box section as truss members. The substructure consists of two solid stem
reinforced concrete piers at piers 1 and 2, two reinforced concrete columns with a
reinforced concrete cap at piers 3 and 4, three solid stem reinforced concrete piers with
columns at piers 5, 6, and 7; and two reinforced concrete stub abutments.
The contractor had been rehabilitating the concrete and steel substructure since work
began in 2020. As part of the contract, no work was to begin on the deck, barriers and
roadway until all of the steel work below has been completed. This work to
rehabilitate/replace steel components of the truss substructure was essentially completed
in April 2023. After that the deck and other topside components work began and is
tracking to be completed in the spring of 2026.
The designer of the project was Parsons. The project was awarded to Daniel O’Connell’s
Sons on March 23, 2020.

MONTGOMERY-RUSSELL –Bridge Rehabilitation Westfield River Bridge –I-90 Over U.S.-20,
Westfield River, and CSX
Project No. 606866
ANNUAL REPORT
Contract Scope of Work:
This contract consists of the rehabilitation of the bridge and associated roadway work to
restore the roadway to existing conditions after traffic modifications are no longer
necessary. The bridge will be rehabilitated in multiple stages to facilitate traffic flow at
full capacity during the entire project. Essentially the project consists of substructure
concrete repairs at piers and abutments, steel repairs, replacement, and painting, changing
out rivets to high strength bolts, cleaning and painting structural steel, repairs to or
replacing the deck concrete, adding highway lighting, protective screening, drainage
improvements, upgrading to single faced barrier meeting current standards and adding a
new median barrier.
Major Progress as of November 30, 2024
As part of Stage I traffic pattern which prepared both eastbound and westbound high
speed lanes to receive two lanes of eastbound traffic, the median barrier was removed,
repairs to the deck concrete were completed, the area received a new membrane for
waterproofing, and was paved and striped towards the end of 2023. With eastbound
traffic now on the recently completed Stage I repaired deck, Stage II work began this
year.
Stage II consisted of demolition of the outside eastbound barrier (south side of bridge) as
well as sections of the deck, both full depth and partial depth excavation. The limits of
the full deck excavation measured from the outside face of the proposed fascia barrier to
the centerline of the exterior stringer. The partial depth excavation measured 3 feet from
the inside limit of the full depth. This excavation was done in order to create a moment
slab to support the new fascia barrier, protective screening, and light poles.

Westfield River, and CSX
Project No. 606866
Other work during this stage involved soundings to determine random areas of deck
needing replacement, new approach slabs, new end posts, new drainage, lighting, new
expansion joints, membrane waterproofing, paving, and line striping.
Stage III construction involved a narrow section (approximately 12’ in width) between
Stages I and II in order to complete deck work, approach slab, expansion joints,
waterproofing and paving.
The contractor has been working on Stage IV since the summer which is essentially to
same work as in Stage II only on the north side of the structure. Painting of the
substructure steel has been ongoing for the year.

Schedule:
The Contractor was issued a Notice to Proceed on March 23, 2020. The Substantial
Complete date was set for November 25, 2024 but was extended to November 3, 2025 for
inclusion of fabrication and installation of 6 foot high barrier fencing to be placed on top
of the exterior barriers for the entire length of the structure instead of just over the
railroad.
5

MONTGOMERY-RUSSELL –Bridge Rehabilitation Westfield River Bridge –I-90 Over U.S.-20,
Westfield River, and CSX
Project No. 606866
The contractor maintains that having to mill, place membrane, and pave at the end of
each Stage of the construction versus just doing it all at once at the end of the project as
they had planned has set the project back. Now they are forecasting Substantial
Completion to be June 14, 2026. Part of this current 223 day late completion is the
anticipated winter weather preventing placement of the membrane and final paving at the
end of the various Stages.
Full Beneficial Use is currently set at October 8, 2025 but the Contract is forecasting this
date for April 15, 2026, 189 days behind schedule.
Areas and Issues of Concern
With the way the schedule is slipping due to issues stated above, paving may be right up
against the winter of 2025/2026.
Financially, quantity overruns plus the addition of the 6 foot high barrier fencing being
added to the project, the Current Estimate at Completion stands at $57,050,333 while the
Encumbered Amount was $55,292,599 leading to request a likely add funds amount of
$1.75M. As the project nears completion, the budget will have to be closely monitored
and additional funds may need to be added to the contract.

Peer Review
As part of the initial design phase for this project, evidence supports that a peer review
was performed at each stage of the design by MassDOT’s Highway Division forces
independent of the project designer. As the design process developed, Addenda was
issued, primarily involving better defining the final product desired. These reviews were
performed to identify conflicts or errors that should be corrected or mitigated at each
stage before the design progressed to the next stage.
During the construction phase of this project, this O.R. is satisfying the peer review
obligations by attending regular project review meetings where construction issues,
conflicts, and resolutions are discussed; walking the site to observe major construction
activities; and participating in the change order process, to review and comment upon any
proposed design changes and their impacts to the project’s quality, budget, or schedule
goals.
Value Engineering
It is the Owner’s Representative’s understanding that no Value Engineering process was utilized
on this Project.
Cost Recovery
There have been overruns of quantities relating primarily to initial access issues and
another being additional quantity of an item that was brought to light and added during
the Addendum process but never carried into the contract documents.
Another overrun has come to light during the painting process. The contract documents
reflect a quantity of 46,000 sf with no calculations to substantiate the quantity. The final
quantity is actually nearing 85,000 sf and leading to an overrun of nearly 39,000 sf at a
cost of $3,802,960. Because this item will end up more than 25% over the original
quantity, MassDOT is currently asking for this item price to be renegotiated.

Project No. 606866
It does not appear that these rise to the level of errors leading to cost recovery with
conventional industry thinking being that if these quantities were included in the original
contract, the cost to the contract would have been that much more at bid time.
It should be noted that any initial identification of a Cost Recovery issue does not
necessarily mean that cost recovery is due; a formal evaluation process must still be
followed. The undersigned Owner’s Representative will continue to monitor issues and,
with MassDOT Highway Division, will discuss the need for its referral to the Cost
Recovery Standing Committee. For any issue referred for Cost Recovery, the current
MassDOT Highway Division Cost Recovery Procedure (SOP No. HED-70-01-1-000,
dated 8/7/17) shall govern. In order to perform the legislative mandate of being the
Primary Manager of Cost Recovery, the Owner’s Representative will follow the
referenced SOP. This SOP, as modified for projects with an Owner’s Representative,
describes the role of the Owner’s Representative and includes a Cost Recovery Standing
Committee. This committee oversees the work of separate and issue-specific Cost
Recovery Review Panels and Cost Recovery Evaluation Committees, which will be
convened as necessary.

NORTHAMPTON– Bridge Replacement N-19-059 Interstate I-91 Over US 5 and
B&M Railroad; and N-19-060 Interstate Over Hockanum Road; and
Improvements to Interstate 91 Interchange 18
Project No. 606552
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The two bridges (4 structures in all) carrying Interstate 91 both Northbound and
Southbound were constructed in 1965 and have not been reconstructed. (Please refer to
Page 4 for Project Orientation) The Northbound and Southbound bridges over Route 5,
etc. are each about 416 feet in length with 6 spans and are made up of cast in place
concrete decks over steel stringers. The bridges over Hockanum Road are each about 83
feet in length and are made up of cast in place concrete decks over steel stringers in one
continuous span.
Based on inspections completed in early 2020, the conditions of the substructures were
all determined to be level 4 which equates to poor condition with advanced deterioration
and spalling. The condition of the superstructure of I-91 SB over Route 5, etc. was
assessed a 3 which equates to Serious Condition – Loss of section, deterioration, spalling,
or scour have seriously affected primary structural component. The superstructure for the
I-91 NB over Route 5, etc. was assessed as a 4 (see above). The superstructure for I-91
SB over Hockanum Road was assessed a 5 which equates to Fair Condition and the I-91
NB over Hockanum Road was assessed a 6 which means Satisfactory Condition.
The two I-91 SB bridges carry an average daily traffic count of more than 29,000
vehicles per day and the two I-91 NB bridges carry roughly 24,000 vehicles per day.
Currently US Route 5 does not meet the current Healthy Transportation Initiatives goals.
This project will construct a sidewalk on the west side of the roadway and provide
bicycle accommodations on both sides of the roadway, as well as provide crosswalks at
the ramp intersections. Widening of turning lanes will be provided and also traffic
signals, new signage, and pavement markings will be installed.
During construction, I-91 traffic will be maintained through the use of a temporary
roadway and Acro Panel bridge through the median. Also, temporary widened ramps
will be utilized for on-ramp and off-ramp motorists while construction of the permanent
ramps is completed.
The project was designed by Parson’s and bids were opened on December 8, 2020. The
project had an estimated construction duration of nearly 30 months. The winning bidder
was J.F. White with a low bid of $42,115,135.60.

ANNUAL REPORT
Contract Scope of Work:
The project consists of the complete reconstruction of the superstructures and
substructures of four bridge structures carrying Interstate 91 Northbound and Southbound
over US Route 5 and the B&M Railroad; and Interstate 91 over Hockanum Road. Traffic
will be conveyed through this section by constructing a temporary two-lane roadway and
building two temporary bridges for a distance of nearly 4400 linear feet in the median
area. Temporary on-ramps and off-ramps will be constructed as well.
Also as part of the project, US Route 5 will be reconstructed including a new drainage
system, addition of a sidewalk on the west side of the road, bicycle lanes on both sides of
the roadway, and new traffic signals. The project includes safety improvements to I-91,
US Route 5, and the ramp systems. Route 91, US Route 5, and Hockanum Road will all
be milled and overlayed with hot mix asphalt.
Major Progress As Of November 30, 2024
For the year, much has been accomplished including the following:
• Opening I-91 SB to traffic over the newly completed bridges #59 and #60 over
Route 5, B&M Railroad, and Hockanum Road. (I-91 NB was reopened to traffic
in 2023).
• Acro Panel bridges used in the median for temporary traffic have been
disassembled and removed from the jobsite.
• The temporary roadway in median has been excavated and the median restored to
its preconstruction condition..
• All paving on I-91 leading to and from the new bridges has been completed. Also
all paving of the ramp system, Route 5 and Hockanum Road has been completed
to the project limits.
• Construction of sidewalks, guard rail, detention ponds and line striping has been
completed.

1,332 Days from NTP – (10/1/24) – Contractor did forecast this at 9/09/24, and then
11/5/24, with it not being met yet.Full Beneficial Use is defined as: The majority of
contract Work has been completed and the asset(s) has been opened for full multi-modal
transportation use, except for limited contract work items that do not materially impair or
hinder the intended public use of the transportation facility. All anticipated lane takings
have been completed, except for minor, short term work items.
During the placement of guardrail behind the sidewalk on Route 5, it was discovered that
there is a conflict with the embedment length of the posts being limited by the footing
from Pier 2. Only recently has a proposed solution been approved and the modification
to the steel posts is out at a fabrication shop.

1,353 Days from NTP (10/22/24) has been extended to 11/12/24 – Contractor had
forecast this for 10/22/24, but due to the conflict described above, the new date is
currently anticipated for 12/10/24.
Substantial Completion is defined as: A walkthrough of the entire contract Work has
been performed by the Resident Engineer, a Punch-list has been generated and the Work
required by the contract, including paper work, has been completed, except for work
having a contract price of less than one percent of the adjusted total contract price,
including overruns, underruns and all contract amendments. All material submittals have
been received by the District Materials Lab.
Milestone #1 - Contractor Field Completion
1419 Days from NTP (12/28/24) – Contractor forecasts 1/23/25 (see conflict
description above)
Contractor Field Completion is defined as: All physical contract work is complete
including punch-list. The Contractor has fully de-mobilized from field operations.
Areas and Issues of Concern
The guard rail post conflict with the Pier 2 footing is the only thing keeping this project
from being complete at this time.
Also, having to most likely encumber an additional $700K for completion due to
approved extras, and overruns.

Peer Review
As part of the initial design phase for this project, a peer review was performed at each
stage of the design by MassDOT’s Highway Division forces independent of the project
designer. These reviews were performed to identify conflicts or errors that should be
corrected or mitigated at each stage before design progressed further. The O.R. was not
engaged with this project during the design and thus did not participate in the peer review
of the design by reviewing and commenting on the consultant’s peer review report,
attending project review meetings, and design milestone reviews.
During the construction phase of this project, this O.R. will satisfy the peer review
obligations by attending regular project review meetings where construction issues,
conflicts, and resolutions are discussed; walking the site to observe major construction
activities; and participating in the change order process, to review and comment upon any
proposed design changes and their impacts to the project’s quality, budget, or schedule
goals.
Value Engineering
It is the Owner’s Representative’s understanding that no Value Engineering process was utilized
on this Project.
Cost Recovery
One situation that may rise to the level of cost recovery entails when it was noticed that
there were somewhat significant discrepancies between the survey provided and the
design plans. This issue came to light while attempting to install drainage structures on
Route 5. The design for this area is to essentially meet existing grade but the structures
when installed were sticking out of the pavement by as much as 2.5 feet. The contractor
suspended operations on the Route 5 work from late September until early/mid
November of 2021 when revised numbers were provided by the Design Consultant. They
still continued to work on the temporary roadway in the median which is part of the
Critical Path to completion for the project. The contractor was given additional days on
the contract for this situation and a settlement was negotiated for $50,132.53 (.1% of
projected project cost).
There have been overruns of quantities primarily relating primarily to the calculations for
earthwork items in the median temporary bypass roadway..

I. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The Natick Bridge Replacement, N-03-020, Route 27 (North Main Street) over Route 9 (Worcester
Street) and Interchange Improvements is a design-build project to replace the structurally deficient
bridge carrying Route 27 (North Main Street) over Route 9 (Worcester Street) in the town of Natick,
Massachusetts, with new bridges designed for a 75-year design life and improvements within the
interchange by designing a modified diverging diamond configuration.
As part of this Project, the existing Route 27 (North Main Street) bridge over Route 9 (Worcester
Street) will be replaced by three (3) independent structures (two structures for vehicles and one
structure for a shared use path). This configuration was deemed to be highly desirable by the Natick
community as part of the robust public engagement process. Providing an interchange that improves
safety, mobility, and operations was of utmost importance. Equally important was an interchange
configuration that was context sensitive and that would support Natick’s quality of life.
The limits of roadway construction extend along Route 9 (Worcester Street) approximately from the
Cochituate Rail Trail bridge over Route 9 (Worcester Street) to Linden Street, a distance of
approximately 0.74 miles. Within the limits of the Project, Route 9 (Worcester Street) has an ADT of
65,200 and a posted speed limit of 50 miles per hour. The Project includes median replacement, a
cement concrete sidewalk along the north side of Route 9 (Worcester Street), a buffered HMA shared
use path along the south side of Route 9 (Worcester Street), roadway milling and pavement overlay,
and localized widening of Route 9 (Worcester Street) to accommodate improved acceleration and
deceleration lanes in the Route 27 (North Main Street) interchange area. The work also includes
roadway reconstruction of Route 27 (North Main Street) to construct a Modified Diverging Diamond
Interchange consolidating Route 9 (Worcester Street) on-ramps and off-ramps to improve
merge/diverge operations.
The limits of roadway construction extend along Route 27 (North Main Street) from approximately
Running Brook Circle to Bacon Street, a distance of approximately 0.48 miles. Within the limits of
the Project, Route 27 (North Main Street) has an ADT of 23,050 and a posted speed limit of 30 miles
per hour. Work along Route 27 (North Main Street) includes roadway reconstruction and realignment,
an HMA shared use path, and a cement concrete sidewalk.
Roadway work includes vertical and horizontal alignment adjustments, variable depth milling and
HMA overlay; full-depth HMA construction, roadways for staged construction, grading, walls, granite
curb, HMA shared use paths, cement concrete sidewalks, temporary and permanent drainage
3

including detention ponds, highway lighting, temporary and permanent traffic signals, relocation of
utilities, signage, pavement markings, and other related work.
A locus map of the study area is shown in Figure 1. This project is being constructed by the
Massachusetts Department of Transportation (MassDOT) - Highway Division with Greenman-
Pedersen, Inc. as the Preliminary Designer of Record. The project was procured as a Design-Build
Contract with the Project awarded on August 22, 2024, with the apparent Best Value being the
Design-Build Team of McCourt Construction Company Inc. of Boston, MA as the Prime Contractor
and Jacobs Engineering Group Inc. as Design-Build Designer of Record. Notice to Proceed was
issued to McCourt on September 19, 2024. Since the NTP was issued McCourt has been advancing
various design elements, coordinating with affected utility companies, meeting with
abutters/community, and field survey.

Areas of Concern
The following represents the primary areas of concern identified in design and at this stage in construction:
Utility coordination, protection, and relocation for the replacement of bridges over Route 9.
Coordination with Eversource for the relocation of poles and overhead power lines.
Removal of the existing bridge over Route 9
The roadway and bridge construction staging will require careful consideration given the
traffic volumes and lanes restrictions. The Design-Builder will be responsible for providing
early release design packages to address staging and presenting the intended methods of traffic
control to maintain traffic throughout construction.
Impacts to abutters due to construction, specifically traffic/access and noise impacts.
CHAPTER 303 OF THE ACTS OF 2008 AREAS OF INTEREST
Peer Review
During the construction phase of this project, Jacobs, as Engineer of Record, is continuing to provide
construction phase services. In addition, this O.R. will continue to partially satisfy the peer review obligations
by attending regular project review meetings where construction issues, conflicts, and resolutions are
discussed; walking the site to observe major construction activities; and monitoring the change order process
to ensure any proposed design changes are evaluated for their impacts to the project’s quality, budget, or
schedule goals.
