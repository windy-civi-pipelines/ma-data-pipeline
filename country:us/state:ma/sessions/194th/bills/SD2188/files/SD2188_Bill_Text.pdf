SENATE DOCKET, NO. 2188 FILED ON: 1/17/2025
SENATE . . . . . . . . . . . . . . No.
A petition (accompanied by bill) of Kirstin Beatty for legislation to establish a commission to
limit first responder radiation exposure.
The Commonwealth of Massachusetts
_______________
In the One Hundred and Ninety-Fourth General Court
(2025-2026)
_______________
An Act establishing a commission to limit first responder radiation exposure.
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives in General Court assembled, and by the authority
of the same, as follows:
1 SECTION 1. The legislature finds and confirms all of the following:-
2 Whereas, advances in technology and warfare have significantly increased the allotted
3 time of exposure, power density, and type of exposure to non-ionizing radiation for first
4 responders, increasing exposures even when recommendations for occupational exposure are
5 already much higher than for the general population.
6 Whereas, occupational exposure to non-ionizing radiofrequency and microwave radiation
7 is linked to harm such as significant increases in leukemias, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and all
8 other cancers in the Polish military (Szmigielski, 1997); increasing mortality from cancer in U.S.
9 Navy Korean War veterans with a dose-response effect from low, intermediate, and high radar
10 exposures (Cherry, 2002); and clusters of testicular cancer in police from hand-held radar (Davis
11 & Mostofi, 1993).

12 Whereas, a study of firemen with a cell tower adjacent to their fire station showed brain
13 abnormalities in a 2004 SPECT scan, delayed reaction time, lack of impulse control, cognitive
14 impairment, and symptoms reflective of poor well being, which led the International Association
15 of Fire Fighters to pass Resolution 15 opposing cell towers on fire stations.
16 Whereas, expert Barry Trower completed two reports on the proposed and then later
17 instituted Tetra communications systems for the British police; he predicted greater, swifter harm
18 due to more aggressive pulsed radiation, higher frequencies, and thermal power density, and the
19 British police did report swift increases in illness and disease upon implementation of the Tetra
20 system.
21 Whereas, the following investigative commission invites experts and stakeholders to find
22 solutions to reduce non-ionizing radiation exposures for first responders.
23 SECTION 2. (a) Resolved, there shall be a special commission to examine the impacts of
24 technology on police, firefighters, and emergency and security personnel in Massachusetts, with
25 the goal of protecting the physical and mental condition of the personnel while ensuring the
26 Commonwealth's residents and businesses have access to a competent emergency and security
27 forces.
28 (b) The commission shall review and identify with respect to first responders and
29 electromagnetic radiation emitted by technology that ranges from 0 hertz to 300 gigahertz: (1)
30 existing conditions of radiation exposure for first responders; (2) potential exposures from new
31 or proposed technologies; (3) existing or potential exposures from the relevant emergency
32 communication systems including FirstNet; (4) the known impact of radiation exposures from
33 technology on physical and mental health of first responders; (5) the potential or surmised impact
2 of 4

34 of radiation exposures from technology on first responders; (6) whether any existing and
35 proposed radiating technologies can be engineered for greater safety, hard-wired, or removed
36 from use; (7) an assessment of first responder radiation exposures in relation to value for society;
37 (8) additional proposals for reducing exposures to radiation from technology, including
38 identification of potential stakeholders and authorities that can help improve conditions; (9) best
39 practices with respect to reducing exposure to radiation from technology.
40 (c) The special commission shall consist of the following members or of their designees:
41 the Commissioner of the department of telecommunications and cable; the senate and house
42 chairmen of the Joint Committee on Telecommunication, Utilities and Energy who shall serve as
43 the additional co-chairs; (1) representative of the Massachusetts Broadband Institute; (1)
44 representative of the Massachusetts Coalition of Police; (1) representative of the Massachusetts
45 Chiefs of Police Association; (1) representative of the State Police Association of Massachusetts;
46 (1) representative of the Professional Firefighters of Massachusetts; (1) representative of the
47 Massachusetts National Guard nominated by the Adjutant General; (1) representative of the
48 Massachusetts Medical Society; (2) representatives or nominees of the International
49 Commission on the Biological Effects of Electromagnetic Fields; (1) representative selected by
50 the governor.
51 (d) The special commission shall file an initial report of its recommendations and drafts
52 of proposed broadband legislation or regulations, if any, on subsection (b) with the clerks of the
53 house of representatives and the senate, the President of the Senate, The Speaker of the House of
54 Representatives, the Governor and the chairs of the house and senate committees on ways and
55 means not later than December 31, 2026. The special commission shall file a final report
3 of 4

56 providing a full report regarding said subsection (b) not later than March 1, 2027, but may file
57 intermittent reports in advance.
