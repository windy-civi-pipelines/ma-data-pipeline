Dear Members of the General Court:
I am pleased to submit this Report to the Legislature: Commonwealth Virtual Schools, pursuant
to G.L. c. 71, § 94(p).
A Commonwealth Virtual School (CMVS) is a public school operated by a board of trustees
whose teachers primarily teach from a remote location using the Internet or other computer-
based methods and whose students are not required to be located at the physical premises of the
school. Like a charter school, a virtual school is an autonomous, single-school district that
operates independently of any existing school district.
The Board of Elementary and Secondary Education (Board) grants a certificate to the board of
trustees of a virtual school for not less than three years and not more than five years, as
determined by the Board. The school and its board then become a state entity, directly
accountable to the Board and the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education
(Department). A virtual school may not discriminate in the enrollment of students based on race,
color, national origin, creed, sex, gender identity, ethnicity, sexual orientation, mental or physical
disability, age, ancestry, athletic performance, special need, English language proficiency, or
academic achievement.
The Board has granted two virtual school certificates, one to the Greater Commonwealth Virtual
School (GCVS) and one to the TEC Connections Academy Commonwealth Virtual School
(TECCA). Both schools enroll students statewide. These schools enrolled a total of 3,716
students as of October 1, 2021 (FY2022 is the period addressed in this report).
If you have any questions about this report, please contact Director Alison Bagg at 781-338-3218.
Sincerely,
Jeffrey C. Riley
Commissioner of Elementary and Secondary Education

Introduction
The Department of Elementary and Secondary Education respectfully submits this Report to the
Legislature: Commonwealth Virtual Schools pursuant to G.L. c. 71 § 94(p):
“On or before September 1, the commissioner shall prepare a report on the
implementation and impact of this section, including, but not limited to:(1) the fiscal
impact on sending districts; (2) any necessary adjustments to tuition rates, including
whether the amount should vary based on grade or type of school and the appropriate
mechanism for funding virtual schools; (3) information on course completion and student
attendance and participation rates; (4) the academic achievement of students attending
commonwealth virtual schools; (5) the level of supervision or support needed for students
in elementary and middle school; (6) the support necessary or helpful to ensure that
students successfully complete online courses; (7) the professional development virtual
school teachers require; (8) the appropriate enrollment limit for a virtual school, if any,
including information about wait lists; and (9) the need for any changes to the
commonwealth virtual school program.”
A Commonwealth Virtual School (CMVS) is a public school operated by a board of trustees
where Massachusetts licensed teachers primarily teach from a remote location using the Internet
or other computer-based methods, and where students are not required to be located at the
physical premises of the school. The statute permits up to ten virtual schools to operate in the
Commonwealth at any time.
As of FY22, the Board of Elementary and Secondary Education (Board) has granted two virtual
school certificates, one to the Greater Commonwealth Virtual School (GCVS) and one to the
TEC Connections Academy Commonwealth Virtual School (TECCA).1 Both schools enroll
students statewide. As of October 1, 2021, these schools enrolled a total of 3,716 students
including 1,030 from GCVS and 2,686 from TECCA (FY22), the period addressed in this report.
Greater Commonwealth Virtual School
• Greater Commonwealth Virtual School (GCVS), formerly Greenfield Commonwealth
Virtual School (GCVS), first opened in 2010 as the Massachusetts Virtual Academy of
Greenfield (MAVA) under the innovation school law (G.L.c.71, § 92). On January 2, 2013,
Governor Patrick signed into law Chapter 379 of the Acts of 2012, “An Act Establishing
Commonwealth Virtual Schools” (Act), most of which is codified as G.L. c. 71, § 942. By
statute, MAVA ceased to exist on July 1, 2013. Section 6 of the Act required the Board of
Elementary and Secondary Education (Board) to grant a certificate to operate a
Commonwealth of Massachusetts Virtual School (CMVS) to MAVA upon submission of a
timely application that addressed the information specified in the statute.
1 GCVS has a three-year certificate to operate from July 1, 2019 through June 30, 2022. TECCA has a five-year
certificate to operate from July 1, 2017 through June 30, 2022.
1

• GCVS received its certificate on June 25, 2013, and began operating as a CMVS on July 1,
2013, serving 750 students in grades K through 12.
• On June 2014, the Board voted to place GCVS on probation for the remainder of the school's
certificate term (until June 30, 2016) with conditions requiring the school to: submit board of
trustees minutes to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education (Department);
submit a final contract with K12, Inc.; align its curriculum with the Massachusetts
curriculum frameworks; submit a comprehensive evaluation of its academic program; submit
an action plan outlining strategies to improve academic performance; and demonstrate
significant academic improvement by 2015.
• In February 2016, the Board renewed the school’s certificate and extended the school’s
probationary status. The probationary conditions required the school to: limit its maximum
enrollment to 750 students for grades K through 12; submit board of trustees meeting
materials; submit weekly student enrollment reports; submit projected budgets to meet
requirement for enrolling at least 5 percent of students from Greenfield; submit a corrective
action plan to ensure at least 95 percent of students and student groups participated in
MCAS; establish an escrow account to pay for potential closure; and to demonstrate
significant and sustained academic improvement by 2017.
• In October 2017, the Board approved an amendment for the school to terminate its contract
with K12, Inc. and to adopt the Canvas learning management system by Instructure, Inc. The
school adopted a new curriculum, including EngageNY (grades K through 5, English
language arts, and mathematics), and Florida Virtual Schools Global (FLVS) (grades 6
through 12, all subjects).
• In January 2018, the commissioner approved an amendment for the school to amend its
mission statement. In March 2018, the Board extended the school’s probationary status,
maintained the prior probationary conditions, and added a new condition related to the
provision of services for English learners.
• In March 2019, the Board removed the school from probation and renewed the school’s
certificate with conditions requiring the school to: submit board of trustees meeting materials
and weekly student enrollment reports; enroll a maximum of 750 students; provide the
Department with updates on the implementation of its plan for serving English learners;
submit a comprehensive evaluation of the school’s mathematics, English language arts, and
science programs by 2019; submit a comprehensive action plan for improving academic
performance and addressing other areas for improvement by 2019; and demonstrate
academic success by providing evidence that the school has exhibited significant and
sustained academic improvement in mathematics, English language arts, and science on the
statewide assessment for all student subgroups by 2021.
• In June 2019, the GCVS teachers voted to join a union and are now an affiliate of the
American Federation of Teachers (AFT). GCVS has negotiated the teachers’ contract with
the AFT. In April 2021, the contract was ratified and signed by all teachers and the GCVS
Board of Trustees.
• In October 2019, the commissioner approved a number of amendment requests to change
elements of GCVS’ educational program by adding supports for students (an in-person
support center for students who struggle to advance in the school’s academic program),
adopting two new curricula (Accelerate Education for grades K-5 and Edgenuity for a 9-12
asynchronous program), and offering students dual enrollment at Greenfield Community
College (GCC).
2

• In July 2020, the commissioner approved an amendment to change the school’s curriculum
for grades K through 5 from Accelerate Education to the newly released curriculum from
FLVS for all subjects for synchronous programs. This change allowed the school to
implement FLVS across all grades.
• In July 2020, the commissioner approved an amendment to increase the school’s maximum
enrollment by an additional 250 seats, for a new maximum enrollment of 1,000 until the end
of the school’s current certificate (June 30, 2022). This granting of additional seats was
explicitly conditioned on GCVS demonstrating that its K-12 curriculum is fully aligned with
the Massachusetts curriculum frameworks by September 15, 2020. After a second request
from GCVS, the maximum enrollment was amended again, in September 2020, with an
increase of 50 additional seats, for a new maximum enrollment of 1,050 until the end of the
current certificate.
• In December 2020, the Department conducted an Accountability Review of GCVS.
• In January 2021, the commissioner approved the school’s request to report on a new
accountability plan.
• In September 2021, the commissioner approved an amendment to change the school’s name
from Greenfield Commonwealth Virtual School to Greater Commonwealth Virtual School
and to change the Learning Management System (LMS) from Canvas to Schoology.
• In February 2022, the commissioner approved the school’s request to increase its maximum
enrollment by an additional 150 seats, for a new maximum of 1,200 seats, in order to meet
elevated demand for students who are unable to attend school in person because of a medical
condition. That same month, the commissioner approved the school’s request to amend its
enrollment policy to provide the first order enrollment preference to students who are unable
to attend school in-person because of a medical condition.
• The school has implemented leadership changes during the certificate term. In July 2019,
GCVS created the position for and hired the family engagement coordinator. In August 2019,
a vice principal for grades K through 5 was hired and in 2021 the vice principal’s role was
expanded to oversee grades K through 8. In September 2019, the asynchronous Edgenuity
program director was hired. In June 2020 the responsibilities of the director of special
education and student services position were split into two roles: the director of special
education and the director of accountability and student services. In August 2020, a vice
principal for grades 9 through 12 as hired. In December 2020, GCVS hired a new director of
instructional technology. In August 2021, GCVS hired a new support center coordinator.
• The school’s board of trustees oversees the executive director, who oversees the school
administration. The school administration includes the director of business services, the
director of teaching and learning (also referred to as the principal for grades K through 12),
the flex program director (to oversee the asynchronous Edgenuity program), the director of
information technology, the director of special education, the director of instructional
technology, the director of accountability and support services, and the family engagement
coordinator. The principal oversees the assistant principal for grades K through 8, the
assistant principal for grades 9 through 12, and the guidance counselors. The principal and
assistant principals share oversight of the general education teachers. The director of
accountability and support services oversees English as a Second Language (ESL) and Title I
teachers, and the director of special education oversees the special education teachers, the
support center coordinator, and the school adjustment officer. The family engagement
coordinator oversees the family engagement liaisons.

• Pursuant to CMR 52.11, and in accordance with the Department’s guidelines, on June 30,
2021, GCVS applied to renew its certificate. The Department conducted a renewal inspection
on November 22-23, 2021 and the report from this inspection was issued to the school in
March 2022. At its March 22, 2022 meeting, in accordance with G.L. c. 71, §94, and 603
CMR 52.00, the Board renewed the certificate of GCVS for an additional four-year period
from July 1, 2022 through June 30, 2026 with a maximum enrollment of 1,200 students.
Further, pursuant to 603 CMR 52.12, the Board imposed conditions that the school is
required to meet as recommended by Commissioner Jeffrey C. Riley in his memorandum to
the Board dated March 22. 2022.
TEC Connections Academy Commonwealth Virtual School
• The Education Cooperative (TEC) as the “founder entity” submitted an application for a
virtual certificate to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education (Department) in
the spring of 2013; on February 25, 2014, the Board of Elementary and Secondary Education
(Board) approved a 3-year operating certificate for TEC Connections Academy
Commonwealth Virtual School (TECCA) under the state's virtual school legislation (Chapter
379 of the Acts of 2012).
• TECCA opened on July 1, 2014, serving 1,000 students in grades K-12. The school expanded
to its original maximum enrollment of 2,000 by the third year of its operation.
• In February 2017, the Board renewed the school’s certificate for a five-year term (until June
20, 2022) with conditions requiring the school to submit a detailed plan for ensuring that not
less than 95 percent of students participate in the Spring 2017 MCAS tests by March 2017
and submit a detailed plan for serving students who are English language learners by April
2017. TECCA met both conditions by the corresponding deadlines.
• In June and August 2014, the commissioner approved two amendment requests allowing the
school to add three new board members to TECCA’s board of trustees.
• In November 2015, the commissioner approved an amendment for the school to amend the
financial and operational arrangement between TECCA and Connections Education (CE), the
entity that provides the school with its LMS, curriculum, and additional services as specified
in the contract.
• In May 2016, the commissioner approved an amendment for the school to amend its board of
trustees’ bylaws.
• In September 2016, the commissioner approved an amendment for the school to amend its
contract with CE regarding human resources management.
• In August 2018, the commissioner approved an amendment to increase the school’s
maximum enrollment by an additional 300 seats, for a new maximum enrollment of 2,300.
• In August 2018, the Commissioner approved four additional amendment requests: to amend
TECCA’s contract with CE, to amend TECCA’s mission statement and add two additional
pathways (i.e., accelerated, extended programs), and to add a new board member to
TECCA’s board of trustees.
• In November 2019, the commissioner approved an amendment for the school to amend its
contract with CE to include accounting (expense reporting, tracking, receivables, facilitating
accounts payable excluding any payment to CE), audit support, and provision of Human
Resources support during a time of administrative transition.
4

• In August 2020, the commissioner approved the school’s request to increase its maximum
enrollment by an additional 400 seats, for a new maximum of 2,700 in order to meet elevated
demand for virtual programming due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
• In August 2020, the commissioner approved an amendment for the school to amend its
contract with CE to include partner school leadership and strategic account relationship
support.
• In March 2020, TECCA teachers started negotiations to become an affiliate of the
Massachusetts Teacher’s Association (MTA). In June 2020 MTA was certified at TECCA
and negotiations for a contract continued until September 2021. Negotiations are currently
suspended and will recommence in January 2022.
• On January 20-21, 2021, the Department conducted an Accountability Review of TECCA.
The review team issued ratings in the areas of academic program success, organizational
viability, and faithfulness to certificate, the guiding principles of virtual school
accountability.
• In February 2021, the commissioner approved the school’s requests to amend the school’s
enrollment policy and to report on a new accountability plan.
• In October 2021, the commissioner approved the school’s request to increase its maximum
enrollment by an additional 300 seats, for a new maximum of 3,000 in order to meet elevated
demand for students who are unable to attend to school in-person because of the student’s
medical condition. That same month, the commissioner approved the school’s request to
amend its enrollment policy to provide the first order enrollment preference to students who
are unable to attend school in-person because of the student’s medical condition.
• The school has implemented leadership changes during the certificate term. In January 2020,
the interim superintendent created the district leadership team including new leadership
positions of director and assistant director of elementary school, director and assistant
director of middle and high school, dean of students, 504 coordinator, and registrar. In July
2020, the interim superintendent transitioned to TECCA’s new superintendent, replacing the
former superintendent who had served in the role since July 2015. In August 2021, the school
restructured its leadership team at the elementary, middle, and high school to replace the
director and assistant directors with an elementary school principal, middle school principal,
and high school principal.
• The school’s board of trustees oversees the superintendent, who oversees the district
leadership team. The school district leadership team includes the business manager, human
resources, executive assistant to administration, director of assessment, instruction, and
professional development, director and assistant director of counseling services, director of
special education, assistant director of special education, principal of elementary school,
principal of middle school, and principal of high school. The superintendent and school
principals share oversight of the general education teachers. The director and assistant
director of counseling services share oversight of the school’s guidance counselors, family
engagement coordinators, social workers, and 504 coordinators. The director of special
education oversees special education teachers.
• On August 17, 2021, TECCA requested another contract amendment with Connections
Education. The commissioner approved this amendment on August 23, 2021. The
amendment removed PSLT Support Services, Pathways programs, and Chromebook
technology. The fee schedule was adjusted, reducing substitute teacher fees, monthly fees for
5

students without PSLT, alternative pricing for staff not using laptops, and increasing elective
course instruction fees.
• Pursuant to CMR 52.11, and in accordance with the Department’s guidelines, on June 9,
2021, TECCA applied to renew its certificate. The Department conducted a renewal
inspection on October 9 and November 20, 2021 and the report from this inspection was
issued to the school on March 2022. At its March 22, 2022 meeting, in accordance with G.L.
c. 71, §94, and 603 CMR 52.00, the Board renewed the certificate of TECCA for an
additional four-year period from July 1, 2022 through June 30, 2026 with a maximum
enrollment of 3,000 students. Further, pursuant to 603 CMR 52.12, the Board imposed
conditions that the school is required to meet as recommended by Commissioner Jeffrey C.
Riley in his memorandum to the Board dated March 22, 2022.
Fiscal Impact on Sending Districts
The virtual school statute, at G.L. c. 71, § 94(k), funds a CMVS based upon the funding for
school choice under G.L. c. 76, § 12B: the school district of residence of each student enrolled in
the CMVS is charged a set tuition, and the Department transfers the funds from the district to the
CMVS. Tuition is based on full year enrollment and is prorated if a student is enrolled in the
CMVS for only a portion of the school year.
The default tuition rate for a student enrolled in a CVMS is the school choice tuition rate of
$5,000.3 The Board, in consultation with the Operational Services Division (OSD), may approve
a rate higher than $5,000 in CMVS certificates provided the rate does not exceed the state
average per pupil foundation budget for students of the same classification and grade level. G.L.
c. 71, § 94(k); 603 CMR 52.07(1). At its December 7, 2017 meeting, the Board voted to amend
the certificates of GCVS and TECCA to specify a tuition rate4 of $8,265 per pupil, effective for
FY19, with $75 per pupil retained by the Department for program administration. Additionally,
the Board voted to delegate to the Commissioner authority to adjust this rate annually for
inflation for the remainder of the schools' current certificates and amend their certificates
accordingly. In March 2022, the Board approved certificates for both CMVS that included the
higher rate and continued the Commissioner’s authority to adjust the tuition rate annually for
inflation. The Board-approved CMVS tuition rate does not change over the course of a fiscal
year.
In FY22, the state average per pupil foundation budget was $13,1425. In FY22, districts were
charged $8,863 per full-time pupil enrolled in a CMVS6. In FY22, GCVS and TECCA received a
per pupil tuition amount of $8,788, which equals the district per-pupil tuition amount, less $75
per pupil retained by the Department for program administration, as permitted by statute.
In FY22, the virtual schools received $35,645,416 in tuition payments from 249 districts of
residence. While enrollment varies from district to district, the following six districts accounted
3 The tuition for special education students is the cost of providing the special education required by the student.
G.L. c. 71, § 94(k).
4 Until December 2017, the CMVS tuition rate remained at $6,700, less $75 per pupil retained by the Department
(total rate of $6,625 per pupil paid to each CMVS).

for approximately 21 percent of virtual school tuition and enrollment: Springfield (5.6 percent),
Boston (5.2 percent), Worcester (4 percent), New Bedford (2.5 percent), Chicopee (2 percent)
Fall River (2 percent), and Wachusett (1 percent). A summary of FY22 tuition payments is
provided in Appendix B.
Course Completion and Student Attendance and Participation Rates
GCVS and TECCA provide 425 instructional hours in kindergarten, 900 hours in grades 1-8, and
990 hours in grades 9-12 in accordance with state regulations.
Both schools offer flexibility in terms of the time of day when students participate. Teachers and
“learning coaches” (students’ parents/guardians) take attendance and monitor the hours of
schoolwork completed. In FY22, GCVS reported an attendance rate of 96.4 percent and TECCA
reported an attendance rate of 86.6 percent.
While each school’s calendar provides for holidays and vacations during which teachers are not
available, students may continue to do schoolwork and access the online learning management
system at any time during the school year. Attendance is based on courses completion and not
“seat time” – while each school expects all students to complete their coursework by the end of a
typical semester or school year, students may proceed through the curriculum at their own pace.
Course completion data for GCVS and TECCA are provided in Tables 1 and 2. Because many
students arrive in school after the beginning of the school year or transferred out of the school
prior to the end of the school year, course completion data are only reported for students enrolled
in the schools for a full academic year, as defined in Table 1 on next page.

According to the enrollment policies of both schools, eligibility for enrollment in a specific grade
requires a student to have successfully completed the preceding grade. Each school reviews
academic documentation to ensure accurate grade level assignments and course placements.
Both TECCA and GCVS reported having greater demand than in past years. Since the
emergence of COVID-19 and the subsequent closures of brick-and-mortar schools statewide,
families have sought admission to both CMVSs in unprecedented numbers. During the FY22
school year the waitlists for GCVS and TECCA each averaged approximately 500 students.
Academic Achievement
The purpose of the statewide accountability system is to provide clear, actionable information
about school and district performance. The Department did not issue school, district, or state
accountability determinations for the 2019-2020 school year due to the cancellation of state
assessments and school closures related to COVID-19. Additionally, the Department did not
issue school, district, or state accountability determinations in 2021; spring 2021 MCAS
administration included a partial test for grades 3-8 and some grade 3-8 students took the
assessment remotely. In 2022, schools administered full MCAS assessments in grades 3-8 and
10. The Department published some, but not all, of the indicators included in the statewide
accountability system. A summary of performance data from 2022 for both schools is provided
in Appendix C. More detailed information related to student performance is included in the
Department’s Profiles, GCVS can be found at 2022 Accountability Data - Greater
Commonwealth Virtual District (39010000) (mass.edu) and TECCA can be found at 2022

Supervision and Support for Students in Elementary and Middle
School
Much of the responsibility for student learning is placed on the “learning coach,” typically the
student’s parent/guardian, particularly in the early grades. Learning coaches facilitate their
student’s progress through daily lessons and help manage the student’s schedule and pacing
through the online program. Both schools have systems in place for closely monitoring student
progress on a course-by-course basis. At GCVS and TECCA, guidance counselors and family
engagement coordinators help learning coaches and students adjust to the virtual environment,
support students’ nonacademic needs, and create a sense of community through face-to-face and
virtual activities.
GCVS reports that at the elementary level (grades K-5) students receive daily full class and small
group live instruction in core academic subjects. At the middle school level (grades 6-8) student
receive 5 live lessons a week in each core academic subject. Art, Music, Physical Education, and
Computer electives rotate each quarter and meet live once per week. GCVS employs Family
Engagement Liaisons (FELs) who provide support and assistance in addition to the support
provided by the classroom teachers. Teachers alert the FELs to any individual family concerns
who, in turn, work with those families on an individual basis to ensure proper support for
students at home. As part of the school structure, GCVS also uses the following supports: Title I
and English as a Second Language (ESL) services; Family Engagement; contracts for students
with particular needs; Special Education supports, in person meet-ups, extra help from teachers,
dual enrollment with Greenfield Community College, use of GCVS Chromebooks with added
security measures.
TECCA reports that students in the elementary, middle, and high school are supported by their
homeroom teachers and subject teachers, in addition to the supervision provided by the learning
coach. Homeroom teachers are responsible for biweekly contact with each of their students, and
during these calls, teachers review the student’s overall progress in lessons and assignments,
often with the learning coach present as well, depending on the grade level of the student.
Subject teachers monitor student progress on a regular basis to analyze student performance on
assessments so they can differentiate instruction, provide support to students in a small group or
1:1, as well as provide resources to support struggling students. In addition, the learning coach,
who is often the student’s parent/guardian, facilitates their student’s progress and helps manage
the student’s schedule, attendance, pacing through the online program, and provides outreach to
teachers when help is needed. TECCA has additional support staff who also work to support all
students to adjust to the virtual environment, support students’ both academic and non-academic
needs, and assist in creating a sense of community through other face-to-face and virtual
interactions and activities.
Support for Online Course Completion
As indicated above, both GCVS and TECCA, a “learning coach,” typically the student’s
parent/guardian, facilitates student progress through daily lessons, with flexibility in terms of
pace and scheduling. The schools expect learning coaches to spend three to five hours daily
12

supporting students and students to spend five to six hours daily on schoolwork and homework.
Teachers are expected to manage all facets of the student’s instructional experience and engage
in regular communication with learning coaches and students via email, telephone, and online
meetings. Further, both schools arrange face-to-face activities, such as field trips, throughout the
school year.
At GCVS, all live sessions take place in a synchronous virtual classroom. All class sessions are
recorded so that students can access them at any time. Teachers also schedule small group and
individual intervention sessions as needed throughout the week. These sessions may also be
recorded. Throughout the class, teachers constantly monitor a chat area, virtual whiteboard area
where both students and teachers can post items, and verbal interaction via microphones or
headsets. Break-out rooms can be created for individual or small groups of students during the
live session to allow for differentiated instruction/assignments as needed. In terms of the GCVS
“flex” (asynchronous) courses there are staff dedicated to supporting students in the
asynchronous program, ESL staff work to monitor and shelter material, and the school provides a
summer extension time.
In FY22, GCVS employed three full-time Title I teachers, two for reading and one for
mathematics. These teachers provided supports to students who performed below grade level.
GCVS special education teachers support students with IEPs. Two English Learner (EL) teachers
provided supports to students whose first language is not English. All general and special
education teachers are either Sheltered English Immersion (SEI) endorsed or in the process of
obtaining it, which enables them to support ELs in the regular classroom. Students who require
accommodation under Section 504 have their assignments and curriculum modified by
classroom teachers, as necessary. Students are identified for interventions and/or services are
referred to the Tiered System of Support process, monitored by the two assistant principals and
the Family Engagement Team. The Family Engagement Team reaches out to families when a
student’s attendance becomes a problem. Last year, GCVS added several liaisons to the team, to
better monitor student performance. In this way, GCVS separated the issues of engagement
(attendance) and academic performance.
TECCA reports that staff work to ensure families/students are aware of all expectations for high-
quality online learning outcomes. Once enrolled, all students/families receive a welcome call
typically within 5 school days by a homeroom teacher to ensure students/families begin the year
with personal connection to a teacher, set up regular bi-weekly supportive contact for the student,
and to begin establishing an understanding of the expectations both students and families will
need to meet as the year progresses.
TECCA also reports that it has a technical support system available to students and families who
may be experiencing technical difficulties impeding their access to the school and course
materials. Students, caretakers, and learning coaches have access to technical (hardware,
software, and Connexus) support services from both Connections Education (TECCA’s
contracted partner) personnel and by TECCA faculty and staff. Students, caretakers, and learning
coaches have access to our extensive technical support services via webmail and email 24 hours
a day, 7 days a week, and can call into the helpdesk.
13

Additionally, TECCA has the role of student success coach in the middle and high schools to
monitor a variety of student metrics, including academic performance, attendance, and course
completion status. Student success coaches work directly with a group of homeroom students
and complete a biweekly academic check in calls/meetings. In addition to student success
coaches, general education teachers, guidance counselors, social workers, special education
teachers, and virtual counselors, also monitor and support students who may require an
additional layer of support and/or service. At the elementary level, grade level teachers or special
education case managers act as homeroom teachers and perform these same responsibilities.
TECCA also has a family engagement coordinator for students who are struggling to meet
engagement and attendance expectations. The staff work with both the student and the learning
coach to create an academic plan in which the student/family sets goals and tracks progress
toward meeting those goals.
In order to support teachers and help to identify any gaps in completion or engagement, the
District Leadership Team (DLT) met biweekly to review and discuss at-risk students. School
leaders then used this information in their biweekly touch bases with their individual staff
members to ensure that all students were receiving the support they needed. The DLT uses
metrics to plan for upcoming professional development and ensure teachers had the resources
and tools they needed to best engage students in learning.
Professional Development
According to GCVS, teachers met on a regular basis throughout the 2021-2022 school year.
GCVS continued to hold full faculty meetings and/or team meetings by grade cluster to discuss
data and share instructional strategies. GCVS created Professional Learning Communities
(PLSs) to map the core curriculum. GCVS’s instructional leadership team met every other week.
GCVS created time for special education teachers and general education teachers to collaborate
multiple times a week.
During the 2021-2022 school year, GCVS provided the following professional development
opportunities and trainings:
• Professional Learning communities regarding curriculum development
• Curriculum training specific to Florida Virtual School (FLVS) Elementary
• Curriculum development in anti-racist teaching
• Wellness resources
• Training in Schoology, our newly adopted learning platform, and in PowerTeacher
• Sharing of and collaborative exploration of online tools, such as ActivelyLearn
• Improving Instructional Practices for Student Learning
• Responsive Classroom (Elementary)
• MTSS procedures
• Improving Student Literacy (High School and Middle School)
• Star 360 Assessment Training
TECCA reports that once per week, all faculty members attended professional development,
training, and collaboration activities on a district and/or school/department levels. During the
14

2021-2022 school year, TECCA implemented the following mandatory districtwide, department,
and school based professional development opportunities and trainings:
● Professional Learning Communities
● Instructional Best Practices to Support Diverse Learners
● Renaissance Star 360: Using Benchmark Data to support instruction
● Curriculum Alignment in High School Core Courses
● The Virtual Classroom and Virtual Instruction Best Practices
● Training related to the school year cycle and tasks
● MCAS Proctor and Test Administrator Training
● New Staff Cohort
● New Staff Coaching
● 2nd Year Staff Cohort
● TECCA Special Education, 504, and ELL Program Models and Expectations
● Best Practices in Co-Teaching
● Center for Behavioral Health, Equity, and Leadership (BHELS) training for the District
Leadership team
● Coaching for district leaders through BHELS
TECCA’s grade level teams, content teams, and schools/departments all met regularly to
collaborate using MCAS, STAR, and grade-level, course, and/or student achievement data.
During these meeting times, teachers reviewed student progress, specifically those who are
demonstrating struggle, to determine how to provide individualized support which helped to
promote mastery.
Beyond the regularly scheduled meetings and collaboration opportunities in FY22, TECCA
provided opportunities for teachers at both the elementary and middle school level to spend
several days throughout the year reviewing prior and current year school data. These “data dive
days” focused on using the data to identify gaps in curriculum and to plan instruction for
underperforming focus areas. Teachers met both with their grade level colleagues and
participated in vertical alignment activities to ensure that the curriculum is aligned through grade
levels.
Recommended Changes to the Commonwealth Virtual School
Program
In FY20, the Department engaged consultants to help update the Commonwealth Virtual School
Performance Criteria (Criteria). The Criteria were first developed in 2014 and required updates.
During the fall of 2019, the Department began a substantial review and revision process to
update these Criteria to incorporate national best practices and standards for virtual school
performance. By November 2022, the Department published the Criteria, which is in effect
during the CMVS’ current certificate terms (2022 through 2026).
Pursuant to the virtual school statute, G.L. c. 71, § 94(j), and the CMVS regulations at 603 CMR
52.11, on March 22, 2022, the Board of Elementary and Secondary Education (Board) renewed
the certificates for GCVS and TECCA for an additional four years. The Commissioner
15

recommended, and the Board also voted to place conditions9 on the schools’ certificates to
address concerns related to academic performance and governance issues.
Using quantitative and qualitative evidence, the Department evaluated the performance of both
CMVSs against the statutory requirements for renewal10 and the Commonwealth Virtual School
Performance Criteria.
Based on evidence gathered, neither school was found to have fully delivered on the promises of
its mission. In determining conditions, the Commissioner of Elementary and Secondary
Education carefully considered each school’s history, each school’s student population, the
limited accountability data due to the pandemic, and the track record of virtual schools in
Massachusetts and nationwide. Key considerations follow.
• Focus group interviews with families of CMVS students demonstrate continued demand
for a virtual option because it benefits students with unique circumstances. Evidence
provided by families indicates that CMVSs provide a safe educational option for students
with social and emotional needs, students who experienced bullying in traditional public
schools, students with chronic medical conditions that make consistent attendance in-
person difficult, and academically or athletically gifted students who desire more flexible
programming. As noted in the table below, both GCVS and TECCA enroll students with
disabilities/504 plans and low-income students at rates above state averages.
Additionally, both CMVS enroll English learners at rates below state averages.
Students with Students with Students who English
disabilities 504 plans are low income learners
% of GCVS 22.5 7.0 57.7 1.7
% of TECCA 20.6 9.0 54.0 1.4
% of State 18.9 5.0 43.8 11.0
• Neither school’s results have consistently met academic standards set by the statewide
accountability system. Despite coordinating testing locations across the state each year,
both schools have struggled to meet the state assessment participation levels required by
law, both schools produce results that are well below state averages,11 and both schools
have been identified as performing in the lowest percentile levels across the state. Results
of these two virtual schools are similar to the academic results seen in virtual schools
nationwide.12 Further, the COVID-19 pandemic forced changes to MCAS administrations
in 2020 and 2021; these changes created a lack of academic data making it difficult to
9 Pursuant to 603 CMR 52.12(1), the “Board or Commissioner may impose conditions on a virtual school's
certificate for violations of law, failure to improve student achievement, failure to comply with the terms of the
virtual school's certificate, or failure to remain viable.”
10 “When deciding on certificate renewal, the board shall consider progress made in student academic achievement
and whether the school has met its obligations and commitments under the certificate.” G.L. c. 71, §94(j).
11 Student achievement rates at TECCA in 2021 exceeded or were comparable to state averages; students in grades 3
through 8 took modified MCAS examinations and virtual testing was allowed.
12 “Virtual Schools in the U.S. 2021” from the National Education Policy Center can be found at

assess academic progress during the schools’ current certificate term. Renewing the
schools’ certificates with conditions that clearly outline areas for improvement or
correction gives both schools additional time to demonstrate academic improvement and
retains the Board’s ability to impose probation should the school’s performance worsen.
For detailed information on the conditions placed on each certificate see the March 14, 2022
memorandum from the Commissioner of Elementary and Secondary Education to the Board of
Elementary and Secondary Education.
In addition, the Department continues to collaborate with others on a regional and national level
to identify the best ways to support high-quality virtual educational programs, curriculum, and
instructional practices.

all applicable state and federal health and safety laws and regulations.
21

(g) The board may waive requirements that students who attend a commonwealth virtual school, attend
school for a minimum number of hours or days each school year and may permit students to earn credits
by demonstrating competency in a grade or subject matter. Students in commonwealth virtual schools
shall be required to meet the same academic standards, testing and portfolio requirements set by the
board for students in other public schools.
To ensure that students are learning and demonstrating their knowledge, each commonwealth virtual
school shall ensure that students are provided, in each credit-bearing course, multiple synchronous
learning opportunities with their teachers in which students are required to participate and share their
knowledge.
(h) Commonwealth virtual schools shall comply with chapter 71B; provided, however, that the fiscal
responsibility for a student with a disability enrolled in or determined to require a private day or residential
school shall remain with the school district where the student resides. If a commonwealth virtual school
expects that a student with a disability enrolled in the commonwealth virtual school may be in need of the
services of a private day or residential school, it shall convene an individualized education program team
meeting for the student. Notice of the team meeting shall be provided to the special education department
of the school district in which the child resides at least 5 days in advance. Personnel from the school district
in which the child resides shall participate in the team meeting concerning future placement of and services
for the child and shall agree on the needed services for the child.
(i) No teacher shall be hired by a commonwealth virtual school who is not certified pursuant to section
38G. Nothing herein shall preclude such teacher from using digital content which may include, but not be
limited to, guest lecturers.
(j) A certificate to operate a commonwealth virtual school granted by the board shall be for not less than 3
years and not more than 5 years, as determined by the board. The board shall develop procedures and
guidelines for amending, revoking and renewing a virtual school’s certificate. When deciding on certificate
renewal, the board shall consider progress made in student academic achievement and whether the
school has met its obligations and commitments under the certificate.
(k) The amount of tuition per pupil a school district shall pay for a student residing in the district who is
enrolled in a commonwealth virtual school shall be the school choice tuition amount, which shall be paid
through the school choice mechanism; provided, that the department may, in consultation with the
operational services division, approve alternative tuition amounts proposed by applicants that shall not
exceed the state average per pupil foundation budget for students of the same classification and grade
level; provided, further, that the department may authorize additional tuition assessments for services
required by an individualized education program established pursuant to chapter 71B. If a commonwealth
virtual school offers online courses to students attending other schools, the commonwealth virtual school
shall work with the student’s district or school to determine whether the online courses meet said district’s
or school’s standards and requirements and what the commonwealth virtual school will charge the
student’s district or school for such online courses.
The department may retain not more than $75 per pupil for the administration of the commonwealth virtual
school program.
The department, in consultation with the department of youth services, shall determine the appropriate
tuition responsibility for students who are in the custody of the department of corrections, a sheriff or the
department of youth services.
Students enrolled in a commonwealth virtual school shall be counted in the foundation enrollment of the
school district where the student resides.
22

(l) The department shall promulgate rules and regulations creating a reporting requirement for a
commonwealth virtual school’s net asset balance at the end of each fiscal year; provided, however, that
the report shall include, but not be limited to: (1) the revenue and expenditures for the prior fiscal year with
a specific accounting of the uses of public and private dollars; (2) compensation and benefits for teachers,
staff, administrators, executives and members of the board of trustees; (3) the amount of funds paid to a
management company; (4) the sources of surplus funds, specifically whether the funds are private or
public; (5) how surplus funds were used in the previous fiscal year; and (6) the planned use of surplus
funds in the upcoming fiscal year and in future fiscal years. The board may establish limits for excess
funds that may be retained by commonwealth virtual schools and may require commonwealth virtual
schools to return excess funds to school districts.
(m) Each commonwealth virtual school shall submit an annual report, on or before January 1, to the board.
The school shall make its report available to the public on its website. The annual report shall be in such
form as may be prescribed by the board and shall include, but not be limited to: (1) a discussion of progress
made toward the achievement of the goals set forth in the certificate; (2) a list of the programs and courses
offered; (3) a description and number of the students enrolled in the commonwealth virtual school by grade
level, the number of students eligible for free and reduced price lunch and the number of students who
applied and were not admitted; (4) a financial statement describing by appropriate categories the revenue
and expenditures for the prior fiscal year and a balance sheet describing the commonwealth virtual
school’s assets, liabilities and fund balances or equities; (5) information regarding and a discussion of
student attendance and participation; (6) information regarding and a discussion of student-teacher
interaction; (7) information regarding and a discussion of student performance in the commonwealth virtual
school, including data from state assessments and a comparison of students’ achievement against the
achievement of the students in the sending district; (8) a discussion of how many courses were completed
and not completed; (9) a discussion of how the school created a community for students; (10) what
activities were included to engage students and how students participated in those activities; (11) a
discussion of parental involvement; and (12) a discussion of the school’s outreach and recruitment efforts;
provided, however, that said report shall include input from teachers and administrators at the virtual
school and input from administrators in a district that has established a virtual school or districts that are
members of an education collaborative that has established a virtual school.
(n) Each commonwealth virtual school shall maintain an accurate account of all its activities and all its
receipts and expenditures and shall annually conduct an independent audit of its accounts. Such audit
shall be filed annually on or before January 1 with the department and the state auditor and shall be in a
form prescribed by the state auditor. The state auditor may investigate the budget and finances of
commonwealth virtual schools and their financial dealings, transactions and relationships and shall have
the power to examine the records of commonwealth virtual schools and to prescribe methods of accounting
and the rendering of periodic reports.
(o) On or before September 1, the commissioner shall furnish a supplemental report on the Massachusetts
comprehensive assessment system performance results of students served by each commonwealth
virtual school and on the racial, ethnic and socio-economic make-up of the students served by each
commonwealth virtual school. The commissioner shall also provide information on the number of students
enrolled in each commonwealth virtual school who have individualized education programs pursuant to
chapter 71B. The department shall make such report available to the public on the department’s website.
(p) On or before September 1, the commissioner shall prepare a report on the implementation and impact
of this section, including, but not limited to:
(1) the fiscal impact on sending districts;
(2) any necessary adjustments to tuition rates, including whether the amount should vary based on grade
or type of school and the appropriate mechanism for funding virtual schools;
23

(3) information on course completion and student attendance and participation rates;
(4) the academic achievement of students attending commonwealth virtual schools;
(5) the level of supervision or support needed for students in elementary and middle school;
(6) the support necessary or helpful to ensure that students successfully complete online courses;
(7) the professional development virtual schoolteachers require;
(8) the appropriate enrollment limit for a virtual school, if any, including information about wait lists; and
(9) the need for any changes to the commonwealth virtual school program.
The report shall be based partially on information in each commonwealth virtual school’s annual report
and financial audits. This report shall include input from virtual schoolteachers and administrators. The
commissioner shall consult with the digital learning advisory council to prepare this report. The
commissioner shall file the report with the clerks of the house and senate, who shall forward the report to
the joint committee on education. The department shall make the report available to the public on the
department’s website.
(q) The commissioner shall identify and offer information on online courses which are aligned with state
academic standards that districts may use and shall publish that list on the department’s website. At least
1 of the online courses listed shall be available at no cost to school districts, provided that such no cost
online course is aligned with state academic standards. The list shall be reviewed and updated annually.
Nothing in this subsection shall preclude school districts from using other courses not identified by the
commissioner.
(r) The board may promulgate regulations for implementation and enforcement of this section, provided
that the regulations may include, but shall not be limited to, a provision indicating the appropriate
percentage of online academic instruction provided for a school to be considered a commonwealth virtual
school pursuant to this section. Upon release of the proposed regulations, the board shall file a copy of
the regulations with the clerks of the house of representatives and the senate, who shall forward the
regulations to the joint committee on education. Within 30 days of the filing, the committee may hold a
public hearing and issue a report on the regulations and file the report with the board. The board, pursuant
to applicable law, may adopt final regulations making revisions to the proposed regulations as it deems
appropriate after consideration of the report and shall file a copy of the regulations with the chairpersons
of the joint committee on education and, not earlier than 30 days after the filing, the board shall file the
final regulations with the state secretary.
(s) Nothing in this section shall preclude a student from taking some or all of the student’s classes online
when such classes are offered or approved by the school the student attends or by an education
collaborative in which the student’s school district participates.
This section shall not apply to a virtual school operated by a single school district if the school enrolls only
students residing in the school district; provided, however, that such district shall submit a summary
description of the proposed virtual school to the commissioner for review and comment at least 4 months
in advance of the opening of the virtual school. The commissioner shall then provide written comments on
the proposal to each district’s school committee.
(t) A school committee may, by vote, restrict enrollment of its students in commonwealth virtual schools if
the total enrollment of its students in commonwealth virtual schools exceeds 1 per cent of the total
24

enrollment in its district; provided, however, that no student enrolled in a commonwealth virtual school
shall be compelled to withdraw as a result of that vote.

Appendix C: CMVS Academic Achievement Data
The Department did not issue school, district, or state accountability determinations for the 2019-
2020 school year due to the cancellation of state assessments and school closures related to
COVID-19. Additionally, the Department did not issue school, district, or state accountability
determinations in 2021; spring 2021 MCAS administration included a partial test for grades 3-8
and some grade 3-8 students took the assessment remotely. All Massachusetts schools
administered the full MCAS for grades 3-8 and 10 during the spring of 2022. Due to prior data
disruption, the Department published some, but not all, of the data for the statewide
accountability system in 2022.
