Office of the Massachusetts Attorney General

Office of the Clerk of the House
Clerk:
Per Chapter 151 of the Acts of 2007 of the Massachusetts Session Laws (the Act), the Pension Reserves
Investment Management Board (PRIM) is required to annually report PRIM’s divestment from Sudan
restricted securities. PRIM Staff provides investment managers with quarterly lists of restricted securities.
The managers are required to divest from said securities according to the timeline laid out in the
legislation, which requires that 50% of PRIM’s restrictive holdings be divested within 6 months of the
security being added to the restriction list and 100% divested within 12 months of the security being
added to the restriction list.
Per subsection (b) of Section 3 of the Act, PRIM reports that no securities of companies on the scrutinized
companies list were acquired in 2024.
Per subsection (d) of Section 3 of the Act, PRIM reports that investment managers with indirect holdings
of restricted securities have not removed restricted companies from their funds (except as part of their
trading strategy – not because of divestment concerns) nor have these managers created similar actively
managed funds which exclude these restricted securities.
Per Section 4 of the Act, attached is the most recent scrutinized companies list, effective January 1, 2024.
Please do not hesitate to contact Riya Shah, Investment Compliance Analyst, at (617)-946-8426 if you have
any questions regarding this letter or scrutinized companies list.
