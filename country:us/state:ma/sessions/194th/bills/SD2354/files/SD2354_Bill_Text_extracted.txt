Per Chapter 32, Section 23 of the Massachusetts General Laws (the Act), the Pension Reserves Investment

of its revenues from the sale tobacco products.” The Pension Reserves Investment Management (PRIM)
Board’s current tobacco divestment policy requires that 50% of PRIT’s tobacco restrictive holdings be
divested within 6 months of the security being added to the restriction list and 100% be divested within
12 months of the security being added. PRIM is also required to report annually a listing of such tobacco
investments “held by the Fund and their book value as of the preceding December first” as PRIT divests
from these companies.
Per Chapter 32 Section 23, as of December 1, 2024, no restricted tobacco securities were held by PRIT.
