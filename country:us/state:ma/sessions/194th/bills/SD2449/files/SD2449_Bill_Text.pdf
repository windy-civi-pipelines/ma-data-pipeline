ANNUAL ADDRESS
The Workforce Competitiveness Trust Fund (WCTF) was established by the Massachusetts Legislature
in 2006 to invest in demand-driven programs designed by industry sector partnerships that train and
place unemployed, underemployed, and incumbent workers. The fund supports the development and
implementation of employer and worker-responsive programs to enhance worker skills, incomes,
productivity, and retention, and in turn, it increases the quality and competitiveness of the workforce,
companies, organizations in Massachusetts.
WCTF grants expand training capacity to upskill new workers and address employers' hiring needs
across a broad range of occupations within industries such as Healthcare, Hospitality, Information
Technology, Transportation, Life Sciences, Early Childhood Education, and Construction.
In 2018, the Massachusetts Legislature voted to rename grant awards from the WCTF in memory of the
late Senator Kenneth J. Donnelly, who was a steadfast champion of promoting workforce opportunities
in the Commonwealth, especially for people who might otherwise lack a pathway to economic stability.
In this spirit, Senator Kenneth J. Donnelly Workforce Success Grants seek to foster sector partnerships
that are powered by local organizations that possess deep expertise and aim to uplift untapped talent.
This model enables education and community organizations to build and sustain effective
partnerships with employers and the public workforce system while striving to incorporate more
equitable and innovative practices that lead to increased economic mobility for more people in the
Commonwealth.
Commonwealth Corporation administers WCTF on behalf of the Executive Office of Labor and Workforce
Development (EOLWD). Commonwealth Corporation also works closely with the Workforce Skills
Cabinet (WSC), which aligns EOLWD plus the Executive Offices of Education, Economic Development,
and Health and Human Services to work collaboratively towards closing workforce skills gaps in
Massachusetts.
The enabling legislation for WCTF (WCTF-Section 2WWW) calls for a report to be filed annually with the
Secretary of Administration and Finance;the House and Senate Committees on Ways and Means; and
the Joint Committees on Community Development and Small Business, Education, Economic
Development and Emerging Technologies, Labor and Workforce Development, and Public Health.
WCTF services are delivered with a focus on prioritizing Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion as well as
accessibility for all Massachusetts residents, especially those most underrepresented. The report must
include the number of educational and eligible service providers receiving grants and participants
receiving services and placed in employment, as well as the salary and benefits that participants
receive after placement, the cost per participant, and job retention or promotion rates for the year after
training ends.

2024 HIGHLIGHTS
Amplifying Training and Education Opportunities in Massachusetts
WCTF programs serve underemployed and unemployed individuals across
Massachusetts, especially individuals whose life experiences and circumstances make it
difficult for them to succeed in employment without targeted support. Examples of
participant populations includes residents who are underemployed and rely on aid from
public benefits, people who have been disconnected from the workforce for a long period,
individuals who have not been able to obtain a credential or complete formal schooling,
and individuals whose first language is not English, many of whom are recent
newcomers to this country. Other participants may face barriers to work due to past
involvement with the criminal justice system, health conditions such as a disability, or a
substance use history. WCTF aims to assist in revitalizing this segment of the workforce
by developing talent pipelines for demand-driven opportunities in regions throughout
Massachusetts.
In 2024, WCTF grants funded programs from all regions, representing a multitude of
sectors in Massachusetts. Programs were led by community colleges, community-based
organizations, MassHire Regional Workforce Development Boards, MassHire career
centers and all in partnership with employers.
All WCTF-funded programs support a training strategy that would:
Offer training and placement services to unemployed or underemployed individuals
from outside the target industry, helping them secure full-time, unsubsidized jobs
in the target occupation after completing the program.
Provide training to current employees in the target sector to help them advance into
higher-level roles within their organization.

HEALTHCARE/BEHAVIORAL
WORKFORCE HUB INITIATIVE
The Healthcare Workforce Hub Initiative
was funded in 2024 by federal American
Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) funding
previously awarded by the
Massachusetts Legislature to the WCTF
to train unemployed, underemployed, and
incumbent workers in health care and
behavioral health roles. In 2024, the
Healthcare Workforce Hub Initiative of
the WCTF awarded over $16 million
dollars to nine regional partnerships,
each led by a MassHire Workforce Board.

who have not completed formal education.
In 2024, $70 million was awarded to 126

RENEW
RENEW, another WCTF program funded by
ARPA, was a piloted funding model to help
individuals access high-quality training and
placement programs for in-demand jobs.
The model's concept was to invest public
resources in a way that encourages
employers to contribute funding back to the
program, ensuring the model’s longevity.

WCTF PROGRAM DESIGN
The WCTF Program Design grant is a redesigned
version of the SCALE grant, following valuable
feedback from grantees and related
stakeholders to Commonwealth Corporation.
The WCTF Program Design grant program aims
to fund planning and program design activities
that lead to an implementation proposal for the
WCTF-Donnelly Success Grant. This grant
program offers funding to provide training and
placement programs for unemployed and/or
underemployed individuals, as well as training
and advancement programs for incumbent
workers. Grant awards can be up to $50,000,
and work with other Program Design grantees
with 6-month cohorts. The main differences
between the Program Design grant and the
SCALE grant are 1) a higher funding cap, 2) a
longer grant cycle, and 3) more intensive

Develop, Implement, Enhance & Empower
Commonwealth Corporation conducted focus groups in the summer of 2024 to learn
more about participant perspectives on whether programs met the WCTF mission of
promoting meaningful employment and upward mobility. While WCTF has previously
conducted focus groups with its grantee partners, this marks the first time they were
conducted with training programs participants. 39 participants from seven WCTF -
funded training programs provided a range of perspectives incorporating regional
and sector diversity.
KEY FINDINGS INCLUDED:
Career Advancement and Opportunities:
Participants sought training programs to switch careers, overcome barriers, or seek
better job opportunities. The programs exceeded their expectations, offering new skills,
industry connections, and practical experiences that were directly applicable to job roles.
Workforce Readiness and Personal Growth:
Impact to Date
Participants reported increased self-confidence and felt better prepared to advance their
careers. Many expressed satisfaction with the quality of training and support received,
highlighting the development of both professional and socio-emotional skills.
Support Services:
Many participants appreciated the comprehensive support services, which included
assistance with childcare, transportation, and career development resources. These
services were critical in enabling them to balance personal and professional obligations
while completing their training.

INNOVATIVE EMERGING PROGRAMS
Innovation, Achievement, Amplify & Empower
With the strong support of policymakers and advocates in economic and workforce
development, the WCTF has been able to award over $100 million in grants since 2013.
Grant awards have continued to grow at significant rates this year due, in part, to
substantial ARPA investments. WCTF staff has continued to support and provide quality
technical assistance to help programs develop and implement superior employer and
worker-responsive programs. These programs have enhanced worker skills, incomes,
productivity, and retention. This ultimately leads to the empowerment of thousands of
individuals to enter quality jobs with family-sustaining wages as well as a strong
economic state for the Commonwealth.
Since the COVID-19 pandemic, Massachusetts continues to experience steady economic
recovery. However, while the state is experiencing low unemployment, the state is also
experiencing record high job openings in many sectors and a skills gap among available
talent. WCTF programs help to fill skills gaps by training, preparing, and employing highly
skilled workers with industry-recognized credentials and certifications. Commonwealth

up workforce organizations to support more employer partnership engagement,
including but not limited to increased and more intricate partnerships with community
colleges, MassHire Regional Workforce Development Boards, and community-based
organizations.
The Legislature allocated $37.5 million in funding appropriated in 2021 through the ARPA
to support scaling WCTF grant awards. This funding, in addition to the state
appropriations, allows partnerships to plan and deliver larger-scale training, placement,
and advancement programs. WCTF is also funded from the state budget at $10 million for
FY 21, $17 million for FY22, $17 million for FY 23, $8 million for FY 24, and $14.7 million for
FY 25 (including funding in the supplemental budget). Commonwealth Corporation and
the WSC are investing these resources to fully support workforce development and
economic growth in Massachusetts.

EMPOWERING FUTURES:
HOW MASSHIRE GREATER BROCKTON WORKFORCE
BOARD’S CDL PROGRAM DRIVES CHANGE IN
SOUTHEASTERN MASSACHUSETTS
By Jai Freeman
Mass Hire Greater Brockton Workforce Board (MassHireGBWB ) is transforming lives through
its CDL Driver Training Program, offering southeastern Massachusetts residents a chance to
secure stable, well-paying jobs in the commercial driving industry. Funded by the Workforce
Competitiveness Trust Fund (WCTF), the CDL program provides unemployed and
underemployed individuals with the skills they need to thrive in a growing job market,
empowering them to build a more secure future.
In partnership with CMSC Parker Professional Driving School, the program was designed to
train 32 residents from the South East region. By June 2024, the program saw 18 participants
secure employment, with an average hourly wage of $32.47. This outcome exceeded the
initial expectations and highlights the program's success in preparing participants for high-
paying jobs within the commercial driving industry.
Matt Kilday, a recent graduate of the program, shared his success story. "I landed two jobs
after completing the program. My first was with Amazon, driving overnight from city to city; it
gave me valuable experience. I am now working for a small company hauling construction
waste, making over $30 an hour."
The program’s impact goes beyond job placement; it also builds confidence and skills for
long-term success. "The program taught me how to pass the road test, and the real-world
experience came from my first job.” Kilday said, reflecting on his experience, “It is a
steppingstone. I’m 22 and making decent money, so I’m definitely grateful for it."
34

The CDL Driver Training Program also stands out for its commitment to inclusivity. Lorraine
Albert, Director of Regional Planning at MassHireGBWB, shared her pride in the program’s
diversity. “We have females, males, veterans—people from all over Southeastern Mass in the
program. Seeing them succeed and find good jobs with strong wages makes us so proud.
Knowing we have helped underemployed individuals get to a better place in their lives brings
us real joy.”
The program's influence reaches far beyond individual participants, helping to uplift the
entire community. Kilday highlighted its potential, "This program can help people get out of
low-paying jobs. The CDL program gives people a real career and a chance to better their
lives."
The CDL Driver Training Program is a powerful example of how strategic partnerships,
community engagement, and workforce development initiatives can drive meaningful
change. By providing comprehensive training and support, MassHireGBWB is empowering
individuals to take control of their futures. As the demand for CDL drivers grows, the program
will continue to help southeastern Massachusetts residents build brighter, more secure
futures, one successful graduate at a time.

BUILDING A STRONGER WORKFORCE
THROUGH HUMAN SERVICES TRAINING
By Stephanie Gutierrez
In today’s competitive job market, building a strong and resilient workforce is more important than
ever. The Polus Center for Social & Economic Development, located in Athol, MA, is playing a crucial
role in this effort by providing training for unemployed and underemployed individuals in the field of
Human Services across Massachusetts. Roberta Richards, Program Coordinator at the Polus Center,
shared some insights into the meaningful work they are doing to prepare participants for careers
that make a difference.
"The Human Services industry is about helping people," explains Roberta. “The program encompasses
roles in autism support, senior caregiving, and even working in retirement homes. We have people
who may not have had the education in substance abuse or homelessness, but they have lived
experience, so we let them dig down deep with the stuff they’ve learned and make it into a resume so
that this way they can get an entry-level job,” she adds.
The Polus Center, supported by a Workforce Competitiveness Trust Fund grant, offers a six-week
training program currently serving 72 participants. The program runs from Tuesday through Friday,
covering a wide range of topics relevant to Human Services. “We go over various subjects, from
substance abuse and autism to professionalism and problem-solving in the workplace,” says
Roberta. The program also includes practical skills like resume writing, crafting cover letters, and
preparing for interviews, which Roberta notes "is something everyone really loves."
A highlight of the program is the job fair that takes place at the end of the six-week training. “We've
built strong relationships with employers who come back every year,” Roberta proudly shares. She
emphasizes the importance of close partnerships with their local MassHire, the Commission for the
Blind, Viability, and other organizations, who consistently refer participants to the program. These
connections are essential to ensuring that the Polus Center reaches as many people as possible and
provides them with the support they need.
36

The need for jobs in the Human Services field, particularly for those who are unemployed or
underemployed, led the Polus Center to develop this program. "We saw an opportunity to educate
people about career options in this field," Roberta explains. The training focuses on empowering
participants with the knowledge and skills they need to thrive in Human Services roles.
One key aspect of the curriculum is social role valorization, a concept based on renowned educational
psychologist Dr. Wolf Wolfersberger’s work on treating marginalized individuals with dignity. Program
participants also receive training in trauma-informed care and mental health services. Guest
speakers, like Darcy Elks, contribute to the training by addressing topics such as respecting the
autonomy of elderly or marginalized individuals in care settings. “We want our students to leave with
the skills and confidence they need, whether it’s in writing a professional resume, acing an interview,
or even something as simple as sending a thank-you note,” Roberta shares.
Graduates of the program receive a certificate of completion, but the relationship with the Polus
Center doesn’t end there. The Polus Center ensures that every student secures a job or receives
substantial training to feel confident in what they do. “Upon graduation, the only thing we ask is that
they get a first pay stub and a 30 day pay stub,” shares Roberta, but that does not mean that their
contact ends there. “I still have students reaching out to me from the first session,” she shares.
Roberta also adds that “if something happens after the 30 days, say six months, seven months, we
had one person reach out to us and say, you know, I'm not happy with my job, I want to get back in the
market, can you help me with my resume?,” she responds enthusiastically with “of course I will and
she just got another job.”
One of Roberta’s favorite success stories is about a mother who joined the program during a difficult
time in her life. “She came to us with no confidence, going through a tough divorce, but she wanted to
better herself. Over the course of six weeks, we saw an incredible transformation,” Roberta recalls. The
participant was partnered with Dress for Success, which provided her with professional attire,
boosting her self-esteem. “She secured a job as a teacher’s assistant just a week after our job fair,
and she was so proud and happy.”
The passion for Human Services is evident in many of the program’s participants, Roberta notes. “It’s
not just that they need a job—they genuinely want to make a difference in the world. Many are in their
40s, 50s, and 60s, making significant career changes to do something meaningful. Others are in their
20s and 30s, just starting out, but they need that extra support to open doors that weren’t accessible
to them before.

A RECIPE FOR SUCCESS:
HOW UMASS AMHERST'S CULINARY PROGRAM
EMPOWERS NON-ENGLISH-SPEAKING EMPLOYEES
By Jai Freeman
In an increasingly diverse workplace, effective communication is essential for employee success. At
UMass Amherst, the culinary training program, part of The Partnership for Worker Education and the
Office of Human Resources, is transforming how non-English-speaking employees in dining services
grow and thrive through targeted education and support.
Since its inception in 2018, the program has significantly evolved to better serve its workforce. In
2018, the program offered training in six languages; today, it proudly provides instruction in an
impressive 22 languages—a testament to UMass Amherst's commitment to inclusivity and
adaptability. This expansion ensures that all employees, regardless of their linguistic background,
can access the tools and resources they need to succeed. As Larissa Checkmareva, the Career
Ladders Project Coordinator with the Partnership for Worker Education program at UMass Amherst,
explains, “Offering training in multiple languages has allowed us to connect with employees on a
much deeper level. It’s not just about language; it’s about creating a pathway for growth and helping
them feel part of the larger institution.”
The program's innovative integration of AI-driven learning tools further enhances its effectiveness. By
leveraging technology, staff can provide personalized learning experiences, allowing employees to
master culinary terminology and workplace communication at their own pace. As Jacob Carter,
Director of the Partnership for Worker Education at UMass Amherst, explains, “Its a highly
sophisticated program that's data-driven and incorporates ongoing monitoring, evaluation, and
learning from that as they go.” This adaptability ensures that training is not only comprehensive but
also relevant to the specific needs of each employee.
The Culinary Career Ladder (CCL) is at the heart of the program, offering a clear and supportive
pathway for career development within the dining services. The CCL is designed to provide a
structured and supportive pathway for career development. By focusing on skill development and
personal growth, participants progress from entry level positions to more specialized and leadership
roles. Chekmareva emphasizes this, noting, “As part of the culinary Career Ladder, we want to ensure
that new employees understand that their roles are not just jobs; they are steppingstones for growth
within their organizations. Each training module is customized for the specific needs of the dining
workplace.” Carter adds, The English classes are designed very specifically for culinary at both the
beginner and intermediate levels.”
38

The program is not just about skills training—it is about creating a supportive environment where
employees feel welcomed from the start. One of the standout features is that training and orientation
are provided in employees’ native languages. This approach ensures that they feel comfortable,
confident, and able to focus on their work without the stress of navigating new systems in an
unfamiliar language. Carter highlights the importance of this: “This approach allows employees to
show up to work and focus on their responsibilities without worrying about how to check their
paycheck, where to park, or what uniform to wear. It provides a strong foundation for job satisfaction
and retention.”
The program’s results speak for themselves. Since the beginning of this 2024 funding cycle, 158 new
employees have been hired across UMass Amherst and Lawrence Public Schools, with 105 identified
as ESOL (English Speakers of Other Languages). The real impact of this program can be seen in the
personal stories of the employees it supports, like the touching story of a Nepali-speaking employee
who had worked for years without access to email or IT systems. Through the program, the employee
was finally able to connect to the university’s network in their native language. “The reaction was
personal; people laughed, cried, and hugged us. It was a moment that showed how truly
transformative our training could be," Checkmareva recalls.
The program has also made a difference in job fairs, where non-English-speaking applicants who
once felt disconnected now find a supportive environment where they are greeted in their own
languages. As Checkmareva explains, "[W]hen we tell them that we provide onboarding in different
languages, people are often surprised and thrilled. It connects our program with the employees and
helps them feel more comfortable entering the workplace."
And at the core of this program's success is the strong collaboration between UMass Amherst Human
Resources, dining services, and the Partnership for Worker Education. Checkmareva notes that,
"Without our partners, there would be no program. Their support from day one has been crucial in
helping us understand the needs of our participants and the context of the training we offer." This
partnership also plays a key role in the program’s ability to evolve. By continuously sharing data,
insights, and feedback, UMass Amherst Human Resources, dining services, and the Partnership for
Worker Education can adapt the program as the workforce changes or new challenges arise. As
Checkmareva mentions, "Their support has helped us from day one, not only in terms of resources but
also in shaping the strategic direction of the program." Through these partnerships, the program has
expanded, innovated, and, most importantly, empowered its participants to succeed in their roles and
grow within the organization.
The success of UMass Amherst’s culinary program is perhaps best captured through the words of its
participants. Monique, a dining services employee, reflects on the challenge she faced: “I can do all
the work in the kitchen, but English is the language I can’t speak yet.” Through Culinary classes,
Monique* gained the vocabulary needed to understand and perform her tasks with confidence. "Now I
know the names of things, and I can put them together while cooking," she explained. This new
knowledge proved valuable in real situations. “When I was asked to work in the salad area, and the
person who was supposed to help me was really busy, I was able to put things in place as I was
asked.”
The culinary program at UMass Amherst is an example of how tailored workforce training education
can create meaningful opportunities for employees, fostering both professional growth and a sense of
belonging. ESOL training should continue to be prioritized in the workplace, as it not only helps
employee job performance but fosters inclusivity and promotes long-term career advancement. As
the program continues to grow, the commitment remains clear: to expand its reach, support more
employees, and help them thrive both in their jobs and for long-term success. The results so far show
that this blend of personalized learning, career pathways, and community support is a recipe for
success.
