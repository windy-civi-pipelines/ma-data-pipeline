In the One Hundred and Ninety-Fourth General Court
(2025-2026)
_______________
An Act establishing offices of legislative research and fiscal analysis.
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives in General Court assembled, and by the authority
of the same, as follows:
1 Section 1. It is hereby declared that the volume and complexity of legislative matters
2 before the general court requires a high degree of subject-matter proficiency in a large number of
3 areas on the part of members of the general court; that painstaking, exhaustive, and accurate fact-
4 finding and fiscal, economic, budgetary, and policy analysis are a necessity for the proper
5 discharge of legislative duties in a legislative body encompassing the scope of the general court
6 of Massachusetts; that professional factual and policy research and fiscal analysis are recognized
7 as valuable and indispensable tools in the efficient performance of the legislative function; and
8 that it is the intention of this act to establish offices of legislative research and fiscal analysis
9 staffed by nonpartisan, highly qualified professionals who shall perform their duties impartially
10 and in conformity with the highest standards of research practice for the assistance and benefit of
11 the members, committees, and commissions of the general court.
1 of 6
12 Section 2. Chapter 3 of the General Laws is hereby amended by adding the following
13 sections.
14 Section 56. There are hereby established within the general court an office of legislative
15 research and an office of fiscal analysis.
16 (a) The office of legislative research shall
17 (i) assist members of the general court and committees thereof in all matters requiring
18 policy analysis, comparative legal analysis, statistical research, and fact-finding in connection
19 with proposed or potential legislation or other matters pertaining to the functions of the general
20 court;
21 (ii) assist with bill-drafting upon request by any member;
22 (iii) review bills and amendments in third reading for consistency with existing
23 provisions of the general laws;
24 (iv) prepare a detailed, section-by-section summary for each bill that reaches third
25 reading;
26 (v) maintain legislative history of all bills that reach third reading; and
27 (vi) continuously review the general laws for errors, inconsistencies, and other matters
28 requiring technical revision and, from time to time, submit to the counsel to the senate and to the
29 counsel to the house of representatives, jointly, recommendations, including drafts of legislation
30 for the correction, revision, amendment, rearrangement, consolidation, compilation and
31 recodification of the General Laws, or any of them, and amendments thereof, including
32 recommendations for the repeal of such statutory provisions as have become obsolete or the
2 of 6
33 reasons for the enactment of which have ceased to exist. In submitting recommendations under
34 this section the office may recommend the omission or repeal of redundant enactments and those
35 which may have ceased to have any effect on existing rights, the rejection or elimination of
36 superfluous words, the condensation of circuitous, tautological and ambiguous phraseology and
37 the correction of mistakes, inconsistencies and imperfections. Recommendations for changes of
38 provisions of the General Laws and amendments thereof, as provided for in this section, shall be
39 consistent with the will and intent of the general court as expressed in such provisions at the time
40 of such recommendations.
41 (b) The office of fiscal analysis shall
42 (i) prepare tax revenue and expenditure forecasts and reviews;

47 committees on ways and means.
48 (c) The offices shall make their reports and findings public in electronic form, except to
49 the extent an exemption as provided in General Laws chapter 4, section 7(26) applies to any
50 portion of such reports and findings. Notwithstanding the foregoing, communications between
51 the offices and any member, member’s staff, or committee, including requests made and research
52 materials provided, are confidential and may not be disclosed to any other member, staff, or the
53 public.
3 of 6
54 (d) The offices of legislative research and fiscal analysis shall be provided with quarters
55 in the state house or elsewhere at a location convenient to the general court.

57 shall be appointed without regard to political affiliation by a majority vote of the following: the
58 speaker, the senate president, and the leader of the minority party in each chamber. The directors
59 shall be qualified by training, education, and experience to manage, respectively, a research and
60 fiscal analysis organization. No current or former member of the general court shall serve as
61 director of either office. The director of each office shall take an oath to faithfully and
62 impartially execute the duties of the office.
63 (b) Directors shall be appointed for a renewable term of five years from the date of
64 appointment, and shall devote full time and attention to the duties of the office. Directors shall

67 (c) The salary of the directors shall be set by the rules committees of both chambers,
68 acting jointly.

70 activities of the office are conducted in a nonpartisan manner. The director during the term of
71 service shall not: (i) hold, or be a candidate for, federal, state or local elected office; (ii) hold an
72 appointed office in a federal, state, or local government; or (iii) serve as an official in a political
73 party.
74 (e) In the case of an absence or vacancy in the office of the director or in the case of
75 disability, the rules committees, acting jointly, may designate an acting director to serve as
4 of 6
76 director until the vacancy is filled or the absence or disability ceases. The acting director shall
77 have all of the powers and duties of the director and shall have similar qualifications as the
78 director.
79 Section 58. (a) The director of each office shall be responsible for the operations of said
80 office, including the hiring of professional and research staff, administrative assistants, and other
81 qualified personnel as may be required to discharge the duties of said office, and may expend
82 with the approval of said committees such sums as may be necessary for such operations. All
83 personnel of the offices, including the directors thereof, shall be appointed without regard to
84 political affiliation and solely on the basis of their professional qualifications and fitness to
85 perform their duties, and shall take an oath to faithfully and impartially execute the duties of the
86 office. The director of each office may prescribe the duties and responsibilities of the personnel
87 thereof and delegate to them authority to exercise any of the powers and perform any of the
88 duties and functions assigned to the office or the director.

93 their assistants shall not be subject to chapter thirty-one.
94 Section 59. Any member or committee may request assistance with policy research,
95 analysis, and bill drafting. Priority of requests shall be established by each director, taking into

99 estimates, and statistics directly from the various departments, divisions, agencies, and political
100 subdivisions of the commonwealth, including the units, officers, and agencies of the executive
101 branch and administrative offices of the courts of the commonwealth, as are material to the
102 proper conduct of its duties. All such departments, divisions, agencies, commissions, and
103 political subdivisions shall furnish all available data and information that each director
104 determines to be material to the performance of the duties and functions of its respective office
105 other than information the disclosure of which would be a violation of law.
106 (b) The offices shall report annually, within 90 days of the close of the fiscal year, on
107 their operations and on reports issued and bills prepared during the preceding fiscal year.
108 Section 3. Chapter 3, section 55A is hereby repealed.
