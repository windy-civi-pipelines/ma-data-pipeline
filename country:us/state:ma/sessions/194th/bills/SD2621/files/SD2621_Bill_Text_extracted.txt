INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT
Independent Auditor’s Report
To the Advisory Board of the Greater Attleboro-Taunton Regional Transit Authority
Taunton, Massachusetts
Opinions
We have audited the accompanying financial statements of the business-type activities and the aggregate remaining fund
information of the Greater Attleboro-Taunton Regional Transit Authority (“the Authority”), as of and for the year ended
June 30, 2024, and the related notes to the financial statements, which collectively comprise the Authority’s basic financial
statements as listed in the table of contents.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the respective financial
position of the business-type activities of the Authority, as of June 30, 2024, and the respective changes in financial
position and cash flows thereof for the year then ended in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America.
Basis for Opinions
We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America and the
standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards, issued by the Comptroller General of
the United States. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the
Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report. We are required to be independent of the Authority and to meet our
other ethical responsibilities, in accordance with the relevant ethical requirements relating to our audit. We believe that the
audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinions.
Responsibilities of Management for the Financial Statements
Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and for the design, implementation, and
maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements that are free from
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements, management is required to evaluate whether there are conditions or events, considered
in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the Authority’s ability to continue as a going concern for twelve months
beyond the financial statement date, including any currently known information that may raise substantial doubt shortly
thereafter.
Continued
Greater Attleboro-Taunton Regional Transit Authority
Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinions. Reasonable
assurance is a high level of assurance but is not absolute assurance and therefore is not a guarantee that an audit conducted
in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards and Government Auditing Standards will always detect a material
misstatement when it exists. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one
resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of
internal control. Misstatements are considered material if there is a substantial likelihood that, individually or in the
aggregate, they would influence the judgment made by a reasonable user based on the financial statements.
In performing an audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards and Government Auditing Standards, we:
• Exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit.
• Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error,
and design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks. Such procedures include examining, on a test
basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
• Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are
appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the
Authority’s internal control. Accordingly, no such opinion is expressed.
• Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant accounting
estimates made by management, as well as evaluate the overall presentation of the financial statements.
• Conclude whether, in our judgment, there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise
substantial doubt about the Authority’s ability to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time.
We are required to communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope
and timing of the audit, significant audit findings, and certain internal control-related matters that we identified during the
audit.
Required Supplementary Information
Accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America require that the management’s discussion and
analysis and certain pension and other post-employment information be presented to supplement the basic financial
statements. Such information is the responsibility of management and, although not a part of the basic financial statements,
is required by the Governmental Accounting Standards Board who considers it to be an essential part of financial reporting
for placing the basic financial statements in an appropriate operational, economic, or historical context. We have applied
certain limited procedures to the required supplementary information in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States of America, which consisted of inquiries of management about the methods of preparing the
information and comparing the information for consistency with management’s responses to our inquiries, the basic
financial statements, and other knowledge we obtained during our audit of the basic financial statements. We do not express
an opinion or provide any assurance on the information because the limited procedures do not provide us with sufficient
evidence to express an opinion or provide any assurance.

Greater Attleboro-Taunton Regional Transit Authority
Supplementary Information
Our audit was conducted for the purpose of forming opinions on the financial statements that collectively comprise the
Authority’s basic financial statements. The Schedule of Local (Cities and Towns) Funding, Net Cost of Service, and
Schedule of Revenues and Expenses – Brokerage Department, are presented for purposes of additional analysis and are not
a required part of the basic financial statements. Such information is the responsibility of management and was derived
from and relates directly to the underlying accounting and other records used to prepare the basic financial statements. The
information has been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the audit of the basic financial statements and certain
additional procedures, including comparing and reconciling such information directly to the underlying accounting and
other records used to prepare the basic financial statements or to the basic financial statements themselves, and other
additional procedures in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. In our
opinion, the accompanying supplemental information is fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the basic
financial statements as a whole.
Other Reporting Required by Government Auditing Standards
In accordance with Government Auditing Standards, we have also issued our report dated December 31, 2024, on our
consideration of the Authority’s internal control over financial reporting and on our tests of its compliance with certain
provisions of laws, regulations, contracts, and grant agreements and other matters. The purpose of that report is solely to
describe the scope of our testing of internal control over financial reporting and compliance and the results of that testing,
and not to provide an opinion on the effectiveness of the Authority’s internal control over financial reporting or on
compliance. That report is an integral part of an audit performed in accordance with Government Auditing Standards in
considering Authority’s internal control over financial reporting and compliance.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Unaudited)
For the Year Ended June 30, 2024
Management’s Discussion and Analysis – Required Supplementary Information (Unaudited)
Introduction
As Management of the Greater Attleboro-Taunton Regional Transit Authority (the Authority), we present this Management
Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) to provide financial statement readers with an introduction and overview to the
Authority’s financial activities during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024. The components of the Authority’s Financial
Statements as defined by GASB Statement 24 are as follows:
Management’s Discussion and Analysis
The Management’s Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) is required supplementary information that accompanies the financial
statements and is unaudited. The MD&A precedes the proprietary fund financial statements. In this section, management
aims to provide an analysis of the overall financial position of the Authority and results of the fiscal year operations, assess
whether financial position improved or deteriorated during the year, consider economic factors that may affect operating
results, and describe currently known events or conditions that may affect the Authority’s future financial position.
Proprietary Fund Financial Statements
The Greater Attleboro-Taunton Regional Transit Authority’s financial statements are presented as follows:
The Statement of Net Position reports on financial position at fiscal year-end. The statement distinguishes between current
and noncurrent assets and liabilities of the Authority. The difference between assets and liabilities is presented as net
position. Increases or decreases to net position may serve as a useful indicator of whether the Authority’s financial position
is improving or deteriorating over time. Net position is divided into three categories: net investment in capital assets,
restricted, and unrestricted. Total Net Position per the Statement of Net Position equals the Net Position at June 30, 2024
reported on the Statement of Revenues, Expenses, and Changes in Net Position.
The Statement of Revenues, Expenses, and Changes in Net Position measures performance for the fiscal year. Revenues and
expenses are presented in three categories: operating, non-operating, and capital. This statement provides information on
the costs of providing the services requested of us, how the Authority finances the services (i.e. user fees, federal and state
grants, local assessments, and other revenues), and if current year revenues were sufficient to pay for current year expenses.
The Operating Income (Loss per the Statement of Revenues, Expenses, and Changes in Net Position is reconciled to Cash
Flows from Operating Activities on the Statement of Cash Flows.
The Statement of Cash Flows reports whether cash increased or decreased during the year. Cash flows are reported in four
categories: operating, noncapital financing, capital and related financing, and investing. This statement provides useful
information on the cash receipts and uses of the Authority during the fiscal year and helps users to analyze the Authority’s
ability to generate future cash flows and meet future obligations. Cash and Cash Equivalents at June 30, 2024 reported on
the Statement of Cash Flows equal Cash per the Statement of Net Position.
The Notes to Financial Statements communicate additional objective information to financial statement readers, including
the Authority’s accounting policies and explanations or data not shown on the face of the statements.
Required Supplementary Information
In addition to the Management’s Discussion and Analysis, the following information is required material that is unaudited:
Schedule of Proportionate Share of Net Pension Liability, Schedule of Pension Contributions, and Schedule of Changes in
total OPEB Liability and Related Ratios. These schedules are found following the proprietary fund financial statements.
Supplementary Information
The following are supplemental schedules: Schedule of Local (Cities and Towns) Funding, Net Cost of Service, and
Schedule of Revenues and Expenses – Brokerage Department. These schedules are found following the proprietary fund
financial statement and required supplementary information.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Unaudited) (Continued)
For the Year Ended June 30, 2024
Financial Analysis
The COVID-19 pandemic, beginning in March 2020 and continuing through fiscal year end, June 30, 2021, significantly
affected GATRA’s operations and financial trends during the two-year period. During the fiscal year ending June 30, 2022,
continuing into the fiscal year ending June 30, 2024, GATRA experienced an increase in services, with operations trending
towards pre-pandemic levels. Detailed analyses of the normal trends and COVID-specific impacts are detailed below.
Total current assets increased in 2024 by approximately $2.1 million or 8%. This was primarily caused by an increase in
amounts due from other governments of $3.8 million. Fluctuation in this balance from year to year is common and mostly
due to timing differences in the receipt of operating and capital assistance from federal and state sources. In fiscal years
2020 and 2021, GATRA reduced human services transportation programs beginning in March 2020 in response to the
pandemic, resulting in a decrease in reimbursement billings sent to the State through those fiscal year ends. Beginning in
fiscal year 2022 and continuing in the current year, GATRA continued to resume these programs and experience an
increase in services, which increased the balances in receivables at year end.
Total current liabilities increased in 2024 by approximately $800 thousand or 3.6%. The increase was primarily due to
accounts payable to operators. Again, year-to-year fluctuation in this balance is common and is most often related to timing
differences in payment of operating and capital invoices at year end. Due to the pandemic and the reduction in human
service transportation operations described above, fewer bills were received from the operators and outstanding at the end
of the prior fiscal year. In fiscal year 2024, GATRA continued to resume normal operations in these programs towards pre-
pandemic levels, which increased the balances in payables at year end. Additionally, the notes payable balance at June 30,
2024 was consistent with the prior year balance at $8.2 million related to revenue anticipation notes with $8.2 million
issued and retired.
Total noncurrent liabilities decreased in 2024 by approximately $82 thousand or 1%. This was primarily caused by an
decrease in OPEB liability of $130 thousand, an increase in net pension liability of $170 thousand and a decrease in
compensated absences of $123 thousand. The changes in pension and post-employment benefit liabilities were due to
changes in the actuarial valuations and changes in compensated absences were due to staff turnover.
GATRA recognized an increase in capital assets in 2024 of $5.1 million or 6.8%. This was primarily a result of purchases
of facilities totaling approximately $900 thousand and buses totaling $4 million. There were no disposals in the current
fiscal year.
At the end of the current fiscal year, Greater Attleboro-Taunton Regional Transit Authority had no long-term bonded debt
outstanding. The Authority regularly borrows on a short-term basis in anticipation of state and federal grant revenues to
supplement its cash flow during the year.
As of the close of the current fiscal year, the Authority’s proprietary fund reported an ending net position of $27.5 million,
an increase over the prior year of $2.8 million. This increase was the combination of an increase to net investments in
capital assets of $1.6 million and unrestricted net position of $1.2 million.
The increase in net position was the result of the Authority’s revenues, operating assistance, and capital contributions
exceeding expenses by $2.8 million.
Total operating revenues increased in FY24 by $7.6 million or 11%. The increase was the result of increased ridership in
response to the recovery from the COVID pandemic and the addition of new contracts. Both fixed route and demand
response ridership was higher compared to prior years. Throughout the fiscal year, the volume of brokerage services
provided was significantly higher compared to that experienced during the pandemic, with service levels trending towards
pre-pandemic numbers. GATRA anticipates that these numbers will continue to trend upwards as we recover from the
pandemic and return to normalcy.
Total operating expenses increased by $10.5 million or 11.4%. The increases were related to increased purchases of
transportation services in response to increased ridership as noted above.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Unaudited) (Continued)
For the Year Ended June 30, 2024
Economic Factors
The unemployment rate for the Taunton-Middleborough-Norton Labor Market as of June 30, 2024 was 4.2%, which
increased 0.5% from 3.7% a year ago. This rate is slightly higher than the statewide trend experienced in which the
unemployment rate of 3.3% in June 2023 decreased to 3.2% by the end of fiscal year 2024. The inflationary trend in the
region (3.5% annual – BLS CPI Boston-Cambridge-Quincy region for all items) is higher than the national inflation rate
(3.0% - BLS CPI Urban areas - all items) for the last year. Note however, GATRA procurements are driven by national
factors as much as regional.
All of these factors were considered in preparing the Greater Attleboro-Taunton Regional Transit Authority’s budget for the
2025 fiscal year and GATRA has presented the planned level of expense to the Greater Attleboro-Taunton Regional Transit
Authority Advisory Board and to the State of Massachusetts Department of Transportation.

Notes to the Financial Statements

Section 2:
1. The Authority and Operators
The Greater Attleboro-Taunton Regional Transit Authority (the Authority) is a component unit of the
Massachusetts Department of Transportation (Mass DOT) and Mass DOT is a component unit of the
Commonwealth of Massachusetts (the Commonwealth). The Authority was established as a political subdivision
of the Commonwealth on December 15, 1976, by the various cities and towns constituting the Authority, pursuant
to Section 3 of Chapter 161B of the General Laws of the Commonwealth, for the purpose of continuing and
improving local transit service.
The Authority is managed by an Administrator appointed by an Advisory Board. The Advisory Board is made up
of appointed representatives from the member communities. The Authority’s operations are primarily funded
through passenger fares, contractual reimbursements and operating subsidies from the federal government, Mass
DOT, and the member communities. In addition, the Authority receives federal and state capital grants that are
used to finance acquisitions and improvements to facilities and equipment.
The operation and maintenance of the Authority is performed by various private sector transportation companies
(the Operators) under terms and agreements whereby the carriers provide mass transit along such routes and
according to such schedules as may be defined by the Authority.
The Authority also has a brokerage contract with the Commonwealth’s Executive Office of Health and Human
Services, whereby the Authority coordinates with this Agency to provide its clients with transportation services.
The actual services are provided by various private sector transportation companies.

Section 3:
2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Measurement Focus, Basis of Accounting, and Financial Reporting Presentation
The financial statements of the Authority have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of American (GAAP) as applied to government entities. The Governmental
Accounting Standards Board (GASB) is the accepted standard-setting body for establishing governmental
accounting and financial reporting principles. Under these standards, the Authority meets the definition of a
special-purpose government, engaged only in business-type activities.
The financial statements are reported using the economic resources measurement focus and the accrual basis of
accounting. Revenues are recognized at the time transportation services are provided. Unearned revenue represents
cash received in advance of future services.
The Authority distinguishes between operating revenues and expenses and nonoperating revenues and expenses.
Operating revenues and expenses generally result from providing services in connection with the Authority’s
principal ongoing operations. The Authority’s principal operating revenues are charges for services. Operating
expenses include the cost of transit services, provided by third party vendors, maintenance, administrative and
depreciation expense. All revenues and expenses not meeting this definition are reported as non-operating
revenues and expenses.
Inventories
Inventories of fuel are stated at the lower of cost or market on a first-in, first-out basis (FIFO). Inventories of parts
are stated at the lower of cost or market on an average cost basis.

Section 4:
2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)
Capital Assets
Capital assets are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line
method based on the estimated service lives of the assets. The Authority’s capitalization policy is to capitalize all
assets acquired with capital funds regardless of the dollar amount. The estimated service lives are as follows:
Buildings 20 – 40 years
Vehicles 4 – 14 years
Equipment 5 – 7 years
Intangible assets 2 – 7 years
Net Position
Net position is the residual of all other elements presented in a statement of net position. It is the difference
between (a) assets and deferred outflows of resources and (b) liabilities and deferred inflows of resources. Net
position is reported in three categories and these are defined as follows: (1) amounts invested in capital assets
consists of capital assets, net of accumulated depreciation and is reduced by the related debt that is attributed to the
acquisition, construction, or improvement of those assets, (2) restricted net position results when constraints are
placed on net position use, and are either externally imposed by creditors, grantors, contributors, and the like, or
imposed by law through legislation, (3) Unrestricted net position consists of net position that does not meet the
definition of the two preceding categories.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the
financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Statement of Cash Flows
For purposes of the statement of cash flows, the Authority considers all highly liquid investments purchased with a
maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.
Available Unrestricted Resources
The Authority’s policy is to utilize available restricted resources prior to unrestricted resources.
Pensions
For purposes of measuring the Authority’s net pension liability, deferred outflows of resources and deferred
inflows of resources related to pensions, and pension expense, information about fiduciary net position of the
Taunton Contributory Retirement System (the System) and additions to/deductions from the System’s fiduciary
net position have been determined on the same basis as they are reported by the System.
For this purpose, benefit payments (including refunds of employee contributions) are recognized when due and
payable in accordance with the benefit terms. Investments are reported at fair value.

Section 5:
3. Cash
State and local statutes place certain limitations on the nature of deposits and investments available to the
Authority. Deposits (including demand deposits, term deposits, and certificates of deposit) in any one financial
institution may not exceed certain levels without collateralization by the financial institutions involved.
Investments can also be made in securities issued by or unconditionally guaranteed by the U. S. Government or its
agencies that have a maturity of less than one year from the date of purchase and repurchase agreements
guaranteed by such securities with maturity dates of no more than 90 days from the date of purchase.

Section 6:
3. Cash (continued)
Custodial credit risk exists for cash deposits when, in the event of the failure of a depository financial institution,
the Authority’s deposits will not be recovered. The Authority does not have a formal policy with regard to
custodial credit risk but places its funds in deposits that are insured or collateralized with securities held by the
pledging financial institution’s trust department in the financial institution’s name. the total amount of the
Authority’s bank deposits consists of the following at June 30, 2024:

Reserve for Extraordinary Expense
In accordance with Section 6 of Chapter 161B of the General Laws of the Commonwealth, the Authority is
allowed to establish a reserve account for the purpose of meeting the cost of extraordinary expenses in an amount
not to exceed three percent of the prior year’s local assessment. Any balance in the reserve account at the end of
the fiscal year may be carried forward into the next fiscal year, provided, however, that the aggregate amount in
the account does not exceed twenty percent of the prior year’s local assessment. The Authority did not contribute
additional funds to the reserve. The balance in the reserve account at June 30, 2024 is $936,033.
Restricted for Attleboro Station Improvements
The Authority leases a commuter rail station from the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA). The
lease allows the Authority to operate the MBTA’s Attleboro Station paid parking facility. The excess of the
revenues over expenses is shared with the MBTA. However, the Authority’s share of income use is restricted to
capital improvements to the Attleboro Station. At the end of the lease term, any remaining excess revenues not
used for improvements will be returned to the MBTA. The balance restricted for Attleboro Station improvements
at June 30, 2024 is $878,004.

Section 12:
8. Post Employment Benefit Plans (continued)
Benefits Provided
The plan covers all full-time employees and provides retirement, disability, cost of living adjustments and death
benefits to all plan members and beneficiaries. The plan provides for retirement allowance benefits up to a
maximum of 80% of a member’s highest three-year average annual rate of regular compensation for those hired
prior to April 2, 2012. For persons who became members on or after April 2, 2012, average salary is the average
annual rate of regular compensation received during the five consecutive years that produce the highest average,
or, if greater, during the last five years (whether or not consecutive) preceding retirement. Benefit payments are
based upon a member’s age, length of creditable service, level of compensation, and group classification.
Contributions
Pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws, Chapter 32, contribution requirements of the active employees and the
participating employers are established and may be amended by the Massachusetts Contributory Retirement
system. System members are required to pay into the System 5% to 11% of their covered compensation,
depending on plan entry date and the level of compensation. The Authority’s required contribution for the year
ended June 30, 2024 was $217,417 (which was 8.8% of actual payroll expense), actuarily determined as an amount
that, when combined with employees during the year, with an additional amount to finance any unfunded accrued
liability.
Pension Liabilities, Expense and Deferred Outflows and Inflows of Resources Related to Pensions
At June 30, 2024, the Authority reported a liability of $1,515,830 for its proportionate share of the net pension
liability. The net pension liability was measured as of December 31, 2023, and the total pension liability used to
calculate the net pension liability was determined by an actuarial valuation as of January 1, 2023. The authority’s
proportion of the net pension liability was based on a projection of the long-term share of contributions to the
pension plan relative to the projected contributions of all participating employers, actuarially determined. At
December 31, 2023, the Authority’s proportion of the net pension liability was approximately 1.08%, an increase
of approximately 0.14% from the prior measurement date.
Changes in Assumptions
Since the prior valuation, there were no changes to the actuarial assumptions that would have an effect on the
measurement of the net pension liability:
The discount rate remained at 7.6%
The base to which the annual cost of living adjustment (COLA) is applied remained at $16,000
For the year ended June 30, 2024, the Authority recognized pension expense of $230,847 and reported deferred
outflows and deferred inflows of resources related to pensions from the following sources:
Deferred
Outflows of
Resources
Difference between expected and actual experience $ 221,482

Section 14:
8. Post Employment Benefit Plans (continued)
The long-term expected rate of return on pension plan investments was determined using best-estimate ranges of
expected future nominal rates of return (expected returns, net of pension plan investment expense and inflation)
developed for each major asset class using an econometric model that forecasts a variety of economic
environments and then calculates asset class returns based on functional relationships between the economic
variables and the asset classes. The target allocation and projected arithmetic real rates of return for each major
asset class, used in derivation of the long-term expected investment rate of return assumption as of December 31,
2023 are summarized in the following table:
Long-Term Long-Term
Expected Asset Expected Real
Asset Class Allocation Rate of Return
Equity 60% 8.09%
Fixed Income 20% 4.27%
Alternatives 5% 6.49%
Real Estate 15% 9.99%
Total 100%
Discount Rate
The discount rate used to measure the total pension liability was 7.6% at December 1, 2023 and 2022. The
projection of cash flows used to determine the discount rate assumed plan member contributions will be made at
the current contribution rate and that contributions from employers will be made at rates equal to the actuarially
determined contribution rate. Based on those assumptions, the System’s fiduciary net position was projected to be
available to make all projected future benefit payments of current plan members. Therefore, the long-term
expected rate of return on pension plan investments was applied to all periods of projected benefit payments to
determine the total pension liability.
Sensitivity of the Authority’s Proportionate Share of the Net Pension Liability to Changes in the Discount Rate
The following presents the Authority’s proportionate share of the net pension liability calculated using the
discount rate of 7.6 percent, as well as what the Authority’s proportionate share of the net pension liability would
be if it were calculated using a discount rate that is 1 percentage point lower (6.6%) or 1 percentage point higher
(8.6%) than the current rate:
1% Discount 1%

Pension Plan Fiduciary Net Position
Detailed information about the pension plan's fiduciary net position is available in the separately issued System
financial report. The Plan's fiduciary net position uses the same basis as the plan. The Plan uses the accrual basis
of accounting, and benefits and refunds are recognized when due and payable. Plan investments are measured at
fair value.

8. Post Employment Benefit Plans (continued)
Post Employment Healthcare Benefits Plan
Plan Description
The Authority administers a single-employer, defined-benefit post- employment health care plan. The plan
provides benefits for eligible employees who have attained age 55 and render at least 10 or more years of service
or at any age with 20 years of service, until the employee is eligible for Medicare. For those hired after April 1,
2012, benefits are received after attaining age 60 with 10 or more years of service. The benefits, benefit level,
employee contributions and employer contributions are governed by the Authority. As of July 1, 2023, the
actuarial valuation date, 44 active employees and 11 retirees or beneficiaries currently receiving benefits met
eligibility requirements. The plan does not accumulate assets in a trust that meets the criteria of GASBS No.75 and
does not issue separate stand-alone financial statements.
Benefits Provided
Medical coverage under the group health insurance plan for regular full-time employees will continue until the
employee is eligible for Medicare. Coverage for the dependents of such regular full-time employees will also
continue during this period. Once the retired employee is entitled to Medicare, health care coverage for the
employee's spouse will continue, provided that the enrollment costs as established annually by the Plan
administrator are paid.
Dental coverage under the group health insurance plan for regular full-time employees will continue until the
employee is eligible for Medicare. Coverage for the dependents of such regular full-time employees will also
continue during this period. Once the retired employee is entitled to Medicare, health care coverage for the
employee's spouse will continue, provided that the enrollment costs as established annually by the Plan
administrator are paid.
Contributions
For medical coverage, grandfathered retirees must pay 10% of the enrollment cost (the "working rate") as
established annually by the Plan administrator and all other retirees pay 25%. The Authority contributes the
remainder of the health plan costs.
For dental coverage, the retired employee must pay 0% of the enrollment cost (the "working rate") as established
annually by the Plan administrator. The Authority contributes the remainder of the health plan costs.
Total OPEB Liability
The Authority's total OPEB liability of $6,377,090 was measured, as of June 30, 2024, based on an actuarial
valuation that was performed on July 1, 2023.
Changes in Assumptions
Since the prior valuation, one key assumption has changed that affected measurement of the total OPEB liability:
• Due to the GASBS No. 75 standards, the discount rate has been changed from 4.09% to 4.21% decreasing
the disclosed liability by approximately $100 thousand.

The actuarial assumptions used to calculate the actuarial accrued liability, and the service cost primarily reflect the
latest experience studies of the Massachusetts PERAC issued in 2014 and their most recent analysis of retiree
mortality during 2015 and 2016.
Sensitivity of the Total OPEB Liability to Changes in the Discount Rate
The following presents the total OPEB liability of the Authority, as well as what the Authority’s total OPEB
liability would be if it were calculated using a discount rate that is 1% lower or 1% higher than the current
discount rate:

9. Commitments and Contingencies
Purchase Commitments
Construction in progress at June 30, 2024 consisted of expenditures by the Authority for various construction
projects. At June 30, 2024, remaining commitments for these projects were approximately $0.
Litigation
In the normal course of operations, the Authority has been named in various claims and litigation. Based upon
information available to counsel and the Authority, management believes that the ultimate outcome from these
claims and litigations will not have a material adverse effect on the Authority’s financial position.
Risk Management
The Authority is exposed to various risks of loss related to tors; theft of, and damage to, and destruction of assets;
errors and omissions; natural disasters; and workers compensation claims for which the Authority carries
commercial insurance. Settlements have not exceeded coverages for each of the past three fiscal years.
The Authority’s workers compensation coverage is insured under a retrospectively rated policy. In the opinion of
management, any insurance carrier audit adjustment, if any, will not be material to the accompanying financial
statements. The Authority has received capital and operating financial assistance from federal and state agencies in
the form of grants. Expenditure of funds under these programs generally requires compliance with terms and
conditions specified in the grant agreements and are subject to audit by the grantor agencies. Any disallowed
claims resulting from such audits could become a liability of the Authority. In the opinion of Authority
management, liabilities resulting from such disallowed expenditures, if any, would not be material to the
accompanying financial statements.

Independent Auditor’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting and
on Compliance and Other Matters Based on an Audit of Financial Statements
Performed in Accordance with Government Auditing Standards
To the Advisory Board of the
Greater Attleboro-Taunton Regional Transit Authority
We have audited, in accordance with the auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America and
the standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards issued by the Comptroller
General of the United States, the financial statements of the business-type activities of the Greater Attleboro-
Taunton Regional Transit Authority (“the Authority”), as of and for the year ended June 30, 2024, and the related
notes to the financial statements, which collectively comprise the Authority’s basic financial statements,
and have issued our report thereon dated December 31, 2024.
Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements, we considered the Authority’s internal control
over financial reporting (internal control) to determine the audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances
for the purpose of expressing our opinions on the financial statements, but not for the purpose of expressing an
opinion on the effectiveness of the Authority’s internal control. Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the
effectiveness of the Authority’s internal control.
A deficiency in internal control exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow management or
employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent, or detect and correct,
misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal
control, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the entity’s financial statements
will not be prevented, or detected and corrected on a timely basis. A significant deficiency is a deficiency, or a
combination of deficiencies, in internal control that is less severe than a material weakness, yet important enough to
merit attention by those charged with governance.
Our consideration of internal control was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph of this section and
was not designed to identify all deficiencies in internal control that might be material weaknesses or, significant
deficiencies. Given these limitations, during our audit we did not identify any deficiencies in internal control that we
consider to be material weaknesses. However, material weaknesses may exist that have not been identified.
Report on Compliance and Other Matters
As part of obtaining reasonable assurance about whether the Authority’s financial statements are free from material
misstatement, we performed tests of its compliance with certain provisions of laws, regulations, contracts, and grant
agreements, noncompliance with which could have a direct and material effect on the determination of financial
statement amounts. However, providing an opinion on compliance with those provisions was not an objective of our
audit, and accordingly, we do not express such an opinion. The results of our tests disclosed no instances of
noncompliance or other matters that are required to be reported under Government Auditing Standards.

Independent Auditor’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting and
on Compliance and Other Matters Based on an Audit of Financial Statements
Performed in Accordance with Government Auditing Standards (Continued)
Purpose of this Report
The purpose of this report is solely to describe the scope of our testing of internal control and compliance and the
results of that testing, and not to provide an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal control or on
compliance. This report is an integral part of an audit performed in accordance with Government Auditing Standards
in considering the entity’s internal control and compliance. Accordingly, this communication is not suitable for any
other purpose.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT
Independent Auditor’s Report
To the Advisory Board of the Greater Attleboro-Taunton Regional Transit Authority
Taunton, Massachusetts
Opinions
We have audited the accompanying financial statements of the business-type activities and the aggregate remaining fund
information of the Greater Attleboro-Taunton Regional Transit Authority (“the Authority”), as of and for the year ended
June 30, 2024, and the related notes to the financial statements, which collectively comprise the Authority’s basic financial
statements as listed in the table of contents.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the respective financial
position of the business-type activities of the Authority, as of June 30, 2024, and the respective changes in financial
position and cash flows thereof for the year then ended in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America.
Basis for Opinions
We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America and the
standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards, issued by the Comptroller General of
the United States. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the
Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report. We are required to be independent of the Authority and to meet our
other ethical responsibilities, in accordance with the relevant ethical requirements relating to our audit. We believe that the
audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinions.
Responsibilities of Management for the Financial Statements
Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and for the design, implementation, and
maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements that are free from
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements, management is required to evaluate whether there are conditions or events, considered
in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the Authority’s ability to continue as a going concern for twelve months
beyond the financial statement date, including any currently known information that may raise substantial doubt shortly
thereafter.
Continued

Greater Attleboro-Taunton Regional Transit Authority
Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinions. Reasonable
assurance is a high level of assurance but is not absolute assurance and therefore is not a guarantee that an audit conducted
in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards and Government Auditing Standards will always detect a material
misstatement when it exists. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one
resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of
internal control. Misstatements are considered material if there is a substantial likelihood that, individually or in the
aggregate, they would influence the judgment made by a reasonable user based on the financial statements.
In performing an audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards and Government Auditing Standards, we:
• Exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit.
• Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error,
and design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks. Such procedures include examining, on a test
basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
• Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are
appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the
Authority’s internal control. Accordingly, no such opinion is expressed.
• Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant accounting
estimates made by management, as well as evaluate the overall presentation of the financial statements.
• Conclude whether, in our judgment, there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise
substantial doubt about the Authority’s ability to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time.
We are required to communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope
and timing of the audit, significant audit findings, and certain internal control-related matters that we identified during the
audit.
Required Supplementary Information
Accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America require that the management’s discussion and
analysis and certain pension and other post-employment information be presented to supplement the basic financial
statements. Such information is the responsibility of management and, although not a part of the basic financial statements,
is required by the Governmental Accounting Standards Board who considers it to be an essential part of financial reporting
for placing the basic financial statements in an appropriate operational, economic, or historical context. We have applied
certain limited procedures to the required supplementary information in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States of America, which consisted of inquiries of management about the methods of preparing the
information and comparing the information for consistency with management’s responses to our inquiries, the basic
financial statements, and other knowledge we obtained during our audit of the basic financial statements. We do not express
an opinion or provide any assurance on the information because the limited procedures do not provide us with sufficient
evidence to express an opinion or provide any assurance.

Greater Attleboro-Taunton Regional Transit Authority
Supplementary Information
Our audit was conducted for the purpose of forming opinions on the financial statements that collectively comprise the
Authority’s basic financial statements. The Schedule of Local (Cities and Towns) Funding, Net Cost of Service, and
Schedule of Revenues and Expenses – Brokerage Department, are presented for purposes of additional analysis and are not
a required part of the basic financial statements. Such information is the responsibility of management and was derived
from and relates directly to the underlying accounting and other records used to prepare the basic financial statements. The
information has been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the audit of the basic financial statements and certain
additional procedures, including comparing and reconciling such information directly to the underlying accounting and
other records used to prepare the basic financial statements or to the basic financial statements themselves, and other
additional procedures in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. In our
opinion, the accompanying supplemental information is fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the basic
financial statements as a whole.
Other Reporting Required by Government Auditing Standards
In accordance with Government Auditing Standards, we have also issued our report dated December 31, 2024, on our
consideration of the Authority’s internal control over financial reporting and on our tests of its compliance with certain
provisions of laws, regulations, contracts, and grant agreements and other matters. The purpose of that report is solely to
describe the scope of our testing of internal control over financial reporting and compliance and the results of that testing,
and not to provide an opinion on the effectiveness of the Authority’s internal control over financial reporting or on
compliance. That report is an integral part of an audit performed in accordance with Government Auditing Standards in
considering Authority’s internal control over financial reporting and compliance.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Unaudited)
For the Year Ended June 30, 2024
Management’s Discussion and Analysis – Required Supplementary Information (Unaudited)
Introduction
As Management of the Greater Attleboro-Taunton Regional Transit Authority (the Authority), we present this Management
Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) to provide financial statement readers with an introduction and overview to the
Authority’s financial activities during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024. The components of the Authority’s Financial
Statements as defined by GASB Statement 24 are as follows:
Management’s Discussion and Analysis
The Management’s Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) is required supplementary information that accompanies the financial
statements and is unaudited. The MD&A precedes the proprietary fund financial statements. In this section, management
aims to provide an analysis of the overall financial position of the Authority and results of the fiscal year operations, assess
whether financial position improved or deteriorated during the year, consider economic factors that may affect operating
results, and describe currently known events or conditions that may affect the Authority’s future financial position.
Proprietary Fund Financial Statements
The Greater Attleboro-Taunton Regional Transit Authority’s financial statements are presented as follows:
The Statement of Net Position reports on financial position at fiscal year-end. The statement distinguishes between current
and noncurrent assets and liabilities of the Authority. The difference between assets and liabilities is presented as net
position. Increases or decreases to net position may serve as a useful indicator of whether the Authority’s financial position
is improving or deteriorating over time. Net position is divided into three categories: net investment in capital assets,
restricted, and unrestricted. Total Net Position per the Statement of Net Position equals the Net Position at June 30, 2024
reported on the Statement of Revenues, Expenses, and Changes in Net Position.
The Statement of Revenues, Expenses, and Changes in Net Position measures performance for the fiscal year. Revenues and
expenses are presented in three categories: operating, non-operating, and capital. This statement provides information on
the costs of providing the services requested of us, how the Authority finances the services (i.e. user fees, federal and state
grants, local assessments, and other revenues), and if current year revenues were sufficient to pay for current year expenses.
The Operating Income (Loss per the Statement of Revenues, Expenses, and Changes in Net Position is reconciled to Cash
Flows from Operating Activities on the Statement of Cash Flows.
The Statement of Cash Flows reports whether cash increased or decreased during the year. Cash flows are reported in four
categories: operating, noncapital financing, capital and related financing, and investing. This statement provides useful
information on the cash receipts and uses of the Authority during the fiscal year and helps users to analyze the Authority’s
ability to generate future cash flows and meet future obligations. Cash and Cash Equivalents at June 30, 2024 reported on
the Statement of Cash Flows equal Cash per the Statement of Net Position.
The Notes to Financial Statements communicate additional objective information to financial statement readers, including
the Authority’s accounting policies and explanations or data not shown on the face of the statements.
Required Supplementary Information
In addition to the Management’s Discussion and Analysis, the following information is required material that is unaudited:
Schedule of Proportionate Share of Net Pension Liability, Schedule of Pension Contributions, and Schedule of Changes in
total OPEB Liability and Related Ratios. These schedules are found following the proprietary fund financial statements.
Supplementary Information
The following are supplemental schedules: Schedule of Local (Cities and Towns) Funding, Net Cost of Service, and
Schedule of Revenues and Expenses – Brokerage Department. These schedules are found following the proprietary fund
financial statement and required supplementary information.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Unaudited) (Continued)
For the Year Ended June 30, 2024
Financial Analysis
The COVID-19 pandemic, beginning in March 2020 and continuing through fiscal year end, June 30, 2021, significantly
affected GATRA’s operations and financial trends during the two-year period. During the fiscal year ending June 30, 2022,
continuing into the fiscal year ending June 30, 2024, GATRA experienced an increase in services, with operations trending
towards pre-pandemic levels. Detailed analyses of the normal trends and COVID-specific impacts are detailed below.
Total current assets increased in 2024 by approximately $2.1 million or 8%. This was primarily caused by an increase in
amounts due from other governments of $3.8 million. Fluctuation in this balance from year to year is common and mostly
due to timing differences in the receipt of operating and capital assistance from federal and state sources. In fiscal years
2020 and 2021, GATRA reduced human services transportation programs beginning in March 2020 in response to the
pandemic, resulting in a decrease in reimbursement billings sent to the State through those fiscal year ends. Beginning in
fiscal year 2022 and continuing in the current year, GATRA continued to resume these programs and experience an
increase in services, which increased the balances in receivables at year end.
Total current liabilities increased in 2024 by approximately $800 thousand or 3.6%. The increase was primarily due to
accounts payable to operators. Again, year-to-year fluctuation in this balance is common and is most often related to timing
differences in payment of operating and capital invoices at year end. Due to the pandemic and the reduction in human
service transportation operations described above, fewer bills were received from the operators and outstanding at the end
of the prior fiscal year. In fiscal year 2024, GATRA continued to resume normal operations in these programs towards pre-
pandemic levels, which increased the balances in payables at year end. Additionally, the notes payable balance at June 30,
2024 was consistent with the prior year balance at $8.2 million related to revenue anticipation notes with $8.2 million
issued and retired.
Total noncurrent liabilities decreased in 2024 by approximately $82 thousand or 1%. This was primarily caused by an
decrease in OPEB liability of $130 thousand, an increase in net pension liability of $170 thousand and a decrease in
compensated absences of $123 thousand. The changes in pension and post-employment benefit liabilities were due to
changes in the actuarial valuations and changes in compensated absences were due to staff turnover.
GATRA recognized an increase in capital assets in 2024 of $5.1 million or 6.8%. This was primarily a result of purchases
of facilities totaling approximately $900 thousand and buses totaling $4 million. There were no disposals in the current
fiscal year.
At the end of the current fiscal year, Greater Attleboro-Taunton Regional Transit Authority had no long-term bonded debt
outstanding. The Authority regularly borrows on a short-term basis in anticipation of state and federal grant revenues to
supplement its cash flow during the year.
As of the close of the current fiscal year, the Authority’s proprietary fund reported an ending net position of $27.5 million,
an increase over the prior year of $2.8 million. This increase was the combination of an increase to net investments in
capital assets of $1.6 million and unrestricted net position of $1.2 million.
The increase in net position was the result of the Authority’s revenues, operating assistance, and capital contributions
exceeding expenses by $2.8 million.
Total operating revenues increased in FY24 by $7.6 million or 11%. The increase was the result of increased ridership in
response to the recovery from the COVID pandemic and the addition of new contracts. Both fixed route and demand
response ridership was higher compared to prior years. Throughout the fiscal year, the volume of brokerage services
provided was significantly higher compared to that experienced during the pandemic, with service levels trending towards
pre-pandemic numbers. GATRA anticipates that these numbers will continue to trend upwards as we recover from the
pandemic and return to normalcy.
Total operating expenses increased by $10.5 million or 11.4%. The increases were related to increased purchases of
transportation services in response to increased ridership as noted above.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Unaudited) (Continued)
For the Year Ended June 30, 2024
Economic Factors
The unemployment rate for the Taunton-Middleborough-Norton Labor Market as of June 30, 2024 was 4.2%, which
increased 0.5% from 3.7% a year ago. This rate is slightly higher than the statewide trend experienced in which the
unemployment rate of 3.3% in June 2023 decreased to 3.2% by the end of fiscal year 2024. The inflationary trend in the
region (3.5% annual – BLS CPI Boston-Cambridge-Quincy region for all items) is higher than the national inflation rate
(3.0% - BLS CPI Urban areas - all items) for the last year. Note however, GATRA procurements are driven by national
factors as much as regional.
All of these factors were considered in preparing the Greater Attleboro-Taunton Regional Transit Authority’s budget for the
2025 fiscal year and GATRA has presented the planned level of expense to the Greater Attleboro-Taunton Regional Transit
Authority Advisory Board and to the State of Massachusetts Department of Transportation.

Greater Attleboro-Taunton Regional Transit Authority
(A Component Unit of the Massachusetts Department of Transportation)
Notes to Financial Statements (Continued)
For the Year Ended June 30, 2024
Notes to the Financial Statements
1. The Authority and Operators
The Greater Attleboro-Taunton Regional Transit Authority (the Authority) is a component unit of the
Massachusetts Department of Transportation (Mass DOT) and Mass DOT is a component unit of the
Commonwealth of Massachusetts (the Commonwealth). The Authority was established as a political subdivision
of the Commonwealth on December 15, 1976, by the various cities and towns constituting the Authority, pursuant
to Section 3 of Chapter 161B of the General Laws of the Commonwealth, for the purpose of continuing and
improving local transit service.
The Authority is managed by an Administrator appointed by an Advisory Board. The Advisory Board is made up
of appointed representatives from the member communities. The Authority’s operations are primarily funded
through passenger fares, contractual reimbursements and operating subsidies from the federal government, Mass
DOT, and the member communities. In addition, the Authority receives federal and state capital grants that are
used to finance acquisitions and improvements to facilities and equipment.
The operation and maintenance of the Authority is performed by various private sector transportation companies
(the Operators) under terms and agreements whereby the carriers provide mass transit along such routes and
according to such schedules as may be defined by the Authority.
The Authority also has a brokerage contract with the Commonwealth’s Executive Office of Health and Human
Services, whereby the Authority coordinates with this Agency to provide its clients with transportation services.
The actual services are provided by various private sector transportation companies.
2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Measurement Focus, Basis of Accounting, and Financial Reporting Presentation
The financial statements of the Authority have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of American (GAAP) as applied to government entities. The Governmental
Accounting Standards Board (GASB) is the accepted standard-setting body for establishing governmental
accounting and financial reporting principles. Under these standards, the Authority meets the definition of a
special-purpose government, engaged only in business-type activities.
The financial statements are reported using the economic resources measurement focus and the accrual basis of
accounting. Revenues are recognized at the time transportation services are provided. Unearned revenue represents
cash received in advance of future services.
The Authority distinguishes between operating revenues and expenses and nonoperating revenues and expenses.
Operating revenues and expenses generally result from providing services in connection with the Authority’s
principal ongoing operations. The Authority’s principal operating revenues are charges for services. Operating
expenses include the cost of transit services, provided by third party vendors, maintenance, administrative and
depreciation expense. All revenues and expenses not meeting this definition are reported as non-operating
revenues and expenses.
Inventories
Inventories of fuel are stated at the lower of cost or market on a first-in, first-out basis (FIFO). Inventories of parts
are stated at the lower of cost or market on an average cost basis.

Notes to Financial Statements (Continued)
For the Year Ended June 30, 2024
2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)
Capital Assets
Capital assets are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line
method based on the estimated service lives of the assets. The Authority’s capitalization policy is to capitalize all
assets acquired with capital funds regardless of the dollar amount. The estimated service lives are as follows:
Buildings 20 – 40 years
Vehicles 4 – 14 years
Equipment 5 – 7 years
Intangible assets 2 – 7 years
Net Position
Net position is the residual of all other elements presented in a statement of net position. It is the difference
between (a) assets and deferred outflows of resources and (b) liabilities and deferred inflows of resources. Net
position is reported in three categories and these are defined as follows: (1) amounts invested in capital assets
consists of capital assets, net of accumulated depreciation and is reduced by the related debt that is attributed to the
acquisition, construction, or improvement of those assets, (2) restricted net position results when constraints are
placed on net position use, and are either externally imposed by creditors, grantors, contributors, and the like, or
imposed by law through legislation, (3) Unrestricted net position consists of net position that does not meet the
definition of the two preceding categories.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the
financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Statement of Cash Flows
For purposes of the statement of cash flows, the Authority considers all highly liquid investments purchased with a
maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.
Available Unrestricted Resources
The Authority’s policy is to utilize available restricted resources prior to unrestricted resources.
Pensions
For purposes of measuring the Authority’s net pension liability, deferred outflows of resources and deferred
inflows of resources related to pensions, and pension expense, information about fiduciary net position of the
Taunton Contributory Retirement System (the System) and additions to/deductions from the System’s fiduciary
net position have been determined on the same basis as they are reported by the System.
For this purpose, benefit payments (including refunds of employee contributions) are recognized when due and
payable in accordance with the benefit terms. Investments are reported at fair value.
3. Cash
State and local statutes place certain limitations on the nature of deposits and investments available to the
Authority. Deposits (including demand deposits, term deposits, and certificates of deposit) in any one financial
institution may not exceed certain levels without collateralization by the financial institutions involved.
Investments can also be made in securities issued by or unconditionally guaranteed by the U. S. Government or its
agencies that have a maturity of less than one year from the date of purchase and repurchase agreements
guaranteed by such securities with maturity dates of no more than 90 days from the date of purchase.

3. Cash (continued)
Custodial credit risk exists for cash deposits when, in the event of the failure of a depository financial institution,
the Authority’s deposits will not be recovered. The Authority does not have a formal policy with regard to
custodial credit risk but places its funds in deposits that are insured or collateralized with securities held by the
pledging financial institution’s trust department in the financial institution’s name. the total amount of the
Authority’s bank deposits consists of the following at June 30, 2024:

7. Restricted Net Position
Reserve for Extraordinary Expense
In accordance with Section 6 of Chapter 161B of the General Laws of the Commonwealth, the Authority is
allowed to establish a reserve account for the purpose of meeting the cost of extraordinary expenses in an amount
not to exceed three percent of the prior year’s local assessment. Any balance in the reserve account at the end of
the fiscal year may be carried forward into the next fiscal year, provided, however, that the aggregate amount in
the account does not exceed twenty percent of the prior year’s local assessment. The Authority did not contribute
additional funds to the reserve. The balance in the reserve account at June 30, 2024 is $936,033.
Restricted for Attleboro Station Improvements
The Authority leases a commuter rail station from the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA). The
lease allows the Authority to operate the MBTA’s Attleboro Station paid parking facility. The excess of the
revenues over expenses is shared with the MBTA. However, the Authority’s share of income use is restricted to
capital improvements to the Attleboro Station. At the end of the lease term, any remaining excess revenues not
used for improvements will be returned to the MBTA. The balance restricted for Attleboro Station improvements
at June 30, 2024 is $878,004.
8. Post Employment Benefit Plans
Pension Plan - General Information about the Pension Plan
Plan Description

System). The System is a cost-sharing, multiple-employer, defined benefit pension plan. The System is a member
of the Massachusetts Association of Contributory Retirement Systems and is governed by Massachusetts General
Laws, Chapter 32. Oversight of the System is provided by a five-person Board of Retirement. The System issues a
publicly available financial report that may be obtained by contacting the System located at 140 Dean Street, Suite
203, Taunton, MA 02780.

8. Post Employment Benefit Plans (continued)
Benefits Provided
The plan covers all full-time employees and provides retirement, disability, cost of living adjustments and death
benefits to all plan members and beneficiaries. The plan provides for retirement allowance benefits up to a
maximum of 80% of a member’s highest three-year average annual rate of regular compensation for those hired
prior to April 2, 2012. For persons who became members on or after April 2, 2012, average salary is the average
annual rate of regular compensation received during the five consecutive years that produce the highest average,
or, if greater, during the last five years (whether or not consecutive) preceding retirement. Benefit payments are
based upon a member’s age, length of creditable service, level of compensation, and group classification.
Contributions
Pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws, Chapter 32, contribution requirements of the active employees and the
participating employers are established and may be amended by the Massachusetts Contributory Retirement
system. System members are required to pay into the System 5% to 11% of their covered compensation,
depending on plan entry date and the level of compensation. The Authority’s required contribution for the year
ended June 30, 2024 was $217,417 (which was 8.8% of actual payroll expense), actuarily determined as an amount
that, when combined with employees during the year, with an additional amount to finance any unfunded accrued
liability.
Pension Liabilities, Expense and Deferred Outflows and Inflows of Resources Related to Pensions
At June 30, 2024, the Authority reported a liability of $1,515,830 for its proportionate share of the net pension
liability. The net pension liability was measured as of December 31, 2023, and the total pension liability used to
calculate the net pension liability was determined by an actuarial valuation as of January 1, 2023. The authority’s
proportion of the net pension liability was based on a projection of the long-term share of contributions to the
pension plan relative to the projected contributions of all participating employers, actuarially determined. At
December 31, 2023, the Authority’s proportion of the net pension liability was approximately 1.08%, an increase
of approximately 0.14% from the prior measurement date.
Changes in Assumptions
Since the prior valuation, there were no changes to the actuarial assumptions that would have an effect on the
measurement of the net pension liability:
The discount rate remained at 7.6%
The base to which the annual cost of living adjustment (COLA) is applied remained at $16,000
For the year ended June 30, 2024, the Authority recognized pension expense of $230,847 and reported deferred
outflows and deferred inflows of resources related to pensions from the following sources:
Deferred
Outflows of
Resources
Difference between expected and actual experience $ 221,482

The long-term expected rate of return on pension plan investments was determined using best-estimate ranges of
expected future nominal rates of return (expected returns, net of pension plan investment expense and inflation)
developed for each major asset class using an econometric model that forecasts a variety of economic
environments and then calculates asset class returns based on functional relationships between the economic
variables and the asset classes. The target allocation and projected arithmetic real rates of return for each major
asset class, used in derivation of the long-term expected investment rate of return assumption as of December 31,
2023 are summarized in the following table:
Long-Term Long-Term
Expected Asset Expected Real
Asset Class Allocation Rate of Return
Equity 60% 8.09%
Fixed Income 20% 4.27%
Alternatives 5% 6.49%
Real Estate 15% 9.99%
Total 100%
Discount Rate
The discount rate used to measure the total pension liability was 7.6% at December 1, 2023 and 2022. The
projection of cash flows used to determine the discount rate assumed plan member contributions will be made at
the current contribution rate and that contributions from employers will be made at rates equal to the actuarially
determined contribution rate. Based on those assumptions, the System’s fiduciary net position was projected to be
available to make all projected future benefit payments of current plan members. Therefore, the long-term
expected rate of return on pension plan investments was applied to all periods of projected benefit payments to
determine the total pension liability.
Sensitivity of the Authority’s Proportionate Share of the Net Pension Liability to Changes in the Discount Rate
The following presents the Authority’s proportionate share of the net pension liability calculated using the
discount rate of 7.6 percent, as well as what the Authority’s proportionate share of the net pension liability would
be if it were calculated using a discount rate that is 1 percentage point lower (6.6%) or 1 percentage point higher
(8.6%) than the current rate:
1% Discount 1%
Decrease Rate Increase
6.60% 7.60% 8.60%
Authority's proportionate share of the
net pension liability $ 965,562 $ 1,515,830 $ 2,161,240
Pension Plan Fiduciary Net Position
Detailed information about the pension plan's fiduciary net position is available in the separately issued System
financial report. The Plan's fiduciary net position uses the same basis as the plan. The Plan uses the accrual basis
of accounting, and benefits and refunds are recognized when due and payable. Plan investments are measured at
fair value.

8. Post Employment Benefit Plans (continued)
Post Employment Healthcare Benefits Plan
Plan Description
The Authority administers a single-employer, defined-benefit post- employment health care plan. The plan
provides benefits for eligible employees who have attained age 55 and render at least 10 or more years of service
or at any age with 20 years of service, until the employee is eligible for Medicare. For those hired after April 1,
2012, benefits are received after attaining age 60 with 10 or more years of service. The benefits, benefit level,
employee contributions and employer contributions are governed by the Authority. As of July 1, 2023, the
actuarial valuation date, 44 active employees and 11 retirees or beneficiaries currently receiving benefits met
eligibility requirements. The plan does not accumulate assets in a trust that meets the criteria of GASBS No.75 and
does not issue separate stand-alone financial statements.
Benefits Provided
Medical coverage under the group health insurance plan for regular full-time employees will continue until the
employee is eligible for Medicare. Coverage for the dependents of such regular full-time employees will also
continue during this period. Once the retired employee is entitled to Medicare, health care coverage for the
employee's spouse will continue, provided that the enrollment costs as established annually by the Plan
administrator are paid.
Dental coverage under the group health insurance plan for regular full-time employees will continue until the
employee is eligible for Medicare. Coverage for the dependents of such regular full-time employees will also
continue during this period. Once the retired employee is entitled to Medicare, health care coverage for the
employee's spouse will continue, provided that the enrollment costs as established annually by the Plan
administrator are paid.
Contributions
For medical coverage, grandfathered retirees must pay 10% of the enrollment cost (the "working rate") as
established annually by the Plan administrator and all other retirees pay 25%. The Authority contributes the
remainder of the health plan costs.
For dental coverage, the retired employee must pay 0% of the enrollment cost (the "working rate") as established
annually by the Plan administrator. The Authority contributes the remainder of the health plan costs.
Total OPEB Liability
The Authority's total OPEB liability of $6,377,090 was measured, as of June 30, 2024, based on an actuarial
valuation that was performed on July 1, 2023.
Changes in Assumptions
Since the prior valuation, one key assumption has changed that affected measurement of the total OPEB liability:
• Due to the GASBS No. 75 standards, the discount rate has been changed from 4.09% to 4.21% decreasing
the disclosed liability by approximately $100 thousand.

9. Commitments and Contingencies
Purchase Commitments
Construction in progress at June 30, 2024 consisted of expenditures by the Authority for various construction
projects. At June 30, 2024, remaining commitments for these projects were approximately $0.
Litigation
In the normal course of operations, the Authority has been named in various claims and litigation. Based upon
information available to counsel and the Authority, management believes that the ultimate outcome from these
claims and litigations will not have a material adverse effect on the Authority’s financial position.
Risk Management
The Authority is exposed to various risks of loss related to tors; theft of, and damage to, and destruction of assets;
errors and omissions; natural disasters; and workers compensation claims for which the Authority carries
commercial insurance. Settlements have not exceeded coverages for each of the past three fiscal years.
The Authority’s workers compensation coverage is insured under a retrospectively rated policy. In the opinion of
management, any insurance carrier audit adjustment, if any, will not be material to the accompanying financial
statements. The Authority has received capital and operating financial assistance from federal and state agencies in
the form of grants. Expenditure of funds under these programs generally requires compliance with terms and
conditions specified in the grant agreements and are subject to audit by the grantor agencies. Any disallowed
claims resulting from such audits could become a liability of the Authority. In the opinion of Authority
management, liabilities resulting from such disallowed expenditures, if any, would not be material to the
accompanying financial statements.

Independent Auditor’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting and
on Compliance and Other Matters Based on an Audit of Financial Statements
Performed in Accordance with Government Auditing Standards
To the Advisory Board of the
Greater Attleboro-Taunton Regional Transit Authority
We have audited, in accordance with the auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America and
the standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards issued by the Comptroller
General of the United States, the financial statements of the business-type activities of the Greater Attleboro-
Taunton Regional Transit Authority (“the Authority”), as of and for the year ended June 30, 2024, and the related
notes to the financial statements, which collectively comprise the Authority’s basic financial statements,
and have issued our report thereon dated December 31, 2024.
Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements, we considered the Authority’s internal control
over financial reporting (internal control) to determine the audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances
for the purpose of expressing our opinions on the financial statements, but not for the purpose of expressing an
opinion on the effectiveness of the Authority’s internal control. Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the
effectiveness of the Authority’s internal control.
A deficiency in internal control exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow management or
employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent, or detect and correct,
misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal
control, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the entity’s financial statements
will not be prevented, or detected and corrected on a timely basis. A significant deficiency is a deficiency, or a
combination of deficiencies, in internal control that is less severe than a material weakness, yet important enough to
merit attention by those charged with governance.
Our consideration of internal control was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph of this section and
was not designed to identify all deficiencies in internal control that might be material weaknesses or, significant
deficiencies. Given these limitations, during our audit we did not identify any deficiencies in internal control that we
consider to be material weaknesses. However, material weaknesses may exist that have not been identified.
Report on Compliance and Other Matters
As part of obtaining reasonable assurance about whether the Authority’s financial statements are free from material
misstatement, we performed tests of its compliance with certain provisions of laws, regulations, contracts, and grant
agreements, noncompliance with which could have a direct and material effect on the determination of financial
statement amounts. However, providing an opinion on compliance with those provisions was not an objective of our
audit, and accordingly, we do not express such an opinion. The results of our tests disclosed no instances of
noncompliance or other matters that are required to be reported under Government Auditing Standards.

on Compliance and Other Matters Based on an Audit of Financial Statements

Purpose of this Report
The purpose of this report is solely to describe the scope of our testing of internal control and compliance and the
results of that testing, and not to provide an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal control or on
compliance. This report is an integral part of an audit performed in accordance with Government Auditing Standards
in considering the entity’s internal control and compliance. Accordingly, this communication is not suitable for any
other purpose.
