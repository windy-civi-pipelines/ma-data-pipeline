Essex District Attorney's Drug Diversion Program Annual Report
Dear Senator Rodrigues,
Enclosed, please find a report on the Juvenile Justice and Drug Diversion activities of the Essex
District Attorney's Office. I invite your review of this report but would like to highlight the
following:
• The Juvenile Justice Unit is responsible for reviewing all juvenile and youthful cases to
determine the appropriate response, ranging from Diversion to traditional prosecution.
We continue to offer Juvenile Diversion and Youthful Diversion in all district and juvenile
courts and are continuing to explore options to expand this response to all ages.
• Our nationally recognized Drug Diversion Program offers treatment on demand for
certain non-violent offenders of all ages. For 2024, we continued to work closely with
Bridgewell. Unfortunately, Bridgewell is no longer participating in the diversion program,
and we are in the process of seeking new partners for the Drug Diversion Program. We
remain committed to aiding those suffering from substance use disorder.
• We continue to respond to the needs of at-risk youth by chairing 113 Community
Collaborative Initiative (CCI) meetings during 2024. These multi-disciplinary meetings
are conducted pursuant to the mandate of M.G.L. c. 221 of the Acts of 2004, which
authorizes the sharing of information for at-risk youth.
• In July and August of 2024, we held our Essex County Summer Day Program with the
collaboration of several Essex County Police Departments. Over 400 children
participated in fun-filled, educational opportunities. The Program allows youth, police,
and peer leaders the opportunity to spend a week together participating in anti-drug and
violence prevention lessons, educational workshops, and team-building activities.

• With the goal of incorporating Restorative Justice into our existing diversion programs,
we have hired a Restorative Justice Coordinator and sent members of our staff to the
Center for Restorative Justice at Suffolk University and Circle Training at ROCA. We
were able to offer several Restorative Justice Circles to our juveniles with the assistance
of The Resolution Center in Beverly. It is our hope that by implementing this program,
we can further strengthen our communities through community healing.
• Prom and graduation season brings concerns about whether students are making safe
choices. Hoping to encourage safe choices, we offered grants to any school in the 34
cities and towns in Essex County to support alcohol and substance-free post-prom and
post-graduation events. Eight (8) communities participated.
• With the help of a Safer Communities Grant to address gang violence, illegal firearms,
and narcotics distribution that impacts the quality of life for Lynn and Lawrence
residents, we were able to partner with local organizations to bring programming to the
youth of Lynn and Lawrence.
n In partnership with the City of Lynn and facilitated by RECK Fitness and Massflag
champs, we hosted two (2) free, week-long, flag football and sports clinics for
100 kids each week of February and April school vacation.
n We also collaborated with Rise Academy in Lawrence and Change the Play, Inc.,
an Educational/Charitable organization that creates programming for at-risk
youth focusing on Education, Healthy Lifestyle Choices, and Identity. They
provide education in marketing, branding and entrepreneurship, music
production, DJ'ing, and podcasting instruction to youth.
• This summer, our office was able to support the Gloucester Police Community Impact
Unit's Kops 'N' Kids Youth Anglers Program. By uniting Gloucester youngsters with
police officers to share in the splendors of saltwater fishing, the hope is to break down
barriers between law enforcement agencies and the communities they serve.
• We have implemented a few new initiatives this year as well as supported some
community agencies that further our goals of helping our youth.
n Due to concerns surrounding drownings in Essex County and with an emphasis
on the importance of water safety, the District Attorney's Office partnered with
Mayor Nicholson and the Parks & Recreation Department in Lynn to provide a
swim program to youth ages 5 to 14 years old. Formal swimming lessons and
education on water safety can help to reduce the number of drownings.
n LEAP for Education, Inc. runs free, after-school and summer programs designed
to empower underserved students in Essex County. The hope is to achieve social
and economic mobility by cultivating personal, educational, and career growth.
Our office has granted funds in support of LEAP's goals.
n In the communities of Lynn and Lawrence, Lynn Youth Street Outreach
Advocacy, Inc. (LYSOA) seeks to empower high-risk youth by guiding them in
their search for a positive purpose in life. LYSOA provides advocacy and
outreach services to high-risk youth, young adults, and their families. To further
their mission, our office granted funds for a mental heath clinician and outreach
worker in Lawrence.

n Recently, it has become clear that Emerging adults (ages 18-24) in the criminal
justice system require programming that specifically addresses the unique needs
faced by this population. Because a strong solution requires that we build a
community approach to address these issues, I sat on a panel at the
Massachusetts 3rd Annual Emerging Adult Summit, in October, hosted by the
Executive Office of Public Safety, among others. I also sent several members of
my staff to the event. Further, I, along with members of my staff are participating
in the Essex County Emerging Adult Round Table, a community-based program
initiated by the Department of Youth Services.
Your continued support will ensure that these worthwhile programs will remain viable and
effective. For additional information, please feel free to contact Dawn Gigante-Masterson,
Director of Juvenile Justice or my Chief of Staff, Sharyn Lubas.
We look forward to continuing our collaborative efforts to keep our schools and communities
safe.

The Juvenile Diversion Program
The District Attorney's Juvenile Diversion Program is a national model that works with
certain first-time juvenile offenders aged 12 to 17, and their families, by offering an
alternative to the juvenile court system. Started in 1981, the program has effectively
addressed juvenile delinquent behavior while allowing participants a second chance.
The program provides first-time nonviolent offenders the opportunity to receive services
in lieu of being prosecuted through the traditional court process.
A juvenile's participation in the Juvenile Diversion Program is voluntary. If the juvenile
chooses not to participate in the program, the case will go forward through the court
system.
Cases are referred to the Juvenile Diversion Program before the juvenile is arraigned in
court. If a juvenile is appropriate for the program, the Juvenile Justice Coordinator will
meet with the juvenile and his or her parents or guardian and execute a signed
agreement for their participation in the program.
Once accepted into the program, the juvenile participates in appropriate counseling,
education, and community service projects. If a case involves property damage, the
juvenile may also be held responsible for restitution.
The juvenile's case is monitored by the District Attorney's Juvenile Justice Staff. The
Juvenile Justice Coordinator is responsible for supervising the case and monitoring
counseling, community service and restitution.
If the juvenile successfully completes the program, the District Attorney will dismiss the
charges, and the juvenile will not have a delinquency record. If the juvenile does not
successfully complete the program or voluntarily withdraws from the program, the case
will go forward in court for prosecution.
Major components of the Juvenile Diversion Program
Counseling
The Juvenile Diversion Program is designed to identify and address high-risk behavior
and to prevent further involvement of a youth in the juvenile justice system.
As part of his or her involvement in the Juvenile Diversion Program, a juvenile is
required to participate in a counseling program. The Diversion Program requires a
juvenile to receive a counseling evaluation from a licensed professional and attend
recommended individual or group counseling. If, for any reason, counseling is not
warranted, the juvenile would be required to participate in an education group, which
may cover important topics including decision-making, high-risk behavior, and alcohol
and substance abuse education. The number of sessions that are required will be
determined by the counselor.
A list of counseling agencies that work with the program will be provided to families.
However, families may choose an individual counselor by speaking to their primary care
physician or health insurance provider.

Once a counselor has been chosen, the family must contact this office within one week
with the counselor's name, address, and phone contact information and a referral will be
sent to the appropriate agency. A Juvenile Justice Coordinator will also contact the
counselor and provide them with information pertinent to the Diversion Program and the
program's requirements. A Juvenile Justice Coordinator will maintain contact with the
counselor until the juvenile has completed the program.
Community Service
As part of the Juvenile Diversion Program, juveniles are required to volunteer at a
community agency or non-profit organization. Community service can provide juveniles
with the opportunity to "give back" to the community.
Community Service has a value to the community and can also provide a juvenile with
the understanding that it is important to be an active citizen.
During the intake, the Juvenile Justice Coordinator will discuss any potential volunteer
experience and skills to help determine a potential community service site for the
juvenile to perform their community service hours.
Juveniles are required to contact the Juvenile Justice Coordinator regarding their chosen
community service site.
Restitution
The Juvenile Diversion Program follows the state guidelines and collects any out-of-
pocket expenses and the replacement cost of damaged or stolen property. If this
component is applicable, the Juvenile Justice Coordinator will inform the juvenile of how
much money they will need to pay for restitution and where to send the bank check or
money orders.
Preparing for the future
All cases entering Juvenile Diversion are reviewed on a case-by-case basis and
sometimes require additional components. These additional components or conditions
may include online educational programs, enrollment in GED, technical or college
programs and access to job and career training.

Standards and Procedures for Acceptance to the Essex
District Attorney's Juvenile Diversion Program
The District Attorney's Juvenile Justice Program, established in 1981, is intended to
balance appropriate prevention services with strong prosecution, thereby providing an
effective response to each and every incident of juvenile crime in Essex County.
Accordingly, Juvenile Justice Staff in each district court reviews all juvenile cases. In
reviewing cases, all available information is taken into account including input from the
arresting officer or police liaison and specific community needs and concerns. Based on
a review by Juvenile Justice Coordinators and Assistant District Attorneys, juvenile
cases are referred for Juvenile Diversion, Juvenile Prosecution, or Indictment as a
Youthful Offender.
The Juvenile Diversion Program is offered to first-time, nonviolent juvenile offenders.
Participants in the Juvenile Diversion Program are required to attend appropriate
individual counseling or educational group, perform community service, and in certain
cases pay restitution. Juveniles who complete the program successfully will not have a
court record as a result of the incident. Those who fail to complete the program
successfully will be prosecuted. The majority of cases referred to the Juvenile Diversion
Program are referred at the pre-arraignment stage. However, occasionally there are
cases that are accepted post-arraignment.
The ultimate decision of whether to divert a case, either at the pre-arraignment or post-
arraignment level, or prosecute, shall be determined by the Juvenile Justice Coordinator
in conjunction with an Assistant District Attorney ("ADA") who has prosecutorial
discretion. No singular factor, in itself, is determinative of whether the juvenile is
diverted, either pre-arraignment or post-arraignment, or prosecuted.
Standards for Acceptance to the Juvenile Diversion Program
• A juvenile, age 12 to 17, may be referred.
• First Offenses, in most cases, may be eligible for the program. Prior
involvement with the police and prior court involvement are considered and may
be a basis for denial of entry into the program.
• Delinquent acts of violence, generally, are not referable. However, assaultive
crimes may be eligible in certain circumstances. Victim input is considered in
these matters. The ADA and JJ Coordinator will consult with supervisory staff
regarding possible diversion.
• Crimes of a group activity, which may be gang related, are not referable.
Crimes of a group activity, which are occasional, situational, and temporary,
may be eligible.
• Drug Offenses: Referrals can be made on "possession" and "use" cases.
Cases in which the District Attorney's Office would prosecute for "sale" are not
eligible.

• JOL: Any offenses that violate the Junior Operators Law may be eligible for
Juvenile Diversion but require Main Office approval.
• The following crimes will NOT be diverted unless there are exceptional and
mitigating circumstances and with the approval of the Main Office.
o Any/all major felonies
o Any sexual assault or sexual related offense
o Any serious drug cases alleging:
n Possession w/intent to distribute
n Distributing a controlled substance
o Misdemeanors or felonies identified by the District Attorney's Office, the
police, schools, or community in general, which have been determined to
be of particular concern to that community.
• Restitution is determined pursuant to the policies and procedures of the Victim
Witness Assistance Program. Indigent juveniles will not be excluded from
participation in the Juvenile Diversion Program solely because of an inability to
pay restitution. The program will attempt to make longer payment schedules
when appropriate. The juvenile and parent(s) or guardian(s) are informed that
fulfillment of the restitution component of the Juvenile Diversion Program contract
does NOT render them immune from civil action.
• The juvenile must acknowledge responsibility for their behavior in the offense.
• The juvenile and parent/guardian must be amenable to all the terms and
conditions of the contract and treatment program established by the JJ
Coordinator and ADA. Juveniles who do not agree to attend counseling and
complete community service projects shall be denied entry into the program.
• The juvenile and parent/guardian are informed that their participation in the
program is voluntary and that the case may be brought forward in court at any
time upon their request.
Standards for Compliance
Upon termination for non-compliance, the case will be brought forward, and the usual
juvenile court process shall resume in a non-prejudiced manner. The following
conditions are in violation of a juvenile's contract with the Diversion Program and may
result in the termination from the program for non-compliance:
• Failure of the juvenile to attend counseling on a regular basis.
• Failure of the juvenile to complete assigned community service projects.
• Commission of a subsequent offense.
• Failure to pay restitution.

Successful Program Completion
When a client successfully completes the goals of the Juvenile Diversion Program, the
termination process begins. The JJ Coordinator will monitor the follow-up procedure for
each client that successfully completes the program.
• The JJ Coordinator will contact each family by letter within a sixty (60) day period
after program completion.
• If additional services are requested, the JJ Coordinator will assist in securing the
needed services.
Juvenile Diversion Post-Complaint Procedure
• Juvenile is arraigned on delinquent charges.
• ADA informs the court that the case may be accepted into the Juvenile Diversion
Program and requests a status date. At this point, the JJ Coordinator and ADA
review facts and discuss with police. Where appropriate, the Victim Witness
Advocate ("VWA") becomes involved.
• If a case is to be accepted to the Juvenile Diversion Program post-arraignment,
the juvenile must appear before the Court and declare their intention to enter the
program.
• The ADA shall ask for a 4-month status/review date.
• At the review date, the JJ Coordinator shall report to the Court. If the juvenile has
completed the program successfully, then the ADA requests that the case be
dismissed.
• In the event that the JJ Coordinator requests the case be brought forward, the
Coordinator will inform the juvenile by written correspondence and the case will
proceed through the usual court process.

Juvenile/Youthful
Diversion
All potential Diversion cases are screened by a Juvenile Justice Coordinator.
Pre-Arraignment Post-Arraignment
Intake
A contract is signed by the youth and a parent (if under 18) that outlines
the requirements and expectations of the Diversion Program.
Case Management
The Juvenile Justice Coordinator monitors the case and receives updates from service
providers. The youth must provide documentation once requirements are complete.
Successful Unsuccessful
Case dismissed, not prosecuted. Case brought forward for prosecution.

Youthful Diversion Program
The District Attorney's Youthful Diversion Program offers first-time nonviolent offenders
aged 18 to 21 services in lieu of being prosecuted through the traditional court process.
Started in 1995, the Youthful Diversion program is based on the same principles of our
Juvenile Diversion Program.
Cases are referred to the Youthful Diversion Program before the youth is arraigned in
court. If a youth is appropriate for the program, the Juvenile Justice Coordinator will
meet with the youth and execute a signed agreement for their participation in the
Program. Participation in the Youthful Diversion Program is voluntary. If the youth
chooses not to participate in the program, the case will go forward through the court
system.
Once accepted into the Program, the youth participates in appropriate
counseling/education and community service projects. If a case involves property
damage or theft, the youth may also be held responsible for restitution.
Each case is supervised by the District Attorney's Juvenile Justice Staff. The Juvenile
Justice Staff is responsible for monitoring counseling, community service, and restitution.
If the youth successfully completes the program, the District Attorney will dismiss the
charges, and the youth will not have a court record. If the youth does not successfully
complete the program or voluntarily withdraws from the program, the case will go
forward in court for prosecution.
Major Components of the Youthful Diversion Program
Counseling
The Youthful Diversion Program is designed to identify and address high-risk behavior
and to prevent further involvement of a youth in the criminal justice system.
As part of the involvement in the Youthful Diversion Program, a youth is required to
participate in a counseling program. The Diversion Program requires a youth to receive
a counseling evaluation from a licensed professional and attend recommended
individual or group counseling. If, for any reason, counseling is not warranted, the youth
would be required to participate in an education group, which may cover important topics
including decision-making, high-risk behavior, and alcohol and substance abuse
education. The number of sessions that are required will be determined by the
counselor.
A list of counseling agencies that work with the program will be provided to the youth.
However, the youth may choose an individual counselor by speaking to their primary
care physician or health insurance provider.
(

Once a counselor has been chosen, the youth must contact the District Attorney's Office
with the counselor's name, address, and phone contact information and a referral will be
sent to the appropriate agency. A Juvenile Justice Coordinator will also contact the
counselor and provide them with information pertinent to the Diversion Program and the
program's requirements. A Juvenile Justice Coordinator will maintain contact with the
counselor until the youth has completed the program.
Community Service
As part of the Youthful Diversion Program, participants are required to volunteer at a
community agency or non-profit organization. Community service provides participants
with the opportunity to "give back" to the community.
A list of community service sites will be offered. However, the youth may choose another
site or project, subject to approval by the Juvenile Justice Coordinator.
Restitution
The Youthful Diversion Program follows the state guidelines and collects any out-of-
pocket expenses and/or replacement cost of damaged or stolen property. If this
component is applicable, the Juvenile Justice Coordinator will inform the youth of how
much money they owe for restitution and where to send the bank check or money
orders.
Preparing for the future
All cases entering Youthful Diversion are reviewed on a case-by-case basis and
sometimes require additional components. These additional components or conditions
may include online educational programs, enrollment in GED, technical or college
programs and access to job and career training.

Standards for Acceptance to the Essex District Attorney's
Youthful Diversion Program
In 1995, the District Attorney's Office expanded the diversion concept to include youth (aged 18
to 21). Cases are reviewed by Juvenile Justice Coordinators to determine eligibility. In this
way, young people who have committed non-violent offenses are offered a second chance. By
intervening and providing services the first time a young person is charged, it is hoped that they
will have no further involvement in the criminal justice system.
Youthful Diversion requires first-time offenders to participate in an educational group and/or
counseling, perform community service, and pay any applicable restitution in lieu of going
through the court system. Successful completion of the Program will result in the youth not
having a court record for the offense which brought the youth to the attention of the court.
Most participants in the Youthful Diversion Program are referred pre-arraignment by a police
officer, a Clerk Magistrate, or a probation officer. The program also accepts cases referred
post-arraignment. Eligibility is determined by a Juvenile Justice Coordinator on a case-by-case
basis following certain basic criteria. However, the ultimate decision of whether or not to divert
a case at the pre-complaint level shall be determined by the Assistant District Attorney. No
singular factor in itself is determinative of whether the youth is prosecuted or diverted.
Standards for Acceptance
• A first-time offender, aged 18 to 21, may be referred.
• Eligible offenses to the Youthful Diversion Program may include:
o Minor in possession of alcohol
o Disorderly conduct
o Public drinking
o Disturbing the peace
o Minor purchasing or attempting to purchase alcoholic beverages
o Shoplifting
o Trespassing
• Drug Offenses: Referrals can be made on "possession" and "use" cases. Cases in
which the District Attorney's Office would prosecute for "sale" are not eligible.
• Youth charged with OUI are NOT eligible for the program. These cases must be
docketed and go through the regular court process.
• The youth must acknowledge responsibility for his/her behavior in the offense. The youth
must successfully complete counseling and perform community service.
• The youth is informed that participation in the program is voluntary and that the case
may be brought forward in court at any time at the youth's request.

Standards for Compliance
Upon termination for non-compliance or voluntary withdrawal, the complaint will be issued
against the youth and the usual court process shall resume. The following conditions are in
violation of the client's contract with the Youthful Diversion Program and may result in
termination from the Program for non-compliance:
• Failure to attend educational groups and/or counseling.
• Failure to complete assigned community service projects.
• Commission of a subsequent offense.
Successful Program Completion
When a youth successfully completes the requirements of the Youthful Diversion Program, the
case will be closed and not prosecuted.

The Drug Diversion Program
Established in 2006, the Essex District Attorney's Drug Diversion Program is
designed for non-violent offenders with substance use disorder. This program
seeks to address substance use and improve public safety by offering evaluation,
treatment, and intensive case management. This program is currently operating
in all Essex County District Courts
The program provides eligible candidates the opportunity to receive
comprehensive substance abuse treatment services in lieu of being prosecuted
through the traditional court process.
Bridgewell clinicians conduct all evaluations develop and manage individualized
treatment plans. Treatment options include a range of inpatient and outpatient
services, and support designed to help participants maintain sobriety. No one is
denied services based on an inability to pay. When available, a participant's
insurance will be billed.
Offenders identified by the District Attorney's Office as eligible to enter the Essex
County Drug Diversion Program will:
• Obtain a clinical evaluation followed by immediate access to treatment.
• Receive intensive treatment planning and treatment options, based on the
clinical evaluation.
• Be subject to strong case management and follow up.
Compliance is recognized as consistent and confirmed participation in
appropriate treatment modalities, weekly case management with a Diversion
Clinical Case Manager, and the consistent maintenance of sobriety from all illicit,
non-prescribed substances and alcohol. If a participant fails to adhere to their
treatment plan, they will be prosecuted. However, in the event of a relapse, the
participant is offered an amended treatment plan that provides needed support to
allow them to continue in recovery.

Essex District Attorney's Drug Diversion Program
The Philosophy of Diversion
The Essex District Attorney's Drug Diversion Program is a pre-arraignment and post-
arraignment program for non-violent offenders with substance use disorders. The
program provides eligible offenders the opportunity to receive comprehensive
substance abuse treatment services in lieu of being prosecuted through the traditional
court process. Cases involving possession of drugs may be eligible; however, offenders
charged with possession with intent to distribute, distribution of controlled substances,
or drug trafficking will be prosecuted and are not eligible for the program.
The clinical evaluations and treatment plans are administered by Bridgewell. Treatment
includes appropriate inpatient and outpatient services, and support designed to help
maintain sobriety.
Offenders identified by the District Attorney's Office as eligible to enter the Essex
District Attorney's Drug Diversion Program will:
• Obtain a thorough clinical evaluation.
• Receive intensive treatment planning and treatment options.
• Be subject to strong case management, including drug screening when
applicable.
Compliance is recognized as consistent and confirmed participation in appropriate
treatment modalities, weekly case management with a Diversion Clinical Case
Manager, and the consistent maintenance of sobriety from all illicit, non-prescribed
substances and alcohol. If a participant fails to adhere to their treatment plan, they will
be prosecuted. However, in the event of a relapse, the participant is offered an
amended treatment plan that provides needed support to allow them to continue in
recovery.
Role of the Clinical Intake and Assessment Coordinator
The Clinical Intake and Assessment Coordinators conduct intakes at the district courts
throughout Essex County for clients referred by the District Attorney's Office. The
Clinical Intake Coordinator is responsible for assessing and implementing the
immediate safety needs of newly referred clients, including the coordination and referral
to a medical detox, emergency psychiatric evaluation, an intensive outpatient program,
or residential program. Other services may include addressing homelessness, an
unsafe home life, and/or any other concerns impacting immediate safety needs.
Following the initial intake, the case is assigned to a Clinical Case Manager.
Initial Intake to Case Management
The Clinical Case Manager will contact the client the same day and support the client in
their treatment program. An initial case management session will be scheduled within a

week of the clinical intake. A client's ongoing treatment plan is developed and
implemented by the Clinical Case Manager; however, a client's input is also part of the
process to determine what could be most beneficial to their recovery. Relapse is not
always a basis for returning a client to court for prosecution and a treatment plan may
be amended at any time based on an enhanced level of care needed. All treatment
plans are based on the needs of the individual.
Role of the Clinical Case Manager
The Clinical Case Manager provides weekly clinical case management for clients
referred by the District Attorney's Office. The Clinical Case Manager is responsible for
implementing individualized treatment plans based on a client's addiction and mental
health needs. They also are responsible for coordinating and securing treatment
modality appointments for the client. Based on a client's needs, this may also include
enrolling for MassHealth, identifying a Primary Care Physician, securing services
through the Department of Transitional Assistance, accessing job placement services,
and other supportive services that could contribute to stability.
The Clinical Case Manager will provide support and supervision for participants, and will
act as the liaison among the client, treatment providers, and the District Attorney's
Office. Treatment plans may be amended and enhanced at any time based on a shift in
the client's needs. If a client struggles to follow their treatment plan, they may be
allowed to remain in the program if they are willing to recommit to their recovery and
sobriety. The Clinical Case Manager will work to secure appropriate services so that a
client will meet treatment goals and, when appropriate, will work with a client's family to
better understand the disease of addiction, and support the client in a therapeutic way.
Client Need
The needs of all clients are complex and unique. Therefore, success cannot be
measured in the same manner for all. For some, maintaining sobriety even for one day
is a success. The needs of opiate dependent clients are often the most complex.
Many of the heroin dependent clients face similar challenges in confronting their
addiction.
These challenges include:
The chronicity of their disease. Many clients have been heroin dependent for
over a year. Some may have been sporadically involved in treatment and some
clients may have received no treatment at all. As a result, these clients must
become educated about the disease of addiction and must accept that it can
successfully be managed long-term.
• The illegal behaviors that brought the clients to the attention of the court system.
In many cases, these illegal offenses are acts of desperation to support their
addiction.
The Essex District Attorney's Drug Diversion Program seeks to support all clients to
achieve their goals of recovery and sobriety. Completing Diversion requires participation

in a continuum of treatment interventions and case management for a period of at least
six months consistent with these program goals.
Clinical Interventions
Research shows that with appropriate clinical interventions and treatment, recovery is
possible. The comprehensive interventions utilized may include:
• Intensive outpatient (I0P) day programming
• Professionally facilitated groups including Early Recovery and Relapse
Prevention
• Opiate replacement therapy
• Individual therapy to address addiction and/or mental health needs
• Psychiatric evaluations
• Long and short-term residential treatment
• Detoxification and maintenance
• Self-Help: Narcotics and Alcoholics Anonymous meetings/identifying a sponsor
• Vocational and rehabilitation services
• AIDS/HIV testing and support
The longer .a client is involved in ongoing treatment, the greater the chance of that client
being able to maintain long-term sobriety and recovery.
After-care
Clients are provided with a continuum of care. When a Diversion client completes the
program, they can expect to have their housing, employment, and educational needs
addressed with a concrete plan of continued addiction and mental health treatment. The
Clinical Case Manager will make recommendations and referrals to meet a client's
anticipated needs for the six months following Diversion. Bridgewell is always available
to former clients should they need additional support after leaving the program.

Overview of Participating Agencies and Schools
M.G.L. Ch.12, §32 mandates that District Attorney's Offices establish, implement and
coordinate a partnership of schools, police and state agencies to address violence
prevention and school violence. This initiative in Essex County is called the Community
Collaborative Initiative (CCI). The following agencies participate in these meetings by
sharing information to provide better services for youth. The goal of these meetings is
for all agencies, schools and police to build stronger communities by fostering better
communication and relationships. Agency representation, and the information shared,
varies depending on the needs of the CCI participants and the community.
The District Attorney's Office
Juvenile Justice Coordinators facilitate the CCI meetings on behalf of the District
Attorney's Office. The Juvenile Justice Coordinators provide information regarding
ongoing priority prosecution cases and diversion cases involving school-based
incidents. Coordinators provide an overview of the court system and help plan
prevention efforts.
Essex County Juvenile Probation
Many youth discussed at CCI meetings are involved in the Juvenile Court system either
through CRA applications or delinquency cases. A juvenile probation officer attends the
CCI meetings on behalf of the Juvenile Court system. Often, the representative
attending the meeting is assigned to that community and is familiar with the youth
population and their families. In addition, probation officers provide information for
interventions or about available resources in the community.
Department of Children and Families
A supervisor or caseworker represents the Department of Children and Families (DCF)
at the CCI meeting. The DCF representative records information or inquiries about
specific cases, forwards that information to the proper caseworker, and then provides
follow-up information at the next CCI meeting. The representative also informs CCI
participants about available resources and intervention information in addition to
instructing on when and how to file 51A Reports, the investigation process, and possible
outcomes.
Department of Youth Services
The Department of Youth Services (DYS) sends a representative to CCI meetings in the
communities where youth have been committed to their custody. While the DYS
representative typically communicates with the school department on a regular basis, it
is important that they attend the CCI to share information with the other agencies in an
effort to provide better services to families of committed youth. Oftentimes, a family may
be involved with DCF or DMH, there may be younger siblings in surrounding school
systems, or the police may have community concerns related to a committed youth.

Department of Mental Health
Representatives from the Department of Mental Health (DMH) are invited to attend CCI
meetings. If a name is raised with mental health concerns, the representative will
explain the voluntary application process and eligibility criteria.
Police
The police representative attending CCI meetings may be a juvenile officer, a school
resource officer, a truancy officer, or a court liaison. The police representative is able to
provide information regarding community concerns such as group related activities,
crime trends among youth, and safety issues. The police serve in a reactive capacity
when concerns may arise that lead to a criminal investigation.
Schools
School representation at CCI meetings varies depending on the needs of the
community. Representatives usually consist of elementary, middle and high school
administrators, and sometimes guidance counselors. The majority of names raised at
the meetings are by school representatives. Concerns range from truancy issues,
possible criminal conduct, substance abuse, family issues, and behavioral matters.
Depending on the issue, other participants are able to then provide feedback on a
course of action, whether there is an ongoing matter with the youth, or whether any of
the agencies present have any involvement with the youth or family.

Summer Day Program
For over thirty years, the Essex District Attorney's Office, in conjunction with several
local police departments, has participated in a summer program for in-coming fifth grade
students. The twelve (12) participating police departments and the District Attorney
have provided staff and support for the program.
The purpose of the Essex County Summer Day Program is to allow youth, police and
peer leaders the opportunity to spend a week together engaging in anti-drug and
violence prevention lessons, educational workshops and team-building activities.
This year, over 400 students participated in the camp held at Higgins Middle School in
Peabody. The two (2) one-week sessions were July 22nd — July 26th and July 29th —
August 2nd.
The workshops provide education regarding decision-making and goal setting. Activities
consist of field trips and presentations that focus on appropriate alternatives to drugs
and violence. Highlights include a K-9 demonstration, a fire safety presentation by the
Peabody Fire Department, and a laser show addressing bullying and the importance of
teamwork. We, again, offered two (2) educational programs addressing increased
concerns over mental health and anti-semetic and racist ideologies. Changing Minds:
Stories Over Stigma was presented by the non-profit mental health foundation, Minding
your Mind to further enhance mental health education. Additionally, the Anti-
Defamation League and Melrose High School Peer Leaders worked to engage campers
in inclusivity exercises which aim to strive for a more just society.
The importance of the camp is paramount; not only do youth learn important life skills,
but they also develop positive relationships with police officers from their community
and engage with high school mentors.
Participating police departments include Beverly, Danvers, Georgetown, Gloucester,
Ipswich, Lynn, Lynnfield, Marblehead, Peabody, Salem, Saugus, and Swampscott.

the Criminal-Legal System
This two-day transformative workshop engages participants using small group work,
mini-lectures, video presentations, readings, and other activities to provide an
experience-based introduction to restorative justice in criminal-legal involved settings.
Designed to be highly interactive, the workshop explores topics such as concepts of

THE
RESOLUTION
CENTER
Finding common ground
through mediation
The Resolution Center (TRC) is a non-profit organization that has been providing conflict resolution and
training services locally since 1994. The Essex County District Attorney's Office, in partnership with TRC,
is offering people who are involved in the Diversion Program an option to participate in a Restorative
Justice Session. Restorative Justice is a philosophy and a theory of justice that emphasizes bringing
together everyone affected by an incident to address everyone's needs and responsibilities, provide
accountability, and heal the impact of the incident on all involved.
What is a Restorative Justice Session?
Restorative Justice Sessions are led by trained, neutral facilitators who create a safe, confidential space
for participants to discuss the effects of a young person's action and opportunities for repair. These
sessions allow people to speak face-to-face about the impact of an incident in their community. The goal
of these sessions is not to blame or shame anyone. The purpose is to offer an opportunity for the
responsible person to take accountability while providing a high level of support to everyone who has
been impacted. These sessions center around impact and moving forward by identifying: the needs and
responsibilities of all impacted, discussing accountability, and what is needed to repair the impact and
heal from the incident. All individuals have a role in repairing the impact and working toward positive
outcomes.
Referral Process
Restorative sessions are voluntary for all participants. Cases that the DA's Office determines are
appropriate for Restorative Justice Sessions will be sent to TRC for "intake" conversations. We conduct
intake calls with the impacted person/people to hear about the situation, and separately with the young
person who is responsible for the impact. In these calls we describe the process and answer any
questions, as well as identify any support people that those most directly involved would like to bring to
the session so that they can also participate in intake calls and be included in the session.
Location: Restorative Sessions will happen at Essex County DA's office at 51 Federal Street, 5th floor,
Salem, MA at a date/time that works for everyone involved.
Contact Information: P lease contact Anya McDavitt at The Resolution Center for scheduling and/or any
questions you may have regarding participation in a Restorative Justice Session. She can be reached at
