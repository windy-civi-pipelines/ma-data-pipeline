INTAKE UNIT
The DPPC Intake Unit receives reports of abuse against persons with a disability via a 24-Hour Hotline at
1-800-426-9009 or MassRelay (711) for Deaf and Hard of Hearing callers. During this quarter, the DPPC
received 4,068 reports of abuse resulting in 3,873 intakes. Multiple reports on the same incident are
combined into one intake. In addition, DPPC staff received 381 death reports, 574 information and referral
requests and 7 retaliation complaints. There were 0 allegations of abuse found to have been falsely
reported as a result of intentional and malicious action.

Every intake is reviewed pursuant to the DPPC screening criteria. A determination is made regarding
whether the intake is an emergency or non-emergency, and then, whether the situation meets the agency’s
jurisdictional criteria. During this quarter, 790 of the intakes screened by the DPPC 24-Hour Hotline were
assigned for a DPPC 19C investigation. Also during this quarter, the 3,083 intakes not within the
jurisdiction of the Commission were forwarded to the appropriate state agency for review and action as
necessary.
INVESTIGATION UNIT
Reports of alleged abuse determined to be within the jurisdiction of the DPPC are immediately assigned to
an Adult Protective Services (APS) Investigator and a DPPC Oversight Officer. The APS Investigator may
be one of DPPC’s Investigators or an Investigator from the Department of Developmental Services (DDS),
Department of Mental Health (DMH) or MassAbility. The DPPC Investigation Unit and the Investigation
Units of DDS, DMH and MassAbility conduct abuse investigations under the authority of DPPC’s statute,
M.G.L. c. 19C. The primary focus of all APS investigations is the protection of vulnerable individuals.
Investigators also look for systemic issues that may contribute or lead to abuse.

The DPPC Oversight Unit is responsible for monitoring all 19C investigations. Every case, whether
investigated by DPPC, DDS, DMH or MassAbility, is monitored by one of DPPC's Oversight Officers to
ensure that the victim is safe, the report is timely and the investigation is thorough. In cases where abuse
by a caregiver has been substantiated, protective services are provided by the respective service-providing
agency, DDS, DMH or MassAbility. To confirm that necessary protective services are implemented, the
DPPC Oversight Officers monitor cases until risk of harm to the victim is adequately reduced or eliminated.
In July of 2017, a Sexual Assault Response (SAR) team was created at the DPPC to increase access to
trauma informed support services for persons with a disability thanks to the Massachusetts Office for
Victim Assistance (MOVA) through the Office for Victims of Crime, Office of Justice Programs, U.S.
Department of Justice Victims of Crime Act of 1984 (VOCA) funding. SAR provides navigation, peer
support and clinical matching services to sexual assault victims with disabilities. SAR works with individuals
with disabilities, families and support teams by providing information, resources, referrals and supports.
The goal of SAR is to increase access to trauma services for persons with disabilities to aid in their recovery
of sexual abuse.
In addition to navigation, peer support and clinical matching, SAR also benefits from a robust and active
volunteer Advisory Council. The volunteer Advisory Council’s role is to advise the DPPC in its ongoing
development of SAR. The Advisory Council members share their professional/experiential wisdom to guide
and enhance SAR operations. Advisory Council members also serve as ambassadors for SAR within the
members’ own spheres of influence by taking action within their own organizations to prevent and
effectively respond to sexual violence against persons with a disability. Further, the Advisory Council
members are called upon for assistance with introductions to stakeholders in the fields of disability
services and advocacy, sexual violence, law, mental health, criminal justice, law enforcement, medical
health, education, research and employment. DPPC and SAR have benefited greatly from the collective
experience offered by the individual members of the volunteer Advisory Council.

STATE POLICE DETECTIVE UNIT
The MA State Police Detective Unit (SPDU), assigned to the DPPC, reviews 100% of the Intakes received
by the DPPC to determine which of these complaints suggest criminal activity against a person with a
disability. Within this quarter the SPDU reviewed 3,873 allegations of abuse. Of the 3,873 intakes
reviewed and screened by the SPDU, 219 were referred to the District Attorney for possible criminal
investigation.

LEARNING AND DEVELOPMENT UNIT
Everyone at DPPC shares in the responsibility for preventing abuse. DPPC continually strives to identify
new and effective ways to educate direct care staff, law enforcement, others working with persons with
disabilities, and the public about the prevalence of abuse of persons with a disability. The DPPC’s abuse
prevention strategy is to decrease incidents of abuse by increasing awareness about how widespread the
problem of abuse/neglect against persons with a disability is; and to educate people regarding the important
role they can perform in preventing or stopping this abuse.
To educate others, the DPPC Learning and Development Unit distributes informational materials and
conducts training on an ongoing basis. Training is provided to a broad range of individuals including law
enforcement, educators, medical professionals, service providers and persons with a disability. Topics
include recognizing and reporting abuse, preservation of evidence, the DPPC investigation process,
communicating with individuals from varied backgrounds or with differing communication needs as well as
regulatory and statutory compliance.
Some of DPPC’s ongoing activities include:
• Curricula development and training designed to educate Adult Protective Services (APS) and others;
• Consulting with agencies interested in developing abuse prevention programs; and
• Collaborating with agencies to develop presentations, programs and services related to abuse prevention
and improving the quality of life of persons with disabilities.

Massachusetts Agencies Partner
to Support Crime Victims With Disabilities
Building Partnerships for the Protection of Persons with Disabilities (BPI) is a statewide Massachusetts initiative
that, using a multidisciplinary approach, links law enforcement, adult protection, human services and others to
address violence committed against persons with a disability. The partnership was formed in 1999 to
effectively address abuse, neglect and crimes committed against persons with a disability. In addition, the
partnership was created to respond to the fact that crimes committed against persons with a disability in the
Commonwealth were not being recognized or reported to the appropriate authorities. Having started as a
federally funded Byrne grant program, BPI is currently funded through an award to the Hampden District
Attorney’s Office from the Department of Developmental Services (DDS). A BPI steering committee, co-
chaired by retired Northwestern District Attorney Elizabeth D. Scheibel and Disabled Persons Protection
Commission (DPPC) Executive Director Nancy A. Alterio, oversees the initiative’s legislative and training
activities. Through the efforts of the steering committee, thousands of persons with a disability, local and
state police, adult protective service investigators, victim witness advocates, assistant district attorneys and
human service providers have been trained to effectively recognize, report, investigate abuse and neglect, and
prosecute crimes committed against persons with a disability.
The partnership initiative brings together, through formal Memorandums of Understanding (MOU), the
District Attorney, DPPC, human service organizations and law enforcement agencies in each county. The
goals of the initiative are to provide protection, treatment and continuity of care for persons with a disability
who are victims of a crime; to increase awareness of crimes being committed against persons with a disability;
to increase communication and cooperation between law enforcement and agencies providing services to
persons with a disability; and to ensure that crimes committed against persons with a disability are promptly
reported, investigated by trained law enforcement personnel and prosecuted by the District Attorneys.
In FY2024, 1,103 cases were investigated criminally. Of those 1,103 criminal cases, 432 were crimes of a
sexual nature. The following graph depicts the increase in intakes referred to the District Attorneys for
criminal investigation for FY1997 through FY2024.
