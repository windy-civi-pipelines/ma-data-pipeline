OFFICE OF THE STATE AUDITOR
MEDICAID AUDIT UNIT
March 2, 2024 through February 28, 2025
Introduction
The Office of the State Auditor (OSA) receives an annual appropriation for the operation of a Medicaid
Audit Unit (the Unit) for the purposes of preventing and identifying fraud, waste, and abuse in the
MassHealth system and making recommendations for improved operations. The state’s fiscal year 2025
budget (Chapter 140 of the Acts of 2024) requires that OSA submit a report to the House and Senate
Committees on Ways and Means by no later than February 28, 2025 that includes (1) “all findings on
activities and payments made through the MassHealth system;” (2) “to the extent available, a review of
all post-audit efforts undertaken by MassHealth to recoup payments owed to the commonwealth due to
identified fraud and abuse;” (3) “the responses of MassHealth to the most recent post-audit review
survey, including the status of recoupment efforts;” and (4) “the unit’s recommendations to enhance
recoupment efforts.”
For fiscal year 2025, the appropriation for the Unit was $1,440,504. This amount represents an
approximately 2.9% increase over the Unit’s fiscal year 2024 appropriation of $1,399,658. OSA submits
all costs (direct and indirect) associated with running the Unit to the Executive Office of Health and
Human Services (EOHHS) to be included in its quarterly filings with the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid
Services for federal cost sharing. In federal fiscal year 2024, OSA submitted a total of $1,622,790 to
EOHHS for consideration for the state’s program integrity, allowing the state to obtain a 50%, or
$811,395, reimbursement of these costs.
This report, which is being submitted by OSA in accordance with Chapter 140 of the Acts of 2024,
provides a summary of the following performance audits of MassHealth: (1) a review of capitation
payments made to members with multiple Medicaid identification numbers (IDs), (2) a review of
telehealth adult day health (ADH), and (3) a review of telehealth adult foster care (AFC) and group adult
foster care (GAFC). This report also details an estimated $27,259,164 of potential cost savings we
identified in the MassHealth program.
1
Background
EOHHS administers the state’s Medicaid program, known as MassHealth. This program provides access
to healthcare services annually to approximately two million eligible children, families, seniors, and
people with disabilities, all with low and moderate incomes. In fiscal year 2024, MassHealth program
expenditures totaled $20.1 billion, of which approximately 39% was paid by the Commonwealth.
Medicaid program expenditures represent approximately 33% of the Commonwealth’s total annual
budget.
Heightened concerns over the integrity of Medicaid expenditures were raised in January 2003, when the
US Government Accountability Office (GAO) placed the US Medicaid program on its list of government
programs that are at “high risk” of fraud, waste, abuse, and mismanagement. At that time, GAO
estimated that between 3% and 10% of total healthcare costs were lost to fraudulent or abusive
practices by unscrupulous healthcare providers. Based on these concerns, OSA began conducting audits
of Medicaid-funded programs and, as part of its fiscal year 2007 budget proposal, submitted a request
to establish a Medicaid Audit Unit within its Division of Audit Operations. This unit would be dedicated
to detecting fraud, waste, and abuse in the MassHealth program. With the support of the Massachusetts
Legislature and the Governor, this proposal was approved and has continued to be funded in
subsequent budgets. Since that time, OSA has maintained ongoing independent oversight of the
MassHealth program and its contracted service providers. Since 2007, audit reports issued by OSA have
identified ways MassHealth can strengthen its controls to prevent and detect fraud, waste, abuse, and
mismanagement in the Massachusetts Medicaid program, as well as improper claims for Medicaid
services.
OSA uses data analytics in all audits conducted by the Unit. By doing so, our auditors can identify areas of
high risk, isolate outlier providers, and in many cases perform reviews of 100% of the claims under audit,
thus significantly improving the integrity, efficiency, and effectiveness of our audits. Moreover, in many
cases, data analytics has enabled the Unit to fully quantify the financial effects of improper payments,
whether they involve 1 claim or 10 million claims. The use of data analytics techniques has enabled the
Unit to (1) identify greater cost recoveries and savings; (2) isolate weaknesses in claim-processing systems;
and (3) make recommendations regarding MassHealth’s system and program regulations to promote
future cost savings, improve service delivery, and make government work better.

COMPLETED AUDITS
(MARCH 2, 2024 THROUGH FEBRUARY 28, 2025)
During this reporting period, the Office of the State Auditor (OSA) released three audit reports on
MassHealth’s compliance with state and federal laws, regulations, and other applicable authoritative
guidance. These reports identified an estimated $27,259,164 in potential cost savings and provided
several recommendations to strengthen internal controls and oversight in MassHealth’s program
administration. The following is a summary of our Medicaid audit work between March 2024 and the
end of February 2025.

Section 2:
1. Office of Medicaid (MassHealth)—Review of Capitation Payments1 with
Multiple Identification Numbers
Audit Number 2024-1374-3M1
Audit Period January 1, 2019–December 31, 2022
Issue Date December 31, 2024
Number of Findings 1
Number of Recommendations 3
Total Improper Billings $3,813,827 (estimated)
MassHealth Recouping Payments N/A
Background and Reason for Audit
The purpose of this audit was to determine whether MassHealth ensured that it did not make capitation
payments to managed care organizations (MCOs) on behalf of members who were assigned more than
one member ID. OSA conducted the audit as part of our ongoing independent statutory oversight of the
state’s Medicaid program.
Summary of Findings and Recommendations
OSA reported one finding in this audit:

Section 3:
1. MassHealth made capitation payments on behalf of members with multiple IDs.

Section 4:
1. Capitation payments are set payments to a managed care organization from MassHealth to provide healthcare for its
members. These payments are paid monthly for each MassHealth member enrolled in the managed care organization.
3
OSA’s recommendations to MassHealth were as follows:

Section 5:
1. MassHealth should require that all members flagged by data matches submit documentation to
confirm their identity. If the member does not provide documentation, then MassHealth should
either pause the member’s coverage or move the member to its fee-for-service model until it can
determine whether the member’s coverage should be terminated.

Section 6:
2. MassHealth should investigate and resolve all instances where its data matches indicate that a
member has been assigned more than one member ID.

Section 7:
3. MassHealth should implement a match criterion that focuses solely on Social Security Numbers
(SSNs). Because an SSN should be unique to each individual, a targeted match criterion that only
includes an SSN would reduce the prevalence of multiple IDs by 19%, based on our sample testing.
EOHHS’s Comments
Specifically regarding the three issues noted in the finding, MassHealth responded with the following:
Member IDs linked in [the Medicaid Management Information System (MMIS)]: The
majority of identified overpayments ($622,885 out of $672,946) result from capitation payments
made for 67 cases where [member IDs (MIDs)] were linked by MassHealth after the
implementation of our enhanced [master data management (MDM)] identification process.
MassHealth has reviewed and addressed or is in the process of addressing these resulting
overpayments. MassHealth’s use of MDM reports to identify and investigate potential cases of
multiple MIDs in 2022 resulted in a significant number of cases being linked after the point in time
when resulting duplicate capitation payments from 2019, 2020, and 2021 would have been
recouped within MMIS. Overpayments made in 2019 and 2020 were not recoverable as MassHealth
does not pursue overpayments nor account for underpayments made to managed care entities
after the closure of its risk-sharing reconciliation process for that rate year. However, MassHealth
was able to recoup [Office of the State Auditor (OSA)]-identified 2021 overpayments associated
with linked members made to [accountable care organization] and MCO plans as part of its risk-
sharing reconciliation process for rate year 2021. Finally, MassHealth will pursue recoupment for a
small amount of 2022 capitation payments associated with three cases that were linked later in
2023 and 2024. Going forward, MassHealth’s timely identification and review of any multiple MID
cases will result in duplicate capitation payments to be collected within MMIS.
Member IDs not linked in MMIS but determined to be the same person: Based upon
MassHealth’s review of the OSA’s findings, 7 cases that remained unlinked were due to MIDs
being associated with an inactive benefit. MassHealth’s review of duplicate MIDs is limited to
cases where both MIDs are associated with active benefits that result in duplicate capitation
payments. For these cases, by the time the MDM enhancements were implemented in 2022, at
least one of the MIDs had an inactive benefit. MassHealth notes that these cases account for a
smaller overpayment amount of $31,918 over the course of the four-year audit period.
MassHealth unable to determine whether member IDs were for the same person:
MassHealth respectfully disagrees with the OSA characterization of the 26 cases under this
category. While MassHealth recognizes these cases as instances of multiple MIDs being associated
4
with the same individual, MassHealth is unable to link these cases due to privacy concerns. In
certain cases, particularly for children in the care and custody of the Department of Children and
Families (DCF), it has been MassHealth’s policy to not link certain MIDs. For example, in order to
prevent the biological parent from having access to the new family’s information, multiple IDs for
adopted children are not linked without prior authorization from DCF. MassHealth recognizes that
the policy not to link these members may result in duplicate capitation payments made to managed
care entities. MassHealth notes that these cases reflected the smallest share of identified
overpayments at $18,143. While this policy affects a relatively small number of cases and
associated capitation payments, MassHealth will explore new means of preventing and recouping
these duplicate payments without risking the privacy of the associated members.
Specific to our recommendations, MassHealth responded with the following:
Recommendation 1: MassHealth will investigate the feasibility of establishing a process to
request further documentation where MassHealth is unable to determine if two [member IDs
(MIDs)] are associated with the same individual. MassHealth notes that the majority of cases can
be determined via the information submitted through members’ applications and external data
sources. The cases where [the Office of the State Auditor (OSA)] determined the MIDs cannot be
confirmed as the same person instead reflect a policy decision to not link members where there is a
privacy concern as described above. MassHealth will explore an alternative course of action for this
small subset members to prevent and recoup duplicate capitation payments made in these
cases. . . .
Recommendation 2: MassHealth believes that it has established the system infrastructure as well
as policies and procedures to comprehensively identify and investigate potential MID duplicates. As
stated above, MassHealth’s MDM program both prevents the creation of multiple MIDs for the same
individual as well as produces routine reports that MassHealth uses to link members with more than
one MID. In addition, these routine reports allow MassHealth to investigate cases in a timely
manner that ensures any duplicate capitation payments are recouped. . . .
Recommendation 3: MassHealth disagrees with this recommendation. Because MassHealth may
receive inaccurate social security numbers due to typographical errors, preventing the creation of
an MID due to a matching social security number with no other matches across personal
information may result in delayed enrollment for members and impact their access to care.
However, in most cases, MassHealth’s existing controls prevent the creation of multiple MIDs for an
individual where the social security number matches. For those cases where multiple MIDs are
created, MDM’s regular reporting of potential duplicates allow MassHealth to link MIDs in time to
ensure any duplicate capitation payments are ultimately recouped and prevented going forward.

Section 8:
2. Office of Medicaid (MassHealth)—Review of Payment for Telehealth Adult
Day Health
Audit Number 2023-1374-3M1
Audit Period January 1, 2020–December 31, 2021
Issue Date October 1, 2024
Number of Findings 3
Number of Recommendations 7
Total Improper Billings $465,683
MassHealth Recouping Payments N/A
Background and Reason for Audit
The purpose of this audit was to determine whether MassHealth monitored telehealth practices for ADH
to ensure compliance with its regulations.
This audit was conducted as part of OSA’s ongoing independent statutory oversight of the state’s
Medicaid program. Several of our previously issued audit reports disclosed weaknesses in MassHealth’s
claim processing system and improper billing practices by MassHealth providers, which identified
millions of dollars in potentially improper payments. As with any government program, public
confidence is essential to the success of and continued support for public expenditures, such as the
state’s Medicaid program. Our audit is designed to identify issues that will help improve the Medicaid
program so that taxpayers know their dollars are spent prudently and that there is a system of
continuous improvement of efficiency and service over time.
Summary of Findings and Recommendations
OSA reported three findings in this audit:

Section 9:
1. MassHealth paid providers for ADH that it did not authorize and/or that did not have supporting
documentation.

Section 10:
2. MassHealth paid providers for transportation to ADH that it did not authorize and/or that did not
have supporting documentation.

Section 11:
3. MassHealth paid providers $11,797 for 109 claims for services allegedly rendered to 31 members
who were proven to be deceased.
6
OSA’s recommendations to MassHealth were as follows:

Section 12:
1. MassHealth should ensure that system edits to prevent payments for ADH without prior
authorization are properly implemented.

Section 13:
2. MassHealth should investigate the paid claims identified by OSA and take corrective action as it
deems appropriate. MassHealth should also investigate for improper documentation of ADH claims
from providers that OSA did not review.

Section 14:
3. MassHealth should ensure that system edits to prevent payments for ADH without prior
authorization are properly implemented.

Section 15:
4. MassHealth should investigate the paid claims identified by OSA and take corrective action as it
deems appropriate. MassHealth should also investigate ADH claims from providers outside the five
OSA reviewed for improper documentation.

Section 16:
5. MassHealth should establish monitoring controls to ensure that ADH claims are documented.

Section 17:
6. MassHealth should update its MMIS algorithms to cross-reference members’ dates of death with
additional data sources and not rely solely on the Department of Public Health’s Vital Statistics file
when verifying members’ dates of death.

Section 18:
7. MassHealth should establish a plan to recoup the $11,797 in overpayments made on behalf of
deceased members.
EOHHS’s Comments
Regarding Finding 1, MassHealth stated the following:
Regarding recommendation 1 . . . MassHealth delayed the planned activation of a system edit
related to prior authorization that—prior to the pandemic—had been set to be activated on April
15, 2020. MassHealth made the decision to delay activation of the edit to avoid further disruption
to the ADH program at a time when ADH providers had been forced to close and MassHealth was
intently focused on finding ways to retain the existence of ADH providers and ensure the
continued availability of ADH services. This decision was also premised on the understanding that
any claims for ADH services that were paid absent a [prior authorization (PA)] could be recovered
via post payment review, a process which has since occurred, and as noted in further detail
below. Ultimately MassHealth activated the PA edit on September 1, 2021, after the height of the
pandemic had receded. . . .
Regarding recommendation 2, MassHealth agrees with this recommendation. MassHealth will
review the OSA’s findings and recover any identified overpayments that are not already subject to
ongoing MassHealth provider audits and recoveries. Specifically, and as noted above, MassHealth
is finalizing a claim-based algorithm recovery for ADH services provided without a PA, which
encompass the OSA’s audit period and was previously in development as part of MassHealth’s
standard program integrity controls. Further, MassHealth will ensure that any findings from the
OSA not captured in the existing recovery project will be validated and pursued through
overpayment recoveries as appropriate.
7
MassHealth further requests, however, that in . . . the draft audit report, where it states
“$123,733 out of the $262,685 (47%) in undocumented ADH claims were for retainer payments
to ADH providers” that the auditor identify whether the identified retainer payment claims with no
documentation were for dates that occurred in a week with no other documentation of a member
contact, as it was permissible for ADH providers to claim multiple retainer payments in a given
month so long as they had at least one contact with the member during each week in that
month.
Regarding Finding 2, MassHealth stated the following:
Regarding recommendation [4], MassHealth agrees with this recommendation. MassHealth will
review the OSA’s findings and recover any identified overpayments that are not already subject to
ongoing MassHealth provider investigations and recoveries. Of note, MassHealth is currently
finalizing a claim-based algorithm recovery for ADH nonemergency transportation services
provided without a PA for ADH services, which encompass the OSA’s audit period and was
previously in development as part of MassHealth’s standard program integrity controls. Further,
MassHealth will ensure that any findings from the OSA not captured in the existing recovery
project will be validated and pursued through overpayment recoveries as appropriate.
Regarding recommendation [5], MassHealth agrees with this recommendation and is committed
to ensuring ADH providers’ compliance with documentation requirements. MassHealth works to
ensure ADH provider compliance via training conducted during provider meetings, as well as
robust program integrity controls. Such program integrity controls include a comprehensive set of
pre-pay edits, a prior authorization process that ensures services rendered are clinically
appropriate, postpayment claims recoveries, and regularly scheduled audits of providers.
Specifically, MassHealth regularly initiates 1 to 2 ADH provider audits per month which may result
in the issuance of corrective actions and overpayments for improper documentation. Since
January 1st, 2022, MassHealth has initiated 36 audits of ADH providers and has issued 20 initial
notices of overpayment which detail the agency’s overpayment and sanction findings.
Regarding Finding 3, MassHealth stated the following:
MassHealth agrees with these recommendations. MassHealth has robust program integrity
controls in place to prevent payments after a member’s date of death. However, due to issues
often beyond MassHealth’s control (e.g., inaccurate sources of death data and time lags in access
to death data), it is possible for such payments to occur. As a result, MassHealth also has robust
controls in place to identify and recover such claims post-payment.
Regarding recommendation [6], MassHealth has adjusted its program integrity processes to
improve the identification and recovery of inappropriately paid claims for dates of service after a
member’s date of death. Historically, it had been MassHealth’s process to use Department of
Public Health (DPH) Vital Statistics data to identify claims that were incorrectly paid for dates [of]
service after a member’s date of death; only members matching on the DPH Vital Statistics file
would be included in any findings. MassHealth must balance the risk of missing potential
overpayments with the risk of relying on less reliable sources of death data in pursuing
recoupments of potential overpayments. In light of the OSA’s recommendation, as of January
8
2024, MassHealth has updated its program integrity efforts to no longer exclude members from
post-death algorithms when members do not appear in the DPH Vital Statistics file.
Regarding recommendation [7], MassHealth agrees with this recommendation. MassHealth will
review the claims identified by the OSA and carry out the recovery process as appropriate.
MassHealth notes that 28 of the 109 claims have already been identified and included in initial
notices of overpayment issued to the associated providers. MassHealth will ensure that all
remaining overpayments identified are validated and recovered as appropriate.

Section 19:
3. Office of Medicaid (MassHealth)—Review of Payment for Telehealth Adult
Foster Care and Group Adult Foster Care
Audit Number 2023-1374-3M2
Audit Period January 1, 2020–December 31, 2021
Issue Date September 4, 2024
Number of Findings 3
Number of Recommendations 3
Total Improper Billings $22,979,654
MassHealth Recouping Payments N/A
Background and Reason for Audit
The purpose of this audit was to determine whether MassHealth monitored telehealth practices for AFC
and GAFC services to ensure compliance with its regulations.
The audit was conducted as part of OSA’s ongoing independent statutory oversight of the state’s
Medicaid program. Several of our previously issued audit reports disclosed weaknesses in MassHealth’s
claim processing system and improper billing practices by MassHealth providers, which identified
millions of dollars in potentially improper payments. As with any government program, public
confidence is essential to the success and continued support for public expenditures, such as the state’s
Medicaid program. Our audit is designed to identify issues that will help improve the Medicaid program
so that taxpayers know that their dollars are spent prudently and that there is a system of continuous
improvement to support improved efficiency and service over time.
Summary of Finding and Recommendation
OSA reported three findings in this audit:

Section 20:
1. MassHealth did not ensure that AFC and GAFC registered nurses / licensed practical nurses and care
managers conducted required oversight visits.
9

Section 21:
2. MassHealth paid AFC and GAFC providers for services that did not have supporting caregiver / direct
care aide log documentation.

Section 22:
3. MassHealth paid for AFC and GAFC caregiver / direct care aide services that were incorrectly coded
as telehealth.
OSA’s recommendations to MassHealth were as follows:

Section 23:
1. MassHealth should establish effective monitoring controls to ensure that AFC and GAFC providers
conduct the required oversight visits for MassHealth members and caregivers / direct care aides. To
establish effective monitoring controls, we believe MassHealth should establish a goal for the
number of AFC / GAFC providers it will audit each year. MassHealth should investigate and resolve all
instances where its data matches indicate that a member is enrolled in another state’s Medicaid
program.

Section 24:
2. MassHealth should establish an effective monitoring process to ensure that caregivers / direct care
aides of AFC and GAFC providers properly document care in their logs.

Section 25:
3. MassHealth should add a system control in the Medicaid Management Information System to deny
AFC and GAFC caregiver / direct care aide services in a telehealth setting.
EOHHS’s Comments
Regarding Finding 1, MassHealth stated the following:
MassHealth agrees with this recommendation. MassHealth is committed to ensuring AFC and
GAFC providers’ compliance with federal and state requirements through clear and frequent
outreach to the provider network via periodic trainings and provider meetings, as well as robust
program integrity controls. Such program integrity controls include a comprehensive set of pre-
pay edits, a prior authorization process that ensures services rendered are clinically appropriate,
post-payment claims recoveries, and regularly scheduled audits of providers.
Program integrity initiatives developed and implemented since the period covered under this
audit include instituting a temporary moratorium on new AFC providers from March 10, 2023,
through September 10, 2023. The purpose of the temporary moratorium was to allow MassHealth
to focus on enhanced training and education of existing AFC providers and the development of a
more robust onboarding process for new AFC providers. Following the end of the moratorium,
and in addition to instituting a more robust onboarding process, MassHealth schedules audits of
every new AFC and GAFC provider within six months of their enrollment.
Additionally, to monitor compliance, and as part of MassHealth’s overall program integrity
strategy, MassHealth initiates audits of 2 to 3 AFC and GAFC providers each month
(approximately 24-36 audits per year). As part of these audits, MassHealth auditors review
documentation submitted by providers to ensure [registered nurse / licensed practical nurse] and
care manager visits are documented and occur within the timeframes required by the provider
regulations. Where MassHealth identifies instances of non-compliance, MassHealth issues
overpayments and sanctions as appropriate.
10
From 2022 to present, MassHealth has initiated 92 audits of AFC and GAFC providers
(approximately 3 audits per month) and has issued 49 initial notices of overpayment and
sanction, which outline MassHealth’s audit findings and initiates the recovery process for
identified overpayments and sanctions.
Regarding Finding 2, MassHealth stated the following:
MassHealth agrees with this recommendation. As discussed above, MassHealth actively engages
in provider education and program integrity activities to promote and monitor AFC and GAFC
compliance with provider requirements. This includes the provision of provider education on
requirements to train caregivers and direct care aides on care log documentation requirements,
as well as provider audits to monitor compliance with program requirements, which includes
review of caregiver / direct care aide logs.
As noted in response to Finding 1, above, from 2022 to present, MassHealth has initiated 92
audits of AFC and GAFC providers (approximately 3 audits per month) and has issued 49 initial
notices of overpayment and sanction, which outline MassHealth’s audit findings and initiates the
recovery process for identified overpayments and sanctions.
Regarding Finding 3, MassHealth stated the following:
MassHealth agrees with this recommendation. MassHealth will implement a system edit to
prevent AFC and GAFC providers from submitting claims for AFC / GAFC services when coded as
telehealth.
As noted above, because personal care is a type of care that cannot be delivered via telehealth,
AFC and GAFC providers were not—and are not—permitted to use telehealth for the delivery of
personal care. MassHealth appreciates that the [Office of the State Auditor] draft report
acknowledges that the identified claims were billed as telehealth in error and that AFC / GAFC
services were in fact rendered in person and based on the auditor’s review of provider
documentation. MassHealth further notes this error appears to be concentrated to a small
percentage of providers within the network with only 5 out of 268 providers having billed claims
coded as telehealth. As noted above, MassHealth agrees with the recommendation and will
implement an edit to prevent the ability for AFC / GAFC claims to be submitted when coded as
telehealth.
11
CURRENT INITIATIVES
During this reporting period, the Office of the State Auditor (OSA) began or continued work on seven
audits of MassHealth’s administration of the Medicaid program and Medicaid service providers’
compliance with state and federal laws, regulations, and other authoritative guidance. These audits were
selected based on OSA’s research, and we are using data analytics to identify areas of risk in the state’s
Medicaid program. Based on preliminary analysis and previous audit results, we anticipate that these
audits will continue to identify improper payments and areas for improvement in MassHealth’s
administration of program services. Where applicable, the audits will include recommendations to
strengthen internal controls and oversight in MassHealth’s program administration. The following is a
summary of our Medicaid audit work in process.
• OSA is conducting a review of MassHealth claims submitted by providers for durable medical
equipment (DME) for the audit period July 1, 2021 through June 30, 2023. This audit will
determine whether DME was ordered or prescribed to members by providers who are excluded
from participating in the Medicaid program and whether MassHealth paid for DME prescribed to
members who are deceased.
• OSA is conducting a review of MassHealth claims submitted by Dental Arts for the period July 1,
2019 through June 30, 2023. This audit will determine whether dental services provided to
MassHealth members were properly supported by documentation and were allowable in
accordance with certain MassHealth regulations.
• OSA is conducting a review of MassHealth claims submitted for non-emergency transportation
for the period July 1, 2020 through June 30, 2023. This audit will determine whether
MassHealth’s non-emergency transportation broker process provides equal opportunity to
contracted providers throughout the Commonwealth, whether non-emergency transportation
claims were properly authorized, and whether transportation drivers and attendants
consistently had Criminal Offender Record Information checks.
• OSA is conducting a review of MassHealth reimbursements for inpatient maternity services
provided by University of Massachusetts Memorial Healthcare (UMMH) during the period July 1,
2020 through June 30, 2023. This audit will determine whether UMMH properly billed
MassHealth for maternity care for its members, whether UMMH reported births occurring in its
hospitals to the Department of Public Health, and whether UMMH properly used grant funds
from EOHHS and the Massachusetts Emergency Management Agency.

March 2, 2024 through February 28, 2025
Introduction
The Office of the State Auditor (OSA) receives an annual appropriation for the operation of a Medicaid
Audit Unit (the Unit) for the purposes of preventing and identifying fraud, waste, and abuse in the
MassHealth system and making recommendations for improved operations. The state’s fiscal year 2025
budget (Chapter 140 of the Acts of 2024) requires that OSA submit a report to the House and Senate
Committees on Ways and Means by no later than February 28, 2025 that includes (1) “all findings on
activities and payments made through the MassHealth system;” (2) “to the extent available, a review of
all post-audit efforts undertaken by MassHealth to recoup payments owed to the commonwealth due to
identified fraud and abuse;” (3) “the responses of MassHealth to the most recent post-audit review
survey, including the status of recoupment efforts;” and (4) “the unit’s recommendations to enhance
recoupment efforts.”
For fiscal year 2025, the appropriation for the Unit was $1,440,504. This amount represents an
approximately 2.9% increase over the Unit’s fiscal year 2024 appropriation of $1,399,658. OSA submits
all costs (direct and indirect) associated with running the Unit to the Executive Office of Health and
Human Services (EOHHS) to be included in its quarterly filings with the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid
Services for federal cost sharing. In federal fiscal year 2024, OSA submitted a total of $1,622,790 to
EOHHS for consideration for the state’s program integrity, allowing the state to obtain a 50%, or
$811,395, reimbursement of these costs.
This report, which is being submitted by OSA in accordance with Chapter 140 of the Acts of 2024,
provides a summary of the following performance audits of MassHealth: (1) a review of capitation
payments made to members with multiple Medicaid identification numbers (IDs), (2) a review of
telehealth adult day health (ADH), and (3) a review of telehealth adult foster care (AFC) and group adult
foster care (GAFC). This report also details an estimated $27,259,164 of potential cost savings we
identified in the MassHealth program.

Background
EOHHS administers the state’s Medicaid program, known as MassHealth. This program provides access
to healthcare services annually to approximately two million eligible children, families, seniors, and
people with disabilities, all with low and moderate incomes. In fiscal year 2024, MassHealth program
expenditures totaled $20.1 billion, of which approximately 39% was paid by the Commonwealth.
Medicaid program expenditures represent approximately 33% of the Commonwealth’s total annual
budget.
Heightened concerns over the integrity of Medicaid expenditures were raised in January 2003, when the
US Government Accountability Office (GAO) placed the US Medicaid program on its list of government
programs that are at “high risk” of fraud, waste, abuse, and mismanagement. At that time, GAO
estimated that between 3% and 10% of total healthcare costs were lost to fraudulent or abusive
practices by unscrupulous healthcare providers. Based on these concerns, OSA began conducting audits
of Medicaid-funded programs and, as part of its fiscal year 2007 budget proposal, submitted a request
to establish a Medicaid Audit Unit within its Division of Audit Operations. This unit would be dedicated
to detecting fraud, waste, and abuse in the MassHealth program. With the support of the Massachusetts
Legislature and the Governor, this proposal was approved and has continued to be funded in
subsequent budgets. Since that time, OSA has maintained ongoing independent oversight of the
MassHealth program and its contracted service providers. Since 2007, audit reports issued by OSA have
identified ways MassHealth can strengthen its controls to prevent and detect fraud, waste, abuse, and
mismanagement in the Massachusetts Medicaid program, as well as improper claims for Medicaid
services.
OSA uses data analytics in all audits conducted by the Unit. By doing so, our auditors can identify areas of
high risk, isolate outlier providers, and in many cases perform reviews of 100% of the claims under audit,
thus significantly improving the integrity, efficiency, and effectiveness of our audits. Moreover, in many
cases, data analytics has enabled the Unit to fully quantify the financial effects of improper payments,
whether they involve 1 claim or 10 million claims. The use of data analytics techniques has enabled the
Unit to (1) identify greater cost recoveries and savings; (2) isolate weaknesses in claim-processing systems;
and (3) make recommendations regarding MassHealth’s system and program regulations to promote
future cost savings, improve service delivery, and make government work better.

COMPLETED AUDITS
(MARCH 2, 2024 THROUGH FEBRUARY 28, 2025)
During this reporting period, the Office of the State Auditor (OSA) released three audit reports on
MassHealth’s compliance with state and federal laws, regulations, and other applicable authoritative
guidance. These reports identified an estimated $27,259,164 in potential cost savings and provided
several recommendations to strengthen internal controls and oversight in MassHealth’s program
administration. The following is a summary of our Medicaid audit work between March 2024 and the
end of February 2025.
1. Office of Medicaid (MassHealth)—Review of Capitation Payments1 with
Multiple Identification Numbers
Audit Number 2024-1374-3M1
Audit Period January 1, 2019–December 31, 2022
Issue Date December 31, 2024
Number of Findings 1
Number of Recommendations 3
Total Improper Billings $3,813,827 (estimated)
MassHealth Recouping Payments N/A
Background and Reason for Audit
The purpose of this audit was to determine whether MassHealth ensured that it did not make capitation
payments to managed care organizations (MCOs) on behalf of members who were assigned more than
one member ID. OSA conducted the audit as part of our ongoing independent statutory oversight of the
state’s Medicaid program.
Summary of Findings and Recommendations
OSA reported one finding in this audit:
1. MassHealth made capitation payments on behalf of members with multiple IDs.
1. Capitation payments are set payments to a managed care organization from MassHealth to provide healthcare for its
members. These payments are paid monthly for each MassHealth member enrolled in the managed care organization.
3

OSA’s recommendations to MassHealth were as follows:
1. MassHealth should require that all members flagged by data matches submit documentation to
confirm their identity. If the member does not provide documentation, then MassHealth should
either pause the member’s coverage or move the member to its fee-for-service model until it can
determine whether the member’s coverage should be terminated.
2. MassHealth should investigate and resolve all instances where its data matches indicate that a
member has been assigned more than one member ID.
3. MassHealth should implement a match criterion that focuses solely on Social Security Numbers
(SSNs). Because an SSN should be unique to each individual, a targeted match criterion that only
includes an SSN would reduce the prevalence of multiple IDs by 19%, based on our sample testing.
EOHHS’s Comments
Specifically regarding the three issues noted in the finding, MassHealth responded with the following:
Member IDs linked in [the Medicaid Management Information System (MMIS)]: The
majority of identified overpayments ($622,885 out of $672,946) result from capitation payments
made for 67 cases where [member IDs (MIDs)] were linked by MassHealth after the
implementation of our enhanced [master data management (MDM)] identification process.
MassHealth has reviewed and addressed or is in the process of addressing these resulting
overpayments. MassHealth’s use of MDM reports to identify and investigate potential cases of
multiple MIDs in 2022 resulted in a significant number of cases being linked after the point in time
when resulting duplicate capitation payments from 2019, 2020, and 2021 would have been
recouped within MMIS. Overpayments made in 2019 and 2020 were not recoverable as MassHealth
does not pursue overpayments nor account for underpayments made to managed care entities
after the closure of its risk-sharing reconciliation process for that rate year. However, MassHealth
was able to recoup [Office of the State Auditor (OSA)]-identified 2021 overpayments associated
with linked members made to [accountable care organization] and MCO plans as part of its risk-
sharing reconciliation process for rate year 2021. Finally, MassHealth will pursue recoupment for a
small amount of 2022 capitation payments associated with three cases that were linked later in
2023 and 2024. Going forward, MassHealth’s timely identification and review of any multiple MID
cases will result in duplicate capitation payments to be collected within MMIS.
Member IDs not linked in MMIS but determined to be the same person: Based upon
MassHealth’s review of the OSA’s findings, 7 cases that remained unlinked were due to MIDs
being associated with an inactive benefit. MassHealth’s review of duplicate MIDs is limited to
cases where both MIDs are associated with active benefits that result in duplicate capitation
payments. For these cases, by the time the MDM enhancements were implemented in 2022, at
least one of the MIDs had an inactive benefit. MassHealth notes that these cases account for a
smaller overpayment amount of $31,918 over the course of the four-year audit period.
MassHealth unable to determine whether member IDs were for the same person:
MassHealth respectfully disagrees with the OSA characterization of the 26 cases under this
category. While MassHealth recognizes these cases as instances of multiple MIDs being associated
4

with the same individual, MassHealth is unable to link these cases due to privacy concerns. In
certain cases, particularly for children in the care and custody of the Department of Children and
Families (DCF), it has been MassHealth’s policy to not link certain MIDs. For example, in order to
prevent the biological parent from having access to the new family’s information, multiple IDs for
adopted children are not linked without prior authorization from DCF. MassHealth recognizes that
the policy not to link these members may result in duplicate capitation payments made to managed
care entities. MassHealth notes that these cases reflected the smallest share of identified
overpayments at $18,143. While this policy affects a relatively small number of cases and
associated capitation payments, MassHealth will explore new means of preventing and recouping
these duplicate payments without risking the privacy of the associated members.
Specific to our recommendations, MassHealth responded with the following:
Recommendation 1: MassHealth will investigate the feasibility of establishing a process to
request further documentation where MassHealth is unable to determine if two [member IDs
(MIDs)] are associated with the same individual. MassHealth notes that the majority of cases can
be determined via the information submitted through members’ applications and external data
sources. The cases where [the Office of the State Auditor (OSA)] determined the MIDs cannot be
confirmed as the same person instead reflect a policy decision to not link members where there is a
privacy concern as described above. MassHealth will explore an alternative course of action for this
small subset members to prevent and recoup duplicate capitation payments made in these
cases. . . .
Recommendation 2: MassHealth believes that it has established the system infrastructure as well
as policies and procedures to comprehensively identify and investigate potential MID duplicates. As
stated above, MassHealth’s MDM program both prevents the creation of multiple MIDs for the same
individual as well as produces routine reports that MassHealth uses to link members with more than
one MID. In addition, these routine reports allow MassHealth to investigate cases in a timely
manner that ensures any duplicate capitation payments are recouped. . . .
Recommendation 3: MassHealth disagrees with this recommendation. Because MassHealth may
receive inaccurate social security numbers due to typographical errors, preventing the creation of
an MID due to a matching social security number with no other matches across personal
information may result in delayed enrollment for members and impact their access to care.
However, in most cases, MassHealth’s existing controls prevent the creation of multiple MIDs for an
individual where the social security number matches. For those cases where multiple MIDs are
created, MDM’s regular reporting of potential duplicates allow MassHealth to link MIDs in time to
ensure any duplicate capitation payments are ultimately recouped and prevented going forward.

2. Office of Medicaid (MassHealth)—Review of Payment for Telehealth Adult
Day Health
Audit Number 2023-1374-3M1
Audit Period January 1, 2020–December 31, 2021
Issue Date October 1, 2024
Number of Findings 3
Number of Recommendations 7
Total Improper Billings $465,683
MassHealth Recouping Payments N/A
Background and Reason for Audit
The purpose of this audit was to determine whether MassHealth monitored telehealth practices for ADH
to ensure compliance with its regulations.
This audit was conducted as part of OSA’s ongoing independent statutory oversight of the state’s
Medicaid program. Several of our previously issued audit reports disclosed weaknesses in MassHealth’s
claim processing system and improper billing practices by MassHealth providers, which identified
millions of dollars in potentially improper payments. As with any government program, public
confidence is essential to the success of and continued support for public expenditures, such as the
state’s Medicaid program. Our audit is designed to identify issues that will help improve the Medicaid
program so that taxpayers know their dollars are spent prudently and that there is a system of
continuous improvement of efficiency and service over time.
Summary of Findings and Recommendations
OSA reported three findings in this audit:
1. MassHealth paid providers for ADH that it did not authorize and/or that did not have supporting
documentation.
2. MassHealth paid providers for transportation to ADH that it did not authorize and/or that did not
have supporting documentation.
3. MassHealth paid providers $11,797 for 109 claims for services allegedly rendered to 31 members
who were proven to be deceased.
6

OSA’s recommendations to MassHealth were as follows:
1. MassHealth should ensure that system edits to prevent payments for ADH without prior
authorization are properly implemented.
2. MassHealth should investigate the paid claims identified by OSA and take corrective action as it
deems appropriate. MassHealth should also investigate for improper documentation of ADH claims
from providers that OSA did not review.
3. MassHealth should ensure that system edits to prevent payments for ADH without prior
authorization are properly implemented.
4. MassHealth should investigate the paid claims identified by OSA and take corrective action as it
deems appropriate. MassHealth should also investigate ADH claims from providers outside the five
OSA reviewed for improper documentation.
5. MassHealth should establish monitoring controls to ensure that ADH claims are documented.
6. MassHealth should update its MMIS algorithms to cross-reference members’ dates of death with
additional data sources and not rely solely on the Department of Public Health’s Vital Statistics file
when verifying members’ dates of death.
7. MassHealth should establish a plan to recoup the $11,797 in overpayments made on behalf of
deceased members.
EOHHS’s Comments
Regarding Finding 1, MassHealth stated the following:
Regarding recommendation 1 . . . MassHealth delayed the planned activation of a system edit
related to prior authorization that—prior to the pandemic—had been set to be activated on April
15, 2020. MassHealth made the decision to delay activation of the edit to avoid further disruption
to the ADH program at a time when ADH providers had been forced to close and MassHealth was
intently focused on finding ways to retain the existence of ADH providers and ensure the
continued availability of ADH services. This decision was also premised on the understanding that
any claims for ADH services that were paid absent a [prior authorization (PA)] could be recovered
via post payment review, a process which has since occurred, and as noted in further detail
below. Ultimately MassHealth activated the PA edit on September 1, 2021, after the height of the
pandemic had receded. . . .
Regarding recommendation 2, MassHealth agrees with this recommendation. MassHealth will
review the OSA’s findings and recover any identified overpayments that are not already subject to
ongoing MassHealth provider audits and recoveries. Specifically, and as noted above, MassHealth
is finalizing a claim-based algorithm recovery for ADH services provided without a PA, which
encompass the OSA’s audit period and was previously in development as part of MassHealth’s
standard program integrity controls. Further, MassHealth will ensure that any findings from the
OSA not captured in the existing recovery project will be validated and pursued through
overpayment recoveries as appropriate.
7

MassHealth further requests, however, that in . . . the draft audit report, where it states
“$123,733 out of the $262,685 (47%) in undocumented ADH claims were for retainer payments
to ADH providers” that the auditor identify whether the identified retainer payment claims with no
documentation were for dates that occurred in a week with no other documentation of a member
contact, as it was permissible for ADH providers to claim multiple retainer payments in a given
month so long as they had at least one contact with the member during each week in that
month.
Regarding Finding 2, MassHealth stated the following:
Regarding recommendation [4], MassHealth agrees with this recommendation. MassHealth will
review the OSA’s findings and recover any identified overpayments that are not already subject to
ongoing MassHealth provider investigations and recoveries. Of note, MassHealth is currently
finalizing a claim-based algorithm recovery for ADH nonemergency transportation services
provided without a PA for ADH services, which encompass the OSA’s audit period and was
previously in development as part of MassHealth’s standard program integrity controls. Further,
MassHealth will ensure that any findings from the OSA not captured in the existing recovery
project will be validated and pursued through overpayment recoveries as appropriate.
Regarding recommendation [5], MassHealth agrees with this recommendation and is committed
to ensuring ADH providers’ compliance with documentation requirements. MassHealth works to
ensure ADH provider compliance via training conducted during provider meetings, as well as
robust program integrity controls. Such program integrity controls include a comprehensive set of
pre-pay edits, a prior authorization process that ensures services rendered are clinically
appropriate, postpayment claims recoveries, and regularly scheduled audits of providers.
Specifically, MassHealth regularly initiates 1 to 2 ADH provider audits per month which may result
in the issuance of corrective actions and overpayments for improper documentation. Since
January 1st, 2022, MassHealth has initiated 36 audits of ADH providers and has issued 20 initial
notices of overpayment which detail the agency’s overpayment and sanction findings.
Regarding Finding 3, MassHealth stated the following:
MassHealth agrees with these recommendations. MassHealth has robust program integrity
controls in place to prevent payments after a member’s date of death. However, due to issues
often beyond MassHealth’s control (e.g., inaccurate sources of death data and time lags in access
to death data), it is possible for such payments to occur. As a result, MassHealth also has robust
controls in place to identify and recover such claims post-payment.
Regarding recommendation [6], MassHealth has adjusted its program integrity processes to
improve the identification and recovery of inappropriately paid claims for dates of service after a
member’s date of death. Historically, it had been MassHealth’s process to use Department of
Public Health (DPH) Vital Statistics data to identify claims that were incorrectly paid for dates [of]
service after a member’s date of death; only members matching on the DPH Vital Statistics file
would be included in any findings. MassHealth must balance the risk of missing potential
overpayments with the risk of relying on less reliable sources of death data in pursuing
recoupments of potential overpayments. In light of the OSA’s recommendation, as of January
8

2024, MassHealth has updated its program integrity efforts to no longer exclude members from
post-death algorithms when members do not appear in the DPH Vital Statistics file.
Regarding recommendation [7], MassHealth agrees with this recommendation. MassHealth will
review the claims identified by the OSA and carry out the recovery process as appropriate.
MassHealth notes that 28 of the 109 claims have already been identified and included in initial
notices of overpayment issued to the associated providers. MassHealth will ensure that all
remaining overpayments identified are validated and recovered as appropriate.
3. Office of Medicaid (MassHealth)—Review of Payment for Telehealth Adult
Foster Care and Group Adult Foster Care
Audit Number 2023-1374-3M2
Audit Period January 1, 2020–December 31, 2021
Issue Date September 4, 2024
Number of Findings 3
Number of Recommendations 3
Total Improper Billings $22,979,654
MassHealth Recouping Payments N/A
Background and Reason for Audit
The purpose of this audit was to determine whether MassHealth monitored telehealth practices for AFC
and GAFC services to ensure compliance with its regulations.
The audit was conducted as part of OSA’s ongoing independent statutory oversight of the state’s
Medicaid program. Several of our previously issued audit reports disclosed weaknesses in MassHealth’s
claim processing system and improper billing practices by MassHealth providers, which identified
millions of dollars in potentially improper payments. As with any government program, public
confidence is essential to the success and continued support for public expenditures, such as the state’s
Medicaid program. Our audit is designed to identify issues that will help improve the Medicaid program
so that taxpayers know that their dollars are spent prudently and that there is a system of continuous
improvement to support improved efficiency and service over time.
Summary of Finding and Recommendation
OSA reported three findings in this audit:
1. MassHealth did not ensure that AFC and GAFC registered nurses / licensed practical nurses and care
managers conducted required oversight visits.
9

2. MassHealth paid AFC and GAFC providers for services that did not have supporting caregiver / direct
care aide log documentation.
3. MassHealth paid for AFC and GAFC caregiver / direct care aide services that were incorrectly coded
as telehealth.
OSA’s recommendations to MassHealth were as follows:
1. MassHealth should establish effective monitoring controls to ensure that AFC and GAFC providers
conduct the required oversight visits for MassHealth members and caregivers / direct care aides. To
establish effective monitoring controls, we believe MassHealth should establish a goal for the
number of AFC / GAFC providers it will audit each year. MassHealth should investigate and resolve all
instances where its data matches indicate that a member is enrolled in another state’s Medicaid
program.
2. MassHealth should establish an effective monitoring process to ensure that caregivers / direct care
aides of AFC and GAFC providers properly document care in their logs.
3. MassHealth should add a system control in the Medicaid Management Information System to deny
AFC and GAFC caregiver / direct care aide services in a telehealth setting.
EOHHS’s Comments
Regarding Finding 1, MassHealth stated the following:
MassHealth agrees with this recommendation. MassHealth is committed to ensuring AFC and
GAFC providers’ compliance with federal and state requirements through clear and frequent
outreach to the provider network via periodic trainings and provider meetings, as well as robust
program integrity controls. Such program integrity controls include a comprehensive set of pre-
pay edits, a prior authorization process that ensures services rendered are clinically appropriate,
post-payment claims recoveries, and regularly scheduled audits of providers.
Program integrity initiatives developed and implemented since the period covered under this
audit include instituting a temporary moratorium on new AFC providers from March 10, 2023,
through September 10, 2023. The purpose of the temporary moratorium was to allow MassHealth
to focus on enhanced training and education of existing AFC providers and the development of a
more robust onboarding process for new AFC providers. Following the end of the moratorium,
and in addition to instituting a more robust onboarding process, MassHealth schedules audits of
every new AFC and GAFC provider within six months of their enrollment.
Additionally, to monitor compliance, and as part of MassHealth’s overall program integrity
strategy, MassHealth initiates audits of 2 to 3 AFC and GAFC providers each month
(approximately 24-36 audits per year). As part of these audits, MassHealth auditors review
documentation submitted by providers to ensure [registered nurse / licensed practical nurse] and
care manager visits are documented and occur within the timeframes required by the provider
regulations. Where MassHealth identifies instances of non-compliance, MassHealth issues
overpayments and sanctions as appropriate.
10

From 2022 to present, MassHealth has initiated 92 audits of AFC and GAFC providers
(approximately 3 audits per month) and has issued 49 initial notices of overpayment and
sanction, which outline MassHealth’s audit findings and initiates the recovery process for
identified overpayments and sanctions.
Regarding Finding 2, MassHealth stated the following:
MassHealth agrees with this recommendation. As discussed above, MassHealth actively engages
in provider education and program integrity activities to promote and monitor AFC and GAFC
compliance with provider requirements. This includes the provision of provider education on
requirements to train caregivers and direct care aides on care log documentation requirements,
as well as provider audits to monitor compliance with program requirements, which includes
review of caregiver / direct care aide logs.
As noted in response to Finding 1, above, from 2022 to present, MassHealth has initiated 92
audits of AFC and GAFC providers (approximately 3 audits per month) and has issued 49 initial
notices of overpayment and sanction, which outline MassHealth’s audit findings and initiates the
recovery process for identified overpayments and sanctions.
Regarding Finding 3, MassHealth stated the following:
MassHealth agrees with this recommendation. MassHealth will implement a system edit to
prevent AFC and GAFC providers from submitting claims for AFC / GAFC services when coded as
telehealth.
As noted above, because personal care is a type of care that cannot be delivered via telehealth,
AFC and GAFC providers were not—and are not—permitted to use telehealth for the delivery of
personal care. MassHealth appreciates that the [Office of the State Auditor] draft report
acknowledges that the identified claims were billed as telehealth in error and that AFC / GAFC
services were in fact rendered in person and based on the auditor’s review of provider
documentation. MassHealth further notes this error appears to be concentrated to a small
percentage of providers within the network with only 5 out of 268 providers having billed claims
coded as telehealth. As noted above, MassHealth agrees with the recommendation and will
implement an edit to prevent the ability for AFC / GAFC claims to be submitted when coded as
telehealth.
11

CURRENT INITIATIVES
During this reporting period, the Office of the State Auditor (OSA) began or continued work on seven
audits of MassHealth’s administration of the Medicaid program and Medicaid service providers’
compliance with state and federal laws, regulations, and other authoritative guidance. These audits were
selected based on OSA’s research, and we are using data analytics to identify areas of risk in the state’s
Medicaid program. Based on preliminary analysis and previous audit results, we anticipate that these
audits will continue to identify improper payments and areas for improvement in MassHealth’s
administration of program services. Where applicable, the audits will include recommendations to
strengthen internal controls and oversight in MassHealth’s program administration. The following is a
summary of our Medicaid audit work in process.
• OSA is conducting a review of MassHealth claims submitted by providers for durable medical
equipment (DME) for the audit period July 1, 2021 through June 30, 2023. This audit will
determine whether DME was ordered or prescribed to members by providers who are excluded
from participating in the Medicaid program and whether MassHealth paid for DME prescribed to
members who are deceased.
• OSA is conducting a review of MassHealth claims submitted by Dental Arts for the period July 1,
2019 through June 30, 2023. This audit will determine whether dental services provided to
MassHealth members were properly supported by documentation and were allowable in
accordance with certain MassHealth regulations.
• OSA is conducting a review of MassHealth claims submitted for non-emergency transportation
for the period July 1, 2020 through June 30, 2023. This audit will determine whether
MassHealth’s non-emergency transportation broker process provides equal opportunity to
contracted providers throughout the Commonwealth, whether non-emergency transportation
claims were properly authorized, and whether transportation drivers and attendants
consistently had Criminal Offender Record Information checks.
• OSA is conducting a review of MassHealth reimbursements for inpatient maternity services
provided by University of Massachusetts Memorial Healthcare (UMMH) during the period July 1,
2020 through June 30, 2023. This audit will determine whether UMMH properly billed
MassHealth for maternity care for its members, whether UMMH reported births occurring in its
hospitals to the Department of Public Health, and whether UMMH properly used grant funds
from EOHHS and the Massachusetts Emergency Management Agency.
