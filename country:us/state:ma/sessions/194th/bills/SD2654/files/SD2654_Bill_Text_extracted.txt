MassHealth Delivery System
Restructuring: 2022 Update
Report
Executive Office of Health & Human Services
January 2024

Executive Summary (1 of 2)
• In 2018, Massachusetts implemented its most significant Medicaid restructuring* in 20 years to move
away from a fee-for-service model by creating:
• Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs)
• Community Partners (CPs), serving members with complex needs
• Delivery System Reform Incentive Payment (DSRIP) Program, investing in statewide
infrastructure
• This is the fifth public report** on the MassHealth delivery system restructuring – this report covers the
program’s fifth calendar year (2022) through the first quarter of 2023 which marked the end of that
ACO contract period.
• During 2022, MassHealth had 17 ACOs providing care for ~1.2M members with a composite expense of
~$6.9B; when including Q1 2023, through the end of the ACO contract, an additional ~$1.8B was spent for
a total five-quarter period expense of $8.7B.
• The COVID-19 pandemic began to wane with a decline in case counts and severity of illness, yet the
residual effects of the pandemic continued to challenge the health care delivery system and to have an
impact on health needs and outcomes.
• MassHealth caseload and ACO enrollment increased due to Medicaid coverage protections during
the federal Public Health Emergency (PHE), and as a result total spend increased.
• In response to concerns over the pandemic’s impact on individual quality measures, MassHealth and
CMS agreed to certain benchmark reductions for ACO/CP measures.
• This report is focused on the 2017-2022 1115 demonstration's performance data. At the time of this
report’s release, MassHealth is implementing the 2022-2027 1115 demonstration. This report does not
cover this extension.
*See Appendix for further background on the 2018 restructuring.

Executive Summary (2 of 2)
By 2022, ACOs were showing early signs of impact.
• MassHealth members in ACO plans had higher primary care utilization relative to other plans, even
during the pandemic when access was an issue. PCP visits were 14% higher for members in ACOs
than for members not in ACOs on average from 2019 to 2022.
• ACOs had the structure to respond to growing challenges with behavioral health (BH) emergency
department (ED) boarding and better support members with high BH risk during a time with
limited access to BH inpatient beds. ACOs were able to effectively partner with MassHealth to improve
engagement on high impact interventions for these members.
• In 2022, quality measures rebounded after declines in 2020, though some measures did not
reach their pre-pandemic performance levels. The confounding effects of the pandemic made cost
and quality outcomes difficult to interpret.
• Community Partners, which provide community-based care coordination for members with significant
behavioral health and long-term services and supports (LTSS) needs, engaged with 44,000 unique
members in 2022.
• The Flexible Services Program, which provides housing and nutrition support to certain members,
had rapid and substantial growth, and provided >51k services in 2022 (more than double
compared to the previous year).

Context for Delivery System Restructuring Efforts: 1115 Waiver Renewal
• This report covers the final year of the 2017-2022 1115 demonstration. The period of performance
was January 1, 2022 through March 31, 2023.
• MassHealth collaborated with the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), its ACOs,
CPs, and other providers involved in the restructuring efforts on the design of the subsequent
1115 waiver (2022-2027).
• 2022 was also the last full year of Delivery System Reform Incentive Payment (DSRIP) Program:
o ACOs identified which high-impact programs should continue in whole or in part
beyond DSRIP, and accordingly developed sustainability plans and identified funding
sources; ACOs also identified which programs were less impactful and should
be discontinued.
• The 2022-2027 1115 waiver was approved on September 28, 2022, effective October 1, 2022
through December 31, 2027. Among many broad authorities, the 1115 extension authorized the
continuation of the ACO program.
• The ACO contracts that began in 2018 ended on March 31, 2023. During 2022, the ACO program
was being re-procured. ACOs spent time throughout 2022 preparing their bids and setting
strategy for the next contract period, including changes in partnerships and/or models.

Context for Delivery System Restructuring Efforts: COVID Pandemic
In 2022, the Massachusetts health care delivery system continued to experience the effects of the
COVID-19 pandemic on health care delivery, utilization, and access.
• The pandemic placed a strain on the healthcare workforce and resulted in significant
workforce shortages, leading to system-wide capacity strains and barriers to healthcare access.
• Behavioral and mental health needs rose as a result of the pandemic while service capacity was
limited particularly for inpatient BH beds. This led to a large volume of members waiting in the ED
for extended periods for a BH inpatient placement.
• The use of telehealth declined although it remained higher than pre-pandemic; most telehealth
utilization was BH-related.
• Utilization remained lower in most areas compared to pre-pandemic, including acute care
utilization (inpatient and ED).
• Clinical quality performance improved for ACOs, and all 6 measures with declines during the
pandemic showed a partial or full recovery.
• Per member spend increased by 2% compared to 2021 among ACO members, with increases
concentrated in the child population. Total spend increased in part due to increases in caseload.
• Caseload and ACO enrollment continued to increase significantly. MassHealth paused routine
redeterminations of members’ eligibility in accordance with federal guidance starting in March 2020,
leading caseload to increase by 10% in 2020, 13.5% in 2021, and 7% in 2022.

MassHealth’s Restructuring Efforts Were Already Showing Early Promising
Results in 2022
Key examples of progress
▪ ACOs retained strong member connection to primary care. PCP visits were 14%
higher for ACOs than non-ACOs on average from 2019 to 2022.
▪ ACO members saw greater declines in inpatient admissions* from 2019 to 2022 where
ACOs saw a 21% decline versus a 14% decline for non-ACO members.
▪ ACOs improved clinical quality. In 2022, all ACOs showed a partial or full recovery of
quality metrics from their respective previous declines during the pandemic. Overall
clinical quality performance improved for ACOs from 2021.
▪ CPs succeeded at engaging members with complex BH and LTSS needs. In 2022, CPs
served~44,000 unique members, increased engagement rates over pre-pandemic levels,
and sustained improvement on members’ cost and outcomes including trends that pre-
dated the pandemic’s impact on care patterns.
▪ The Flexible Services Program, which provides nutrition and housing support to certain
members, saw rapid and substantial growth increasing the number of unique members
served by 60% from 2021.
*Physical health inpatient admissions, excluding BH admissions

Delivery System Reform: ACOs
In 2022*, the COVID-19 pandemic was waning. However, residual effects continued, including
ongoing enrollment increases and capacity constraints, particularly in behavioral health. This
also marked the last full year of DSRIP funding for ACOs. A few themes emerged during this
period:
• ACOs retained members and increased enrollment over the course of 2022, growing
1
to a total average enrollment of 1,196,381 (7% growth over year-end 2021).

Section 2:
1. The ACO program saw utilization declines from 2019 to 2022 driven by ongoing
2
impacts of the pandemic. However, from 2021-2022 the pediatric population saw
increases in acute services likely due a surge in pediatric respiratory illnesses
• ACOs collaborated with MassHealth to address BH ED boarding and better support
3
members with high BH risk during a time with limited access to BH inpatient beds
resulting in a large volume of members waiting in the ED for extended periods for a BH
inpatient placement
• 2022 was the last year of DSRIP funding during which ACOs made ongoing funding
4
decisions based on demonstrated outcomes and experience of their DSRIP
programs. This included sustaining programs with clear impact, while discontinuing
other efforts.

Section 3:
1. ACOs continued rapid and substantial growth in the third year of the Flexible
5
Services Program. Flexible Services grew faster in 2022 than in 2021 with services
provided more than doubling from 2021 (see next section of this report for detail)

2 In 2022, Most Utilization Rates Were Still Below 2019 (Pre-COVID)
Levels
• Compared to 2019, the last full year before the COVID-19 pandemic, utilization was down for most services in 2022
ranging from -10% to -36%.
• Urgent Care saw a 64% increase when comparing 2022 to 2019 due to the removal of referral requirements for
certain plans at the start of the COVID pandemic and overall changes in patterns of care.
• Utilization rates continue to reflect ongoing pandemic impacts in 2022 (e.g., holds on elective procedures during
COVID spikes and overall lower acuity of the population).
• Behavioral Health Inpatient Admissions saw the largest declines of -36%, at least partially due to statewide system
capacity issues including staffing shortages and limited bed availability.

2 From 2021 to 2022, Utilization Declined for Most Services while
Hospital, Urgent Care and Primary Care Use Increased for Pediatrics
• Comparing 2021 to 2022, most services continued to see flat or declining utilization ranging from a 1% increase
to -16% decrease. These overall trends were driven by declining utilization in the adult population.
• However, the pediatric population experienced increases in a few acute services as well as primary care. These
services included an 11% increase in Physical Health Inpatient Admissions, 19% increase in Emergency
Department Visits, 9% increase in Urgent Care, and a 2% increase in Primary Care.
• The winter of 2022-2023 saw increases in respiratory infections driven by influenza, respiratory syncytial virus
(RSV), and COVID-19 impacting the pediatric population. This may explain some of these trends.

3 ACOs Collaborated with MassHealth to Address BH ED Boarding and
Better Support Members with High BH Risk
• In 2022, Massachusetts continues to experience a large volume of members presenting in EDs seeking inpatient
BH care and waiting extended periods for placement
• To address this ongoing concern, MassHealth implemented a performance and reporting program with ACOs to
improve engagement in high impact interventions for members with high BH risk. High BH risk was defined by the number
of BH ED visits and BH IP admissions a member had during a 3-month period.
• ACOs were asked to report on which four high impact interventions they had engaged members with high BH risk in
during the previous quarter. The results, including a market comparison, were shared with ACOs.

4 ACOs Reviewed Effectiveness of DSRIP Funded Programs to Make
Ongoing Investment Decisions
• As time-limited DSRIP funding declined in this final year of the DSRIP program, ACOs
evaluated and compared their DSRIP-funded investments to make data-driven choices about
which to scale/sustain and which to sunset.
• ACO DSRIP spending was at its highest in 2018 ($189.3M) and continually decreased in the
subsequent years ($173.7M in 2019, $135.7M in 2020, $87.5M in 2021, $69M in 2022 through
Q1 2023) as ACOs decreased spending on Integration Projects and Data Analytics, Population
Health, and HIT Projects.
• In 2022, as in prior years, ACOs made decisions about which programs to fund through DSRIP
and which to sunset or move to other funding sources given lower levels of DSRIP funding.
Example: In 2022, FLN-Berkshire continued DSRIP investment in their Hospital Based
Community Health Worker (CHW) program based on demonstrated reductions in
avoidable ED visits, inpatient admissions, and behavioral health hospital days
• The Hospital Based CHW at Berkshire visits or contacts members when they are in the
ED/inpatient setting to engage the member and provide a warm handoff to the care team for
ongoing care management and engagement
• The program was evaluated and showed positive outcomes on three measures compared to
benchmarks: 1) avoidable ED visits decreased by 24%, 2) inpatient admissions decreased by
23%, 3) residential behavioral health / SUD hospital days decreased 18%.

Flexible Services Program: Summary of 2022 Progress
• The Flexible Services Program enables ACOs to provide nutritional and housing supports
to certain members, with the goal of improving overall member health and outcomes
• The Flexible Services Program was one of 2022’s key successes. In its third year, the
program continued to experience rapid and substantial growth, became more
efficient, and demonstrated promising early outcomes
• The Flexible Services Program grew faster in 2022 than in 2021, providing more
services to more members:
• Overall services* delivered more than doubled:
• 2021: 21,051
• 2022**: 51,281 (2022 total annualized: 41,024**)
• Unique members served increased by 60%
• 10,229 members served in 2021; 20,475 in 2022 (16,380 annualized**)
• Dollars spent on Flexible Services supports doubled
• $22.6M in 2021 to $52.4M ($41.9M annualized**) in 2022
• While Flexible Services remained a relatively nascent program in 2022, preliminary
analyses already began to show improvements for members with diabetes
(reductions in A1c) and total cost of care
*MassHealth defines Flexible Services in terms of member-quarters or number of quarters members have received services. A unique member that
received services across 4 quarters would count towards 4 services provided.
**The 2022 performance period encompasses five quarters (1/1/2022 – 3/31/2023) rather than the standard four quarters reported in prior years.

ACOs Partnered with SSOs to Offer 85 Flexible Services Programs in 2022
• In 2022, ACOs partnered with community-based Social Services Organizations (SSOs) to
offer 85 Flexible Services programs focused on nutrition and housing support services
and goods.
• Compared to 2021, both the number of available programs and partnerships between ACOs
and SSOs increased by approximately 12%.

Flexible Services: Early Promising Results
In 2022, individual SSOs were already seeing early improvements in health and social outcomes.
MassHealth continues to closely track results and evaluate if specific interventions/models are more
impactful than others.
SSO Highlight: Project Bread observed positive initial impacts on food security and fruit and vegetable
consumption based on their members served from October 1, 2021 – September 30, 2022. Their services
include nutrition education, food vouchers, coordination, and transportation.
Snapshot of Services Provided
✓ Partnered with 3 ACOs to serve over 3,000 members
✓ 42,731 Gift Cards Sent
✓ 4,776 Kitchen Supply Orders Placed
✓ 896 Cooking Class / Counseling Session Attendees
• Social Improvements
• 19% decrease in member reported food insecurity and a 30% increase in SNAP
participation for members receiving nutrition services (N = 2,112) for 6 months
• Health Improvements
• At the end of the six months of services:
• 91% of members reported an improved ability to prepare healthy meals
• 94% of members reported improvement in their health
• 87% of members reported an increase in their confidence of their nutrition knowledge
Note: different “N’s” result from variations in survey completeness for initial and 6-month assessments.
22
Flexible Services: Early Promising Results (Continued)
ACO Highlight: Boston Medical Center Healthnet Plan Community Alliance (BACO)
observed encouraging initial impacts on housing status based on their CY2022 members
served.
Housing Placement and Maintenance:
• BACO’s Housing Supports Program reported 76% of members successfully housed in their
programs (n=34).
• In further results from the above program, 95% of members maintained housing for one year after
placement (n=32).
Member Story: Positive Social Outcomes
A member facing various challenges regarding housing (e.g., in need of financial assistance and guided
support for the housing search process) was referred by BACO to a housing program. This program
successfully provided the member:
• Assistance with housing search and placement (e.g., applications submitted for subsidized
housing)
• Assistance with obtaining additional financial resources (e.g., applications for financial
assistance were submitted and approved for rental arrears and future rental stipends)
• Continued guidance and connection to community resources (e.g., referred into food delivery
program)

Community Partners: Summary of CP Progress through March 2023
• CPs contract with ACOs to provide wrap-around expertise and support for behavioral health (BH)
services and long-term services and supports (LTSS)
• The CP program, which ran from September 2018 to March 2023, continued to see positive trends in
utilization and cost measures, including:
• Data showed reductions in ED and BH inpatient utilization rates for members with longer
enrollment in the CP program.
• Risk-adjusted TCOC was 20% lower for BH CP members following graduation from the CP
program vs. members in the 12 months preceding enrollment
• However, these observed reductions may be confounded by overall utilization declines driven by
the pandemic and changes in the CP population over time.
• Despite lingering COVID-related challenges, CPs continued to make gains in member outreach and
engagement. During 2022, CPs:
• Served ~44,000 unique members
• Increased the annual engagement rate** of actively enrolled members from 53% to 58%
• Reduced the statewide average days to a complete care plan (a key indicator of successful
coordination with PCPs) from 176 to 152 days (14% reduction)

• In 2022, BH CP enrollees 13 months or more after their initial Care Plan* was completed
had 7.4% lower ED visits than enrollees before their completed Care Plan
• Overall, members with shorter CP enrollment (e.g., ≤ 6 months) had higher ED utilization,
while members with longer CP enrollment had lower ED utilization.
*Note: "No Completed Care Plan" meansthe member is enrolled in CP but their care plan has not yet been
completed. The Care Plan is considered completed when its development is finalized. Care plans are reviewed and
completed annually for every member or updated when significant changes occur in the member's
presentation/needs.

admissions than members before their completed Care Plan
• However, this is also confounded by large declines in BH inpatient admissions across the ACO
population (see p. 12).

• rTCOC is the average amount paid on claims by Medicaid and ACOs/MCOs per CP member per
month, risk adjusted within the CP population and excluding members who are dually-eligible for
Medicaid and Medicare.
• This graph represents all CP members enrolled in the program between July 1, 2018 to March 31,
2023 and shows the change in rTCOC throughout their time enrolled in the program.
• Overall, rTCOC decreases throughout the time that CP members are engaged with a CP
• On average, CP members have a 15% lower rTCOC upon discharge compared to CP
members in the 12 months prior to enrollment ($1,491 vs. $1,753).

• CP members are considered engaged in the CP Program once their Care Plan is completed and
approved by their PCP. The Days to Care Plan Complete measure provides insight into how quickly and
efficiently CPs are conducting outreach and engaging members and coordinating with other members of
the care team
• During 2022, CPs continued to bring down the average number of days to Care Plan Complete,
from 146 days in Q1 2022 to 139 days in Q4 2022.
• Days to Care Plan Complete has decreased 45% from its peak in Q3 2019 (247 days) to Q1 2023 (136

Overview of DSRIP Program
• The Delivery System Reform Incentive Payment (DSRIP) program was a $1.8 billion, five-year
investment program authorized through MassHealth’s 1115 demonstration to support MassHealth’s
restructuring efforts; 2022 was the last year of the DSRIP Program.
• ACOs and CPs used DSRIP funds to design and test innovative programs, with the expectation
that they measure those programs’ outcomes, and to stand up infrastructure required for
population health management
• In 2022* ACOs and CPs spent $209.1M in DSRIP funding:
• $121.4M by ACOs (Startup/Ongoing: $69M; and Flexible Services: $52.4M)**
• $87.7M by CPs (Infrastructure and Care Coordination)
• The most common type of DSRIP-funded ACO program in CY2022 was care coordination and care
management programs (113 programs costing $26M; e.g., embedding community health workers in
EDs to help members navigate the health care system and share resources upon ED departure)***
• From July 1, 2018 to March 31, 2023, ACOs and CPs cumulatively spent $1.2B in DSRIP funding:
• $794.8M by ACOs (Startup/Ongoing and Flexible Services)
• $377.1M by CPs (Infrastructure and Care Coordination)
• Additionally, $13.4M of DSRIP funding was used for Statewide Investments in 2022 to support
workforce development (training, hiring, retention), technical assistance for ACOs and CPs, and
related initiatives.
See Appendix for detailed DSRIP funding charts by ACO, CP, and Statewide Investments programs
*The 2022 performance period encompasses five quarters (1/1/2022 – 3/31/2023) rather than the standard four quarters
**Certain ACOs also received an additional $104.5M for safety net hospital (Delivery System Transformation Initiative) glide-path
funding from the beginning of DSRIP through 12/31/2022.
***See p. 35-36 for additional details on how ACOs and CPs utilized their DSRIP funding

DSRIP Health-Related Social Needs Spending
One of MassHealth’s key priorities for its ACO program is to better address the health-
related socials needs (HRSNs) of its ACO-enrolled members. ACOs have two funding
sources available to address HRSNs:
• ACOs may use general DSRIP funds on investments such as
infrastructure, technology, and workforce in support of ACO goals,
and some ACOs have leveraged this funding to address HRSNs.
General DSRIP
• CPs may also use DSRIP funds to address certain HRSNs.
Funds
• Funds Spent On HRSNs*† – 2017: $7.4M, 2018: $34.3M, 2019:
$44M, 2020: $32.9M, 2021: $20.5M**, 2022: $13M***
• “Flexible Services” funding can be used to pay for certain nutrition
and housing supports, including pre-tenancy supports (e.g.,
transitional assistance), tenancy sustaining supports, home
Flexible
modifications, and nutrition supports, for certain ACO members.
Services
• The Flexible Services Program launched in January 2020.
• Details on Flexible Services spending and utilization can be found
on p. 18-23.
* ACOs and CPs made investments in housing stabilization and supports, nonmedical transportation, nutrition, investments that addressed multiple HRSNs, and IT investments that were
related to HRSNs. ACOs and CPs did not explicitly report making investments in utility assistance, physical activity, or sexual assault and domestic violence supports.
† It is likely that ACOs/CPs allocated more than this funding to HRSNs. For instance, many ACOs allocated funds to various care management programs, which likely provide some level of
support for a member’s health-related social needs. However, if the HRSN linkage was not explicitly stated in the ACO or CP budgets, the funding allocation tied to those programs was
not included in the total amounts referenced above.
**Flexible Services was launched in 2020; a sizeable portion of HRSN funding shifted over to that program and continued to shift in CY22.
***The decrease from CY21 to CY22 aligns with the overall decrease in DSRIP spending from CY21 to CY22. This amount is inclusive of spending in Q1 2023.

Overview of 2022 ACO and CP Quality Data and Performance
• The varying impact of the pandemic across ACO and CP quality measures, as well as the addition of
various COVID-based scoring modifications 2020-2022, makes the comparison of year over year
overall quality performance difficult.
• However, at a high-level, clinical quality performance improved for ACOs (73.90% vs. 85.25%) and
declined for CPs (69.84% vs. 64.40%) when comparing 2021 to 2022 performance.
• In 2022, of the measures that showed substantial declines in performance from 2019 to 2020, all
six ACO measures and all four CP measures demonstrated partial to full recovery from their
respective previous declines.
• Despite these improvements, some measures did not reach their pre-pandemic performance
levels or demonstrate improvement over 2021 performance.
• Member experience results were similar to 2020-2021, and demonstrated strong levels of
satisfaction with providers, and ongoing opportunities for increased care coordination
• Note: Quality results were not generated for the January – March 2023 time period as individual
measures and/or benchmarks are designed and tested based on a 12-month measurement period
*Note: Despite the ongoing PHE, MassHealth and CMS determined 2021 and 2022 data was usable for official quality
scoring. This is in contrast to 2020 when data was deemed unusable due to the pandemic. In response to concerns over the
pandemic’s impact on individual quality measures, MassHealth and CMS agreed to certain benchmark reductions for
ACO/CP measures demonstrating 2019-2020 performance declines. See the appendix for more details on benchmark
reductions and for the ACO and CP measure slates.

ACO Clinical Quality: 2022 Measures with Substantial Performance Drop
• In 2020, six ACO quality measures demonstrated substantial drops in performance from 2019 to
2020 (likely due to COVID) and were deemed priority measures for monitoring through 2022
• The table below demonstrates the percentage of initial performance drops in 2020 and the recovery
% by the end of 2022. In 2022, five measures demonstrated partial recovery from their initial
2019-2020 declines, and one measure demonstrated full recovery. However, three of those
measures (#s 1, 2, 4) had partially recovered in 2021 and remained stable in 2022.

Member Experience: Summary of 2019-2022 Results
• ACOs are accountable for performance on two member experience measures:*
1) Overall care delivery; and 2) Integration/ coordination of care
• These measures are based on results from a subset of questions in the primary care survey,
based on a nationally validated tool
• As in 2021, members in 2022 expressed strong levels of satisfaction with their providers, and
the need for increased coordination managing BH and other specialists and services
• As with 2019-2021 results, 2022 continues to identify opportunities for progress, especially in
the integration and coordination of BH care, and in the experience for the LTSS population

Overview of 2022 Cost Data and ACO Financial Performance
Overall spend
• In 2022, the ACO program accounted for $6.9B* of MassHealth spending, with an average annual total
cost of medical services per member of ~$5,800; when including Q1 2023, through the end of the ACO
contract, an additional ~$1.8B was spent for a total five-quarter period expense of $8.7B.
• ACO medical spend per member increased on average by approximately 2% from 2021 to 2022:
• Increase concentrated in child population; adult member per year spend was slightly higher
• Decreases in inpatient were offset by increases in pharmacy, outpatient, and other routine care
Financial Performance
• Most ACOs experienced financial gains in 2022
• ACPP/PCACOs were in 1.5%** profits (following market adjustment)
Variation in spend
• Among 13 ACPPs, profit/loss performance varied by up to ~14 percentage points across ACPPs after
applying adjustments
• Among 3 PCACOs, performance varied by up to ~2 percentage points across PCACOs after applying
adjustments
Continuation of New Pricing Policies: Market Adjustment
• In 2021, MassHealth implemented new pricing policies to adjust for changes that impacted the market
as a whole. Through these changes, MassHealth ensures that actual funding (i.e., the rate / benchmark)
is adjusted to meet actual costs for the ACO/MCO program overall while continuing to incentivize
individual ACOs to perform better than the market. The main changes included:
• Concurrent risk score adjustments which adjust for member acuity throughout the year
• Market corridor which applies a market-wide adjustment in instances of significant profits or
losses across all plans
**January – December 2021 & 2022 medical expenditures; includes all medical covered services (incl. maternity supplemental and HCD), and excludes ABA, CBHI, and
HCV. Excludes MCO-Administered ACOs. Total spend and PMPY figures are not directly comparable to estimates in previous annual reports
**The Market % profit/loss above will not tie out to the 2022 refresh market corridor report because the above data excludes MCO and PCC plans
52
Total Cost of Care: Comparison across 2021 & 2022
Both total spend and average per member per year spending increased compared to 2021, driven by the
child population. Adult member per year spend decreased slightly from 2021 to 2022.

Conclusion of 2017-2022 1115 Demonstration
Continued recovery from / response to the pandemic
• In the final year of the 2017-2022 1115 demonstration, ACOs, CPs, and MassHealth continued to address
the effects of the pandemic on MassHealth members and the healthcare workforce
• Efforts to re-engage members in care, ramp up home- and community-based services, continue
telehealth use as appropriate, promote BH access, and address workforce shortages continued to be
crucial.
Planning for the end of DSRIP funding
• 2022 marked the last full year for DSRIP funding to support ACO population health strategies as well as
funding for the CPs, Flexible Services, and Statewide Investments
• ACOs continued to iterate and refine their DSRIP spending and population health strategies as DSRIP
funding declined in the last year, requiring ACOs to continue to prioritize programs that demonstrated
success and sustainability
• MassHealth underwent a planning phase to review the successes and challenges of the 2017-2022
waiver, launched stakeholder meetings, and drafted the next 1115 demonstration proposal to continue to
invest in and build off of the reforms accomplished under the 2017-2022 demonstration
Building on successes for the 2022-2027 1115 demonstration
• In drafting the 2022-2027 1115 demonstration proposal, MassHealth took the most successful program
designs and best practices being tested under the 2017-2022 demonstration and incorporated them as
core, funded expectations for ACOs, CPs, and primary care practices in 2023 and beyond.
• Critical investment areas include:
• Enhanced care coordination by ACOs and CPs serving members with complex needs
• Increased resources to support health equity and health-related social needs along with critical
investments in strategic focus areas (e.g., maternal health, pediatrics)
• High-value MassHealth-serving primary care practices
• Additional information about MassHealth’s 2022 – 2027 1115 demonstration extension can be found at:

60
Context: What are MassHealth Accountable Care Organizations?
• ACOs are health care organizations that are rewarded for better health outcomes,
lower cost, and improved member experience
• ACOs are responsible for achieving these results through team-based care
coordination and integration of behavioral and physical health care; ACOs are also
responsible for taking a whole person view of their members, including LTSS and HRSN
• MassHealth members enrolled in an ACO select, or are assigned, a specific primary
care provider and have access to networks of specialty providers (e.g., hospitals,
specialists, BH providers) that participate in their plan
• ACOs assume upside and downside risk and are financially accountable for specific
quality measures
• ACOs represent a diverse range of provider systems:
• Hospital-based and community primary care-based ACOs
• Large, statewide and regional ACOs
• Provider-led and provider-health plan partnership ACOs
61
Context: What are MassHealth Community Partners?
• Community Partners (CPs) contract with ACOs to provide wrap-around
expertise and support for behavioral health (BH) services and long-term
services and supports (LTSS)
• CPs serve the most complex ACO members, with serious mental illness,
substance use disorders, co-occurring disorders, or disabilities that require
LTSS
• CPs are paid to engage these members and collaborate with the health care
system to coordinate and improve their care
• CPs are community-based organizations with expertise in supporting the
populations they serve
62
Context: What is the Delivery System Reform Incentive Payment (DSRIP)
Program?
• CMS authorized $1.8B in one-time DSRIP funding for upfront
investments in the delivery system.
• Funding is divided among 3 main streams over 5 years:
ACOs CPs Statewide
Investments
$1B $550M $115M
• ACOs and CPs use funding to launch innovative programs and
coordinate care for their members. Funding is tied to performance on
quality and the total cost of care
• $1B ACO allocation includes $149M allocated for Flexible Services
investments, which provide goods and services to address health-
related social needs. See p. 18-23 for more detail
• DSRIP funding is time limited and ends in Q1 2023

This 2022 comparison of the health plans’“% of 2022 Enrollees” to “% of 2022 Disenrollments” is generally in line with disenrollments for
ACOs and MCOs but shows an increase in disenrollments for the PCC Plan.
*Note this reflects total unique members enrolled as compared to average members shown on slide 11. This total excludes 11,355 average members in the Lahey
Health ACO (as of 12/31/2022); members cannot enroll directly into Lahey Health – they must be enrolled in either BMC Health Net Plan or Tufts Public Plans.
**These numbers represent disenrollment events, which differ from the snapshot enrollment number reported in the earlier column, from 1/1/2022 to 12/31/22 that are
driven by the member (e.g., a member calling the Customer Service Center to disenroll from an ACO).

There were significant utilization shifts from 2021 to 2022 driven by the
pandemic and lower member acuity
• Utilization declines ranged from -5% to -16% when comparing 2021 to 2022 with ED Visits
seeing a slight increase (1%).
• Utilization shifts are driven by holds on elective procedures, members deferring care or
seeking care in alternative settings due to the COVID-19 PHE and overall lower acuity of the
population.

Quality Measure Benchmark Reductions due to COVID-19 PHE
Given concerns over the pandemic’s impact on quality measure performance, MassHealth and CMS
agreed to the following stepwise methodology for determining ACO and CP benchmark reductions
applicable to CY2021-2022 quality measure calculations
Step 1:
• Assess each measure for a drop in performance from CY2019 to CY2020
• Performance drop is determined by any negative change in median level performance across
ACOs/CPs
Step 2:
• For any measure with a performance drop identified in Step 1, adjust that measure’s CY2021
Attainment Threshold and Goal Benchmark to exactly match the median performance drop
Example:
• Measure: Childhood Immunization Status
• Attainment Threshold: 48.9%
• Goal Benchmark: 59.4%
• CY2019 Median Performance: 55.7%
• If the CY2020 ACO median performance drops by 4.1 points, then the Attainment Threshold and Goal
Benchmark would be adjusted to 44.8% and 55.3%, respectively.
Step 3:
• For measures with benchmark adjustments in Step 2, determine if those measures demonstrate a two-
thirds recovery in CY2021 as compared to the original CY2020-2021 performance drops.
• Measures demonstrating a two-thirds or greater recovery will have their original pre-COVID
benchmarks reinstated for CY2022
• Measures failing to demonstrate a two-thirds recovery will maintain their COVID benchmark
adjustments in CY2022 (as determine in Step 2)
73
How to Read the Quality Measure Charts on Upcoming Slides
Charts are shown that summarize key information about ACO quality
performance
• The median quality score per measure per year is represented by the bar chart
• This chart allows easy comparison of the median scores against the attainment threshold
and goal benchmark by lining these up (the red line and blue line, respectively); because
the attainment threshold and goal benchmark values actually vary from measure to
measure, lining them up like this requires the scale for each measure to vary as well
• Therefore, these charts show how the medians varied relative to the benchmarks, but
the bars are not to scale with each other and should not be used to determine the relative
performance between one measure and another

MassHealth Delivery System
Restructuring: 2022 Update
Report
Executive Office of Health & Human Services
January 2024
0

Executive Summary (1 of 2)
• In 2018, Massachusetts implemented its most significant Medicaid restructuring* in 20 years to move
away from a fee-for-service model by creating:
• Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs)
• Community Partners (CPs), serving members with complex needs
• Delivery System Reform Incentive Payment (DSRIP) Program, investing in statewide
infrastructure
• This is the fifth public report** on the MassHealth delivery system restructuring – this report covers the
program’s fifth calendar year (2022) through the first quarter of 2023 which marked the end of that
ACO contract period.
• During 2022, MassHealth had 17 ACOs providing care for ~1.2M members with a composite expense of
~$6.9B; when including Q1 2023, through the end of the ACO contract, an additional ~$1.8B was spent for
a total five-quarter period expense of $8.7B.
• The COVID-19 pandemic began to wane with a decline in case counts and severity of illness, yet the
residual effects of the pandemic continued to challenge the health care delivery system and to have an
impact on health needs and outcomes.
• MassHealth caseload and ACO enrollment increased due to Medicaid coverage protections during
the federal Public Health Emergency (PHE), and as a result total spend increased.
• In response to concerns over the pandemic’s impact on individual quality measures, MassHealth and
CMS agreed to certain benchmark reductions for ACO/CP measures.
• This report is focused on the 2017-2022 1115 demonstration's performance data. At the time of this
report’s release, MassHealth is implementing the 2022-2027 1115 demonstration. This report does not
cover this extension.
*See Appendix for further background on the 2018 restructuring.
**Prior reports are available at: https://www.mass.gov/info-details/massachusetts-delivery-system-reform-incentive-payment-program
1

Executive Summary (2 of 2)
By 2022, ACOs were showing early signs of impact.
• MassHealth members in ACO plans had higher primary care utilization relative to other plans, even
during the pandemic when access was an issue. PCP visits were 14% higher for members in ACOs
than for members not in ACOs on average from 2019 to 2022.
• ACOs had the structure to respond to growing challenges with behavioral health (BH) emergency
department (ED) boarding and better support members with high BH risk during a time with
limited access to BH inpatient beds. ACOs were able to effectively partner with MassHealth to improve
engagement on high impact interventions for these members.
• In 2022, quality measures rebounded after declines in 2020, though some measures did not
reach their pre-pandemic performance levels. The confounding effects of the pandemic made cost
and quality outcomes difficult to interpret.
• Community Partners, which provide community-based care coordination for members with significant
behavioral health and long-term services and supports (LTSS) needs, engaged with 44,000 unique
members in 2022.
• The Flexible Services Program, which provides housing and nutrition support to certain members,
had rapid and substantial growth, and provided >51k services in 2022 (more than double
compared to the previous year).

Context for Delivery System Restructuring Efforts: 1115 Waiver Renewal
• This report covers the final year of the 2017-2022 1115 demonstration. The period of performance
was January 1, 2022 through March 31, 2023.
• MassHealth collaborated with the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), its ACOs,
CPs, and other providers involved in the restructuring efforts on the design of the subsequent
1115 waiver (2022-2027).
• 2022 was also the last full year of Delivery System Reform Incentive Payment (DSRIP) Program:
o ACOs identified which high-impact programs should continue in whole or in part
beyond DSRIP, and accordingly developed sustainability plans and identified funding
sources; ACOs also identified which programs were less impactful and should
be discontinued.
• The 2022-2027 1115 waiver was approved on September 28, 2022, effective October 1, 2022
through December 31, 2027. Among many broad authorities, the 1115 extension authorized the
continuation of the ACO program.
• The ACO contracts that began in 2018 ended on March 31, 2023. During 2022, the ACO program
was being re-procured. ACOs spent time throughout 2022 preparing their bids and setting
strategy for the next contract period, including changes in partnerships and/or models.

Context for Delivery System Restructuring Efforts: COVID Pandemic
In 2022, the Massachusetts health care delivery system continued to experience the effects of the
COVID-19 pandemic on health care delivery, utilization, and access.
• The pandemic placed a strain on the healthcare workforce and resulted in significant
workforce shortages, leading to system-wide capacity strains and barriers to healthcare access.
• Behavioral and mental health needs rose as a result of the pandemic while service capacity was
limited particularly for inpatient BH beds. This led to a large volume of members waiting in the ED
for extended periods for a BH inpatient placement.
• The use of telehealth declined although it remained higher than pre-pandemic; most telehealth
utilization was BH-related.
• Utilization remained lower in most areas compared to pre-pandemic, including acute care
utilization (inpatient and ED).
• Clinical quality performance improved for ACOs, and all 6 measures with declines during the
pandemic showed a partial or full recovery.
• Per member spend increased by 2% compared to 2021 among ACO members, with increases
concentrated in the child population. Total spend increased in part due to increases in caseload.
• Caseload and ACO enrollment continued to increase significantly. MassHealth paused routine
redeterminations of members’ eligibility in accordance with federal guidance starting in March 2020,
leading caseload to increase by 10% in 2020, 13.5% in 2021, and 7% in 2022.

MassHealth’s Restructuring Efforts Were Already Showing Early Promising
Results in 2022
Key examples of progress
▪ ACOs retained strong member connection to primary care. PCP visits were 14%
higher for ACOs than non-ACOs on average from 2019 to 2022.
▪ ACO members saw greater declines in inpatient admissions* from 2019 to 2022 where
ACOs saw a 21% decline versus a 14% decline for non-ACO members.
▪ ACOs improved clinical quality. In 2022, all ACOs showed a partial or full recovery of
quality metrics from their respective previous declines during the pandemic. Overall
clinical quality performance improved for ACOs from 2021.
▪ CPs succeeded at engaging members with complex BH and LTSS needs. In 2022, CPs
served~44,000 unique members, increased engagement rates over pre-pandemic levels,
and sustained improvement on members’ cost and outcomes including trends that pre-
dated the pandemic’s impact on care patterns.
▪ The Flexible Services Program, which provides nutrition and housing support to certain
members, saw rapid and substantial growth increasing the number of unique members
served by 60% from 2021.
*Physical health inpatient admissions, excluding BH admissions

Delivery System Reform: ACOs
In 2022*, the COVID-19 pandemic was waning. However, residual effects continued, including
ongoing enrollment increases and capacity constraints, particularly in behavioral health. This
also marked the last full year of DSRIP funding for ACOs. A few themes emerged during this
period:
• ACOs retained members and increased enrollment over the course of 2022, growing
1
to a total average enrollment of 1,196,381 (7% growth over year-end 2021).
1. The ACO program saw utilization declines from 2019 to 2022 driven by ongoing
2
impacts of the pandemic. However, from 2021-2022 the pediatric population saw
increases in acute services likely due a surge in pediatric respiratory illnesses
• ACOs collaborated with MassHealth to address BH ED boarding and better support
3
members with high BH risk during a time with limited access to BH inpatient beds
resulting in a large volume of members waiting in the ED for extended periods for a BH
inpatient placement
• 2022 was the last year of DSRIP funding during which ACOs made ongoing funding
4
decisions based on demonstrated outcomes and experience of their DSRIP
programs. This included sustaining programs with clear impact, while discontinuing
other efforts.
1. ACOs continued rapid and substantial growth in the third year of the Flexible
5
Services Program. Flexible Services grew faster in 2022 than in 2021 with services
provided more than doubling from 2021 (see next section of this report for detail)
*This section compares year over year trends, and therefore does not include data from Q1 2023.

2 In 2022, Most Utilization Rates Were Still Below 2019 (Pre-COVID)
Levels
• Compared to 2019, the last full year before the COVID-19 pandemic, utilization was down for most services in 2022
ranging from -10% to -36%.
• Urgent Care saw a 64% increase when comparing 2022 to 2019 due to the removal of referral requirements for
certain plans at the start of the COVID pandemic and overall changes in patterns of care.
• Utilization rates continue to reflect ongoing pandemic impacts in 2022 (e.g., holds on elective procedures during
COVID spikes and overall lower acuity of the population).
• Behavioral Health Inpatient Admissions saw the largest declines of -36%, at least partially due to statewide system
capacity issues including staffing shortages and limited bed availability.

2 From 2021 to 2022, Utilization Declined for Most Services while
Hospital, Urgent Care and Primary Care Use Increased for Pediatrics
• Comparing 2021 to 2022, most services continued to see flat or declining utilization ranging from a 1% increase
to -16% decrease. These overall trends were driven by declining utilization in the adult population.
• However, the pediatric population experienced increases in a few acute services as well as primary care. These
services included an 11% increase in Physical Health Inpatient Admissions, 19% increase in Emergency
Department Visits, 9% increase in Urgent Care, and a 2% increase in Primary Care.
• The winter of 2022-2023 saw increases in respiratory infections driven by influenza, respiratory syncytial virus
(RSV), and COVID-19 impacting the pediatric population. This may explain some of these trends.

3 ACOs Collaborated with MassHealth to Address BH ED Boarding and
Better Support Members with High BH Risk
• In 2022, Massachusetts continues to experience a large volume of members presenting in EDs seeking inpatient
BH care and waiting extended periods for placement
• To address this ongoing concern, MassHealth implemented a performance and reporting program with ACOs to
improve engagement in high impact interventions for members with high BH risk. High BH risk was defined by the number
of BH ED visits and BH IP admissions a member had during a 3-month period.
• ACOs were asked to report on which four high impact interventions they had engaged members with high BH risk in
during the previous quarter. The results, including a market comparison, were shared with ACOs.

4 ACOs Reviewed Effectiveness of DSRIP Funded Programs to Make
Ongoing Investment Decisions
• As time-limited DSRIP funding declined in this final year of the DSRIP program, ACOs
evaluated and compared their DSRIP-funded investments to make data-driven choices about
which to scale/sustain and which to sunset.
• ACO DSRIP spending was at its highest in 2018 ($189.3M) and continually decreased in the
subsequent years ($173.7M in 2019, $135.7M in 2020, $87.5M in 2021, $69M in 2022 through
Q1 2023) as ACOs decreased spending on Integration Projects and Data Analytics, Population
Health, and HIT Projects.
• In 2022, as in prior years, ACOs made decisions about which programs to fund through DSRIP
and which to sunset or move to other funding sources given lower levels of DSRIP funding.
Example: In 2022, FLN-Berkshire continued DSRIP investment in their Hospital Based
Community Health Worker (CHW) program based on demonstrated reductions in
avoidable ED visits, inpatient admissions, and behavioral health hospital days
• The Hospital Based CHW at Berkshire visits or contacts members when they are in the
ED/inpatient setting to engage the member and provide a warm handoff to the care team for
ongoing care management and engagement
• The program was evaluated and showed positive outcomes on three measures compared to
benchmarks: 1) avoidable ED visits decreased by 24%, 2) inpatient admissions decreased by
23%, 3) residential behavioral health / SUD hospital days decreased 18%.

Flexible Services Program: Summary of 2022 Progress
• The Flexible Services Program enables ACOs to provide nutritional and housing supports
to certain members, with the goal of improving overall member health and outcomes
• The Flexible Services Program was one of 2022’s key successes. In its third year, the
program continued to experience rapid and substantial growth, became more
efficient, and demonstrated promising early outcomes
• The Flexible Services Program grew faster in 2022 than in 2021, providing more
services to more members:
• Overall services* delivered more than doubled:
• 2021: 21,051
• 2022**: 51,281 (2022 total annualized: 41,024**)
• Unique members served increased by 60%
• 10,229 members served in 2021; 20,475 in 2022 (16,380 annualized**)
• Dollars spent on Flexible Services supports doubled
• $22.6M in 2021 to $52.4M ($41.9M annualized**) in 2022
• While Flexible Services remained a relatively nascent program in 2022, preliminary
analyses already began to show improvements for members with diabetes
(reductions in A1c) and total cost of care
*MassHealth defines Flexible Services in terms of member-quarters or number of quarters members have received services. A unique member that
received services across 4 quarters would count towards 4 services provided.
**The 2022 performance period encompasses five quarters (1/1/2022 – 3/31/2023) rather than the standard four quarters reported in prior years.

ACOs Partnered with SSOs to Offer 85 Flexible Services Programs in 2022
• In 2022, ACOs partnered with community-based Social Services Organizations (SSOs) to
offer 85 Flexible Services programs focused on nutrition and housing support services
and goods.
• Compared to 2021, both the number of available programs and partnerships between ACOs
and SSOs increased by approximately 12%.

Flexible Services: Early Promising Results
In 2022, individual SSOs were already seeing early improvements in health and social outcomes.
MassHealth continues to closely track results and evaluate if specific interventions/models are more
impactful than others.
SSO Highlight: Project Bread observed positive initial impacts on food security and fruit and vegetable
consumption based on their members served from October 1, 2021 – September 30, 2022. Their services
include nutrition education, food vouchers, coordination, and transportation.

• At the end of the six months of services:
• 91% of members reported an improved ability to prepare healthy meals
• 94% of members reported improvement in their health
• 87% of members reported an increase in their confidence of their nutrition knowledge
Note: different “N’s” result from variations in survey completeness for initial and 6-month assessments.
22

Flexible Services: Early Promising Results (Continued)
ACO Highlight: Boston Medical Center Healthnet Plan Community Alliance (BACO)
observed encouraging initial impacts on housing status based on their CY2022 members
served.
Housing Placement and Maintenance:
• BACO’s Housing Supports Program reported 76% of members successfully housed in their
programs (n=34).
• In further results from the above program, 95% of members maintained housing for one year after
placement (n=32).
Member Story: Positive Social Outcomes
A member facing various challenges regarding housing (e.g., in need of financial assistance and guided
support for the housing search process) was referred by BACO to a housing program. This program
successfully provided the member:
• Assistance with housing search and placement (e.g., applications submitted for subsidized
housing)
• Assistance with obtaining additional financial resources (e.g., applications for financial
assistance were submitted and approved for rental arrears and future rental stipends)
• Continued guidance and connection to community resources (e.g., referred into food delivery
program)

Community Partners: Summary of CP Progress through March 2023
• CPs contract with ACOs to provide wrap-around expertise and support for behavioral health (BH)
services and long-term services and supports (LTSS)
• The CP program, which ran from September 2018 to March 2023, continued to see positive trends in
utilization and cost measures, including:
• Data showed reductions in ED and BH inpatient utilization rates for members with longer
enrollment in the CP program.
• Risk-adjusted TCOC was 20% lower for BH CP members following graduation from the CP
program vs. members in the 12 months preceding enrollment
• However, these observed reductions may be confounded by overall utilization declines driven by
the pandemic and changes in the CP population over time.
• Despite lingering COVID-related challenges, CPs continued to make gains in member outreach and
engagement. During 2022, CPs:
• Served ~44,000 unique members
• Increased the annual engagement rate** of actively enrolled members from 53% to 58%
• Reduced the statewide average days to a complete care plan (a key indicator of successful
coordination with PCPs) from 176 to 152 days (14% reduction)

Overview of DSRIP Program
• The Delivery System Reform Incentive Payment (DSRIP) program was a $1.8 billion, five-year
investment program authorized through MassHealth’s 1115 demonstration to support MassHealth’s
restructuring efforts; 2022 was the last year of the DSRIP Program.
• ACOs and CPs used DSRIP funds to design and test innovative programs, with the expectation
that they measure those programs’ outcomes, and to stand up infrastructure required for
population health management
• In 2022* ACOs and CPs spent $209.1M in DSRIP funding:
• $121.4M by ACOs (Startup/Ongoing: $69M; and Flexible Services: $52.4M)**
• $87.7M by CPs (Infrastructure and Care Coordination)
• The most common type of DSRIP-funded ACO program in CY2022 was care coordination and care
management programs (113 programs costing $26M; e.g., embedding community health workers in
EDs to help members navigate the health care system and share resources upon ED departure)***
• From July 1, 2018 to March 31, 2023, ACOs and CPs cumulatively spent $1.2B in DSRIP funding:
• $794.8M by ACOs (Startup/Ongoing and Flexible Services)
• $377.1M by CPs (Infrastructure and Care Coordination)
• Additionally, $13.4M of DSRIP funding was used for Statewide Investments in 2022 to support
workforce development (training, hiring, retention), technical assistance for ACOs and CPs, and
related initiatives.
See Appendix for detailed DSRIP funding charts by ACO, CP, and Statewide Investments programs
*The 2022 performance period encompasses five quarters (1/1/2022 – 3/31/2023) rather than the standard four quarters
**Certain ACOs also received an additional $104.5M for safety net hospital (Delivery System Transformation Initiative) glide-path
funding from the beginning of DSRIP through 12/31/2022.

DSRIP Health-Related Social Needs Spending
One of MassHealth’s key priorities for its ACO program is to better address the health-
related socials needs (HRSNs) of its ACO-enrolled members. ACOs have two funding
sources available to address HRSNs:
• ACOs may use general DSRIP funds on investments such as
infrastructure, technology, and workforce in support of ACO goals,
and some ACOs have leveraged this funding to address HRSNs.

modifications, and nutrition supports, for certain ACO members.
Services
• The Flexible Services Program launched in January 2020.
• Details on Flexible Services spending and utilization can be found
on p. 18-23.
* ACOs and CPs made investments in housing stabilization and supports, nonmedical transportation, nutrition, investments that addressed multiple HRSNs, and IT investments that were
related to HRSNs. ACOs and CPs did not explicitly report making investments in utility assistance, physical activity, or sexual assault and domestic violence supports.
† It is likely that ACOs/CPs allocated more than this funding to HRSNs. For instance, many ACOs allocated funds to various care management programs, which likely provide some level of
support for a member’s health-related social needs. However, if the HRSN linkage was not explicitly stated in the ACO or CP budgets, the funding allocation tied to those programs was
not included in the total amounts referenced above.
**Flexible Services was launched in 2020; a sizeable portion of HRSN funding shifted over to that program and continued to shift in CY22.
***The decrease from CY21 to CY22 aligns with the overall decrease in DSRIP spending from CY21 to CY22. This amount is inclusive of spending in Q1 2023.

Overview of 2022 ACO and CP Quality Data and Performance
• The varying impact of the pandemic across ACO and CP quality measures, as well as the addition of
various COVID-based scoring modifications 2020-2022, makes the comparison of year over year
overall quality performance difficult.
• However, at a high-level, clinical quality performance improved for ACOs (73.90% vs. 85.25%) and
declined for CPs (69.84% vs. 64.40%) when comparing 2021 to 2022 performance.
• In 2022, of the measures that showed substantial declines in performance from 2019 to 2020, all
six ACO measures and all four CP measures demonstrated partial to full recovery from their
respective previous declines.
• Despite these improvements, some measures did not reach their pre-pandemic performance
levels or demonstrate improvement over 2021 performance.
• Member experience results were similar to 2020-2021, and demonstrated strong levels of
satisfaction with providers, and ongoing opportunities for increased care coordination
• Note: Quality results were not generated for the January – March 2023 time period as individual
measures and/or benchmarks are designed and tested based on a 12-month measurement period
*Note: Despite the ongoing PHE, MassHealth and CMS determined 2021 and 2022 data was usable for official quality
scoring. This is in contrast to 2020 when data was deemed unusable due to the pandemic. In response to concerns over the
pandemic’s impact on individual quality measures, MassHealth and CMS agreed to certain benchmark reductions for
ACO/CP measures demonstrating 2019-2020 performance declines. See the appendix for more details on benchmark
reductions and for the ACO and CP measure slates.

Clinical Quality: Overview of ACO and CP Performance 2019-2022
▪ ACO/CP clinical quality performance improved for ACOs (73.90% vs. 85.25%) and CPs (69.84% vs.
64.40%) when comparing 2021 performance data to 2022 performance data
▪ Improvements above reflect both measure level increases as well as benchmarks reductions implemented in
2021-2022. However, the expansion of measures in pay-for-performance status and differences in scoring
methodologies (as a result of COVID-19) place limitations on year-over-year comparisons

ACO Clinical Quality: 2022 Measures with Substantial Performance Drop
• In 2020, six ACO quality measures demonstrated substantial drops in performance from 2019 to
2020 (likely due to COVID) and were deemed priority measures for monitoring through 2022
• The table below demonstrates the percentage of initial performance drops in 2020 and the recovery
% by the end of 2022. In 2022, five measures demonstrated partial recovery from their initial
2019-2020 declines, and one measure demonstrated full recovery. However, three of those
measures (#s 1, 2, 4) had partially recovered in 2021 and remained stable in 2022.

Member Experience: Summary of 2019-2022 Results
• ACOs are accountable for performance on two member experience measures:*
1) Overall care delivery; and 2) Integration/ coordination of care
• These measures are based on results from a subset of questions in the primary care survey,
based on a nationally validated tool
• As in 2021, members in 2022 expressed strong levels of satisfaction with their providers, and
the need for increased coordination managing BH and other specialists and services
• As with 2019-2021 results, 2022 continues to identify opportunities for progress, especially in
the integration and coordination of BH care, and in the experience for the LTSS population

Overview of 2022 Cost Data and ACO Financial Performance
Overall spend
• In 2022, the ACO program accounted for $6.9B* of MassHealth spending, with an average annual total
cost of medical services per member of ~$5,800; when including Q1 2023, through the end of the ACO
contract, an additional ~$1.8B was spent for a total five-quarter period expense of $8.7B.
• ACO medical spend per member increased on average by approximately 2% from 2021 to 2022:
• Increase concentrated in child population; adult member per year spend was slightly higher
• Decreases in inpatient were offset by increases in pharmacy, outpatient, and other routine care
Financial Performance
• Most ACOs experienced financial gains in 2022
• ACPP/PCACOs were in 1.5%** profits (following market adjustment)
Variation in spend
• Among 13 ACPPs, profit/loss performance varied by up to ~14 percentage points across ACPPs after
applying adjustments
• Among 3 PCACOs, performance varied by up to ~2 percentage points across PCACOs after applying
adjustments
Continuation of New Pricing Policies: Market Adjustment
• In 2021, MassHealth implemented new pricing policies to adjust for changes that impacted the market
as a whole. Through these changes, MassHealth ensures that actual funding (i.e., the rate / benchmark)
is adjusted to meet actual costs for the ACO/MCO program overall while continuing to incentivize
individual ACOs to perform better than the market. The main changes included:
• Concurrent risk score adjustments which adjust for member acuity throughout the year
• Market corridor which applies a market-wide adjustment in instances of significant profits or
losses across all plans
**January – December 2021 & 2022 medical expenditures; includes all medical covered services (incl. maternity supplemental and HCD), and excludes ABA, CBHI, and
HCV. Excludes MCO-Administered ACOs. Total spend and PMPY figures are not directly comparable to estimates in previous annual reports
**The Market % profit/loss above will not tie out to the 2022 refresh market corridor report because the above data excludes MCO and PCC plans
52

Total Cost of Care: Comparison across 2021 & 2022
Both total spend and average per member per year spending increased compared to 2021, driven by the
child population. Adult member per year spend decreased slightly from 2021 to 2022.

Conclusion of 2017-2022 1115 Demonstration
Continued recovery from / response to the pandemic
• In the final year of the 2017-2022 1115 demonstration, ACOs, CPs, and MassHealth continued to address
the effects of the pandemic on MassHealth members and the healthcare workforce
• Efforts to re-engage members in care, ramp up home- and community-based services, continue
telehealth use as appropriate, promote BH access, and address workforce shortages continued to be
crucial.
Planning for the end of DSRIP funding
• 2022 marked the last full year for DSRIP funding to support ACO population health strategies as well as
funding for the CPs, Flexible Services, and Statewide Investments
• ACOs continued to iterate and refine their DSRIP spending and population health strategies as DSRIP
funding declined in the last year, requiring ACOs to continue to prioritize programs that demonstrated
success and sustainability
• MassHealth underwent a planning phase to review the successes and challenges of the 2017-2022
waiver, launched stakeholder meetings, and drafted the next 1115 demonstration proposal to continue to
invest in and build off of the reforms accomplished under the 2017-2022 demonstration
Building on successes for the 2022-2027 1115 demonstration
• In drafting the 2022-2027 1115 demonstration proposal, MassHealth took the most successful program
designs and best practices being tested under the 2017-2022 demonstration and incorporated them as
core, funded expectations for ACOs, CPs, and primary care practices in 2023 and beyond.
• Critical investment areas include:
• Enhanced care coordination by ACOs and CPs serving members with complex needs
• Increased resources to support health equity and health-related social needs along with critical
investments in strategic focus areas (e.g., maternal health, pediatrics)
• High-value MassHealth-serving primary care practices
• Additional information about MassHealth’s 2022 – 2027 1115 demonstration extension can be found at:

Context: What are MassHealth Accountable Care Organizations?
• ACOs are health care organizations that are rewarded for better health outcomes,
lower cost, and improved member experience
• ACOs are responsible for achieving these results through team-based care
coordination and integration of behavioral and physical health care; ACOs are also
responsible for taking a whole person view of their members, including LTSS and HRSN
• MassHealth members enrolled in an ACO select, or are assigned, a specific primary
care provider and have access to networks of specialty providers (e.g., hospitals,
specialists, BH providers) that participate in their plan
• ACOs assume upside and downside risk and are financially accountable for specific
quality measures
• ACOs represent a diverse range of provider systems:
• Hospital-based and community primary care-based ACOs
• Large, statewide and regional ACOs
• Provider-led and provider-health plan partnership ACOs
61

Context: What are MassHealth Community Partners?
• Community Partners (CPs) contract with ACOs to provide wrap-around
expertise and support for behavioral health (BH) services and long-term
services and supports (LTSS)
• CPs serve the most complex ACO members, with serious mental illness,
substance use disorders, co-occurring disorders, or disabilities that require
LTSS
• CPs are paid to engage these members and collaborate with the health care
system to coordinate and improve their care
• CPs are community-based organizations with expertise in supporting the
populations they serve
62

Context: What is the Delivery System Reform Incentive Payment (DSRIP)
Program?
• CMS authorized $1.8B in one-time DSRIP funding for upfront
investments in the delivery system.
• Funding is divided among 3 main streams over 5 years:
ACOs CPs Statewide
Investments
$1B $550M $115M
• ACOs and CPs use funding to launch innovative programs and
coordinate care for their members. Funding is tied to performance on
quality and the total cost of care
• $1B ACO allocation includes $149M allocated for Flexible Services
investments, which provide goods and services to address health-
related social needs. See p. 18-23 for more detail
• DSRIP funding is time limited and ends in Q1 2023

Quality Measure Benchmark Reductions due to COVID-19 PHE
Given concerns over the pandemic’s impact on quality measure performance, MassHealth and CMS
agreed to the following stepwise methodology for determining ACO and CP benchmark reductions
applicable to CY2021-2022 quality measure calculations
Step 1:
• Assess each measure for a drop in performance from CY2019 to CY2020
• Performance drop is determined by any negative change in median level performance across
ACOs/CPs
Step 2:
• For any measure with a performance drop identified in Step 1, adjust that measure’s CY2021
Attainment Threshold and Goal Benchmark to exactly match the median performance drop
Example:
• Measure: Childhood Immunization Status
• Attainment Threshold: 48.9%
• Goal Benchmark: 59.4%
• CY2019 Median Performance: 55.7%
• If the CY2020 ACO median performance drops by 4.1 points, then the Attainment Threshold and Goal
Benchmark would be adjusted to 44.8% and 55.3%, respectively.
Step 3:
• For measures with benchmark adjustments in Step 2, determine if those measures demonstrate a two-
thirds recovery in CY2021 as compared to the original CY2020-2021 performance drops.
• Measures demonstrating a two-thirds or greater recovery will have their original pre-COVID
benchmarks reinstated for CY2022
• Measures failing to demonstrate a two-thirds recovery will maintain their COVID benchmark
adjustments in CY2022 (as determine in Step 2)
73

How to Read the Quality Measure Charts on Upcoming Slides
Charts are shown that summarize key information about ACO quality
performance
• The median quality score per measure per year is represented by the bar chart
• This chart allows easy comparison of the median scores against the attainment threshold
and goal benchmark by lining these up (the red line and blue line, respectively); because
the attainment threshold and goal benchmark values actually vary from measure to
measure, lining them up like this requires the scale for each measure to vary as well
• Therefore, these charts show how the medians varied relative to the benchmarks, but
the bars are not to scale with each other and should not be used to determine the relative
performance between one measure and another
