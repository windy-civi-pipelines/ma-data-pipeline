Dear Chairs Rodrigues and Michlewitz,
Enclosed is the January, 2025, Resettlement Agency Report, submitted in compliance with item
4003-0123 of chapter 77 of the acts of 2023. That act, which became law in December of 2023,
appropriated $10 million for resettlement agencies (RAs) that resettle and support refugees and
immigrants under contract with the U.S. State Department. The money is authorized to be
expended by the RAs to “provide services to refugees and other displaced persons eligible for
[RA] services” and “to prevent families from entering the emergency shelter system.”
Eight resettlement agencies have been working under contract with the Office for Refugees and
Immigrants (ORI) since March, 2024. RAs and shelter providers are coordinating on rehousing
work with migrants in shelters and temporary respite centers.
In their contracts, RAs agreed to exit specific numbers of families by the end of December, 2024,
but none met those targets. This slow start reflected the difficulty of ramping up a new set of
services during a state emergency, under pressure of time, and in a tight housing market. ORI,
with support from Housing and Livable Communities, worked with RAs to address barriers to
success, and agreed to extend contracts for RAs that hit at least 10% of their target by the end of
November, 2024; all but one met this threshold. ORI is working with that one to wrap up the
contract.

Resettlement Agency Report
As of January, 2025
Chapter 77 of the acts of 2023, the final supplemental appropriations act for the state’s fiscal year
2023, appropriated $10 million in item 4003-0123 for resettlement agencies (RAs) that resettle
and support refugees and immigrants under contract with the U.S. State Department. The money
is authorized to be expended by the RAs to “provide services to refugees and other displaced
persons eligible for [RA] services” and “to prevent families from entering the emergency shelter
system.”
The $10 million in c. 77 supplemented $500,000 appropriated in the same item in the fiscal year
2024 budget. This $10.5 million, which goes to the same entities for the same purposes, is
addressed in combination in this report.
Chapter 77 requires that monthly reports to the House and Senate Committees on Ways and
Means detail the following information:
(i) a list of recipients of such funds; (ii) the amounts distributed to each recipient; (iii) the
number of immigrants and refugees served by each recipient, delineated by municipality;
(iv) a breakdown of the number of immigrants and refugees served by each recipient,
delineated by individuals: (a) currently residing in the emergency housing assistance
program under section 30 of chapter 23B of the General Laws; (b) who entered said
program as migrants, refugees or asylum seekers as a result of the ongoing humanitarian
crisis; and (c) who are currently on the waitlist for placement into said program; (v) a
breakdown of the number of immigrants and refugees served by each recipient who have
been resettled into long term housing other than the emergency shelter system; (vi) a
breakdown of the number of immigrants and refugees served by each recipient who are
currently awaiting federal work authorization versus the number of said immigrants and
refugees who have had their federal work authorization approved; and (vii) a list of all
municipalities served by each recipient of such funds
The status of these items is as follows:
(i) a list of recipients of such funds; (ii) the amounts distributed to each recipient;
Eight RAs have received funds through this item, covering eight geographic regions of the state.
ORI worked with the RAs to assess the number of refugees they serve, and to develop
expectations about the numbers of EA shelter families they can each commit to resettling by the
end of calendar year 2024.
In their contracts, RAs agreed to exit specific numbers of families by the end of December, but
none met those targets. ORI agreed to extend contracts for RAs that hit at least 10% of their
target by the end of November, 2024; all but one met this threshold. ORI is working with that
one to wrap up the contract.
Of the $10.5 million in authorized spending, $2.5 million was distributed to support each
recipients’ work with their identified caseload of refugees as of January of 2024, when the
contracts were negotiated. These funds are allocated in proportion to the January caseload.
The remaining $8.0 million is committed based on RA’s estimates of the numbers of families
they can rehouse by the end of the contract; half was distributed in an initial payment at the
commencement of the contract.
See Attachment 1 for more detail, which is current though January and has not changed since the
spring.
(iii) the number of immigrants and refugees served by each recipient, delineated by
municipality;
See Attachment 2 for number of immigrants and refugees served by each recipient, delineated by
municipality.
(iv) a breakdown of the number of immigrants and refugees served by each recipient,
delineated by individuals: (a) currently residing in the emergency housing assistance
program under section 30 of chapter 23B of the General Laws; (b) who entered said
program as migrants, refugees or asylum seekers as a result of the ongoing humanitarian
crisis; and (c) who are currently on the waitlist for placement into said program;
All people served through these contracts are residing in shelters, or were in shelter and
subsequently exited, and all of them entered the program as migrants, refugees or asylum seekers
as a result of the ongoing humanitarian crisis. Therefore, the only difference between category
(a) and (b) is whether they are currently still in shelter (a), versus were in shelter, were placed in
permanent housing, and continue to receive stabilization services (b but not a).
No one served by these contracts is in category (c) (waitlisted for shelter). Data below is as of
January 31, 2025:

(v) a breakdown of the number of immigrants and refugees served by each recipient who
have been resettled into long term housing other than the emergency shelter system;
As of the end of January, a total of 146 immigrants and refugee families have been resettled into
long-term housing through the efforts of the RAs funded through this appropriation, while 17
additional families have signed leases and appear poised to move (for a total of 163 signed
leases). Please note that this number is not the total for refugees and immigrants resettled out of
shelters, but narrowly those resettled through this program.
(vi) a breakdown of the number of immigrants and refugees served by each recipient who
are currently awaiting federal work authorization versus the number of said immigrants
and refugees who have had their federal work authorization approved; and
RAs have approximately 711 “enrolled” adults with whom they are actively working. Within
this active caseload, as of January 31, the breakdown is as follows:
