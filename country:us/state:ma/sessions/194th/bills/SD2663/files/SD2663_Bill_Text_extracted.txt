Re: Plan of Correction – Worcester County House of Corrections and Jail, West Boylston
Dear Superintendent Rives:
The Massachusetts Department of Public Health, Division of Environmental Health Regulations and Standards (EHRS)
has received your Plan of Correction in response to my inspection on November 18, 2024. After review, the EHRS finds
the plan addresses all the deficiencies noted in the report with the following exceptions:
• In areas your facility was cited for the inability of cell windows to open and close, your Plan of Correction (POC)
states “Renovation Plan awaiting DCAMM Funding”. While the EHRS understands you do not have control over
DCAMM’s allotment of funds, we remain concerned with these areas and would ask to be kept apprised of the
DCAMM funding progress. In addition, the EHRS asks that you provide a plan describing the interim measures
you have implemented to ensure the health and safety of inmates and staff in said areas.
• In regards to the issue of cell size, the EHRS appreciates the limitations of correctional facilities and the need to
accommodate the ever-increasing population; however we remain concerned with the inadequate cell size.
Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter, should you have any questions please contact me at the address listed
above.
Sincerely,
Cory J. Holmes
Senior Advisor, EHRS, BCEH

Re: Plan of Correction – Worcester County House of Corrections and Jail, West Boylston
Dear Superintendent Rives:
The Massachusetts Department of Public Health, Division of Environmental Health Regulations and Standards (EHRS)
has received your Plan of Correction in response to my inspection on November 18, 2024. After review, the EHRS finds
the plan addresses all the deficiencies noted in the report with the following exceptions:
• In areas your facility was cited for the inability of cell windows to open and close, your Plan of Correction (POC)
states “Renovation Plan awaiting DCAMM Funding”. While the EHRS understands you do not have control over
DCAMM’s allotment of funds, we remain concerned with these areas and would ask to be kept apprised of the
DCAMM funding progress. In addition, the EHRS asks that you provide a plan describing the interim measures
you have implemented to ensure the health and safety of inmates and staff in said areas.
• In regards to the issue of cell size, the EHRS appreciates the limitations of correctional facilities and the need to
accommodate the ever-increasing population; however we remain concerned with the inadequate cell size.
Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter, should you have any questions please contact me at the address listed
above.
Sincerely,
Cory J. Holmes
Senior Advisor, EHRS, BCEH
