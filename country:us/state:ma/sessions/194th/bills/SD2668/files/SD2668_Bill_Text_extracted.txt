Legislative Mandate
The following annual report is hereby issued pursuant to Section 2RRRR of Chapter 29 of the
Massachusetts General Laws:

Section 2:
Section 2RRRR. (a) There shall be a Municipal Naloxone Bulk Purchase Trust Fund to be administered and
expended by the commissioner of public health or a designee for the municipal naloxone bulk purchase
program. Municipalities may join the program to purchase naloxone for municipal first responder
agencies. The State Office of Pharmacy Services shall assist with the purchasing and distribution of
naloxone on behalf of the program. The department of public health shall provide technical assistance to
participating municipalities to ensure that municipalities complete all training and registration
requirements.
(b) The fund shall consist of: (i) payments made by participating municipalities for the purchase of
naloxone; (ii) revenue from appropriations or other monies authorized by the general court and specifically
designated to be credited to the fund; and (iii) funds from public or private sources, including, but not
limited to, gifts, grants, donations, rebates and settlements received by the commonwealth that are
specifically designated to be credited to the fund. Funds received under clauses (ii) or (iii) shall be
apportioned in a manner determined by the department and shall be applied to provide price reductions
for municipalities purchasing naloxone through the program. Amounts credited to the fund shall not be
subject to further appropriation and monies remaining in the fund at the end of a fiscal year shall not
revert to the General Fund. The commissioner shall report annually not later than October 1 to the house
and senate committees on ways and means on the fund's activity. The report shall include, but not be
limited to, revenue received by the fund, revenue and expenditure projections for the forthcoming fiscal
year and details of all expenditures from the fund, the municipalities participating in the program, the
amount of naloxone purchased by each municipality and the discount procured through bulk purchasing.

Background
In 2015, the Legislature established the Municipal Naloxone Bulk Purchasing program, which
allows municipalities to purchase naloxone for municipal first responder agencies at a
discounted rate. Naloxone, a medication used to reverse the effects of opioids, including
heroin, is used across the Commonwealth by first responders. Municipalities have seen a
significant increase in cost and demand since the beginning of the opioid epidemic.
The State Office for Pharmacy Services (SOPS) is the Department of Public Health (DPH) office
responsible for managing the bulk purchase program. SOPS receives requests directly from
municipalities, purchases the naloxone on their behalf, ships and invoices directly. SOPS
manages the funds received from the cities and towns, reorders and maintains inventory to
achieve the best price possible.
Through the FY16 budget, a Trust Fund was established to accept: (i) payments made by
participating municipalities for the purchase of Naloxone; (ii) revenue from appropriations or
other monies authorized by the general court and specifically designated to be credited to the
fund; and (iii) funds from public or private sources, including, but not limited to, gifts, grants,
donations, rebates and settlements received by the Commonwealth that are specifically
designated to be credited to the fund.
In FY19, new legislative language provided for the Bureau of Substance Addiction Services
(BSAS) contracted agencies to purchase naloxone at the public interest price and county
sheriff’s departments to purchase naloxone at the discounted first responder cost.
At the end of FY21 and throughout FY22, SOPS assisted BSAS in providing naloxone to Opioid
Treatment Programs (OTP) throughout the state. Additionally, in April FY22, BSAS provided
SOPS further funding to fully cover the cost of naloxone for all end users of the bulk purchasing
program – first responders, schools, health departments, sheriff’s offices and other agencies.
For FY23, SOPS continued to support BSAS locations that joined the Community Naloxone
Program (CNP) and Harm Reduction sites in managing requests, shipping and ordering
Naloxone products. In FY23, BSAS was able to fully fund Naloxone requests for SOPS end users
– first responders, schools, health departments, sheriff’s offices. As a result, expenses and
revenues for the Trust Fund were significantly reduced.
Due to generic competition, SOPS was able to leverage the cost of naloxone between
manufacturers. In July of 2021, the cost of a box (2 sprays) was $70.76. SOPS was able to
reduce the cost to $66.89 by the end of January 2022 and then further reduced it to $63.67 by
the end of March 2022. SOPS continued to work with Emergent Biosciences to obtain better
4
pricing for Narcan and in July 2022, the cost went down to $44.81 resulting in cost avoidance of
$3,267,221.76 on 147,972 boxes purchased.
In FY24, SOPS continued to support the BSAS Naloxone distribution programs – Community
Naloxone Program (CNP) and Harm Reduction sites, as well as providing product for first
responders, schools, sheriff’s offices and other state agencies. Most city and town health
departments joined CNP. All of the product distributed was fully subsidized with the exception
of a small number of sites choosing to purchase with grant funds, public entities that are not
first responders but are able to acquire at public interest cost or CNP sites also choosing to
obtain at public interest cost.
SOPS was able to achieve two more Narcan price reductions during FY24. Beginning in
September 2023, the price changed for a box of two sprays from $44.81 (22.41 per dose) to
$38.69 (19.35 per dose). Then on May 15, 2024, SOPS was able to have the cost decreased
further to $31.12 (15.56 per dose). The first decrease resulted in cost avoidance of $905,969.28
for 147,552 boxes (295,104 doses) purchased and the second decrease resulted in cost
avoidance of $193,852.56 for 25,608 boxes (51,126 doses) purchased during the last 45 days of
FY24.

Revenue Received by the Fund
During FY24, total payments received from 30 orders was $219,053.65. There were 332 orders
shipped representing 147 municipal police and fire departments, 1 board of health, 30 schools
or school districts, 8 colleges, 2 county sheriff’s department, Department of Mental Health (DMH)
group homes, MA Dept of transitional Assistance, MBTA, Attorney General’s Office, Dept of Fire
Services, Environmental Police, Parole Board, Trial Court and Norfolk County DA Office.

FY25 Forecast
Over the past decade, several new products have become available for opioid-related overdose
reversal, including multiple high-dose and long-acting overdose reversal agents, also referred to
as opioid antagonists. While these products have been tested in clinical trials and may be
approved by FDA for use in reversing opioid-related overdoses, the medical literature and clinical
experience confirm that these agents are more likely to precipitate withdrawal, which can in turn
increase mistrust and foster avoidance of future use of opioid antagonists among people who
use drugs
SOPS will continue to provide Naloxone products to municipalities at a significantly discounted
cost. SOPS has been successful in lowering the cost of Narcan spray and will continue to pursue
opportunities to further reduce costs.

Purchase Trust Fund
Annual Report

Legislative Mandate
The following annual report is hereby issued pursuant to Section 2RRRR of Chapter 29 of the
Massachusetts General Laws:
Section 2RRRR. (a) There shall be a Municipal Naloxone Bulk Purchase Trust Fund to be administered and
expended by the commissioner of public health or a designee for the municipal naloxone bulk purchase
program. Municipalities may join the program to purchase naloxone for municipal first responder
agencies. The State Office of Pharmacy Services shall assist with the purchasing and distribution of
naloxone on behalf of the program. The department of public health shall provide technical assistance to
participating municipalities to ensure that municipalities complete all training and registration
requirements.
(b) The fund shall consist of: (i) payments made by participating municipalities for the purchase of
naloxone; (ii) revenue from appropriations or other monies authorized by the general court and specifically
designated to be credited to the fund; and (iii) funds from public or private sources, including, but not
limited to, gifts, grants, donations, rebates and settlements received by the commonwealth that are
specifically designated to be credited to the fund. Funds received under clauses (ii) or (iii) shall be
apportioned in a manner determined by the department and shall be applied to provide price reductions
for municipalities purchasing naloxone through the program. Amounts credited to the fund shall not be
subject to further appropriation and monies remaining in the fund at the end of a fiscal year shall not
revert to the General Fund. The commissioner shall report annually not later than October 1 to the house
and senate committees on ways and means on the fund's activity. The report shall include, but not be
limited to, revenue received by the fund, revenue and expenditure projections for the forthcoming fiscal
year and details of all expenditures from the fund, the municipalities participating in the program, the
amount of naloxone purchased by each municipality and the discount procured through bulk purchasing.

Background
In 2015, the Legislature established the Municipal Naloxone Bulk Purchasing program, which
allows municipalities to purchase naloxone for municipal first responder agencies at a
discounted rate. Naloxone, a medication used to reverse the effects of opioids, including
heroin, is used across the Commonwealth by first responders. Municipalities have seen a
significant increase in cost and demand since the beginning of the opioid epidemic.
The State Office for Pharmacy Services (SOPS) is the Department of Public Health (DPH) office
responsible for managing the bulk purchase program. SOPS receives requests directly from
municipalities, purchases the naloxone on their behalf, ships and invoices directly. SOPS
manages the funds received from the cities and towns, reorders and maintains inventory to
achieve the best price possible.
Through the FY16 budget, a Trust Fund was established to accept: (i) payments made by
participating municipalities for the purchase of Naloxone; (ii) revenue from appropriations or
other monies authorized by the general court and specifically designated to be credited to the
fund; and (iii) funds from public or private sources, including, but not limited to, gifts, grants,
donations, rebates and settlements received by the Commonwealth that are specifically
designated to be credited to the fund.
In FY19, new legislative language provided for the Bureau of Substance Addiction Services
(BSAS) contracted agencies to purchase naloxone at the public interest price and county
sheriff’s departments to purchase naloxone at the discounted first responder cost.
At the end of FY21 and throughout FY22, SOPS assisted BSAS in providing naloxone to Opioid
Treatment Programs (OTP) throughout the state. Additionally, in April FY22, BSAS provided
SOPS further funding to fully cover the cost of naloxone for all end users of the bulk purchasing
program – first responders, schools, health departments, sheriff’s offices and other agencies.
For FY23, SOPS continued to support BSAS locations that joined the Community Naloxone
Program (CNP) and Harm Reduction sites in managing requests, shipping and ordering
Naloxone products. In FY23, BSAS was able to fully fund Naloxone requests for SOPS end users
– first responders, schools, health departments, sheriff’s offices. As a result, expenses and
revenues for the Trust Fund were significantly reduced.
Due to generic competition, SOPS was able to leverage the cost of naloxone between
manufacturers. In July of 2021, the cost of a box (2 sprays) was $70.76. SOPS was able to
reduce the cost to $66.89 by the end of January 2022 and then further reduced it to $63.67 by
the end of March 2022. SOPS continued to work with Emergent Biosciences to obtain better
4

pricing for Narcan and in July 2022, the cost went down to $44.81 resulting in cost avoidance of
$3,267,221.76 on 147,972 boxes purchased.
In FY24, SOPS continued to support the BSAS Naloxone distribution programs – Community
Naloxone Program (CNP) and Harm Reduction sites, as well as providing product for first
responders, schools, sheriff’s offices and other state agencies. Most city and town health
departments joined CNP. All of the product distributed was fully subsidized with the exception
of a small number of sites choosing to purchase with grant funds, public entities that are not
first responders but are able to acquire at public interest cost or CNP sites also choosing to
obtain at public interest cost.
SOPS was able to achieve two more Narcan price reductions during FY24. Beginning in
September 2023, the price changed for a box of two sprays from $44.81 (22.41 per dose) to
$38.69 (19.35 per dose). Then on May 15, 2024, SOPS was able to have the cost decreased
further to $31.12 (15.56 per dose). The first decrease resulted in cost avoidance of $905,969.28
for 147,552 boxes (295,104 doses) purchased and the second decrease resulted in cost
avoidance of $193,852.56 for 25,608 boxes (51,126 doses) purchased during the last 45 days of
FY24.

During FY24, total payments received from 30 orders was $219,053.65. There were 332 orders

or school districts, 8 colleges, 2 county sheriff’s department, Department of Mental Health (DMH)
group homes, MA Dept of transitional Assistance, MBTA, Attorney General’s Office, Dept of Fire

FY25 Forecast
Over the past decade, several new products have become available for opioid-related overdose
reversal, including multiple high-dose and long-acting overdose reversal agents, also referred to
as opioid antagonists. While these products have been tested in clinical trials and may be
approved by FDA for use in reversing opioid-related overdoses, the medical literature and clinical
experience confirm that these agents are more likely to precipitate withdrawal, which can in turn
increase mistrust and foster avoidance of future use of opioid antagonists among people who
use drugs
SOPS will continue to provide Naloxone products to municipalities at a significantly discounted
cost. SOPS has been successful in lowering the cost of Narcan spray and will continue to pursue
opportunities to further reduce costs.
