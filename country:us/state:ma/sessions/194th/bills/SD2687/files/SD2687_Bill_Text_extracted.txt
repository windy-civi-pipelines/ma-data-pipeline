Introduction
As the lead enterprise technology organization for the Commonwealth, EOTSS is committed to
modernizing state-owned IT systems and services, strengthening the Commonwealth’s cybersecurity
posture, and improving the constituent digital-government experience.
EOTSS’s enterprise approach is at the heart of how the Commonwealth approaches IT modernization,
cybersecurity, and the delivery of accessible digital services. By leveraging this enterprise approach, the
cost advantages achieved by more efficient operations offer greater economies of scale.
We thank our colleagues in the Legislature for their continued leadership and investment in the
Commonwealth’s technology and cybersecurity needs. We look forward to continued dialogue with the
Legislature as we navigate the challenges ahead, in furtherance of our mission to provide IT leadership
along with secure, quality digital information, services, technology and tools across the enterprise.
Savings, Efficiencies in Sharing Resources, and Additional Expenses through
Consolidation
Contract Management
To successfully undertake multiple transformational IT projects while also ensuring they each meet the
requisite security measures, oversight, and cost accounting, methodical contract management is
critical.
The Contract Management unit provides contract review and contract negotiation services on large-
scale projects across the Commonwealth at the direction of the Secretary. To date, our Contract
Management Office has negotiated and established highly discounted enterprise volume license
agreements with several major software providers, resulting in millions of dollars of annual savings for
the Commonwealth (e.g. license costs, maintenance, and cost avoidance for deployment).The cost
avoidance gained in mandating standard data security terms and maintaining up-to-date software
systems can be measured against the potential damages of a security breach or system failures due to
unsupported or compromised software. By negotiating Master Services Agreements (MSA) that can be
used by other agencies within the Executive Branch, EOTSS has saved considerable administrative and
legal work for other agencies - as well as our bidders and vendors - in preparing bid responses and
negotiating contracts. For example, a Business Associate Agreement for HIPAA data negotiated once at
the MSA level applies to any purchases by HIPAA-covered entities within the Commonwealth. While it is
hard to quantify the hours saved, agencies find value in the existence of a fully negotiated agreement to
use. This in turn allows agencies to deliver services and software for use by their constituents and/or
employees in a more time effective manner and with robust privacy and security protections.
IT Investment Advisory Board
We are grateful to the full Legislature for its continued leadership and support of both the EOTSS
operating budget and IT capital authorizations. In particular, IT capital funding is critical for new
investments and the replacement of outdated legacy IT infrastructure and systems.
Understanding the critical nature of these IT capital needs, last year the Legislature passed the
FutureTech Act, a five-year bond authorization that was signed by the Governor in July 2024. We deeply
appreciate the legislature’s pivotal work to ensure the modernization of our state’s IT capital,
cybersecurity capabilities and support for IT capital strategic initiatives across the state government
enterprise.
The need for IT project funding is significant. In any given year, we receive twice as many requests for
funding than we can provide. To select which projects move forward, a Board judiciously reviews
proposals to determine their affordability and feasibility.
EOTSS chairs the IT Investment Advisory Board through its Office of Capital Planning to oversee the IT
capital investment portfolio and program management. Composed of executives across the
Commonwealth with expertise in overseeing large, complex IT portfolios, the Board strategically
approves capital projects that improve the delivery of government services, taking into consideration
the project’s risk and respecting the investment of taxpayer dollars. The governance around capital
spending is well-developed, with clear protocols and methods for evaluating capital requests, and
collaboration among the board to ensure that IT investments align with IT priorities.
Once a capital project is approved by the Board, the project performance is evaluated throughout its
lifecycle. Similar to contract management, common missteps can be avoided if personnel are dedicated
to guide complex projects. If a project performance is undesirable, the EOTSS Capital Planning office
may request a project health check. As a result of this well-developed capital investment process,
projects stay on track, on time, and remain sound investments.

EOTSS values transparency, and we believe the IIAB, combined with our project management expertise,
is a successful check to the trust placed in us through these bond authorizations.
Cloud Computing
EOTSS continues to collaborate with agency leaders and business application managers to make further
progress in migrating critical legacy Commonwealth applications and systems to cloud-hosted services
and other EOTSS-approved hosting options included in our Standard Operating Environment (SOE)
framework. Cloud migrations and the move to modern hosting solutions are vital tools in the
government’s ability to ensure critical business applications that power important government services
remain accessible and resilient.
All migrations are handled through a “cloud smart” approach, where EOTSS works with agencies to gain
a full understanding of their business needs while ensuring the continuity of those government services
to avoid any adverse effects for the constituents that rely on them. Outside of Massachusetts, we are
seen as a leader in the space of cloud hosting. Last year, Amazon Web Services (AWS) awarded
Massachusetts with the AWS State and Local Government Champions award for our innovative use of
AWS Cloud technologies in a way that had a positive impact on state services and citizen engagement.
We continue to work with our agency partners to identify and prioritize opportunities for further cloud
migrations and hosting opportunities. Failure of government IT systems are costly, both in terms of a
temporary inability for constituents to access vital government services and also potential costs
associated with needed data recovery. Cloud migrations can be viewed as a cost avoidance initiative for
the Commonwealth and investments in the continuity of government operations and improvements to
the constituent digital experience.
Compatibility and Interoperability of Agency Systems to Consolidate Relevant Data
Between Agencies
Guided by the vision that data should be a key driver for process, policy and decision-making in the
Commonwealth, the EOTSS Data Office has some ambitious and exciting goals set for 2025.
In the last year we established the Enterprise Data Analytics program to improve the
constituent experience by allowing decision-makers in every Secretariat to access accurate, timely, and
easy-to-digest data to support the evaluation, analysis, and continuous improvement of Commonwealth
policies and operations. The program is underpinned by a strong, clear data governance framework that
ensures the security and reliability of state data when it is being created, stored, and shared between
agencies.
We recognize that the importance of measuring and reporting on policy outcomes has never been
higher. Building an analytics program that focuses on the constituent and how our processes, services,
and policy impact them is essential. Outcomes rarely are self-contained within one agency, and
establishing formal processes for both sharing and reporting upon these outcomes is the mission of our
data and analytics program.
Providing data governance standards and processes for all secretariats to adhere to, the Data Analytics
program has been boosted by the continued maturity of the Data Leadership Council, comprised of data
experts across the Executive Branch, with the goal of aligning our data vision across the enterprise. The
3 | Page
Data Leadership Council is also actively engaged in efforts to evaluate the current statewide data-
sharing framework and make iterative improvements to ease the safe, secure integration and use of
data across state agencies to improve the delivery of state services to residents.
Massachusetts Data Hub
The EOTSS Data Office continues to build on the success of the user-friendly Massachusetts Data Hub
tool to connect researchers and members of the public to data and reports published by Massachusetts
state agencies. The tool not only allows users to search state resources and data by topic or keyword
and aggregates state agency-published data and web pages; it also organizes content around topics that
cut across multiple secretariats, making data easier to find by the general public.
The Commonwealth's Data Hub remained a highly visited resource for the public, ranking in the top 1%
of mass.gov visits over the past year. In 2024, EOTSS expanded the Data Hub's capabilities by
introducing "Sub Hubs," offering a centralized gateway to agency-specific data portals across the
Commonwealth.
This year EOTSS fully integrated the MassGIS data hub into the main Data Hub user menu. The MassGIS
Data Hub serves as a "front door" where users can go to search for public geospatial data services from
MassGIS and other organizations across the Commonwealth. Anyone can search the Hub for data of
interest by entering keywords, or by browsing featured content or data categories, with options for
viewing the items in maps and downloading the data in several formats.
The Massachusetts Data Hub reflects the Commonwealth’s commitment to sharing data transparently
and openly to better serve the Commonwealth’s residents, businesses, and visitors. We are continually
iterating on the success of the Data Hub to integrate more state sources of publicly available data and
improve the user experience.
Commonwealth Information Warehouse (CIW)
The Commonwealth Information Warehouse (CIW) brings together enterprise financial, budget, time
and labor, human resources, and payroll data that is maintained in separate source applications run by
independent agencies. This year we plan to migrate the CIW from Redshift to Snowflake, for better
integration with the enterprise user environment. The CIW provides query assistance to over 2,000
Commonwealth employee users. Since the modernization has been completed, millions of queries have
been successfully executed with an average run time of approximately 2 seconds.
Thanks to this year’s planned Snowflake migration and integration in the EOTSS data analytics program,
we will improve the availability and reporting capabilities of finance and human resources data for all
state agencies. Additional benefits will be realized through this migration will include cost savings, data
sharing across agencies, user environment modernization and standardization, and operating
efficiencies.
Executive Branch IT Personnel
EOTSS remains dedicated to its legislative mandate to consolidate IT personnel under its statutory
authority. EOTSS continues to make strategic and targeted consolidation efforts that achieve efficiencies
across the Commonwealth while prioritizing the continuity of vital government service operations for
the constituents that rely on them. In calendar year 2025 we intend to make significant progress
4 | Page
consolidating Network and Telecom staff and service management to EOTSS from at least one of the
three remaining, non-consolidated secretariats, and continue our progress toward full executive branch
IT staff consolidation.
The following chart shows the number of IT personnel who support IT infrastructure and business
applications within each executive office as of February 2025:

Status of Centralization of Infrastructure, Network, and Cloud Hosting
Cloud Hosting
EOTSS works closely with the Secretariat Chief Information Officers (SCIOs) and business application
owners at Executive Branch secretariats to best understand their business needs and prepare for lift and
shift, lift and optimize, and complete re-platform transformations of Commonwealth systems to the
cloud to ensure continuity of those government services.
Cloud migrations and hosting benefit from improved cybersecurity through more routine backups, high
availability, resiliency, fewer individual points of failure, and specialized security capabilities. Utilizing
the Cloud also offers improved environmental resiliency, as the consolidated hosting footprint allows for
green energy usage, lower electricity consumption, and lower carbon emissions than maintaining
several traditional on-premises data centers.
5 | Page
Since 2017, EOTSS has coordinated the migration of over 500 Commonwealth applications and
platforms to the cloud services hosting model. Over the past year, EOTSS collaborated with our agency
partners to complete the successful migration of several key Commonwealth applications. This effort
has allowed us to decommission 117 outdated physical servers and remove 20 racks from MITC data
center. We are continuing progress toward reducing the application, server and rack footprint in EOTSS’
Chelsea data center.
Network and Infrastructure
As EOTSS promotes information sharing and privacy, a key component of that playbook is to deploy
hardware, software, and tools that promote data security, collaboration, and mobility – all vital in the
continuity of government services. EOTSS is committed to operational excellence and efficiency through
the centralized management of information technology standards, infrastructure, and service delivery.
Throughout 2025, EOTSS will also continue with its consolidation of executive office information and
technology services, bringing the benefit of standardization and economy of scale to purchasing and
service delivery.
While some Executive Branch entities still operate distinct data centers and networks, EOTSS is working
to transfer that infrastructure to the center through the One Network program. Enterprise Information
Security policies and standards are published for the entire executive branch and any other agencies
that rely on EOTSS services. Any executive office maintaining a separate environment from EOTSS must
adhere to those security policies and standards. Through the Enterprise Risk Management office, EOTSS
reviews and updates those critical policies and standards on an annual basis.
Cybersecurity
Security Operations Center
The security of the Commonwealth’s IT infrastructure, networks, and data remains a top priority.
Through the support of trusted vendors, the unified Commonwealth Security Operations Center, or SOC,
continues to expand its capacity and service offerings to monitor, alert, respond to, and mitigate
cybersecurity threats across the Executive Branch. Guided by the Enterprise Security Incident Reporting
and Response Framework, the SOC receives all incidents reported by executive branch agencies, and can
receive reports from municipalities and independent agencies as another layer of security awareness
that is mutually beneficial. In addition to the Incident Reporting and Response Framework, EOTSS
maintains the publication of other security policies, standards, guidelines, and administrative directives
as part of the Standard Operating Environment (SOE), including end-user hardware and software
standards.
Enterprise Risk Management Program
The Commonwealth’s Chief Risk Officer and Chief Information Security Officer works with the Chief
Information Security Officer (CISO) Council, a peer-to-peer network of risk and security professionals
comprised of representatives from the Executive Branch, Judiciary, Constitutional Officers, and
Independent Agencies. Vulnerabilities are regularly identified by the Commonwealth SOC and then fed
into the CISO Council to remediate through a vulnerability management lifecycle program. Last year
EOTSS set an aggressive goal to reduce critical vulnerabilities from the July 2023 baseline and
successfully reduced such vulnerabilities by 41% (15284 to 9055) while increasing the sample size (total
6 | Page
scanned assets increased by 16% from the baseline during this time). EOTSS’ mitigation velocity, the
number of vulnerabilities eliminated within 30 days, increased by 297% when comparing January 2024
to January 2025.
EOTSS also frequently engages with cybersecurity stakeholders across all levels of government to both
lead and participate in cybersecurity tabletop exercises that simulate ‘real world’ security events with
agency and secretariat business users, the vendor community, municipalities, and our state partners.
In a nation-leading effort to enhance the Commonwealth’s ability to prepare for, respond to, mitigate
against, and recover from significant cybersecurity incidents, the Massachusetts Cyber Incident
Response Team (MA-CIRT) was established in December 2022. Comprised of members from across
EOTSS and the Executive Office of Public Safety and Security, the MA-CIRT ensures the continuity of
government and government services, public safety, public health, economic security, and the risk of
any loss of public confidence potentially resulting from significant cybersecurity incidents.
The MA-CIRT has developed and maintains a Cyber Incident Response Plan for the
Commonwealth. Tested through several tabletop exercises each year, the Cyber Incident Response Plan
ensures that the Commonwealth’s leadership is informed of ongoing and pending cybersecurity
incidents or threats and guides the deployment of resources to rapidly respond to and minimize the
impact of significant cybersecurity threats. The collaboration built between technology and public safety
experts is a unique – and effective - model in the nation.
Third-party vendor risk remains a potential threat to the Commonwealth. Accordingly, our Office of
Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) is now requiring cloud service providers to respond to an
information security risk assessment as part of its Vendor Risk Management program. This program is
overseen in coordination with our Procurement and Contract Management teams.
The Application Security Center of Excellence was created to evaluate the security of software and
applications purchased and renewed across the Executive Branch and aligns with the ERM’s vendor risk
management program. The security risk assessments include static and dynamic code analysis and
penetration testing. These investments are designed to enhance the Commonwealth’s security posture
by mitigating third-party risk.
Privacy Program
Protecting the Commonwealth’s data is of paramount importance to EOTSS. To that end, our Privacy
Office has been using a Privacy Impact Assessment, or “PIA,” to facilitate the identification and
resolution of data protection and privacy concerns to address the growing threat of data breaches and
the risk to Commonwealth and constituent data. The Privacy Office has been overseeing a pilot program
in collaboration with our risk and security teams to assess privacy risks during the contracting and
development stages using this new PIA tool. This program allows the Privacy Office to assess privacy
risks for new contracts and projects and develop mitigation strategies to protect Commonwealth data.
We continue to engage with state agency partners to promote data privacy within state
government. The Commonwealth Chief Privacy Officer leads an Enterprise Privacy Council consisting of
privacy and legal experts from across state government to meet on a monthly basis with the goal of
information sharing and building our privacy maturity. The Privacy Office, in collaboration with the
Council, has developed a privacy policy designed to set baseline standards for privacy protection across
7 | Page
the Commonwealth and fill in the gaps within the existing statutory framework. The Privacy Office has
also developed an AI Policy to standardize AI use in the Commonwealth with the goal of promoting
innovation while setting necessary guardrails to address privacy and legal risks. To complement this
effort, last year EOTSS established the AI Center of Excellence, one function of which is to continually
iterate on these frameworks, mitigate risk, and provide legal leadership to state government to ensure
continued understanding and compliance with evolving federal and state guidance on AI frameworks.
State Cybersecurity Awareness Training
The Commonwealth provides cybersecurity end-user awareness training to all Commonwealth Executive
Branch employees to ensure they are equipped with the knowledge to remain vigilant and avoid falling
prey to potential cyber threats. By training our workforce, we essentially expand the number of the
Commonwealth’s cybersecurity team from a couple dozen to tens of thousands of employees. EOTSS
supplements its cybersecurity training with enterprise phishing simulation exercises to gain a better
understanding of the Commonwealth’s endpoint vulnerabilities and to enhance its training materials.
With the issuance of Executive Order 602 establishing the Massachusetts Cyber Incident Response Team
(MA-CIRT), all executive department personnel are required to complete the EOTSS-approved security
awareness training program administered by the Human Resources Division (HRD). In collaboration with
HRD and secretariat leadership, EOTSS ensures that employees remain in full compliance with this
mandate. Annual security training is complemented by monthly phishing exercises to all employees to
simulate real phishing emails, essentially turning the state workforce into a team of cybersecurity
analysts.
Municipal Cybersecurity Resources
In addition to the Commonwealth’s workforce, EOTSS supports opportunities to assist our partners in
municipal government. EOTSS’ Office of Municipal and School Technology (OMST) oversees the
municipal cybersecurity training program, which has grown each year since its inception. Now in its sixth
year, the program is being accessed by over 100,000 employees from over 200 municipalities and public
school districts. Participants will receive cybersecurity awareness training to better detect and avoid
cyber threats. The program provides much-needed cost avoidance for municipal organizations by
utilizing the state’s purchasing power to procure this training on behalf of municipal organizations.
Coupled with the Community Compact IT Grant Program; the OMST’s no-cost Cybersecurity Health
Check Program; cyber health services, scanning and penetration testing provided by the Massachusetts
State Police Commonwealth Fusion Center; and the MassCyberCenter’s planning guidance, the
Administration offers our partners in municipal government with multiple no-cost resources to shore up
their cybersecurity capabilities.
State and Local Cybersecurity Grant Program
In 2021, the federal government and Congress made a monumental statement by including $1 billion for
a State and Local Cybersecurity Grant Program in the bi-partisan infrastructure bill. This four-year
program will provide states across the country with vital resources to improve their cyber defenses. The
passage of this first-of-its-kind cybersecurity grant program is a clear indication that Congress recognizes
the increasing threat that municipal governments face from cyber threats.
8 | Page
In 2022, EOTSS engaged with the Executive Office of Public Safety and Security (EOPSS) and the
MassTech Collaborative’s MassCyberCenter to lead a legislatively-mandated working group that includes
municipal representatives and cybersecurity subject matter experts to set the priorities for funded
cybersecurity grants. In July 2024 the Healey-Driscoll Administration announced the first award of nearly
$7 million in federal grant funds to local governments and state agencies to enhance cybersecurity
initiatives and reduce cyber risk for public agencies statewide. A second Application for Grant Funding
(AGF) is tentatively scheduled to be posted in early summer 2025.
Transparency with the Legislature, Executive Branch Agencies and the General Public
Transparency with the Legislature
In coordination with our partners in the Legislature, EOTSS has developed and implemented systems for
additional oversight and reporting for IT projects and procurement. For enhanced cost oversight and
control, any IT project or procurement with expenses over $200,000 made by an executive office or one
of its’ respective state agencies must be reported to and approved by the Chief Information Officer of
the Commonwealth.
Additionally, on an annual basis, EOTSS provides a report to the State Auditor and Legislature detailing
the complete accounting and justification for all IT expenditures over $250,000. We appreciate the
opportunity to share this information with the Legislature for increased transparency detailing how
allocated funds are being invested in the Commonwealth’s IT and cybersecurity infrastructure.
Reporting on IT expenditures in state government supports the mission of EOTSS and its IT Investment
Advisory Board to ensure that taxpayer money is being invested wisely to improve the delivery of
government services and secure the Commonwealth’s IT and data assets.
Transparency with Executive Branch Agencies
In 2022, EOTSS successfully launched a new Product and Service Catalog, which allows our agency
customers to browse approximately 170 EOTSS products and services all in one place on mass.gov. This
streamlined product and service catalog makes it convenient for customers to leverage EOTSS’ many
offerings. As an example, customers can make product and service requests through ServiceNow, a
cloud-based software that allows EOTSS to receive, track, and fulfill customer product and service
requests.
Along with the service catalog update, EOTSS recognized that chargeback models were not reflecting the
full cost of current services, which led to a chargeback modernization initiative. In FY26, EOTSS will
implement an updated chargeback methodology for products and services consumed by customer
agencies that more accurately reflects the full costs of products and services provided by EOTSS. This
modernization effort has led to both the review and recalculation of rates for all existing services and
the rollout of a number of new chargeback services including, but not limited to, end user support,
mobile and cellular support, contact center services, an updated network service model, and full
chargeback for cloud hosting. We partnered with A&F to shift general funds to customer budgets so
that the total EOTSS funding remains level or slightly decreases, and customer agencies are able to
afford the cost.

Transparency with the General Public
EOTSS has undertaken a number of initiatives to make state government services more accessible and to
improve transparency between state government and the constituents we all serve.
These initiatives include:
Enhancing the Digital Experience for Residents
Since 2022, EOTSS has been engaged in a multi-year digital roadmap project to provide a simple and
secure digital experience that adapts to people’s diverse and changing needs. Support for the Digital
Roadmap has since been bolstered through the capital authorizations in the FutureTech Act, passed in
2024 by the Legislature.
Similar to our data reporting effort, the digital services need to shift from a focus on each individual
agency and instead focus on a user’s experience. The cornerstone of the roadmap is the creation of a
single, secure user profile that interfaces with various state agency services. By providing a single,
unified identity across state government, we can better serve the person as an individual and only ask
them for information once. In the future state, this will allow the resident a better way to track their
progress, whether they are applying for a benefit or renewing a license, to improve transparency
throughout the process and alert them proactively when action is needed or the process is
complete. Users should not need to “know state government” to receive the services available to them;
it should be simple and straightforward. We are also using this tool to streamline communications,
making meaningful engagements across different channels, like SMS texts, chat and live agent, and
getting residents’ feedback to inform future opportunities. Concurrently, we aim to provide
personalized user experiences when interacting with the Commonwealth by catering to a resident’s
unique needs, placing a strong emphasis on the accessibility of our digital services, while using simple,
concise language to deliver personalized content.
We are seeing tremendous success as state agency partners are increasingly partnering with the Mass
Digital team’s expertise in user research and content analysis to keep residents at the center, involve
them, and elevate their voices in how we design and improve state services. These engagements include
direct communication with residents who rely on state services, offering increased transparency and
improved service delivery.
The second full year of the Digital Roadmap has introduced a period of rapid growth and sustained
progress. The success of the Roadmap continues to rely on a people-first approach to government
service delivery, by understanding the needs of our constituents and designing services and technology
around those needs. EOTSS continues to support agency partners with this endeavor by helping them
adopt innovative digital solutions, build their capacity to deliver exceptional constituent experiences,
and take a more holistic approach to service delivery that considers the end-to-end constituent journey.
Notable program highlights for this year include:
MyMassGov Portal Launch & Expansion of Single-Sign-On (SSO) & Universal Profile
The MyMassGov portal officially went live in July 2024, building on the Constituent Single-Sign-On (SSO)
functionality which now serves nearly 2 million constituents. The portal allows people to easily and
securely access multiple Massachusetts state programs and applications with a single login and self-
10 | Page
manage their data including their name, password, email and multifactor authentication settings. The
MyMassGov team has continued to expand SSO integrations with other constituent facing applications
which are now accessible through the portal. Notable 2024 additions include: EOHHS’ Virtual Gateway
(500k users), and Paid Family and Medical Leave (300K users). Looking ahead, planned integrations for
2025 include MassAbility, MassFishHunt, DUA’s Division Of Occupational Licensure’s Professional
Licensing System, and EOED’s Business Front Door.
MyMassGov prepares to launch Identify Verification solution
Significant progress has been made in efforts to develop an Identify Verification solution through
MyMassGov, a feature that will allow agencies to verify their users through MyMassGov and ensure that
personal data is kept safe. Key activities during 2024 include the launch of a central portal for users to
manage their credentials and access integrated applications, procurement of vendor Zelus to support
contact center training and management, piloting the use of central profile data to help users complete
a paid leave application, and procurement of Socure to provide identity verification services. The March
2025 planned roll out of IDV is a milestone achievement that will offer constituents a secure and simple
method of verification through the MyMassGov portal, after which they do not have to verify again
when applying for state services.
Partnership with Registry of Motor Vehicles (RMV)
As part of the Digital Roadmap’s Seamless Engagement initiative, EOTSS conducted a deep dive into
constituent needs, mapping key pain points and identifying engagement opportunities across more than
a dozen Commonwealth services. This strategic groundwork surfaced an opportunity to partner with the
RMV to employ a generative AI (GenAI) virtual assistant to support their efforts to enhance customer
experience ahead of the REAL ID deadline on May 7, 2025. This partnership takes an integrated
approach that spans content, GenAI-based chat, and staff enablement while building the foundation for
expanding to other agencies and adding the ability to chat with a live person.
Partnership with Department of Early Education & Care (EEC) and Executive Office of Education (EOE
IT)
As part of the Digital Roadmap’s Life Experience initiative, EOTSS has kicked off a partnership with the
Department of Early Education and Care (EEC) and the Executive Office of Education Information
Technology team (EOE IT) to understand and improve the experience of building a career as an early
childhood educator. Together, EEC and EOE IT in partnership with EOTSS will develop a holistic end-to-
end “minimum viable experience” for early childhood educators seeking to maintain and grow their
skills.
Capacity Building
A cornerstone of the Digital Roadmap is helping agencies by building capabilities to support and
maintain high quality digital services through targeted training and resources. This is done through: (1)
Enablement Engagements where we partner with state organizations to adopt people-centered product
and service delivery; (2) hosting Communities of Practice, which are interactive forums where
organization staff collaborate and grow their experience design and research skills; and (3) providing
resources in the form of guides, tools and operational support to help organizations build teams and
take action. Since launch of the Commonwealth Digital Roadmap, agency engagement across one or
11 | Page
more of these enablement levers has expanded to include: Executive Office of Energy and
Environmental Affairs (EOEEA), Executive Office of Health and Human Services (EOHHS), Massachusetts
Department of Transportation (MassDOT), Executive Office of Housing and Livable Communities
(EOHLC), Executive Office of Education (EOE), Executive Office of Economic Development (EOED),
Executive Office of Public Safety and Security (EOPSS), and Executive Office of Veteran Services (EOVS).
‘Ask MA’ Chatbot
The AskMA chatbot quickly connects visitors to Mass.gov with the content and services they are seeking,
with multilingual capabilities in twenty languages. Ask MA includes an auto-suggestion feature, which
displays suggested questions if the text the user is entering matches or is similar. Content typed into the
chatbot helps provide the Commonwealth with important feedback on how constituents are interacting
with the chatbot, whether they are finding what they are looking for, and what additional responses can
be added to address the most frequent questions. We have now advanced the language access
capabilities of the chatbot so that it is available in 20 different languages.
Ahead of the tax filing season in 2023, the AskMA chatbot offered graphic animation videos explaining
one of the Department of Revenue’s most frequently asked questions. The feature has received highly
positive feedback since its implementation, and EOTSS continues to engage with our agency partners to
find new opportunities to collaborate on this project. The chatbot first integrated with the Registry of
Motor Vehicles in 2022 to assist customers with frequently addressed issues, a function which has
allowed RMV employees to focus on more specialized customer service functions.
Digital Accessibility
Last year, EOTSS hired Massachusetts’ first-ever Chief Information Technology Accessibility Officer
(CIAO). She is just the fourth statewide CIAO in the country. In this role, the CIAO chairs the Digital
Accessibility and Equity Governance Board, established through Executive Order 614 to advance the
Healey-Driscoll Administration’s goal of providing a more equitable, inclusive, and accessible digital
experience for everyone, including those who are blind, have low vision, deaf or hard of hearing, and
other disabilities.
Under the CIAO’s leadership, this year EOTSS built out the Accessibility Center for Consulting, Education
and Support Services (ACCESS) Team to provide accessibility expertise and guidance to all state agencies
and coordinate accessibility initiatives and training throughout the Commonwealth. The team hosts
regular workshops and office hours, and provides training to executive department staff on a rolling
basis, to assist agencies in meeting the Administration’s accessibility goals. To date, over 110 technical
and nontechnical staff from across the executive branch have attended these training sessions and
office hours.
To further support the implementation of Executive Order 614, EOTSS has assisted in identifying and
hiring Secretariat IT Accessibility Officers for EOEEA, EOA&F, EOHHS, and MassDOT. Further, EOTSS will
be working with EOVS, EOLWD, EOPSS, EOE, and EOHLC to provide them with temporary support until
they are able to hire. The team also supports the broader equity and language access goals of the
Administration.

State Employee Diversity Dashboard
EOTSS’ Data Team and Mass Digital partnered with the Human Resources Division (HRD) to launch the
State Employee Diversity Dashboard in 2022. Since its launch, the dashboard has allowed users to
explore demographic data on the MA executive branch workforce and track the progress toward state
government’s goals to reflect the diversity of the Commonwealth workforce, and to stand out as an
employer of choice.
Data contained in the dashboard includes overall workforce composition, the number of hires,
promotions, and separations. Demographic data includes gender, race, age group, length of service,
veteran status, disability status, and more.
Operational Excellence
In 2024, EOTSS was able to make major advancements in the efficiency of its daily operations. EOTSS
provides 24x7 enterprise monitoring services to monitor the health of all infrastructure hardware,
networks, and applications to identify, predict, and preempt service outages and to notify the
appropriate stakeholders. Notifications are sent to both the customer and EOTSS when a system is
critical or down. EOTSS will escalate within the EOTSS Incident Management process, up through the
Major Incident process, as necessary.
Incident response took a leap forward by several key metrics. This year, EOTSS reported a reduction in
Major Incidents from 83 in calendar year 2023 to 60 in calendar year 2024, a 28.57% year-over-year
improvement. Average major incident duration was also substantially reduced, from 8 hours, 47 minutes
in 2023 to 4 hours, 53 minutes in 2024, a duration reduction of 55.6%. These improvements translate to
significantly more reliable state IT systems, and much less outage activity: In 2023 the average outage
duration per major incident was 15 hours, 47 minutes, and in 2024 that time was reduced to 9 hours, 8
minutes.
EOTSS handles a high volume of change request activity; this year, we continued to maintain and
enhance technology services with a 97.35% success rate on all change activities, improving upon an
already robust 93% success rate in calendar year 2023. This work ensures continuity of up-to-date and
enhanced service. This results in 323 such changes monthly, on average.
Summary
This year, EOTSS reached major milestones, both operationally and with our IT capital portfolio. We
made significant and impactful toward mitigating vulnerabilities in our state’s IT systems and further
developing our incident response frameworks to make our services and residents safer, while ensuring
service and information continuity from government. We remain committed to the above efforts to
advance operational excellence, enhance government efficiency, promote cybersecurity in the executive
branch and with our external partners, and modernize the way the state does business.
EOTSS is enhancing the delivery of services to our residents through the continued ramp-up of the
MyMassGov single sign-on solution and adding more business applications and constituent-facing
services to the portal. Putting to work the capital authorizations in the FutureTech Act will allow further
13 | Page
progress on the Massachusetts Digital Roadmap, and through the leadership of the first Chief IT
Accessibility Officer, EOTSS will continue to advance the Healey-Driscoll Administration's priorities of
equity, accessibility and efficient service delivery. We are moving our artificial intelligence work from the
development phase to the production environment in order to enhance service delivery, knowing that
the front door to government is now digital.
EOTSS remains grateful to the Legislature for the opportunity to highlight some of our successes over
the past year to modernize and secure the IT infrastructure across the enterprise, in collaboration with
our IT and business partners from across state government and in the vendor community. We are
committed to these ongoing efforts to make state government more secure, more accessible, and more
efficient. We welcome continued engagement and partnership with the Legislature to maintain the
Commonwealth’s position as a national technology leader.

Introduction
As the lead enterprise technology organization for the Commonwealth, EOTSS is committed to
modernizing state-owned IT systems and services, strengthening the Commonwealth’s cybersecurity
posture, and improving the constituent digital-government experience.
EOTSS’s enterprise approach is at the heart of how the Commonwealth approaches IT modernization,
cybersecurity, and the delivery of accessible digital services. By leveraging this enterprise approach, the
cost advantages achieved by more efficient operations offer greater economies of scale.
We thank our colleagues in the Legislature for their continued leadership and investment in the
Commonwealth’s technology and cybersecurity needs. We look forward to continued dialogue with the
Legislature as we navigate the challenges ahead, in furtherance of our mission to provide IT leadership
along with secure, quality digital information, services, technology and tools across the enterprise.
Savings, Efficiencies in Sharing Resources, and Additional Expenses through
Consolidation
Contract Management
To successfully undertake multiple transformational IT projects while also ensuring they each meet the
requisite security measures, oversight, and cost accounting, methodical contract management is
critical.

The Contract Management unit provides contract review and contract negotiation services on large-
scale projects across the Commonwealth at the direction of the Secretary. To date, our Contract
Management Office has negotiated and established highly discounted enterprise volume license
agreements with several major software providers, resulting in millions of dollars of annual savings for
the Commonwealth (e.g. license costs, maintenance, and cost avoidance for deployment).The cost
avoidance gained in mandating standard data security terms and maintaining up-to-date software
systems can be measured against the potential damages of a security breach or system failures due to
unsupported or compromised software. By negotiating Master Services Agreements (MSA) that can be
used by other agencies within the Executive Branch, EOTSS has saved considerable administrative and
legal work for other agencies - as well as our bidders and vendors - in preparing bid responses and
negotiating contracts. For example, a Business Associate Agreement for HIPAA data negotiated once at
the MSA level applies to any purchases by HIPAA-covered entities within the Commonwealth. While it is
hard to quantify the hours saved, agencies find value in the existence of a fully negotiated agreement to
use. This in turn allows agencies to deliver services and software for use by their constituents and/or
employees in a more time effective manner and with robust privacy and security protections.
IT Investment Advisory Board
We are grateful to the full Legislature for its continued leadership and support of both the EOTSS
operating budget and IT capital authorizations. In particular, IT capital funding is critical for new
investments and the replacement of outdated legacy IT infrastructure and systems.
Understanding the critical nature of these IT capital needs, last year the Legislature passed the
FutureTech Act, a five-year bond authorization that was signed by the Governor in July 2024. We deeply
appreciate the legislature’s pivotal work to ensure the modernization of our state’s IT capital,
cybersecurity capabilities and support for IT capital strategic initiatives across the state government
enterprise.
The need for IT project funding is significant. In any given year, we receive twice as many requests for
funding than we can provide. To select which projects move forward, a Board judiciously reviews
proposals to determine their affordability and feasibility.
EOTSS chairs the IT Investment Advisory Board through its Office of Capital Planning to oversee the IT
capital investment portfolio and program management. Composed of executives across the
Commonwealth with expertise in overseeing large, complex IT portfolios, the Board strategically
approves capital projects that improve the delivery of government services, taking into consideration
the project’s risk and respecting the investment of taxpayer dollars. The governance around capital
spending is well-developed, with clear protocols and methods for evaluating capital requests, and
collaboration among the board to ensure that IT investments align with IT priorities.
Once a capital project is approved by the Board, the project performance is evaluated throughout its
lifecycle. Similar to contract management, common missteps can be avoided if personnel are dedicated
to guide complex projects. If a project performance is undesirable, the EOTSS Capital Planning office
may request a project health check. As a result of this well-developed capital investment process,
projects stay on track, on time, and remain sound investments.

EOTSS values transparency, and we believe the IIAB, combined with our project management expertise,
is a successful check to the trust placed in us through these bond authorizations.
Cloud Computing
EOTSS continues to collaborate with agency leaders and business application managers to make further
progress in migrating critical legacy Commonwealth applications and systems to cloud-hosted services
and other EOTSS-approved hosting options included in our Standard Operating Environment (SOE)
framework. Cloud migrations and the move to modern hosting solutions are vital tools in the
government’s ability to ensure critical business applications that power important government services
remain accessible and resilient.
All migrations are handled through a “cloud smart” approach, where EOTSS works with agencies to gain
a full understanding of their business needs while ensuring the continuity of those government services
to avoid any adverse effects for the constituents that rely on them. Outside of Massachusetts, we are
seen as a leader in the space of cloud hosting. Last year, Amazon Web Services (AWS) awarded
Massachusetts with the AWS State and Local Government Champions award for our innovative use of
AWS Cloud technologies in a way that had a positive impact on state services and citizen engagement.
We continue to work with our agency partners to identify and prioritize opportunities for further cloud
migrations and hosting opportunities. Failure of government IT systems are costly, both in terms of a
temporary inability for constituents to access vital government services and also potential costs
associated with needed data recovery. Cloud migrations can be viewed as a cost avoidance initiative for
the Commonwealth and investments in the continuity of government operations and improvements to
the constituent digital experience.
Compatibility and Interoperability of Agency Systems to Consolidate Relevant Data
Between Agencies
Guided by the vision that data should be a key driver for process, policy and decision-making in the
Commonwealth, the EOTSS Data Office has some ambitious and exciting goals set for 2025.
In the last year we established the Enterprise Data Analytics program to improve the
constituent experience by allowing decision-makers in every Secretariat to access accurate, timely, and
easy-to-digest data to support the evaluation, analysis, and continuous improvement of Commonwealth
policies and operations. The program is underpinned by a strong, clear data governance framework that
ensures the security and reliability of state data when it is being created, stored, and shared between
agencies.
We recognize that the importance of measuring and reporting on policy outcomes has never been
higher. Building an analytics program that focuses on the constituent and how our processes, services,
and policy impact them is essential. Outcomes rarely are self-contained within one agency, and
establishing formal processes for both sharing and reporting upon these outcomes is the mission of our
data and analytics program.
Providing data governance standards and processes for all secretariats to adhere to, the Data Analytics
program has been boosted by the continued maturity of the Data Leadership Council, comprised of data
experts across the Executive Branch, with the goal of aligning our data vision across the enterprise. The
3 | Page

Data Leadership Council is also actively engaged in efforts to evaluate the current statewide data-
sharing framework and make iterative improvements to ease the safe, secure integration and use of
data across state agencies to improve the delivery of state services to residents.
Massachusetts Data Hub
The EOTSS Data Office continues to build on the success of the user-friendly Massachusetts Data Hub
tool to connect researchers and members of the public to data and reports published by Massachusetts
state agencies. The tool not only allows users to search state resources and data by topic or keyword
and aggregates state agency-published data and web pages; it also organizes content around topics that
cut across multiple secretariats, making data easier to find by the general public.
The Commonwealth's Data Hub remained a highly visited resource for the public, ranking in the top 1%
of mass.gov visits over the past year. In 2024, EOTSS expanded the Data Hub's capabilities by
introducing "Sub Hubs," offering a centralized gateway to agency-specific data portals across the
Commonwealth.
This year EOTSS fully integrated the MassGIS data hub into the main Data Hub user menu. The MassGIS
Data Hub serves as a "front door" where users can go to search for public geospatial data services from
MassGIS and other organizations across the Commonwealth. Anyone can search the Hub for data of
interest by entering keywords, or by browsing featured content or data categories, with options for
viewing the items in maps and downloading the data in several formats.
The Massachusetts Data Hub reflects the Commonwealth’s commitment to sharing data transparently
and openly to better serve the Commonwealth’s residents, businesses, and visitors. We are continually
iterating on the success of the Data Hub to integrate more state sources of publicly available data and
improve the user experience.
Commonwealth Information Warehouse (CIW)
The Commonwealth Information Warehouse (CIW) brings together enterprise financial, budget, time
and labor, human resources, and payroll data that is maintained in separate source applications run by
independent agencies. This year we plan to migrate the CIW from Redshift to Snowflake, for better
integration with the enterprise user environment. The CIW provides query assistance to over 2,000
Commonwealth employee users. Since the modernization has been completed, millions of queries have
been successfully executed with an average run time of approximately 2 seconds.
Thanks to this year’s planned Snowflake migration and integration in the EOTSS data analytics program,
we will improve the availability and reporting capabilities of finance and human resources data for all
state agencies. Additional benefits will be realized through this migration will include cost savings, data
sharing across agencies, user environment modernization and standardization, and operating
efficiencies.
Executive Branch IT Personnel
EOTSS remains dedicated to its legislative mandate to consolidate IT personnel under its statutory
authority. EOTSS continues to make strategic and targeted consolidation efforts that achieve efficiencies
across the Commonwealth while prioritizing the continuity of vital government service operations for
the constituents that rely on them. In calendar year 2025 we intend to make significant progress
4 | Page

consolidating Network and Telecom staff and service management to EOTSS from at least one of the
three remaining, non-consolidated secretariats, and continue our progress toward full executive branch
IT staff consolidation.
The following chart shows the number of IT personnel who support IT infrastructure and business
applications within each executive office as of February 2025:

Status of Centralization of Infrastructure, Network, and Cloud Hosting
Cloud Hosting
EOTSS works closely with the Secretariat Chief Information Officers (SCIOs) and business application
owners at Executive Branch secretariats to best understand their business needs and prepare for lift and
shift, lift and optimize, and complete re-platform transformations of Commonwealth systems to the
cloud to ensure continuity of those government services.
Cloud migrations and hosting benefit from improved cybersecurity through more routine backups, high
availability, resiliency, fewer individual points of failure, and specialized security capabilities. Utilizing
the Cloud also offers improved environmental resiliency, as the consolidated hosting footprint allows for
green energy usage, lower electricity consumption, and lower carbon emissions than maintaining
several traditional on-premises data centers.
5 | Page

Since 2017, EOTSS has coordinated the migration of over 500 Commonwealth applications and
platforms to the cloud services hosting model. Over the past year, EOTSS collaborated with our agency
partners to complete the successful migration of several key Commonwealth applications. This effort
has allowed us to decommission 117 outdated physical servers and remove 20 racks from MITC data
center. We are continuing progress toward reducing the application, server and rack footprint in EOTSS’
Chelsea data center.
Network and Infrastructure
As EOTSS promotes information sharing and privacy, a key component of that playbook is to deploy
hardware, software, and tools that promote data security, collaboration, and mobility – all vital in the
continuity of government services. EOTSS is committed to operational excellence and efficiency through
the centralized management of information technology standards, infrastructure, and service delivery.
Throughout 2025, EOTSS will also continue with its consolidation of executive office information and
technology services, bringing the benefit of standardization and economy of scale to purchasing and
service delivery.
While some Executive Branch entities still operate distinct data centers and networks, EOTSS is working
to transfer that infrastructure to the center through the One Network program. Enterprise Information
Security policies and standards are published for the entire executive branch and any other agencies
that rely on EOTSS services. Any executive office maintaining a separate environment from EOTSS must
adhere to those security policies and standards. Through the Enterprise Risk Management office, EOTSS
reviews and updates those critical policies and standards on an annual basis.
Cybersecurity
Security Operations Center
The security of the Commonwealth’s IT infrastructure, networks, and data remains a top priority.
Through the support of trusted vendors, the unified Commonwealth Security Operations Center, or SOC,
continues to expand its capacity and service offerings to monitor, alert, respond to, and mitigate
cybersecurity threats across the Executive Branch. Guided by the Enterprise Security Incident Reporting
and Response Framework, the SOC receives all incidents reported by executive branch agencies, and can
receive reports from municipalities and independent agencies as another layer of security awareness
that is mutually beneficial. In addition to the Incident Reporting and Response Framework, EOTSS
maintains the publication of other security policies, standards, guidelines, and administrative directives
as part of the Standard Operating Environment (SOE), including end-user hardware and software
standards.
Enterprise Risk Management Program
The Commonwealth’s Chief Risk Officer and Chief Information Security Officer works with the Chief
Information Security Officer (CISO) Council, a peer-to-peer network of risk and security professionals
comprised of representatives from the Executive Branch, Judiciary, Constitutional Officers, and
Independent Agencies. Vulnerabilities are regularly identified by the Commonwealth SOC and then fed
into the CISO Council to remediate through a vulnerability management lifecycle program. Last year
EOTSS set an aggressive goal to reduce critical vulnerabilities from the July 2023 baseline and
successfully reduced such vulnerabilities by 41% (15284 to 9055) while increasing the sample size (total
6 | Page

scanned assets increased by 16% from the baseline during this time). EOTSS’ mitigation velocity, the
number of vulnerabilities eliminated within 30 days, increased by 297% when comparing January 2024
to January 2025.
EOTSS also frequently engages with cybersecurity stakeholders across all levels of government to both
lead and participate in cybersecurity tabletop exercises that simulate ‘real world’ security events with
agency and secretariat business users, the vendor community, municipalities, and our state partners.
In a nation-leading effort to enhance the Commonwealth’s ability to prepare for, respond to, mitigate
against, and recover from significant cybersecurity incidents, the Massachusetts Cyber Incident
Response Team (MA-CIRT) was established in December 2022. Comprised of members from across
EOTSS and the Executive Office of Public Safety and Security, the MA-CIRT ensures the continuity of
government and government services, public safety, public health, economic security, and the risk of
any loss of public confidence potentially resulting from significant cybersecurity incidents.
The MA-CIRT has developed and maintains a Cyber Incident Response Plan for the
Commonwealth. Tested through several tabletop exercises each year, the Cyber Incident Response Plan
ensures that the Commonwealth’s leadership is informed of ongoing and pending cybersecurity
incidents or threats and guides the deployment of resources to rapidly respond to and minimize the
impact of significant cybersecurity threats. The collaboration built between technology and public safety
experts is a unique – and effective - model in the nation.
Third-party vendor risk remains a potential threat to the Commonwealth. Accordingly, our Office of
Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) is now requiring cloud service providers to respond to an
information security risk assessment as part of its Vendor Risk Management program. This program is
overseen in coordination with our Procurement and Contract Management teams.
The Application Security Center of Excellence was created to evaluate the security of software and
applications purchased and renewed across the Executive Branch and aligns with the ERM’s vendor risk
management program. The security risk assessments include static and dynamic code analysis and
penetration testing. These investments are designed to enhance the Commonwealth’s security posture
by mitigating third-party risk.
Privacy Program
Protecting the Commonwealth’s data is of paramount importance to EOTSS. To that end, our Privacy
Office has been using a Privacy Impact Assessment, or “PIA,” to facilitate the identification and
resolution of data protection and privacy concerns to address the growing threat of data breaches and
the risk to Commonwealth and constituent data. The Privacy Office has been overseeing a pilot program
in collaboration with our risk and security teams to assess privacy risks during the contracting and
development stages using this new PIA tool. This program allows the Privacy Office to assess privacy
risks for new contracts and projects and develop mitigation strategies to protect Commonwealth data.
We continue to engage with state agency partners to promote data privacy within state
government. The Commonwealth Chief Privacy Officer leads an Enterprise Privacy Council consisting of
privacy and legal experts from across state government to meet on a monthly basis with the goal of
information sharing and building our privacy maturity. The Privacy Office, in collaboration with the
Council, has developed a privacy policy designed to set baseline standards for privacy protection across
7 | Page

the Commonwealth and fill in the gaps within the existing statutory framework. The Privacy Office has
also developed an AI Policy to standardize AI use in the Commonwealth with the goal of promoting
innovation while setting necessary guardrails to address privacy and legal risks. To complement this
effort, last year EOTSS established the AI Center of Excellence, one function of which is to continually
iterate on these frameworks, mitigate risk, and provide legal leadership to state government to ensure
continued understanding and compliance with evolving federal and state guidance on AI frameworks.
State Cybersecurity Awareness Training
The Commonwealth provides cybersecurity end-user awareness training to all Commonwealth Executive
Branch employees to ensure they are equipped with the knowledge to remain vigilant and avoid falling
prey to potential cyber threats. By training our workforce, we essentially expand the number of the
Commonwealth’s cybersecurity team from a couple dozen to tens of thousands of employees. EOTSS
supplements its cybersecurity training with enterprise phishing simulation exercises to gain a better
understanding of the Commonwealth’s endpoint vulnerabilities and to enhance its training materials.
With the issuance of Executive Order 602 establishing the Massachusetts Cyber Incident Response Team
(MA-CIRT), all executive department personnel are required to complete the EOTSS-approved security
awareness training program administered by the Human Resources Division (HRD). In collaboration with
HRD and secretariat leadership, EOTSS ensures that employees remain in full compliance with this
mandate. Annual security training is complemented by monthly phishing exercises to all employees to
simulate real phishing emails, essentially turning the state workforce into a team of cybersecurity
analysts.
Municipal Cybersecurity Resources
In addition to the Commonwealth’s workforce, EOTSS supports opportunities to assist our partners in
municipal government. EOTSS’ Office of Municipal and School Technology (OMST) oversees the
municipal cybersecurity training program, which has grown each year since its inception. Now in its sixth
year, the program is being accessed by over 100,000 employees from over 200 municipalities and public
school districts. Participants will receive cybersecurity awareness training to better detect and avoid
cyber threats. The program provides much-needed cost avoidance for municipal organizations by
utilizing the state’s purchasing power to procure this training on behalf of municipal organizations.
Coupled with the Community Compact IT Grant Program; the OMST’s no-cost Cybersecurity Health
Check Program; cyber health services, scanning and penetration testing provided by the Massachusetts
State Police Commonwealth Fusion Center; and the MassCyberCenter’s planning guidance, the
Administration offers our partners in municipal government with multiple no-cost resources to shore up
their cybersecurity capabilities.
State and Local Cybersecurity Grant Program
In 2021, the federal government and Congress made a monumental statement by including $1 billion for
a State and Local Cybersecurity Grant Program in the bi-partisan infrastructure bill. This four-year
program will provide states across the country with vital resources to improve their cyber defenses. The
passage of this first-of-its-kind cybersecurity grant program is a clear indication that Congress recognizes
the increasing threat that municipal governments face from cyber threats.
8 | Page

In 2022, EOTSS engaged with the Executive Office of Public Safety and Security (EOPSS) and the
MassTech Collaborative’s MassCyberCenter to lead a legislatively-mandated working group that includes
municipal representatives and cybersecurity subject matter experts to set the priorities for funded
cybersecurity grants. In July 2024 the Healey-Driscoll Administration announced the first award of nearly
$7 million in federal grant funds to local governments and state agencies to enhance cybersecurity
initiatives and reduce cyber risk for public agencies statewide. A second Application for Grant Funding
(AGF) is tentatively scheduled to be posted in early summer 2025.
Transparency with the Legislature, Executive Branch Agencies and the General Public
Transparency with the Legislature
In coordination with our partners in the Legislature, EOTSS has developed and implemented systems for
additional oversight and reporting for IT projects and procurement. For enhanced cost oversight and
control, any IT project or procurement with expenses over $200,000 made by an executive office or one
of its’ respective state agencies must be reported to and approved by the Chief Information Officer of
the Commonwealth.
Additionally, on an annual basis, EOTSS provides a report to the State Auditor and Legislature detailing
the complete accounting and justification for all IT expenditures over $250,000. We appreciate the
opportunity to share this information with the Legislature for increased transparency detailing how
allocated funds are being invested in the Commonwealth’s IT and cybersecurity infrastructure.
Reporting on IT expenditures in state government supports the mission of EOTSS and its IT Investment
Advisory Board to ensure that taxpayer money is being invested wisely to improve the delivery of
government services and secure the Commonwealth’s IT and data assets.
Transparency with Executive Branch Agencies
In 2022, EOTSS successfully launched a new Product and Service Catalog, which allows our agency
customers to browse approximately 170 EOTSS products and services all in one place on mass.gov. This
streamlined product and service catalog makes it convenient for customers to leverage EOTSS’ many
offerings. As an example, customers can make product and service requests through ServiceNow, a
cloud-based software that allows EOTSS to receive, track, and fulfill customer product and service
requests.
Along with the service catalog update, EOTSS recognized that chargeback models were not reflecting the
full cost of current services, which led to a chargeback modernization initiative. In FY26, EOTSS will
implement an updated chargeback methodology for products and services consumed by customer
agencies that more accurately reflects the full costs of products and services provided by EOTSS. This
modernization effort has led to both the review and recalculation of rates for all existing services and
the rollout of a number of new chargeback services including, but not limited to, end user support,
mobile and cellular support, contact center services, an updated network service model, and full
chargeback for cloud hosting. We partnered with A&F to shift general funds to customer budgets so
that the total EOTSS funding remains level or slightly decreases, and customer agencies are able to
afford the cost.

Transparency with the General Public
EOTSS has undertaken a number of initiatives to make state government services more accessible and to
improve transparency between state government and the constituents we all serve.
These initiatives include:
Enhancing the Digital Experience for Residents
Since 2022, EOTSS has been engaged in a multi-year digital roadmap project to provide a simple and
secure digital experience that adapts to people’s diverse and changing needs. Support for the Digital
Roadmap has since been bolstered through the capital authorizations in the FutureTech Act, passed in
2024 by the Legislature.
Similar to our data reporting effort, the digital services need to shift from a focus on each individual
agency and instead focus on a user’s experience. The cornerstone of the roadmap is the creation of a
single, secure user profile that interfaces with various state agency services. By providing a single,
unified identity across state government, we can better serve the person as an individual and only ask
them for information once. In the future state, this will allow the resident a better way to track their
progress, whether they are applying for a benefit or renewing a license, to improve transparency
throughout the process and alert them proactively when action is needed or the process is
complete. Users should not need to “know state government” to receive the services available to them;
it should be simple and straightforward. We are also using this tool to streamline communications,
making meaningful engagements across different channels, like SMS texts, chat and live agent, and
getting residents’ feedback to inform future opportunities. Concurrently, we aim to provide
personalized user experiences when interacting with the Commonwealth by catering to a resident’s
unique needs, placing a strong emphasis on the accessibility of our digital services, while using simple,
concise language to deliver personalized content.
We are seeing tremendous success as state agency partners are increasingly partnering with the Mass
Digital team’s expertise in user research and content analysis to keep residents at the center, involve
them, and elevate their voices in how we design and improve state services. These engagements include
direct communication with residents who rely on state services, offering increased transparency and
improved service delivery.
The second full year of the Digital Roadmap has introduced a period of rapid growth and sustained
progress. The success of the Roadmap continues to rely on a people-first approach to government
service delivery, by understanding the needs of our constituents and designing services and technology
around those needs. EOTSS continues to support agency partners with this endeavor by helping them
adopt innovative digital solutions, build their capacity to deliver exceptional constituent experiences,
and take a more holistic approach to service delivery that considers the end-to-end constituent journey.
Notable program highlights for this year include:
MyMassGov Portal Launch & Expansion of Single-Sign-On (SSO) & Universal Profile
The MyMassGov portal officially went live in July 2024, building on the Constituent Single-Sign-On (SSO)
functionality which now serves nearly 2 million constituents. The portal allows people to easily and
securely access multiple Massachusetts state programs and applications with a single login and self-
10 | Page

manage their data including their name, password, email and multifactor authentication settings. The
MyMassGov team has continued to expand SSO integrations with other constituent facing applications
which are now accessible through the portal. Notable 2024 additions include: EOHHS’ Virtual Gateway
(500k users), and Paid Family and Medical Leave (300K users). Looking ahead, planned integrations for
2025 include MassAbility, MassFishHunt, DUA’s Division Of Occupational Licensure’s Professional
Licensing System, and EOED’s Business Front Door.
MyMassGov prepares to launch Identify Verification solution
Significant progress has been made in efforts to develop an Identify Verification solution through
MyMassGov, a feature that will allow agencies to verify their users through MyMassGov and ensure that
personal data is kept safe. Key activities during 2024 include the launch of a central portal for users to
manage their credentials and access integrated applications, procurement of vendor Zelus to support
contact center training and management, piloting the use of central profile data to help users complete
a paid leave application, and procurement of Socure to provide identity verification services. The March
2025 planned roll out of IDV is a milestone achievement that will offer constituents a secure and simple
method of verification through the MyMassGov portal, after which they do not have to verify again
when applying for state services.
Partnership with Registry of Motor Vehicles (RMV)
As part of the Digital Roadmap’s Seamless Engagement initiative, EOTSS conducted a deep dive into
constituent needs, mapping key pain points and identifying engagement opportunities across more than
a dozen Commonwealth services. This strategic groundwork surfaced an opportunity to partner with the
RMV to employ a generative AI (GenAI) virtual assistant to support their efforts to enhance customer
experience ahead of the REAL ID deadline on May 7, 2025. This partnership takes an integrated
approach that spans content, GenAI-based chat, and staff enablement while building the foundation for
expanding to other agencies and adding the ability to chat with a live person.
Partnership with Department of Early Education & Care (EEC) and Executive Office of Education (EOE
IT)
As part of the Digital Roadmap’s Life Experience initiative, EOTSS has kicked off a partnership with the
Department of Early Education and Care (EEC) and the Executive Office of Education Information
Technology team (EOE IT) to understand and improve the experience of building a career as an early
childhood educator. Together, EEC and EOE IT in partnership with EOTSS will develop a holistic end-to-
end “minimum viable experience” for early childhood educators seeking to maintain and grow their
skills.
Capacity Building
A cornerstone of the Digital Roadmap is helping agencies by building capabilities to support and
maintain high quality digital services through targeted training and resources. This is done through: (1)
Enablement Engagements where we partner with state organizations to adopt people-centered product
and service delivery; (2) hosting Communities of Practice, which are interactive forums where
organization staff collaborate and grow their experience design and research skills; and (3) providing
resources in the form of guides, tools and operational support to help organizations build teams and
take action. Since launch of the Commonwealth Digital Roadmap, agency engagement across one or
11 | Page

more of these enablement levers has expanded to include: Executive Office of Energy and
Environmental Affairs (EOEEA), Executive Office of Health and Human Services (EOHHS), Massachusetts
Department of Transportation (MassDOT), Executive Office of Housing and Livable Communities
(EOHLC), Executive Office of Education (EOE), Executive Office of Economic Development (EOED),
Executive Office of Public Safety and Security (EOPSS), and Executive Office of Veteran Services (EOVS).
‘Ask MA’ Chatbot
The AskMA chatbot quickly connects visitors to Mass.gov with the content and services they are seeking,
with multilingual capabilities in twenty languages. Ask MA includes an auto-suggestion feature, which
displays suggested questions if the text the user is entering matches or is similar. Content typed into the
chatbot helps provide the Commonwealth with important feedback on how constituents are interacting
with the chatbot, whether they are finding what they are looking for, and what additional responses can
be added to address the most frequent questions. We have now advanced the language access
capabilities of the chatbot so that it is available in 20 different languages.
Ahead of the tax filing season in 2023, the AskMA chatbot offered graphic animation videos explaining
one of the Department of Revenue’s most frequently asked questions. The feature has received highly
positive feedback since its implementation, and EOTSS continues to engage with our agency partners to
find new opportunities to collaborate on this project. The chatbot first integrated with the Registry of
Motor Vehicles in 2022 to assist customers with frequently addressed issues, a function which has
allowed RMV employees to focus on more specialized customer service functions.
Digital Accessibility
Last year, EOTSS hired Massachusetts’ first-ever Chief Information Technology Accessibility Officer
(CIAO). She is just the fourth statewide CIAO in the country. In this role, the CIAO chairs the Digital
Accessibility and Equity Governance Board, established through Executive Order 614 to advance the
Healey-Driscoll Administration’s goal of providing a more equitable, inclusive, and accessible digital
experience for everyone, including those who are blind, have low vision, deaf or hard of hearing, and
other disabilities.
Under the CIAO’s leadership, this year EOTSS built out the Accessibility Center for Consulting, Education
and Support Services (ACCESS) Team to provide accessibility expertise and guidance to all state agencies
and coordinate accessibility initiatives and training throughout the Commonwealth. The team hosts
regular workshops and office hours, and provides training to executive department staff on a rolling
basis, to assist agencies in meeting the Administration’s accessibility goals. To date, over 110 technical
and nontechnical staff from across the executive branch have attended these training sessions and
office hours.
To further support the implementation of Executive Order 614, EOTSS has assisted in identifying and
hiring Secretariat IT Accessibility Officers for EOEEA, EOA&F, EOHHS, and MassDOT. Further, EOTSS will
be working with EOVS, EOLWD, EOPSS, EOE, and EOHLC to provide them with temporary support until
they are able to hire. The team also supports the broader equity and language access goals of the
Administration.

State Employee Diversity Dashboard
EOTSS’ Data Team and Mass Digital partnered with the Human Resources Division (HRD) to launch the
State Employee Diversity Dashboard in 2022. Since its launch, the dashboard has allowed users to
explore demographic data on the MA executive branch workforce and track the progress toward state
government’s goals to reflect the diversity of the Commonwealth workforce, and to stand out as an
employer of choice.
Data contained in the dashboard includes overall workforce composition, the number of hires,
promotions, and separations. Demographic data includes gender, race, age group, length of service,
veteran status, disability status, and more.
Operational Excellence
In 2024, EOTSS was able to make major advancements in the efficiency of its daily operations. EOTSS
provides 24x7 enterprise monitoring services to monitor the health of all infrastructure hardware,
networks, and applications to identify, predict, and preempt service outages and to notify the
appropriate stakeholders. Notifications are sent to both the customer and EOTSS when a system is
critical or down. EOTSS will escalate within the EOTSS Incident Management process, up through the
Major Incident process, as necessary.
Incident response took a leap forward by several key metrics. This year, EOTSS reported a reduction in
Major Incidents from 83 in calendar year 2023 to 60 in calendar year 2024, a 28.57% year-over-year
improvement. Average major incident duration was also substantially reduced, from 8 hours, 47 minutes
in 2023 to 4 hours, 53 minutes in 2024, a duration reduction of 55.6%. These improvements translate to
significantly more reliable state IT systems, and much less outage activity: In 2023 the average outage
duration per major incident was 15 hours, 47 minutes, and in 2024 that time was reduced to 9 hours, 8
minutes.
EOTSS handles a high volume of change request activity; this year, we continued to maintain and
enhance technology services with a 97.35% success rate on all change activities, improving upon an
already robust 93% success rate in calendar year 2023. This work ensures continuity of up-to-date and
enhanced service. This results in 323 such changes monthly, on average.
Summary
This year, EOTSS reached major milestones, both operationally and with our IT capital portfolio. We
made significant and impactful toward mitigating vulnerabilities in our state’s IT systems and further
developing our incident response frameworks to make our services and residents safer, while ensuring
service and information continuity from government. We remain committed to the above efforts to
advance operational excellence, enhance government efficiency, promote cybersecurity in the executive
branch and with our external partners, and modernize the way the state does business.
EOTSS is enhancing the delivery of services to our residents through the continued ramp-up of the
MyMassGov single sign-on solution and adding more business applications and constituent-facing
services to the portal. Putting to work the capital authorizations in the FutureTech Act will allow further
13 | Page

progress on the Massachusetts Digital Roadmap, and through the leadership of the first Chief IT
Accessibility Officer, EOTSS will continue to advance the Healey-Driscoll Administration's priorities of
equity, accessibility and efficient service delivery. We are moving our artificial intelligence work from the
development phase to the production environment in order to enhance service delivery, knowing that
the front door to government is now digital.
EOTSS remains grateful to the Legislature for the opportunity to highlight some of our successes over
the past year to modernize and secure the IT infrastructure across the enterprise, in collaboration with
our IT and business partners from across state government and in the vendor community. We are
committed to these ongoing efforts to make state government more secure, more accessible, and more
efficient. We welcome continued engagement and partnership with the Legislature to maintain the
Commonwealth’s position as a national technology leader.
