Massachusetts Division of Insurance
Annual Home Insurance Report
For Calendar Year 2023
Michael T. Caljouw
Commissioner of Insurance
Introduction
report pursuant to M.G.L. c. 175, §§ 4A & 4B. For the current report, insurers and their
statistical agents were required to provide aggregate 2021, 2022 and 2023 data sorted
according to Massachusetts zip codes and Insurance Services Office, Inc. (ISO) territories.
The report is based primarily on responses from companies writing home insurance
policies in Massachusetts and from statistical reporting organizations reflecting the
experience of companies in the home insurance market. Unless otherwise noted in the
report, references to “home insurance” include traditional homeowners’ insurance as well
as condominium and rental insurance. It is important to note that while some of the results
in this report apply to all home insurance policies in the Commonwealth, other results apply
to policies written only by the 25 home insurance companies with the largest market share
in Massachusetts and the FAIR Plan, and/or only to particular zip codes in the
Commonwealth. These zip codes are identified as “designated” zip codes because they are
the zip codes that the Commissioner of Insurance (Commissioner) has specified to be
included in the report due to historical skepticism regarding availability of coverage in
these areas. The zip codes include both coastal areas and urban areas. This report provides
specific scrutiny in response to such concerns. A list of the top 25 home insurance
companies can be found under footnote 6. The full list of designated zip codes can be found
in Exhibit 8A of the Statistical Supplement to this report.
This report was prepared by the State Rating Bureau staff of the Division of Insurance
(Matthew M. Mancini, State Rating Bureau Director, Spase Kace, State Rating Bureau
Researcher, Caleb E. Huntington, State Rating Bureau Mathematician, Bashiru Abubakare,
State Rating Bureau Actuary / Statistician).
The Division makes all appropriate efforts to check the completeness and consistency
of data reported by insurance companies and their statistical agents but does rely on
the insurance companies for the accuracy of all reported information.
Many of the statistical tables incorporated in previous versions of this report have been
included in a separate Statistical Supplement. The Statistical Supplement can be found on
the Division’s website at https://www.mass.gov/service-details/the-commissioners-report-
on-home-insurance.

• Total enrollment in the FAIR Plan1 decreased by 5,974 policies in 2023, with the FAIR Plan
writing 8.3% of 2023 home insurance premium.
• For the Cape and Islands market, the FAIR Plan accounted for 33.0% of policies.
There were eight events that were classified as loss catastrophes2 in 2023, which resulted in
estimated property losses in Massachusetts of approximately $892.3 million. The estimated
property losses consisted primarily of flood, hail, tornado, wind, snow and freezing events.
1 The FAIR Plan is the residual market for homeowners’ insurance operated by the Massachusetts Property Insurance and
Underwriting Association (“MPIUA”).
2 Property Claims Services, Inc. (“PCS”), a subsidiary of ISO, Inc., defines catastrophes in the United States, Puerto Rico, and the
U.S. Virgin Islands as events that cause $25 million or more in direct insured losses to property and affect a significant number
of policyholders and insurers. PCS has also provided Massachusetts property loss estimates as a result of a catastrophe.

Composition of the Massachusetts Market
Home insurance covers non-commercial property for risks to structural damage and personal
property, as well as for the risk of personal liability claims. In 2023, insurance companies collected
approximately $3.4 billion in written premium for home insurance policies in Massachusetts, as
noted in the chart below3.
Although it may be fiscally prudent to protect one’s assets from loss or damage, there are no laws
that require property owners to purchase home insurance.4 Figure 1 shows the total number of
households covered under owners’ home insurance (condominium, traditional
homeowners and rental insurance) in the past three years as calculated by “written house-years,”
which is a measure equivalent to average number of homes insured. There were 69 licensed

4 Even though home insurance is not required by law, most lenders will require that an owner have sufficient home insurance as
a condition of a mortgage on the property. Further, in accordance with Chapter 177 of the Acts of 2014, lenders are prohibited
from requiring flood insurance coverage in an amount greater than the outstanding mortgage balance.

Most of the coverage in Massachusetts is provided by local carriers, regional carriers or national
carriers based in Massachusetts. Among the top 10 home insurance groups in the market, only
five– the Travelers Group, the Liberty Mutual Group, Chubb Ltd Group, the Amica Mutual Group,
and United Services Automobile Association Group – offer home insurance nationally. The
remaining companies are regional companies offering coverage primarily in the Northeast.
The Mapfre Insurance Group, which is the parent company of Commerce Insurance Company,
had the largest share of the 2023 voluntary (i.e., non-FAIR Plan) market with 12.5% of the home
insurance premium written. Each of the next nine largest insurance groups had between 9.2% and

The FAIR Plan
The FAIR Plan is a residual market mechanism originally created in 1968. Similar plans for “Fair
Access to Insurance Requirements” -- FAIR -- were established in other jurisdictions during the
same period pursuant to the federal Urban Property Protection and Reinsurance Act of 1968. The
FAIR Plan was substantially restructured in 1976 and again in 1996 and is currently known as the
Massachusetts Property Insurance and Underwriting Association (“MPIUA”). Due to continuity
of mission, membership, and operations, the terms MPIUA and FAIR Plan are often used
interchangeably. By statute, the FAIR Plan is required to offer coverage to homes with a
replacement cost of up to $1 million.8 If an owner cannot obtain a policy from an admitted
insurance company and the home’s value is beyond what the FAIR Plan will cover, an owner can
seek coverage in the surplus lines market.9

company group. Company groups often have more than one licensed insurer writing home insurance.
8 See M.G.L. c. 175C, §4(4a), which requires all home insurance companies licensed to and engaged in writing property insurance
in the Commonwealth to be members of a joint underwriting association that shall provide basic property insurance to eligible
applicants who are otherwise unable to obtain such coverage in the voluntary market.
9 Surplus lines companies are insurers which are not "licensed" or “admitted” in Massachusetts although they are "licensed" in
another state (or country). Such insurers may issue coverage only through specially licensed surplus lines brokers. This document
does not include statistical information on the surplus lines market.

Coverage Options and Limitations
Wind Deductibles
To reduce their financial risk, many home insurance companies have amended their standard
policies to include mandatory wind deductibles.14 These deductibles may apply to any wind-related
damage that occurs in specified coastal territories, typically located in Bristol, Plymouth,
Barnstable, Dukes and Nantucket counties, or within a certain distance from the shore. These
deductibles are imposed either as flat dollar amounts or as a percentage of the covered dwelling
amount.15 The Division requires that insurers provide consumers with clear disclosures of the
deductibles before they purchase coverage. This is often communicated on the declaration pages
that would accompany the policy/endorsement packet sent to the insured.
According to information submitted to the Division from the FAIR Plan and the top 25 companies
in the market, all but six companies reported that they have mandatory wind deductibles that are
part of the coverage they offer in the market, with deductibles up to 5% of the coverage for the
main structure.16 The largest wind deductibles are in the coastal parts of Bristol, Plymouth,
Barnstable, Dukes and Nantucket counties.
Of all policyholders living in a coastal or urban area who are covered by the FAIR Plan or the top
25 home insurance companies, 33.6% had a mandatory wind deductible applicable to their
coverage in 2023. In coastal areas, 60.0% had a mandatory wind deductible. In urban areas, 19.9%
had a mandatory wind deductible.
The Division encourages insurance companies to allow consumers to reduce or eliminate their
wind deductibles by taking steps to mitigate the potential exposure of their property in the event
of a wind event, such as by installing hurricane shutters or shatterproof glass, hurricane-proof
garages or patios, and other doors and/or roof/foundation anchor bolts. The Division has worked
with many carriers to establish clear rules for mitigation programs and to establish ways to
document that mitigation steps have been taken.
Flood Coverage and Exclusions
In the United States, home insurance policies have not traditionally covered damage associated
with floods.17 Recognizing this lack of protection, Congress enacted legislation in 1968 to create
the National Flood Insurance Program (“NFIP”), which is administered by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency (“FEMA”). Under the program, the government plays the role of underwriter
14 A wind deductible is a deductible that applies only to losses caused by wind.
15 The FAIR Plan, for example, currently requires certain insureds to have a minimum named storm percentage deductible of 1%
to 5% of the coverage amount for the dwelling and attached structures, or a minimum fixed dollar named storm deductible of up
to $5,000, depending on the property’s county, distance from the coast and coverage.
16 Additional detailed information is included in the Statistical Supplement to this report.
17 Automobile insurance policies, cover flood damage to a motor vehicle under optional comprehensive coverage.

and assumes the financial risk for damages while relying on private insurance agents to sell
policies.
Flood insurance is mandatory only for those homes that have been identified by FEMA mapping
as located in high-risk flood areas and that are mortgaged through a federally backed lender.
However, the NFIP makes flood coverage available for all property holders if the property is in an
approved NFIP community. The property does not need to be in a flood plain to qualify for
coverage.
Prior to the current re-mapping of flood zones in Massachusetts, FEMA had estimated that more
than 11 million U.S. homes were in flood zones and that about one-fourth of the homes located in
Special Flood Hazard Areas (“SFHA”)18 were covered by NFIP-issued or NFIP-backed flood
insurance. The proportion of property with flood coverage is believed to be low because many
people underestimate the risk of flooding.
As presented in Figure 9, FEMA reports that 54,997 policyholders in Massachusetts had flood
insurance in 2023, which is an increase of 6.2% from the 51,805 reported for 2022.

Flood insurance is required for insurable structures within high-risk areas to protect Federal financial investments and assistance
used for acquisition and/or construction purposes within communities participating in the National Flood Insurance Program.
The NFIP continually updates statistics on national purchases of flood insurance and periodically
produces special reports on the matter. According to the NFIP’s monthly countrywide policy

statistics, as of 6/30/2023 Massachusetts ranked 14th in the country in the number of policies in
place through the flood insurance program.
The U.S. Census Bureau ranked Massachusetts as the 16th most populous state.19 While population
does not necessarily correlate with flood exposure, the number of Massachusetts homes with flood
insurance continues to be relatively low for 2023 (See Figure 10). The Division issued Bulletin
2006-05, in 2006, to remind insurers and insurance producers to offer flood insurance to all state
residents.

Figure 10
Since the 1970s, NFIP rates were predominantly based on relatively static measurements,
emphasizing a property’s elevation within a zone on a Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM). This
approach did not incorporate as many flooding variables as Risk Rating 2.0. Risk Rating 2.0 is the
new methodology used by FEMA and essentially places homes in market “baskets”. The baskets
contain single-family homes with similar property and policy coverage characteristics for that
region. Rating now more resembles how risk is assessed for other types of insurance. One of the
goals of Risk Rating 2.0 is to deliver rates that are actuarially sound, equitable, easier to understand
and better reflect a property’s flood risk. FEMA is building on years of investment in flood hazard
information by incorporating private sector data sets, catastrophe models and evolving actuarial
science. With Risk Rating 2.0, FEMA now has the capability and tools to address rating disparities
19 Massachusetts population ranking is based on estimates as of July 1, 2023. The 2022 U.S. Census Bureau statistics, available at

by incorporating more flood risk variables. These include flood frequency, multiple flood types—
river overflow, storm surge, coastal erosion and heavy rainfall—and distance to a water source
along with property characteristics such as elevation and the cost to rebuild. Risk Rating 2.0
became effective October 1, 2021, for new flood policies and April 1, 2022 for renewal flood
policies.
In recent years private insurers have increased the residential flood coverage they provide in
Massachusetts. In 2018, there was $4,857,911 of direct written premium on 1,668 Massachusetts
private residential flood policies in force (at year-end 2018) plus an additional $693,558 direct
written premium on 3,731 private residential flood endorsements. By 2023, private flood
coverage had increased to $8,705,496 of Massachusetts direct written premium on 4,558
residential flood policies (year-end 2023), and $1,792,571 of direct written premium on 2,307
private residential endorsements.20
Climate Mitigation
To better understand Massachusetts’ carrier’s efforts to address the risks of storms, wildfire and
other climate risks, the Division of Insurance again called a special examination of the top 25
Massachusetts home insurers and the FAIR Plan. The examination asked about credits or
discounts offered by each company in calendar year 2023 as well as how policyholder pre-loss
mitigation measures and community-level loss resiliency efforts impacted rates, deductibles and
the carrier’s capacity to write homeowners’ insurance in the Commonwealth.
Eighteen (18) of the surveyed companies reported that they give premium credits or reduce rates
when homeowners take certain carrier-specific loss mitigation measures including hurricane
shutters, hurricane-resistant glass, roof/foundation tie-downs, roof geometry, and back-up power
supplies.
Several insurers reported premium credits for general mitigation factors, such as construction
compliance with specific building codes, or housing meeting Institute for Building and Home
Safety certification requirements.
Specific results from the survey include the following:
• One insurer gives credit for LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design)
certified homes.

https://content.naic.org/industry_private_flood_data_call.htm
15
Massachusetts Division of Insurance Annual Home Insurance Report for Calendar Year 2023
__________________________________________________________
• Six (6) of the surveyed companies reduce or eliminate wind deductibles in response to
mitigation measures, such as for hurricane shutters, hurricane-resistant glass, reinforced
doors, and roof or foundation tie-downs.
• Eight (8) of the surveyed insurers reported that considering their policyholders’ climate-
related mitigation measures through lower rates or lower deductibles has resulted in
increased capacity to write homeowners’ insurance in Massachusetts.
• Fourteen (14) of the surveyed insurers reported the increased availability of actuarially sound
data reflecting municipal-level or community-level resilience to climate-related causes of
loss. The most cited data sources were commercial catastrophe model loss simulations and
ISO’s Building Code Effectiveness Grading (BCEG). Insurers also indicated that there was
data available about the year of construction of housing in a community, which can be
compared to the code in effect the time of construction.
Overall, many of the surveyed insurers are taking mitigation measures into account when
developing rates for home insurance products. By considering the actuarial data, carriers are
progressively offering benefits in return for mitigation efforts that can be expected to reduce
projected losses.
The Division of Insurance encourages insurance companies to allow consumers to reduce or
eliminate deductibles by taking steps to mitigate the potential exposure of their property in the
event of a weather event.
These efforts also continue through the National Association of Insurance Commissioners
(NAIC) Climate and Resiliency (EX) Task Force which serves as the coordinating body for
discussion and engagement on climate-related risk and resiliency issues, including discussion
among state insurance regulators, industry, and other stakeholders.
The Task Force has divided its projects among several workstreams:
Pre-Disaster Mitigation Workstream – As noted, some insurance companies writing home
insurance coverage give premium credits or discounts, or reduce or eliminate wind deductibles,
when homeowners take certain loss mitigation measures. The Division of Insurance, and state
insurance regulators across the country, prioritize pre-disaster mitigation because protecting
consumers begins long before a wildfire starts, or a storm makes landfall. This work has extended
to collaborations with the Insurance Institute for Business and Home Safety (IBHS) to understand
more about strengthening building codes and the IBHS “fortified program”.
Climate Risk Disclosure Workstream – In 2022, the NAIC adopted a revised Climate Risk
Disclosure Survey that aligns with the Financial Stability Board’s Task Force on Climate-
Related Financial Disclosure (TCFD), which is the leading international standard for climate
reporting for the insurance sector. The goal of the Survey is to provide insurance regulators with
information about the assessment of risks posed by climate change to insurance companies and
the actions companies are taking in response to their understanding of climate risks.
16
Massachusetts Division of Insurance Annual Home Insurance Report for Calendar Year 2023
__________________________________________________________
Specifically, the Survey allows the Division to better understand how insurance companies are
considering and addressing climate change and climate risk in their business operations,
underwriting and reserves, which in turn, impact the availability of coverage for homeowners.
Solvency Workstream – The Solvency Workstream evaluates financial regulatory approaches to
climate risk and resiliency, recommending enhancements to regulator solvency tools. State
insurance regulators have updated the Risk Based Capital (RBC) formula, which is used to
monitor the capital adequacy of insurance companies to ensure their ability to pay claims, to
include specific charges for hurricane, earthquake, and most recently, wildfire risks. These steps
help ensure that insurance carriers remain solvent and have sufficient claims-paying capacity,
which we will get into later in this report.
Innovation and Technology Workstream – This workstream explores innovative and non-
traditional insurance products to help resolve issues with coverage gaps created due to natural
disasters.
The NAIC, through the Center for Insurance Policy and Research, has also created a Catastrophe
Modeling Center of Excellence, which provides education, training, and regulator support for the
review of catastrophe models, which are used by insurance companies to assess risk for property
insurance. The Center of Excellence works with cat modeling firms to understand how climate
risk and changing weather patterns are or are not incorporated into their models and provides this
information to state insurance regulators. By doing so, it enables state insurance regulators to
better understand the use of these models in projecting risks and losses and identifying factors that
could either increase or reduce risks.

Premiums and Losses
Premiums
In 2023, Massachusetts insureds purchased approximately $3.5 billion in home insurance
coverages, as measured in premium paid, which is 17.9% more than was reported for 2022. Of
the total premium, 93.2% was for traditional homeowners’ insurance. Between 2022 and 2023,
traditional homeowners’ insurance premiums increased by approximately $506.9 million.

Filed Claims
In 2023, insureds filed 86,330 claims with their home insurance companies, 67.6% more than in

Section 44:
2022. Approximately 85.3% of these claims were filed on traditional homeowners’ insurance
policies. As illustrated in Figure 13, owners, condominium and tenant coverage types all

Claim trends tend to fluctuate with damage-causing weather patterns. In 2023, there were eight
designated Massachusetts catastrophes resulting in total estimated Massachusetts property
catastrophe losses of $892.3 million compared to $208.3 million of catastrophe losses in 2022.
As illustrated in Figure 14 (below), the average size of claims incurred decreased 20.3 % for
traditional home insurance, increased by 3.6% for condominiums, and increased by 1.9% for
tenants. The decrease in average claim size for traditional home insurance reflects the mix of
causes of loss causing claims in 2023 (see following section discussing cause of loss).

Analysis of Claims Experience
When recording reported claims, companies categorize submitted claims according to the cause of
loss to project future claims and to develop loss control programs aimed at reducing future losses.
Although companies track losses from both natural events (such as earthquakes) and man-made
events (such as thefts) to develop loss controls that are tailored to various events, in general,
company groups categorized claims as follows:
• Fire, lightning and removal;
• Wind and hail;
• Water damage and freezing;
• Theft;
• Liability and medical; and
• All other.21
As illustrated in Figure 15, over half (54.0%) of total claims were submitted for water losses for
non-flood related water damage. Policyholders also submitted 6,880 claims for fire, lightning, and
removal damages and 11,881 claims for damages classified as “all other losses,” accounting
respectively for 8.0% and 13.8% of total claims filed. There was a total of 17,486 claims filed
under the wind category, which represents 20.3% of total claims filed.

Loss Ratios
Loss Experience Compared to Earned Premiums
Loss ratio (incurred losses divided by earned premium) is a generally accepted measure of the
underwriting success or failure of property insurance. The higher the cost to the company of
reinsurance and other expenses, the lower the company’s loss ratio must be for it to continue to
operate. The higher the loss ratio, the more likely companies will have overall losses after paying
for administrative expenses. Based on the submitted loss data, the 2023 overall loss ratio for all
FAIR Plan and insurance company policies was 51.2% across all types of residences (traditional
homes, condominiums, rentals).

Non-weather events do not usually cause major shifts in loss trends.22 Weather-related events, on
the other hand, can cause significant shifts, depending on the severity of the events. Looking back
on the past 10 years, in 2013 there were no “catastrophe” events that resulted in losses in
Massachusetts, there were two in 2014, six in 2015, three in 2016, one in 2017, five (four weather-
related) in 2018, five in 2019, nine in 2020, six in 2021, three in 2022 and eight in 2023 with the
resulting losses varying with the severity of the events. As presented in Figure 18, the traditional
homeowners loss ratio was 51.3%, the condominium loss ratio was 60.4%, and the tenant coverage
loss ratio was 27.5% in 2023.

Combined Ratios: Loss and Expense Experience Compared to Premiums Collected
The combined ratio (the combination of company expenses and incurred claims costs divided by
earned premium) is a measure of the overall experience of property insurance companies in a
market. A lower combined ratio corresponds with a higher potential profit for the company. The
research which forms the basis for this report does not include information on insurance company
operating expenses. To get a more complete picture of insurers’ financial results, the Division has
incorporated industry expense data that insurance companies submit as part of their annual
financial statements. Figure 19 calculates the percentage of premium that insurance companies
paid out for Massachusetts home insurance losses and the percentages of premium that can be
attributed to various operating expenses. The result is an “Adjusted Combined Ratio” for the
Massachusetts home insurance market.

* For the purpose of these columns, incurred losses includes both incurred losses and allocated loss adjustment expenses (defense and cost containment expenses).
Premium & loss data is voluntary market only. Reinsurance expenses are not included in this calculation and are more fully discussed below.
Figure 19
Figure 19 also presents various home insurance company expenses as a percentage of premiums.
The adjusted combined ratio illustrates how other necessary expenses, when combined with losses,
can be compared to homeowners’ insurance premiums.23 The adjusted combined ratio of 86.1%
for 2023 shows an increase from 77.9% in 2022.
23 Insurance companies pay claims handling expenses (also known as “loss adjustment expenses”) which, if added to incurred
losses to calculate an adjusted loss ratio, provide a clearer picture of the proportion of premium dollars that are devoted to claims
and claims handling expenses. In addition to claims, companies need to pay other expenses, including producer commissions,
taxes and licensing fees, other acquisition costs, and general administrative expenses in order to run their businesses. These
expenses, when combined with the adjusted loss ratio, generate a combined ratio reflecting the overall costs of business during
a calendar year. Finally, some mutual insurance companies make payouts to policyholders in the form of dividends that should
be factored into the analysis, as these are real expenses paid out by companies to their policyholders.

This analysis does not include what insurance companies pay to reinsurers for catastrophe and

statements for Massachusetts homeowners’ business. Based upon information submitted as part of
individual company rate filings, the Division estimates that reinsurance expenses could account
for as much as 25% of a company’s premiums, depending on that company’s portfolio of coastal
exposures. The analysis also omits reinsurance recoveries, or payments from reinsurers to
insurance companies that partially reimburse the insurance company for losses paid.

FAIR Plan Financial Results
During its 2023 fiscal year, the FAIR Plan had an underwriting loss of $20,421,00024 (see
accompanying Statistical Supplement). The mix of FAIR Plan underwriting gains and losses from
year to year as shown in Figure 21 demonstrates the high volatility of results in the home insurance
lines of business. Please note that the FAIR Plan underwriting results are on a direct basis and do
not reflect reinsurance premiums paid by the FAIR Plan or reinsurance recoveries.

25 The MPIUA (and the FAIR Plan in its post-1976 structure) is not an insurance company or legal entity but, instead, a statutorily
mandated association of all the insurance companies writing homeowners’ insurance in the Commonwealth. The FAIR Plan
refers to its underwriting profit as its contribution to surplus and its underwriting loss as its charge against surplus. For the
purpose of this analysis, the report will continue to refer to these as underwriting profit and underwriting loss for owner,
condominium, and tenant policies, as reported by the FAIR Plan.
26 Fair Plan underwriting gain (loss) per policy is calculated by dividing the fiscal year’s underwriting profit (loss) by the number
of fiscal year owner, condominium and tenant policies issued.

Changes in FAIR Plan Rates
Between 1996 and 2010, the FAIR Plan filed to revise its rates 11 times. In April 2013, the FAIR
Plan submitted a request for an overall statewide increase of 6.8% for home insurance forms. The
filing was reviewed in accordance with state law with the hearing on this rate proceeding
concluding in 2014. The filing was disapproved in June 2014.
There have been no filings to revise annual average rates by the FAIR Plan since 2013.

FAIR Plan Clearinghouse
The Massachusetts Property Insurance Underwriting Association (MPIUA) -- the successor to the
FAIR Plan -- serves as a residual market issuing policies on behalf of its member insurers. If the
MPIUA were a traditional insurer, its book of business would be one of the largest in
Massachusetts. Many of the homes currently insured through the MPIUA could potentially qualify
for voluntary market coverage from one or more Massachusetts licensed insurers.
In 2018, the MPIUA Board of Directors authorized and implemented the clearinghouse initiative
to help insurance companies work with homeowners’ producers to give more residual market (i.e.,
FAIR Plan) policyholders the opportunity to find coverage in the voluntary market and to
depopulate the FAIR Plan.
For an insurance company to participate in the Clearinghouse, the company must be an admitted
carrier, licensed to write homeowners’ insurance in Massachusetts and must sign a Clearinghouse
Agreement containing the terms and conditions under which the MPIUA will provide information
to the company.
The information provided to the company does not include any personally identifiable information
but does include certain information about the insured and about the property to assist the member
company in determining whether to offer homeowners’ insurance, through the policy's listed
producer, to an existing FAIR Plan policyholder.
The Clearinghouse Agreement and procedure recognizes the producer's ownership of the renewal
rights in the policy by permitting a MPIUA member company to participate only if the company
first has a contractual relationship with the producer under an agency agreement or a limited
servicing agreement. Further, any offer must be made through the insurance producer listed on the
FAIR Plan policy. Additionally, the company may contact the listed producer to obtain more
information on the risk it is interested in insuring.

Cancellations and Nonrenewals
Under M.G.L. c. 175, §4B, the Division collects information from the top 25 insurers27 and the
FAIR Plan regarding policies in force, total cancellations, and total nonrenewals for each urban
and coastal zip code designated by the Commissioner for additional review and reporting. The data
is collected on a calendar year basis for policies written during the reporting period.28
Aggregate Cancellation/Nonrenewal Data for Urban/Coastal Areas29
Figures 24A and 24B depict the percentage of cancellations and nonrenewals in the designated
areas. The top 25 companies and the FAIR Plan reported that they had 582,200 policies in force in
urban and coastal areas as of December 31, 2023. Of the total policies in force, there were 381,426
policies in urban areas and 200,465 policies in coastal areas. The top 25 companies covered
479,070 homes and the FAIR Plan covered 103,130 homes.
Home insurance products are term products, almost always written with a one-year policy period.
At the end of the one-year period, insurance companies and insureds must decide whether to
continue the coverage for another policy period or to nonrenew the policy. There are no
Massachusetts statutes that limit the reasons for the nonrenewal of coverage by an insurer, but an
insurer must provide the policyholder or policyholder’s insurance producer with at least 45 days
advance notice.
A policy cancellation is the termination of a policy before its one-year effective period has expired.
The policies may be cancelled by the insured, or, under certain circumstances, the insurance
company can cancel the policy.
During 2023, there were a total of 95,847 policies cancelled in urban or coastal areas, with 78,305
cancellations among the top 25 companies and 17,542 cancelled FAIR Plan policies. Of the total
number of cancellations, 72,919 policies were cancelled in urban areas and 22,928 policies were
cancelled in coastal areas.
27 The top 25 insurers, primarily insurer groups that were writing homeowners’ insurance in Massachusetts in 2023 based on written
premium data from the National Association of Insurance Commissioner’s database for homeowners’ multiple peril, are listed
within footnote 6. Some of these insurer groups are better known by the names of their individual insurance companies.
28 The designated zip codes are identified in Exhibit 8A of the Statistical Supplement to this report.
29 Statutory cancellation and nonrenewal provisions can be found in M.G.L. c. 175, §§ 4C, 99 and 193P. Detailed information
identifying the number of cancellations and nonrenewals by zip code for each of the noted companies is included within the
Statistical Supplement to this report.

For purposes of this report, policy nonrenewal refers to the insurance company not offering to
renew a policy when it expires. The top 25 companies and the FAIR Plan report that there was a
total of 9,248 policies nonrenewed in the urban and coastal designated zip codes in 2023, with
7,526 policies nonrenewed among the top 25 companies and 1,722 nonrenewed FAIR Plan
policies. Of the total number of nonrenewals, 4,914 policies were nonrenewed in urban areas and
4,334 policies were nonrenewed in coastal areas.
When examining the information submitted on a company-by-company basis, as illustrated in
Figure 25, three companies – Heritage Insurance Holdings Group, American International Group,
and Barnstable Group had the highest nonrenewal percentages in 2023.

Cancellations for Urban/Coastal Areas
In examining cancellations in urban and coastal areas, the Division asked companies to report
whether cancellations were policyholder-initiated or insurer-initiated, and if insurer-initiated,
whether they were made in the first 60 days (when an insurer may do so without reason) or were
due to nonpayment or for other permitted reasons after the first 60 days of a policy. The Division
requested information regarding the number of cancellations specifically associated with
geographic concerns, as opposed to those undertaken for any other reasons.
The top 25 companies and the FAIR Plan reported:
• 95,847 cancellations during 2023.
o 65,011 were initiated by the policyholder; and
o 30,836 were initiated by the insurer, of which:
▪ 3,447 initiated by the insurer in the first 60 days,
▪ 25,144 cancelled due to nonpayment, and
▪ 2,245 cancelled for other reasons permitted by law.

o 24,601 were initiated by the insurer, of which:
▪ 2,751 initiated in the first 60 days,
▪ 20,207 cancelled due to nonpayment, and
▪ 1,643 cancelled for other reasons permitted by law.
From an examination of those policies that were in coastal areas:
• 22,928 cancellations occurred during 2023.
o 16,693 were initiated by the policyholder; and
o 6,235 were initiated by the insurer, of which:
▪ 696 initiated in the first 60 days,
▪ 4,937 cancelled due to nonpayment, and
▪ 602 cancelled for other reasons permitted by law.
The Division does not ask companies to report data where a renewal offer was made and the
policyholder did not accept the offer, instances where the policyholder requested that the policy
not be renewed, and any nonrenewals connected to an insurance agency that did not produce
business for the company during the years 2021, 2022, and 2023. The Division requested that
companies distinguish nonrenewals of particular policies from nonrenewals that were made based
on (a) the risk of natural perils (i.e., windstorm, hurricane) that are usually covered under the
standard homeowner’s policy and (b) all other reasons.
The top 25 companies reported that there were 7,526 insurer-initiated policies nonrenewed in the
urban and coastal designated zip codes in 2023,30 with 457 of the nonrenewals resulting from
insurer withdrawal from certain geographic areas. Of the reported 7,526 nonrenewals in 2023,
there were 3,598 nonrenewals in those zip codes identified as coastal areas and 3,928 nonrenewals
in those zip codes identified as urban areas.
In addition to the top 25 company nonrenewals, the FAIR Plan did not renew 1,722 policies
according to what is permitted within its Plan of Operations.
30 The designated zip codes are identified in Exhibit 8A of the Statistical Supplement to this report.

__________________________________________________________
Claims History of Policyholders Renewed and Nonrenewed in Urban/Coastal Areas in 2023
The Division asked the top 25 home insurance companies to separately report the claims history
of policies that were renewed or nonrenewed.31
In 2023, of the reported 456,219 urban or coastal policies renewed by the top 25 home insurance
companies, there were an estimated 27,918 claims filed during the reporting period, an average of
61 claims filed per 1,000 policies renewed in 2023. The companies reported having paid
$455,987,004 in claims during the reporting period for those renewed in 2023, with an average
claim size of $13,330.
By comparison, in 2022, of the reported 409,663 policies renewed by the top 25 home insurance
companies, there were an estimated 24,623 claims filed during the reporting period, or an average
of 60 claims filed per 1,000 policies renewed. The companies reported having paid $346,675,538
in claims during the period for those renewed, with an average size of $11,555.
When comparing urban and coastal renewed policies, there were 77 claims filed per 1,000 coastal
policies, as compared to 55 claims filed per 1,000 urban policies. The average claim size for
renewal policies was $14,477 per claim for coastal policies, as compared to $12,669 per claim for
urban policies.
Of the reported 7,069 policies nonrenewed by the top 25 insurance companies, there were a total
of 1,832 claims filed in 2023, or an average of 259 claims filed per 1,000 nonrenewed policies.
The companies reported having paid $40,526,154 in claims on these nonrenewed policies during
the reporting period, with an average claim size of $22,121.
When comparing urban and coastal nonrenewed policies, there were 351 claims filed per 1,000
coastal policies, as compared to 186 claims filed per 1,000 urban policies. The average claim size
for nonrenewed policies was $16,000 per claim for coastal policies, as compared to $31,404 per
claim for urban policies.
Summary of Cancellation/Nonrenewals in Urban/Coastal Areas
It is apparent from survey data that insureds who have been nonrenewed have, on average, filed
more claims and more expensive claims during the experience period compared to insureds who
were renewed. Nevertheless, a significant number of insureds whose policies were renewed also
filed claims. In 2022, approximately 30,001 of those whose coverage was renewed did file claims
sometime in the prior three years and companies made payments of $346,675,538 on these claims.
31 In collecting the claims history for those policies renewed in 2023, the Division requested in its survey that the company report
the number of claims reported and dollar value of claims paid during each of 2021, 2022 and 2023. Similarly, in collecting the
claims history for those policies nonrenewed in 2023, the Division requested that the company report the number of claims
reported and dollar of claims paid during each of 2021, 2022 and 2023.
36
Massachusetts Division of Insurance Annual Home Insurance Report for Calendar Year 2023
__________________________________________________________
In 2023, we calculate that 34,208 of those whose coverage was renewed did file claims sometime
in the prior three years and companies made payments of $455,987,004 on these claims.
In urban areas, 96.8% of those policyholders with claims were renewed by their insurers. Similarly,

Section 77:
91.9% of those policyholders with claims in coastal areas were renewed by their insurance
companies32. See Figures 27A and 27B.

Massachusetts Division of Insurance
Annual Home Insurance Report
For Calendar Year 2023
Michael T. Caljouw
Commissioner of Insurance

Introduction
Since 1996, the Division of Insurance (Division) annually produces a home insurance
report pursuant to M.G.L. c. 175, §§ 4A & 4B. For the current report, insurers and their
statistical agents were required to provide aggregate 2021, 2022 and 2023 data sorted
according to Massachusetts zip codes and Insurance Services Office, Inc. (ISO) territories.
The report is based primarily on responses from companies writing home insurance
policies in Massachusetts and from statistical reporting organizations reflecting the
experience of companies in the home insurance market. Unless otherwise noted in the
report, references to “home insurance” include traditional homeowners’ insurance as well
as condominium and rental insurance. It is important to note that while some of the results
in this report apply to all home insurance policies in the Commonwealth, other results apply
to policies written only by the 25 home insurance companies with the largest market share
in Massachusetts and the FAIR Plan, and/or only to particular zip codes in the
Commonwealth. These zip codes are identified as “designated” zip codes because they are
the zip codes that the Commissioner of Insurance (Commissioner) has specified to be
included in the report due to historical skepticism regarding availability of coverage in
these areas. The zip codes include both coastal areas and urban areas. This report provides
specific scrutiny in response to such concerns. A list of the top 25 home insurance
companies can be found under footnote 6. The full list of designated zip codes can be found
in Exhibit 8A of the Statistical Supplement to this report.
This report was prepared by the State Rating Bureau staff of the Division of Insurance
(Matthew M. Mancini, State Rating Bureau Director, Spase Kace, State Rating Bureau
Researcher, Caleb E. Huntington, State Rating Bureau Mathematician, Bashiru Abubakare,
State Rating Bureau Actuary / Statistician).
The Division makes all appropriate efforts to check the completeness and consistency
of data reported by insurance companies and their statistical agents but does rely on
the insurance companies for the accuracy of all reported information.
Many of the statistical tables incorporated in previous versions of this report have been
included in a separate Statistical Supplement. The Statistical Supplement can be found on
the Division’s website at https://www.mass.gov/service-details/the-commissioners-report-
on-home-insurance.

*Policies reflect reported house-years. Ahouse-year is defined as one house insured for one year, and is
calculated based on the term of the policy.
• Total enrollment in the FAIR Plan1 decreased by 5,974 policies in 2023, with the FAIR Plan
writing 8.3% of 2023 home insurance premium.
• For the Cape and Islands market, the FAIR Plan accounted for 33.0% of policies.
There were eight events that were classified as loss catastrophes2 in 2023, which resulted in
estimated property losses in Massachusetts of approximately $892.3 million. The estimated
property losses consisted primarily of flood, hail, tornado, wind, snow and freezing events.
1 The FAIR Plan is the residual market for homeowners’ insurance operated by the Massachusetts Property Insurance and
Underwriting Association (“MPIUA”).
2 Property Claims Services, Inc. (“PCS”), a subsidiary of ISO, Inc., defines catastrophes in the United States, Puerto Rico, and the
U.S. Virgin Islands as events that cause $25 million or more in direct insured losses to property and affect a significant number
of policyholders and insurers. PCS has also provided Massachusetts property loss estimates as a result of a catastrophe.

Composition of the Massachusetts Market
Home insurance covers non-commercial property for risks to structural damage and personal
property, as well as for the risk of personal liability claims. In 2023, insurance companies collected
approximately $3.4 billion in written premium for home insurance policies in Massachusetts, as
noted in the chart below3.
Although it may be fiscally prudent to protect one’s assets from loss or damage, there are no laws
that require property owners to purchase home insurance.4 Figure 1 shows the total number of
households covered under owners’ home insurance (condominium, traditional
homeowners and rental insurance) in the past three years as calculated by “written house-years,”
which is a measure equivalent to average number of homes insured. There were 69 licensed

line of business.
4 Even though home insurance is not required by law, most lenders will require that an owner have sufficient home insurance as
a condition of a mortgage on the property. Further, in accordance with Chapter 177 of the Acts of 2014, lenders are prohibited
from requiring flood insurance coverage in an amount greater than the outstanding mortgage balance.

Most of the coverage in Massachusetts is provided by local carriers, regional carriers or national
carriers based in Massachusetts. Among the top 10 home insurance groups in the market, only
five– the Travelers Group, the Liberty Mutual Group, Chubb Ltd Group, the Amica Mutual Group,
and United Services Automobile Association Group – offer home insurance nationally. The
remaining companies are regional companies offering coverage primarily in the Northeast.
The Mapfre Insurance Group, which is the parent company of Commerce Insurance Company,
had the largest share of the 2023 voluntary (i.e., non-FAIR Plan) market with 12.5% of the home
insurance premium written. Each of the next nine largest insurance groups had between 9.2% and
3.7% of the voluntary market. Extending the analysis to include the 25 insurance groups with the
largest Massachusetts home insurance market share,6 the top 25 groups together account for 91.7%

of the non-FAIR-Plan Massachusetts market. In addition to the top 25, another 44 groups and 4
individual companies wrote homeowners’ insurance in Massachusetts in 2023, none of them with
a market share greater than 0.67%. Together these 44 groups and 4 individual companies wrote
7.8% of the Massachusetts market in 2023.7
The FAIR Plan
The FAIR Plan is a residual market mechanism originally created in 1968. Similar plans for “Fair
Access to Insurance Requirements” -- FAIR -- were established in other jurisdictions during the
same period pursuant to the federal Urban Property Protection and Reinsurance Act of 1968. The
FAIR Plan was substantially restructured in 1976 and again in 1996 and is currently known as the
Massachusetts Property Insurance and Underwriting Association (“MPIUA”). Due to continuity
of mission, membership, and operations, the terms MPIUA and FAIR Plan are often used
interchangeably. By statute, the FAIR Plan is required to offer coverage to homes with a
replacement cost of up to $1 million.8 If an owner cannot obtain a policy from an admitted
insurance company and the home’s value is beyond what the FAIR Plan will cover, an owner can
seek coverage in the surplus lines market.9

7 Based on the National Association of Insurance Commissioners’ 2023 data on home insurance multiple peril line of business by
company group. Company groups often have more than one licensed insurer writing home insurance.
8 See M.G.L. c. 175C, §4(4a), which requires all home insurance companies licensed to and engaged in writing property insurance
in the Commonwealth to be members of a joint underwriting association that shall provide basic property insurance to eligible
applicants who are otherwise unable to obtain such coverage in the voluntary market.
9 Surplus lines companies are insurers which are not "licensed" or “admitted” in Massachusetts although they are "licensed" in
another state (or country). Such insurers may issue coverage only through specially licensed surplus lines brokers. This document
does not include statistical information on the surplus lines market.

ways:
Berkshire and Franklin Counties include ISO territory 50;
Hampden and Hampshire Counties include ISO territories 47, 48 and 49;
Worcester County includes ISO territories 45 and 46;
Middlesex County includes ISO territories 41, 42, 43 and 44;
Essex County includes ISO territories 38, 39 and 40;
Suffolk County (including the City of Boston) includes ISO territories 2, 3, 4, 5 and 11;

The proportion of FAIR Plan policies written by area varies greatly. While the FAIR Plan writes
33.0% of the home insurance for the Cape and Islands (comprising Barnstable, Dukes and
Nantucket counties), it writes under 10% of the policies in each of the other counties in the state
(see Figure 7).
Also, between 2022 and 2023, the number of home insurance policies remained fairly consistent
in most counties (see Figure 8).

Coverage Options and Limitations
Wind Deductibles
To reduce their financial risk, many home insurance companies have amended their standard
policies to include mandatory wind deductibles.14 These deductibles may apply to any wind-related
damage that occurs in specified coastal territories, typically located in Bristol, Plymouth,
Barnstable, Dukes and Nantucket counties, or within a certain distance from the shore. These
deductibles are imposed either as flat dollar amounts or as a percentage of the covered dwelling
amount.15 The Division requires that insurers provide consumers with clear disclosures of the
deductibles before they purchase coverage. This is often communicated on the declaration pages
that would accompany the policy/endorsement packet sent to the insured.
According to information submitted to the Division from the FAIR Plan and the top 25 companies
in the market, all but six companies reported that they have mandatory wind deductibles that are
part of the coverage they offer in the market, with deductibles up to 5% of the coverage for the
main structure.16 The largest wind deductibles are in the coastal parts of Bristol, Plymouth,
Barnstable, Dukes and Nantucket counties.
Of all policyholders living in a coastal or urban area who are covered by the FAIR Plan or the top
25 home insurance companies, 33.6% had a mandatory wind deductible applicable to their
coverage in 2023. In coastal areas, 60.0% had a mandatory wind deductible. In urban areas, 19.9%
had a mandatory wind deductible.
The Division encourages insurance companies to allow consumers to reduce or eliminate their
wind deductibles by taking steps to mitigate the potential exposure of their property in the event
of a wind event, such as by installing hurricane shutters or shatterproof glass, hurricane-proof
garages or patios, and other doors and/or roof/foundation anchor bolts. The Division has worked
with many carriers to establish clear rules for mitigation programs and to establish ways to
document that mitigation steps have been taken.
Flood Coverage and Exclusions
In the United States, home insurance policies have not traditionally covered damage associated
with floods.17 Recognizing this lack of protection, Congress enacted legislation in 1968 to create
the National Flood Insurance Program (“NFIP”), which is administered by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency (“FEMA”). Under the program, the government plays the role of underwriter
14 A wind deductible is a deductible that applies only to losses caused by wind.
15 The FAIR Plan, for example, currently requires certain insureds to have a minimum named storm percentage deductible of 1%
to 5% of the coverage amount for the dwelling and attached structures, or a minimum fixed dollar named storm deductible of up
to $5,000, depending on the property’s county, distance from the coast and coverage.

and assumes the financial risk for damages while relying on private insurance agents to sell
policies.
Flood insurance is mandatory only for those homes that have been identified by FEMA mapping
as located in high-risk flood areas and that are mortgaged through a federally backed lender.
However, the NFIP makes flood coverage available for all property holders if the property is in an
approved NFIP community. The property does not need to be in a flood plain to qualify for
coverage.
Prior to the current re-mapping of flood zones in Massachusetts, FEMA had estimated that more
than 11 million U.S. homes were in flood zones and that about one-fourth of the homes located in
Special Flood Hazard Areas (“SFHA”)18 were covered by NFIP-issued or NFIP-backed flood
insurance. The proportion of property with flood coverage is believed to be low because many
people underestimate the risk of flooding.
As presented in Figure 9, FEMA reports that 54,997 policyholders in Massachusetts had flood
insurance in 2023, which is an increase of 6.2% from the 51,805 reported for 2022.

Flood insurance is required for insurable structures within high-risk areas to protect Federal financial investments and assistance
used for acquisition and/or construction purposes within communities participating in the National Flood Insurance Program.
The NFIP continually updates statistics on national purchases of flood insurance and periodically
produces special reports on the matter. According to the NFIP’s monthly countrywide policy

statistics, as of 6/30/2023 Massachusetts ranked 14th in the country in the number of policies in
place through the flood insurance program.
The U.S. Census Bureau ranked Massachusetts as the 16th most populous state.19 While population
does not necessarily correlate with flood exposure, the number of Massachusetts homes with flood
insurance continues to be relatively low for 2023 (See Figure 10). The Division issued Bulletin
2006-05, in 2006, to remind insurers and insurance producers to offer flood insurance to all state
residents.

Since the 1970s, NFIP rates were predominantly based on relatively static measurements,
emphasizing a property’s elevation within a zone on a Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM). This
approach did not incorporate as many flooding variables as Risk Rating 2.0. Risk Rating 2.0 is the
new methodology used by FEMA and essentially places homes in market “baskets”. The baskets
contain single-family homes with similar property and policy coverage characteristics for that
region. Rating now more resembles how risk is assessed for other types of insurance. One of the
goals of Risk Rating 2.0 is to deliver rates that are actuarially sound, equitable, easier to understand
and better reflect a property’s flood risk. FEMA is building on years of investment in flood hazard
information by incorporating private sector data sets, catastrophe models and evolving actuarial
science. With Risk Rating 2.0, FEMA now has the capability and tools to address rating disparities

by incorporating more flood risk variables. These include flood frequency, multiple flood types—
river overflow, storm surge, coastal erosion and heavy rainfall—and distance to a water source
along with property characteristics such as elevation and the cost to rebuild. Risk Rating 2.0
became effective October 1, 2021, for new flood policies and April 1, 2022 for renewal flood
policies.
In recent years private insurers have increased the residential flood coverage they provide in
Massachusetts. In 2018, there was $4,857,911 of direct written premium on 1,668 Massachusetts
private residential flood policies in force (at year-end 2018) plus an additional $693,558 direct
written premium on 3,731 private residential flood endorsements. By 2023, private flood
coverage had increased to $8,705,496 of Massachusetts direct written premium on 4,558
residential flood policies (year-end 2023), and $1,792,571 of direct written premium on 2,307
private residential endorsements.20
Climate Mitigation
To better understand Massachusetts’ carrier’s efforts to address the risks of storms, wildfire and
other climate risks, the Division of Insurance again called a special examination of the top 25
Massachusetts home insurers and the FAIR Plan. The examination asked about credits or
discounts offered by each company in calendar year 2023 as well as how policyholder pre-loss
mitigation measures and community-level loss resiliency efforts impacted rates, deductibles and
the carrier’s capacity to write homeowners’ insurance in the Commonwealth.
Eighteen (18) of the surveyed companies reported that they give premium credits or reduce rates
when homeowners take certain carrier-specific loss mitigation measures including hurricane
shutters, hurricane-resistant glass, roof/foundation tie-downs, roof geometry, and back-up power
supplies.
Several insurers reported premium credits for general mitigation factors, such as construction
compliance with specific building codes, or housing meeting Institute for Building and Home
Safety certification requirements.
Specific results from the survey include the following:
• One insurer gives credit for LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design)
certified homes.

https://content.naic.org/industry_private_flood_data_call.htm
15

Massachusetts Division of Insurance Annual Home Insurance Report for Calendar Year 2023
__________________________________________________________
• Six (6) of the surveyed companies reduce or eliminate wind deductibles in response to
mitigation measures, such as for hurricane shutters, hurricane-resistant glass, reinforced
doors, and roof or foundation tie-downs.
• Eight (8) of the surveyed insurers reported that considering their policyholders’ climate-
related mitigation measures through lower rates or lower deductibles has resulted in
increased capacity to write homeowners’ insurance in Massachusetts.
• Fourteen (14) of the surveyed insurers reported the increased availability of actuarially sound
data reflecting municipal-level or community-level resilience to climate-related causes of
loss. The most cited data sources were commercial catastrophe model loss simulations and
ISO’s Building Code Effectiveness Grading (BCEG). Insurers also indicated that there was
data available about the year of construction of housing in a community, which can be
compared to the code in effect the time of construction.
Overall, many of the surveyed insurers are taking mitigation measures into account when
developing rates for home insurance products. By considering the actuarial data, carriers are
progressively offering benefits in return for mitigation efforts that can be expected to reduce
projected losses.
The Division of Insurance encourages insurance companies to allow consumers to reduce or
eliminate deductibles by taking steps to mitigate the potential exposure of their property in the
event of a weather event.
These efforts also continue through the National Association of Insurance Commissioners
(NAIC) Climate and Resiliency (EX) Task Force which serves as the coordinating body for
discussion and engagement on climate-related risk and resiliency issues, including discussion
among state insurance regulators, industry, and other stakeholders.
The Task Force has divided its projects among several workstreams:
Pre-Disaster Mitigation Workstream – As noted, some insurance companies writing home
insurance coverage give premium credits or discounts, or reduce or eliminate wind deductibles,
when homeowners take certain loss mitigation measures. The Division of Insurance, and state
insurance regulators across the country, prioritize pre-disaster mitigation because protecting
consumers begins long before a wildfire starts, or a storm makes landfall. This work has extended
to collaborations with the Insurance Institute for Business and Home Safety (IBHS) to understand
more about strengthening building codes and the IBHS “fortified program”.
Climate Risk Disclosure Workstream – In 2022, the NAIC adopted a revised Climate Risk
Disclosure Survey that aligns with the Financial Stability Board’s Task Force on Climate-
Related Financial Disclosure (TCFD), which is the leading international standard for climate
reporting for the insurance sector. The goal of the Survey is to provide insurance regulators with
information about the assessment of risks posed by climate change to insurance companies and
the actions companies are taking in response to their understanding of climate risks.
16

Massachusetts Division of Insurance Annual Home Insurance Report for Calendar Year 2023
__________________________________________________________
Specifically, the Survey allows the Division to better understand how insurance companies are
considering and addressing climate change and climate risk in their business operations,
underwriting and reserves, which in turn, impact the availability of coverage for homeowners.
Solvency Workstream – The Solvency Workstream evaluates financial regulatory approaches to
climate risk and resiliency, recommending enhancements to regulator solvency tools. State
insurance regulators have updated the Risk Based Capital (RBC) formula, which is used to
monitor the capital adequacy of insurance companies to ensure their ability to pay claims, to
include specific charges for hurricane, earthquake, and most recently, wildfire risks. These steps
help ensure that insurance carriers remain solvent and have sufficient claims-paying capacity,
which we will get into later in this report.
Innovation and Technology Workstream – This workstream explores innovative and non-
traditional insurance products to help resolve issues with coverage gaps created due to natural
disasters.
The NAIC, through the Center for Insurance Policy and Research, has also created a Catastrophe
Modeling Center of Excellence, which provides education, training, and regulator support for the
review of catastrophe models, which are used by insurance companies to assess risk for property
insurance. The Center of Excellence works with cat modeling firms to understand how climate
risk and changing weather patterns are or are not incorporated into their models and provides this
information to state insurance regulators. By doing so, it enables state insurance regulators to
better understand the use of these models in projecting risks and losses and identifying factors that
could either increase or reduce risks.

Premiums and Losses
Premiums
In 2023, Massachusetts insureds purchased approximately $3.5 billion in home insurance
coverages, as measured in premium paid, which is 17.9% more than was reported for 2022. Of
the total premium, 93.2% was for traditional homeowners’ insurance. Between 2022 and 2023,
traditional homeowners’ insurance premiums increased by approximately $506.9 million.

Analysis of Claims Experience
When recording reported claims, companies categorize submitted claims according to the cause of
loss to project future claims and to develop loss control programs aimed at reducing future losses.
Although companies track losses from both natural events (such as earthquakes) and man-made
events (such as thefts) to develop loss controls that are tailored to various events, in general,
company groups categorized claims as follows:
• Fire, lightning and removal;
• Wind and hail;
• Water damage and freezing;
• Theft;
• Liability and medical; and
• All other.21
As illustrated in Figure 15, over half (54.0%) of total claims were submitted for water losses for
non-flood related water damage. Policyholders also submitted 6,880 claims for fire, lightning, and
removal damages and 11,881 claims for damages classified as “all other losses,” accounting
respectively for 8.0% and 13.8% of total claims filed. There was a total of 17,486 claims filed
under the wind category, which represents 20.3% of total claims filed.

Loss Ratios
Loss Experience Compared to Earned Premiums
Loss ratio (incurred losses divided by earned premium) is a generally accepted measure of the
underwriting success or failure of property insurance. The higher the cost to the company of
reinsurance and other expenses, the lower the company’s loss ratio must be for it to continue to
operate. The higher the loss ratio, the more likely companies will have overall losses after paying
for administrative expenses. Based on the submitted loss data, the 2023 overall loss ratio for all
FAIR Plan and insurance company policies was 51.2% across all types of residences (traditional
homes, condominiums, rentals).

Non-weather events do not usually cause major shifts in loss trends.22 Weather-related events, on
the other hand, can cause significant shifts, depending on the severity of the events. Looking back
on the past 10 years, in 2013 there were no “catastrophe” events that resulted in losses in
Massachusetts, there were two in 2014, six in 2015, three in 2016, one in 2017, five (four weather-
related) in 2018, five in 2019, nine in 2020, six in 2021, three in 2022 and eight in 2023 with the
resulting losses varying with the severity of the events. As presented in Figure 18, the traditional
homeowners loss ratio was 51.3%, the condominium loss ratio was 60.4%, and the tenant coverage
loss ratio was 27.5% in 2023.

Combined Ratios: Loss and Expense Experience Compared to Premiums Collected
The combined ratio (the combination of company expenses and incurred claims costs divided by
earned premium) is a measure of the overall experience of property insurance companies in a
market. A lower combined ratio corresponds with a higher potential profit for the company. The
research which forms the basis for this report does not include information on insurance company
operating expenses. To get a more complete picture of insurers’ financial results, the Division has
incorporated industry expense data that insurance companies submit as part of their annual
financial statements. Figure 19 calculates the percentage of premium that insurance companies
paid out for Massachusetts home insurance losses and the percentages of premium that can be
attributed to various operating expenses. The result is an “Adjusted Combined Ratio” for the
Massachusetts home insurance market.

* For the purpose of these columns, incurred losses includes both incurred losses and allocated loss adjustment expenses (defense and cost containment expenses).
Premium & loss data is voluntary market only. Reinsurance expenses are not included in this calculation and are more fully discussed below.
Figure 19
Figure 19 also presents various home insurance company expenses as a percentage of premiums.
The adjusted combined ratio illustrates how other necessary expenses, when combined with losses,
can be compared to homeowners’ insurance premiums.23 The adjusted combined ratio of 86.1%
for 2023 shows an increase from 77.9% in 2022.
23 Insurance companies pay claims handling expenses (also known as “loss adjustment expenses”) which, if added to incurred
losses to calculate an adjusted loss ratio, provide a clearer picture of the proportion of premium dollars that are devoted to claims
and claims handling expenses. In addition to claims, companies need to pay other expenses, including producer commissions,
taxes and licensing fees, other acquisition costs, and general administrative expenses in order to run their businesses. These
expenses, when combined with the adjusted loss ratio, generate a combined ratio reflecting the overall costs of business during
a calendar year. Finally, some mutual insurance companies make payouts to policyholders in the form of dividends that should
be factored into the analysis, as these are real expenses paid out by companies to their policyholders.

individual company rate filings, the Division estimates that reinsurance expenses could account
for as much as 25% of a company’s premiums, depending on that company’s portfolio of coastal
exposures. The analysis also omits reinsurance recoveries, or payments from reinsurers to
insurance companies that partially reimburse the insurance company for losses paid.

FAIR Plan Financial Results
During its 2023 fiscal year, the FAIR Plan had an underwriting loss of $20,421,00024 (see
accompanying Statistical Supplement). The mix of FAIR Plan underwriting gains and losses from
year to year as shown in Figure 21 demonstrates the high volatility of results in the home insurance
lines of business. Please note that the FAIR Plan underwriting results are on a direct basis and do
not reflect reinsurance premiums paid by the FAIR Plan or reinsurance recoveries.

25 The MPIUA (and the FAIR Plan in its post-1976 structure) is not an insurance company or legal entity but, instead, a statutorily
mandated association of all the insurance companies writing homeowners’ insurance in the Commonwealth. The FAIR Plan
refers to its underwriting profit as its contribution to surplus and its underwriting loss as its charge against surplus. For the
purpose of this analysis, the report will continue to refer to these as underwriting profit and underwriting loss for owner,
condominium, and tenant policies, as reported by the FAIR Plan.
26 Fair Plan underwriting gain (loss) per policy is calculated by dividing the fiscal year’s underwriting profit (loss) by the number
of fiscal year owner, condominium and tenant policies issued.

Changes in FAIR Plan Rates
Between 1996 and 2010, the FAIR Plan filed to revise its rates 11 times. In April 2013, the FAIR
Plan submitted a request for an overall statewide increase of 6.8% for home insurance forms. The
filing was reviewed in accordance with state law with the hearing on this rate proceeding
concluding in 2014. The filing was disapproved in June 2014.
There have been no filings to revise annual average rates by the FAIR Plan since 2013.

FAIR Plan Clearinghouse
The Massachusetts Property Insurance Underwriting Association (MPIUA) -- the successor to the
FAIR Plan -- serves as a residual market issuing policies on behalf of its member insurers. If the
MPIUA were a traditional insurer, its book of business would be one of the largest in
Massachusetts. Many of the homes currently insured through the MPIUA could potentially qualify
for voluntary market coverage from one or more Massachusetts licensed insurers.
In 2018, the MPIUA Board of Directors authorized and implemented the clearinghouse initiative
to help insurance companies work with homeowners’ producers to give more residual market (i.e.,
FAIR Plan) policyholders the opportunity to find coverage in the voluntary market and to
depopulate the FAIR Plan.
For an insurance company to participate in the Clearinghouse, the company must be an admitted
carrier, licensed to write homeowners’ insurance in Massachusetts and must sign a Clearinghouse
Agreement containing the terms and conditions under which the MPIUA will provide information
to the company.
The information provided to the company does not include any personally identifiable information
but does include certain information about the insured and about the property to assist the member
company in determining whether to offer homeowners’ insurance, through the policy's listed
producer, to an existing FAIR Plan policyholder.
The Clearinghouse Agreement and procedure recognizes the producer's ownership of the renewal
rights in the policy by permitting a MPIUA member company to participate only if the company
first has a contractual relationship with the producer under an agency agreement or a limited
servicing agreement. Further, any offer must be made through the insurance producer listed on the
FAIR Plan policy. Additionally, the company may contact the listed producer to obtain more
information on the risk it is interested in insuring.

Cancellations and Nonrenewals
Under M.G.L. c. 175, §4B, the Division collects information from the top 25 insurers27 and the
FAIR Plan regarding policies in force, total cancellations, and total nonrenewals for each urban
and coastal zip code designated by the Commissioner for additional review and reporting. The data
is collected on a calendar year basis for policies written during the reporting period.28
Aggregate Cancellation/Nonrenewal Data for Urban/Coastal Areas29
Figures 24A and 24B depict the percentage of cancellations and nonrenewals in the designated
areas. The top 25 companies and the FAIR Plan reported that they had 582,200 policies in force in
urban and coastal areas as of December 31, 2023. Of the total policies in force, there were 381,426
policies in urban areas and 200,465 policies in coastal areas. The top 25 companies covered
479,070 homes and the FAIR Plan covered 103,130 homes.
Home insurance products are term products, almost always written with a one-year policy period.
At the end of the one-year period, insurance companies and insureds must decide whether to
continue the coverage for another policy period or to nonrenew the policy. There are no
Massachusetts statutes that limit the reasons for the nonrenewal of coverage by an insurer, but an
insurer must provide the policyholder or policyholder’s insurance producer with at least 45 days
advance notice.
A policy cancellation is the termination of a policy before its one-year effective period has expired.
The policies may be cancelled by the insured, or, under certain circumstances, the insurance
company can cancel the policy.
During 2023, there were a total of 95,847 policies cancelled in urban or coastal areas, with 78,305
cancellations among the top 25 companies and 17,542 cancelled FAIR Plan policies. Of the total
number of cancellations, 72,919 policies were cancelled in urban areas and 22,928 policies were
cancelled in coastal areas.
27 The top 25 insurers, primarily insurer groups that were writing homeowners’ insurance in Massachusetts in 2023 based on written
premium data from the National Association of Insurance Commissioner’s database for homeowners’ multiple peril, are listed
within footnote 6. Some of these insurer groups are better known by the names of their individual insurance companies.
28 The designated zip codes are identified in Exhibit 8A of the Statistical Supplement to this report.
29 Statutory cancellation and nonrenewal provisions can be found in M.G.L. c. 175, §§ 4C, 99 and 193P. Detailed information
identifying the number of cancellations and nonrenewals by zip code for each of the noted companies is included within the
Statistical Supplement to this report.

For purposes of this report, policy nonrenewal refers to the insurance company not offering to
renew a policy when it expires. The top 25 companies and the FAIR Plan report that there was a
total of 9,248 policies nonrenewed in the urban and coastal designated zip codes in 2023, with
7,526 policies nonrenewed among the top 25 companies and 1,722 nonrenewed FAIR Plan
policies. Of the total number of nonrenewals, 4,914 policies were nonrenewed in urban areas and
4,334 policies were nonrenewed in coastal areas.
When examining the information submitted on a company-by-company basis, as illustrated in
Figure 25, three companies – Heritage Insurance Holdings Group, American International Group,
and Barnstable Group had the highest nonrenewal percentages in 2023.

Cancellations for Urban/Coastal Areas
In examining cancellations in urban and coastal areas, the Division asked companies to report
whether cancellations were policyholder-initiated or insurer-initiated, and if insurer-initiated,
whether they were made in the first 60 days (when an insurer may do so without reason) or were
due to nonpayment or for other permitted reasons after the first 60 days of a policy. The Division
requested information regarding the number of cancellations specifically associated with
geographic concerns, as opposed to those undertaken for any other reasons.
The top 25 companies and the FAIR Plan reported:
• 95,847 cancellations during 2023.
o 65,011 were initiated by the policyholder; and
o 30,836 were initiated by the insurer, of which:
▪ 3,447 initiated by the insurer in the first 60 days,
▪ 25,144 cancelled due to nonpayment, and
▪ 2,245 cancelled for other reasons permitted by law.

o 48,318 were initiated by the policyholder; and
o 24,601 were initiated by the insurer, of which:
▪ 2,751 initiated in the first 60 days,
▪ 20,207 cancelled due to nonpayment, and
▪ 1,643 cancelled for other reasons permitted by law.
From an examination of those policies that were in coastal areas:
• 22,928 cancellations occurred during 2023.
o 16,693 were initiated by the policyholder; and
o 6,235 were initiated by the insurer, of which:
▪ 696 initiated in the first 60 days,
▪ 4,937 cancelled due to nonpayment, and
▪ 602 cancelled for other reasons permitted by law.
The Division does not ask companies to report data where a renewal offer was made and the
policyholder did not accept the offer, instances where the policyholder requested that the policy
not be renewed, and any nonrenewals connected to an insurance agency that did not produce
business for the company during the years 2021, 2022, and 2023. The Division requested that
companies distinguish nonrenewals of particular policies from nonrenewals that were made based
on (a) the risk of natural perils (i.e., windstorm, hurricane) that are usually covered under the
standard homeowner’s policy and (b) all other reasons.
The top 25 companies reported that there were 7,526 insurer-initiated policies nonrenewed in the
urban and coastal designated zip codes in 2023,30 with 457 of the nonrenewals resulting from
insurer withdrawal from certain geographic areas. Of the reported 7,526 nonrenewals in 2023,
there were 3,598 nonrenewals in those zip codes identified as coastal areas and 3,928 nonrenewals
in those zip codes identified as urban areas.
In addition to the top 25 company nonrenewals, the FAIR Plan did not renew 1,722 policies
according to what is permitted within its Plan of Operations.
30 The designated zip codes are identified in Exhibit 8A of the Statistical Supplement to this report.

Claims History of Policyholders Renewed and Nonrenewed in Urban/Coastal Areas in 2023
The Division asked the top 25 home insurance companies to separately report the claims history
of policies that were renewed or nonrenewed.31
In 2023, of the reported 456,219 urban or coastal policies renewed by the top 25 home insurance
companies, there were an estimated 27,918 claims filed during the reporting period, an average of
61 claims filed per 1,000 policies renewed in 2023. The companies reported having paid
$455,987,004 in claims during the reporting period for those renewed in 2023, with an average
claim size of $13,330.
By comparison, in 2022, of the reported 409,663 policies renewed by the top 25 home insurance
companies, there were an estimated 24,623 claims filed during the reporting period, or an average
of 60 claims filed per 1,000 policies renewed. The companies reported having paid $346,675,538
in claims during the period for those renewed, with an average size of $11,555.
When comparing urban and coastal renewed policies, there were 77 claims filed per 1,000 coastal
policies, as compared to 55 claims filed per 1,000 urban policies. The average claim size for
renewal policies was $14,477 per claim for coastal policies, as compared to $12,669 per claim for
urban policies.
Of the reported 7,069 policies nonrenewed by the top 25 insurance companies, there were a total
of 1,832 claims filed in 2023, or an average of 259 claims filed per 1,000 nonrenewed policies.
The companies reported having paid $40,526,154 in claims on these nonrenewed policies during
the reporting period, with an average claim size of $22,121.
When comparing urban and coastal nonrenewed policies, there were 351 claims filed per 1,000
coastal policies, as compared to 186 claims filed per 1,000 urban policies. The average claim size
for nonrenewed policies was $16,000 per claim for coastal policies, as compared to $31,404 per
claim for urban policies.
Summary of Cancellation/Nonrenewals in Urban/Coastal Areas
It is apparent from survey data that insureds who have been nonrenewed have, on average, filed
more claims and more expensive claims during the experience period compared to insureds who
were renewed. Nevertheless, a significant number of insureds whose policies were renewed also
filed claims. In 2022, approximately 30,001 of those whose coverage was renewed did file claims
sometime in the prior three years and companies made payments of $346,675,538 on these claims.
31 In collecting the claims history for those policies renewed in 2023, the Division requested in its survey that the company report
the number of claims reported and dollar value of claims paid during each of 2021, 2022 and 2023. Similarly, in collecting the
claims history for those policies nonrenewed in 2023, the Division requested that the company report the number of claims
