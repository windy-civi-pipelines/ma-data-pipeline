Massachusetts Division of Insurance
Credit Insurance Report
For the 2023 Calendar Year
Kevin P. Beagan
Acting Commissioner of Insurance

Acknowledgements
The following report was prepared by the Health Care Access Bureau (“HCAB”), under the
supervision of Kevin P. Beagan, Acting Commissioner. The report is primarily based on
submissions reflecting the experience of insurers offering credit insurance in Massachusetts.
Unless otherwise noted in the report, references to “credit insurance” include credit life insurance,
credit disability income insurance, and credit involuntary unemployment insurance.
The Division makes all appropriate efforts to check the completeness and consistency of data
reported by insurance companies but relies on insurers to ensure the accuracy of all reported
information.

SUMMARY
As required by M.G.L. c. 175, §117C(b), the Division of Insurance (“DOI”) collects information
from all carriers with credit insurance experience in 2023.
Credit insurance business has declined steadily over the past 10 years to a level of approximately
$2 million market-wide1 in 2023. It is believed that this decrease is because credit insurance
products regulated by the DOI have been replaced by debt cancellation/suspension products
offered through banking organizations that are not considered insurance and are regulated by the
federal Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.2
1 Excluding Credit Property insurance, which is outside the scope of this report.
2 The federal Office of the Comptroller of the Currency regulates debt cancellation agreements and debt suspension
agreements sponsored by national banks according to 12 CFR Part 37.

Overview of Credit Insurance
Credit insurance is a line of insurance coverage that may be offered to debtors of a lending
organization for lines of credit other than a residential first mortgage (also known as “first line on
a residential property”).3 Depending on the coverage purchased, credit insurance may pay all of a
debt or the required minimum periodic payments. Under Massachusetts law, it is illegal for a lender
to require a person to buy credit insurance as a condition of obtaining a loan.4 Potential insureds
(debtors) are required, by regulation, to receive certain disclosure materials prior to any such
coverage becoming effective. 5
Types of Credit Insurance
Credit Life Insurance
Credit life insurance is designed to pay off a specific debt, such as a car loan, in the event of the
death of the insured. Unlike traditional life insurance, the beneficiary on the credit life insurance
policy is the entity who offers the credit (the “creditor”), not a friend or family member of the
insured. Credit life insurance in Massachusetts must adhere to the following standards set forth in
M.G.L. c. 175, §110:
(1) the death benefit may not be more than $125,000,
(2) the insurance coverage may not be for more than a 15-year period,
(3) the insurance coverage may only be for the remaining outstanding balance of a debt,
and
(4) the coverage ends when the debt is discharged.
Pursuant to M.G.L. c. 175, §117C, an insurance company’s credit life losses in relation to its earned
premium, called the loss ratio, must be equal to at least 50 percent.
Credit Disability Income Insurance
Credit disability income insurance, also known as credit accident and sickness insurance, is
designed to pay a monthly loan amount equal to at least the minimum monthly payment required
under the debt agreement. Unlike traditional disability insurance, the beneficiary is the creditor
and payments are made to the creditor instead of to the covered person. Credit disability income
insurance may be offered in Massachusetts only in accordance with the following standards set
forth in M.G.L. c. 175, §110:
(1) the monthly benefit is equal to the loan’s minimum monthly payment,
(2) there may be an elimination period before a benefit is paid, and
(3) the benefit may or may not be retroactive.
3 As authorized under Chapter 303 of the Acts of 1988, credit insurance is to be used with a “loan for personal, family
or household purpose, except in the case of a loan secured by a first lien on real property” (M.G.L. c. 255, §12G);
“retail installment contract” (M.G.L. c. 255B §10); “premium finance agreement” (M.G.L. c. 255C, §14A); or
“retail installment sale agreement or revolving credit agreement” (M.G.L. c. 255D, §26).
4 See M.G.L. c. 255, §12G; M.G.L. c. 255B, §10; M.G.L. c. 255C, §14A; and M.G.L. c. 255D, §26.
5 See 211 CMR 143.00.

Pursuant to M.G.L. c. 175, §117C, an insurance company’s loss ratio for credit disability income
insurance must equal at least 55 percent.
Credit Involuntary Unemployment Insurance
Credit involuntary unemployment insurance is designed to pay a monthly amount in the event the
insured loses their job. Unlike traditional involuntary unemployment insurance, the beneficiary is
the creditor and payments are made to the creditor instead of to the covered person. Credit
involuntary unemployment insurance may be offered in Massachusetts only in accordance with
the following standards set forth in M.G.L. c. 175, §110:
(1) the monthly benefit is equal to the loan’s minimum monthly payment,
(2) there may be an elimination period before a benefit is paid, and
(3) the benefit may or may not be retroactive.
Pursuant to section M.G.L. c. 175, §117D, an insurance company’s loss ratio for credit involuntary
unemployment insurance must equal at least 60 percent.
Credit Insurance Rates for Motor Vehicle Dealers
The rates to be used for credit life and credit disability income insurance offered through the Motor
Vehicle Dealers (“MVD”) class of business for auto-related loans are set by the Division every
three years using the last three available years of experience. Division Bulletin 2022-10 identifies
the rates that apply for calendar year 2023 through 2025 based on 2020-2022 experience.6
For all other classes of business, insurers must submit rate filings to the Division for the specific
line that comply with the statutorily defined loss ratio standards, as described above.
6 Pursuant to M.G.L. c.175, s. 117C (b) (C) (4) (iii), the commissioner shall triennially compute the deviated case
rates for credit life and credit accident and health insurance sold through motor vehicle dealers.

Experience for Calendar Year 2023
The Division requested that companies report data separately for credit life, credit disability
income, and credit involuntary unemployment insurance. Within the credit life and credit disability
income categories, the Division further requested that information be reported separately for the
MVD and non-MVD classes of business.7 The Division also requested that companies report data
for each individual product offered within each category of coverage so that the loss ratio of each
individual product could be compared to the applicable statutory loss ratio requirement.
As of 2023, only 3 companies – American National Insurance Company, CFMG Life Insurance
Company and Minnesota Life Insurance Company - were actively writing credit insurance
business while 13 other companies were servicing closed blocks of coverage.
As illustrated in Table 1, the vast majority (over 96%) of earned premium during 2023 was
generated from three companies.
Table 1
Data Requirements
In accordance with M.G.L. c. 175, §117C(b) each insurer is required to file claims experience and
loss ratio data annually. The Commissioner of Insurance is required to provide a summary of the
information reported by companies. When submitting information, insurers are to report claims
and premium data and calculate a loss ratio in the following manner:
Incurred Claims = Total credit insurance claims paid during the experience period
adjusted for changes to the credit insurance claim reserve
Earned Premiums = Actual earned premiums
Loss Ratio = Incurred claims
Earned premiums
7 This information was not requested for credit involuntary unemployment insurance because the Division does not
set rates for any class of business within that line.

Table 2
As required by statute, the DOI reviews each company’s loss ratio experience, by product, for
compliance with statutory minimum loss ratios and requires companies falling below minimum
thresholds to file to adjust rates. This year, company-reported data did not meet statutory data
credibility thresholds due to the low premiums, and companies were therefore not required to
adjust rates.9
It is expected that the level of premium (and credible claims information) in the market will
continue to decline going forward.
8 Loss Ratios for IIUI are not included due to insufficient premium levels.
9 The credibility factors are established in M.G.L. c. 175, §117C.
