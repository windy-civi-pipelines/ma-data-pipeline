Appendix A: Emergency Assistance Fiscal Blueprint for the remainder of FY25
Today, the Administration is filing a supplemental budget with the aim of putting the Emergency
Assistance (EA) program on a sustainable path for the future. This legislation will include a
request for:
(1) Policy changes to ensure that shelter is a rare, brief, and non-recurring stop for families
as they transition to permanent housing and that help reduce EA caseloads to sustainable,
more affordable levels in the coming years: The policy reforms proposed in the forthcoming
legislation build on lessons learned from the last year and ensure that the EA shelter system can
appropriately meet the needs of families while balancing the need to return EA caseloads to
sustainable, affordable levels recognizing that there is not currently identified funding for
extraordinary EA costs beyond FY25.
(2) Additional one-time funding via the Transitional Escrow Fund (TEF) to cover the fiscal
gap in FY25: While these policy changes are going into effect, the EA system requires an
additional appropriation to avoid running out of funding for critical supports, including paying
providers for shelter services, in late January 2025.
Current State of Emergency Assistance System
In the face of heightened demand since the beginning of the Healey-Driscoll Administration and
a lack of federal action, the Emergency Assistance system has worked extensively to serve
homeless families while balancing limited resources to do so. As a result of this approach, in
FY25, the system has supported up to 7,500 families in Emergency Assistance shelter, created
Temporary Respite Center services for an additional 350 families that are currently on the
waitlist, and accelerated the pace at which families exit or divert from the system to sustainable
housing. For example, today, approximately 16 families are seeking shelter daily, down from a
high of 40 families in 2023. Moreover, the system now sees upwards of 400 families exit per
month, the highest level of exits in the last decade, doubling monthly totals seen throughout most
of 2023.
However, in spite of these efforts and recent exit numbers, demand for shelter remains high and
exceeds available supply of shelter – more than 400 families remain on the waitlist and up to 400
new, additional families apply for shelter each month, thereby leading to a caseload of up to
7,500 families this year. In the face of this continued demand and the federal government’s
failure to advance a solution, additional resources are necessary to fund the current system in the
short term while accelerating efforts to increase the rate of exits and bring the caseload down to
sustainable levels in the medium to long term. The sooner the below policy changes go into
effect, the sooner the state will be able to realize reduced caseloads and costs.
Proposed Blueprint for Fiscal and Operational Sustainability
To address these challenges, and consistent with recent legislation, the Healey-Driscoll
Administration convened the Special Commission on Emergency Assistance between June to
November 2024. Last month, the Administration and Commission members approved a report
8
making findings and recommendations on the sustainability, efficiency, and effectiveness of the
emergency housing assistance program.1
Building on those recommendations and lessons learned from the last year, on November 22, the
Healey-Driscoll Administration announced a package of policy reforms in line with Commission
recommendations to ensure that EA shelter is brief, rare, and non-recurring, and that the system
is fiscally and operationally sustainable in FY26 and beyond. These actions are designed to help
bring the EA system back to fiscal and operational sustainability once it is fully implemented,
which will take a period of time. This plan is also in line with peer states and cities that have
begun to scale back their shelter and new arrival programs through reductions in size, lengths of
stay, and other tools to address financial and capacity constraints. To realize this goal, the
Healey-Driscoll Administration proposes policy changes – detailed further here -- that:
• Prioritizes families, particularly long-term Massachusetts residents, based on their
needs and establishing two tracks to support them with necessary resources to either
rapidly find self-sufficient permanent housing -- via the Rapid Shelter Track -- or provide
additional services and supports such as work authorizations, job placements, and English
classes via the Bridge Shelter Track
• Reducing the Length of Stay for the Bridge Shelter Track from 9 months to 6 months
and amending extension criteria contained in prior legislation to help families and EA
providers rehouse more quickly, which ultimately helps families move to permanency
more rapidly and helps the system serve more families. This change helps to set
expectations for families, maintain focus on efforts to move toward permanent housing,
and helps us to serve more families annually with less resources.
• Phasing out the use of hotels and motels for emergency shelter by the end of 2025
per the recommendations of the EA Commission
Proposed Blueprint for Fiscal and Operational Sustainability
Implementation of these policy changes, which will be included in the supplemental budget filed
today, will take some time before the Administration is able to increase exits and return the
caseload to a sustainable level. To that end, the Administration – leveraging remaining one-time
funding from the Transitional Escrow fund -- will work to return caseload to baseline levels and
costs over the current and next fiscal year as illustrated in Figure 1 below.
Figure 1: Illustrative FY25-26 Caseload Projection
1 The final Report of the Special Commission on Emergency Housing Assistance Programs can be found here

As depicted in Figure 2 and Table 1 below, this approach allows the Administration to leverage
the remaining one-time funds in the Transitional Escrow Fund to continue to operate current
caseloads in FY25 while proposed policy changes are considered and implemented. To execute
this plan, the Administration’s supplemental budget proposes supplemental funding
appropriating
from TEF into a newly created reserve account to cover EA shelter costs through the end of
FY25.
Beyond FY25, the administration intends to move towards operational sustainability in FY26
and beyond, recognizing that there is not identified funding for extraordinary EA costs in the
long term. The administration, therefore, anticipates once again proposing General Fund EA and
HomeBASE appropriations in H.1 at levels consistent with the FY25 GAA and requesting
reserve FY26 funding to support the system’s transition to sustainability. The exact format and
timing of that request is under consideration. If successful, the system will return to baseline
caseloads and costs, and therefore operational and fiscal sustainability, by the end of FY26.

Appendix A: Emergency Assistance Fiscal Blueprint for the remainder of FY25
Today, the Administration is filing a supplemental budget with the aim of putting the Emergency
Assistance (EA) program on a sustainable path for the future. This legislation will include a
request for:
(1) Policy changes to ensure that shelter is a rare, brief, and non-recurring stop for families
as they transition to permanent housing and that help reduce EA caseloads to sustainable,
more affordable levels in the coming years: The policy reforms proposed in the forthcoming
legislation build on lessons learned from the last year and ensure that the EA shelter system can
appropriately meet the needs of families while balancing the need to return EA caseloads to
sustainable, affordable levels recognizing that there is not currently identified funding for
extraordinary EA costs beyond FY25.
(2) Additional one-time funding via the Transitional Escrow Fund (TEF) to cover the fiscal
gap in FY25: While these policy changes are going into effect, the EA system requires an
additional appropriation to avoid running out of funding for critical supports, including paying
providers for shelter services, in late January 2025.
Current State of Emergency Assistance System
In the face of heightened demand since the beginning of the Healey-Driscoll Administration and
a lack of federal action, the Emergency Assistance system has worked extensively to serve
homeless families while balancing limited resources to do so. As a result of this approach, in
FY25, the system has supported up to 7,500 families in Emergency Assistance shelter, created
Temporary Respite Center services for an additional 350 families that are currently on the
waitlist, and accelerated the pace at which families exit or divert from the system to sustainable
housing. For example, today, approximately 16 families are seeking shelter daily, down from a
high of 40 families in 2023. Moreover, the system now sees upwards of 400 families exit per
month, the highest level of exits in the last decade, doubling monthly totals seen throughout most
of 2023.
However, in spite of these efforts and recent exit numbers, demand for shelter remains high and
exceeds available supply of shelter – more than 400 families remain on the waitlist and up to 400
new, additional families apply for shelter each month, thereby leading to a caseload of up to
7,500 families this year. In the face of this continued demand and the federal government’s
failure to advance a solution, additional resources are necessary to fund the current system in the
short term while accelerating efforts to increase the rate of exits and bring the caseload down to
sustainable levels in the medium to long term. The sooner the below policy changes go into
effect, the sooner the state will be able to realize reduced caseloads and costs.
Proposed Blueprint for Fiscal and Operational Sustainability
To address these challenges, and consistent with recent legislation, the Healey-Driscoll
Administration convened the Special Commission on Emergency Assistance between June to
November 2024. Last month, the Administration and Commission members approved a report
8

making findings and recommendations on the sustainability, efficiency, and effectiveness of the
emergency housing assistance program.1
Building on those recommendations and lessons learned from the last year, on November 22, the
Healey-Driscoll Administration announced a package of policy reforms in line with Commission
recommendations to ensure that EA shelter is brief, rare, and non-recurring, and that the system
is fiscally and operationally sustainable in FY26 and beyond. These actions are designed to help
bring the EA system back to fiscal and operational sustainability once it is fully implemented,
which will take a period of time. This plan is also in line with peer states and cities that have
begun to scale back their shelter and new arrival programs through reductions in size, lengths of
stay, and other tools to address financial and capacity constraints. To realize this goal, the
Healey-Driscoll Administration proposes policy changes – detailed further here -- that:
• Prioritizes families, particularly long-term Massachusetts residents, based on their
needs and establishing two tracks to support them with necessary resources to either
rapidly find self-sufficient permanent housing -- via the Rapid Shelter Track -- or provide
additional services and supports such as work authorizations, job placements, and English
classes via the Bridge Shelter Track
• Reducing the Length of Stay for the Bridge Shelter Track from 9 months to 6 months
and amending extension criteria contained in prior legislation to help families and EA
providers rehouse more quickly, which ultimately helps families move to permanency
more rapidly and helps the system serve more families. This change helps to set
expectations for families, maintain focus on efforts to move toward permanent housing,
and helps us to serve more families annually with less resources.
• Phasing out the use of hotels and motels for emergency shelter by the end of 2025
per the recommendations of the EA Commission
Proposed Blueprint for Fiscal and Operational Sustainability
Implementation of these policy changes, which will be included in the supplemental budget filed
today, will take some time before the Administration is able to increase exits and return the
caseload to a sustainable level. To that end, the Administration – leveraging remaining one-time
funding from the Transitional Escrow fund -- will work to return caseload to baseline levels and
costs over the current and next fiscal year as illustrated in Figure 1 below.
Figure 1: Illustrative FY25-26 Caseload Projection
1 The final Report of the Special Commission on Emergency Housing Assistance Programs can be found here
https://www.mass.gov/doc/ea-commission-final-report/download

As depicted in Figure 2 and Table 1 below, this approach allows the Administration to leverage
the remaining one-time funds in the Transitional Escrow Fund to continue to operate current
caseloads in FY25 while proposed policy changes are considered and implemented. To execute
this plan, the Administration’s supplemental budget proposes supplemental funding
appropriating
from TEF into a newly created reserve account to cover EA shelter costs through the end of
FY25.
Beyond FY25, the administration intends to move towards operational sustainability in FY26
and beyond, recognizing that there is not identified funding for extraordinary EA costs in the
long term. The administration, therefore, anticipates once again proposing General Fund EA and
HomeBASE appropriations in H.1 at levels consistent with the FY25 GAA and requesting
reserve FY26 funding to support the system’s transition to sustainability. The exact format and
timing of that request is under consideration. If successful, the system will return to baseline
caseloads and costs, and therefore operational and fiscal sustainability, by the end of FY26.
