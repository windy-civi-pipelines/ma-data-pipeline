Re: Reporting required by Chapter 214 of the Acts of 2024
Dear Sirs:
Chapter 214 of the Acts of 2024 established a “non-budgeted special revenue fund to be known
as the Commonwealth Federal Matching and Debt Reduction Fund, which shall be administered
by the secretary of administration and finance.” Among other things, the legislation also sets out
the process for quarterly transfers into the new fund of interest credited to the Stabilization Fund
(subject to certain tests and limitations) and reporting requirements, both of which were made
responsibilities of my office. Finally, it directs that a one-time transfer be made of interest
credited to the Stabilization Fund during Fiscal Year 2024.
The annual reporting is to occur within five days of the issuance of the annual Statutory Basis
Financial Report (SBFR), which occurred on February 19, 2025.
Part 1: Tests related to potential transfers in Fiscal Year 2025. Section 2 says (in part):
(b) Quarterly, the comptroller shall transfer to the fund any interest credited to the
Commonwealth Stabilization Fund during the previous quarter; provided, however, that
no such transfer shall occur if: (i) the balance of the Commonwealth Stabilization Fund
for the most recently ended fiscal year has decreased below the balance of the

Commonwealth Stabilization Fund at the close of the immediately preceding fiscal year

section 12 of chapter 7A; or (ii) the balance of the Commonwealth Stabilization Fund
does not exceed 10 per cent of budgeted revenues for the immediately preceding fiscal
year, as stated in the most recent statutory basis financial report; and provided further,
that if the report for the immediately preceding fiscal year has not yet been issued, the
comptroller shall make an estimate of the Commonwealth Stabilization Fund balance and

Result for test under “(ii)” Pass

issuance of the Fiscal Year 2024 SBFR reflected in the tests shown above, the transfers for the

Stabilization Fund interest credited: Quarter 2 of FY2025 $108,764,427

FY24 and FY25 Stabilization Fund Interest Transfer Report
February 26, 2025
SECTION 6. Notwithstanding section 2EEEEEE of chapter 29 of the General Laws or
any other general or special law to the contrary, the comptroller shall transfer to the
Commonwealth Federal Matching and Debt Reduction Fund, established in said section
2EEEEEE of said chapter 29, any interest credited to the Commonwealth Stabilization
Fund during the 4 quarters of the fiscal year ending June 30, 2024.
The transfer in the amount of $420,763,697 was made on October 9, 2024. Because the
legislation directed that this transfer be made without requiring any calculation or test, it could
proceed before the issuance of the SBFR.
Part 4: Annual reporting requirement
Chapter 214 includes this reporting requirement:
“Annually, not later than 5 business days after the issuance of the statutory basis financial
report required pursuant to section 12 of chapter 7A, the comptroller shall report to the
executive office for administration and finance, the clerks of the house of representatives
and the senate and the house and senate committees on ways and means on: (i) the
balance of the Commonwealth Stabilization Fund as of June 30 of the preceding fiscal
year; and (ii) the interest earned by the Commonwealth Stabilization Fund during the
preceding fiscal year.”
In fulfillment of that requirement:
The Stabilization Fund balance was $8,523,632 on June 30th for Fiscal Year 2024, as
reported on page 11 of the Fiscal Year 2024 SBFR and shown above.
The interest credited to the Stabilization Fund during Fiscal Year 2024 was
$420,763,697. As noted in Part 3, this amount was duly transferred to the
Commonwealth Federal Matching and Debt Reduction Fund.
In this first report, our goal was to provide informative context beyond the specific required
figures. If you have any questions or concerns, please let me know.
Sincerely,
William McNamara
Comptroller
