Dear Senator Rodrigues and Representative Michlewitz:
In accordance with FY2025 Final Budget Line Item 7004-9034, we are pleased to submit the
following report. 7004-9034 required the following reporting on reentry programs funded by
this line item:
the: (i) amount proposed for said subsidies; (ii) estimated number of individuals who
would qualify for said subsidies, including the methodology for determining said subsidy
amounts; (iii) number of individuals who qualify for said subsidies, including available
demographic information; (iv) planned distribution of funds; (v) other reentry services and
programs available to said participants; and (vi) amount of average subsidy in fiscal year
2025 compared to the preceding 2 fiscal years
EOHLC and Executive Office of Public Safety and Security (EOPSS) set up two programs
within this appropriation to serve different target populations. EOPSS referred 30 individuals
exiting long-term incarceration for permanent vouchers, similar to MRVP. The remainder of
funds are used for a sponsor based transitional housing programs with robust wrap around
supports for individuals referred through correction. These programs serve both 18-25 years and
a broader range of adults leaving prison. As such, we provide information separately for the
voucher and sponsor-based programs.
(i) amount proposed for said subsidies;
a. The average subsidy cost in FY25 to date (through November) is $1,693 per
month ($20,316 per year) for the permanent housing vouchers.
b. Estimated $21,429 per year per client for the sponsor-based program.
(ii) estimated number of individuals who would qualify for said subsidies:
c. EOPSS estimates 128 individuals qualify for the voucher program (55+ and
excluding sex offenders) in FY24. EOPSS refers programs clients to EOHLC and

RCAP, the Regional Administering Agency administering these vouchers on
EOHLC’s behalf.
d. EOPSS estimates there are approximately 81 individuals eligible for the UTEC
program (18-25 on release), and 1,176 eligible for the other contracted programs
(all ages upon release). EOHLC established the number of clients served by
procurement. EOPSS refers program clients to the contracted vendors.
(iii) number of individuals who qualify for said subsidies, including available demographic
information
e. Of the 128 eligible for permanent vouchers, 25.8% are Black/African American
and remainder white or other. 8.5% are female, and ages range form 55-83. Of
individuals placed, 24% black/African American, 8% female.
f. Of the population eligible for sponsor-based program:
i. UTEC (18-25 year olds) - 35.4% black/African American, remainder
white or other. 3.2% female. No individuals placed yet
ii. Other Programs – 33.8% black/African American, remainder white or
other. 6% female. Of the 31 individuals placed (representing 100% of
placements funded under the three vendors in this category), 35.5%
black/African American, 0% female.
(iv) planned distribution of funds;
g. EOHLC forecasts to spend just over $600,000 in total on vouchers in FY25.
EOHLC distributes subsidies and any security deposits directly to property
owners on behalf of participants via RCAP, who is administering the vouchers.
EOHLC also pays RCAP $55 per leased voucher per month for administration.
EOHLC has issued 30 vouchers based on 30 referrals from Department of
Corrections (DOC), of whom 20 had leased a unit with their voucher, 7 are
actively searching, and 3 vouchers are pending approval due to being re-issued as
of December 31, 2024.
h. EOHLC conducted a procurement for sponsor-based vendors, with the following
contracts (note, these are contract figures, not fiscal year 2025 spending);
i. $2,000,000 to UTEC to serve 25 young adults;
ii. $363,089 to PAACA to serve 16 adults of any age;
iii. $298,056 to Open Sky to serve 5 adults of any age and
iv. $338,855 to Clinical Support Options to serve 10 adults of any age.
(v) other reentry services and programs available to said participants;
All reentry services outlined in 103 DOC 493, Reentry Policy, are provided to
participants if eligible and interested, this includes the following:
 MAHealth application for insurance coverage in the community;
 Discharge planning, scheduling of aftercare appointments;
 Referrals to post-release resources, specifically case management resources such
as BHJI and Credible Messengers;
 Housing referral placement through corresponding program;
 Identity document obtainment (State ID, Birth Certificate, Social Security Card) ;
and
 Employment preparation (resume development and ability to job search).

total of $226,364 on the vouchers, with the average subsidy cost of $1,787 per
month.
j. EOHLC has only started housing clients with the sponsor-based programming this
