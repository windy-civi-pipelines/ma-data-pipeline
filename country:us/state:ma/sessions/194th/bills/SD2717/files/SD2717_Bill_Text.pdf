HOME&HEALTHY
FOR GOOD
Advancing solution-driven supportive housing
Progress Report:
July 1, 2024 – February 28, 2025
Prepared by the Massachusetts Housing & Shelter Alliance
(MHSA), a nonprofit, public policy advocacy organization
dedicated to ending homelessness in Massachusetts.

Pictured: A former rooming house in Lowell acquired by Community Teamwork Inc. to provide supportive housing for people experiencing
homelessness. The project, which now features 19 efficiency apartments, each with their own kitchenette and private bath, was funded by both Home
& Healthy for Good and Massachusetts Alliance for Supportive Housing funds.

HOME & HEALTHY FOR GOOD
Ending long-term homelessness for individuals in Massachusetts
Our communities are strongest when we all have
safe, stable housing and the support we need to
thrive.
But as Massachusetts confronts a housing
shortage at all income levels, people
experiencing long-term homelessness –
particularly those with disabilities – are hardest
hit by the lack of housing. Shelters are full and
tent encampments are growing across the state.
Fortunately, Massachusetts has housing models
that work.
Home & Healthy for Good (HHG):
A Housing First Approach
Housing First is a cost-effective and evidence-
based approach.
Supportive housing replaces reliance on
emergency responses with a solution to
homelessness for people experiencing chronic
or long-term homelessness who struggle with
medical or behavioral health conditions.
Individuals are placed in low-barrier,
permanent, affordable housing first. Service
providers offer voluntary, intensive support to
help tenants sustain housing and connect with
behavioral health services, medical care, job
training, and more.
Pictured: HHG funds were used by Action Inc. to acquire this
property in Gloucester, which offers 7 supportive housing units.

Flexible Funding
HHG funds are flexible. Housing providers may use HHG funds to support the three key
components of supportive housing:
• Capital
• Operations
• Services
This flexibility allows providers to adapt their use of the funds as needs evolve.
HHG fills budget gaps and leverages other public and private resources.
Systems Change to End Homelessness
HHG funds also support MHSA’s critical systems change work to advance the creation of
supportive housing and solutions to homelessness.

WHY HOUSING FIRST?
Individuals experiencing homelessness face many
challenges that are difficult to address without housing:
• Lack of transportation to medical appointments, employment opportunities,
and other critical supports
• Lack of privacy for taking medicine
• Lack of safety while healing
• Increased risk for stress and physical/sexual violence
• Increased risk of relapse and overdose
The Housing First model recognizes that when individuals
experiencing homelessness have a place to live, they can
more easily:
• Maintain their sobriety • Prioritize their health
• Seek employment • Achieve life goals
People struggling with complex medical and disabling conditions can achieve
stability through low-barrier housing paired with support services driven by their
individual needs.
By offering both housing and services to this population, which frequently relies
on costly emergency services, HHG-funded programs can reach some of our most
vulnerable community members while generating significant cost savings.

DEVELOPING NEW
SUPPORTIVE HOUSING
In FY24, the Legislature invested an additional $2 million in HHG
for the development of supportive housing. As a result:
• 2 new projects (32 units) are currently housing people
formerly experiencing homelessness
• 4 new projects (152 units) are still in development
• 1 project (36 units) had to be cancelled due to
community opposition
In FY25, HHG received level funding.
In addition to sustaining ongoing projects, MHSA was able to use
over $530,000 to fund the development of 105 new units of
supportive housing.
Programs receiving new funding in FY25 for development:
• Commonwealth Land Trust | 42 units | Boston
• NeighborWorks Housing Solutions | 22 units | Attleboro
• Victory Programs Inc. | 41 units | Boston
• One additonal project under consideration

HOME & HEALTHY
FOR GOOD
SPOTLIGHTS
What we appreciate most about HHG funding is its flexibility. HHG
can be used to fill gaps in areas where funding isn’t provided,
especially for supportive services. For our project in Greenfield, we
were able to use HHG one year to fund development and the next
year to fund supportive services.
- Keleigh BenEzra, CSO
HHG allowed Action Inc. to start its Housing First Program more
than 10 years ago. MHSA and HHG have continually supported
permanent supportive housing for individuals, and Action Inc. has
seen time and time again the transformative power of supportive
housing. HHG is a critical resource that has an immediate and
lasting impact and could provide even more if additional funding
was allocated.
- Erin George, Action Inc.
[Life before permanent housing was] horrible. I was living in tents
or tarps under railroad bridges or occasional shelters. It was all
because when I lost my first wife with the divorce and her death, I
was looking for something else and nothing else was there.
Without the help of Action Inc., I wouldn’t have the beautiful house
that I have, groceries, the health support, and the psychological
health support.

Through Home & Healthy for Good, MHSA continues to
demonstrate that providing housing and supportive services to
individuals through a Housing First model is less costly and more
effective than managing their homelessness and health problems
on the street or in shelter.
