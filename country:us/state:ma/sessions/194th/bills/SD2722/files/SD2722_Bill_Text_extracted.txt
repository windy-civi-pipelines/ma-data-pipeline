Executive Summary
innovation and strengthens our economy. Our public institutions of higher education are
a big part of this success, offering affordable, high-quality education and preparing
students for jobs that help our state grow. This year, we have seen remarkable
progress: thanks to historic investments in free community college, applications to
community colleges have surged, and enrollment has increased by double digits,
reversing more than a decade of declines. Public four-year colleges are also seeing
their first enrollment growth since 2013.
However, our public higher education system is facing significant capital challenges.
Much of the construction on these campuses happened in the 1970s, resulting in aging
academic buildings and infrastructure that now require major upgrades. Deferred
maintenance is coming due, and campuses are struggling to meet the modern needs of
students and the workforce. While each campus faces unique capital challenges,
common themes include rising construction costs, the need to modernize pedagogical
technology and ensure ADA compliance, and substantial investments in
decarbonization to meet the state’s ambitious climate goals. Meeting these challenges
on the scale required is all but impossible within the constraints of the state’s traditional
capital program.
Recognizing these challenges, section 196 of the FY25 GAA directed the creation of a
working group to identify new sources of capital to support higher education
transformation and consider options for best deploying those new resources in a way
that will benefit students, institutions, the workforce, and the Commonwealth as a whole.
New Sources of Capital to Support Higher Education Transformation
Through months of investigation, the Working Group confirmed the viability of
leveraging Fair Share revenue to unlock an estimated $2 to $3.5 billion in new
capital resources for Massachusetts’ community colleges, state universities, and
the University of Massachusetts system over the next 10 years, an approach that
imitates the Commonwealth’s successful creation and use of the Commonwealth
Transportation Fund.
With the support of external financial advisors, the group confirmed that the proposed
scale of debt issuance is modest relative to anticipated Fair Share collections, ensuring
minimal risk in meeting debt service commitments and allowing for the creation of a new
capital bonding program without constraining other operational goals and uses of Fair
Share revenue. Moreover, the analysis confirmed that the creation of a standalone
credit structure secured by Fair Share can be done without having any impact on
existing credits of the Commonwealth’s General Obligation debt capacity.
Findings on Deploying New Capital to Address Needs
Having confirmed that Fair Share is a viable source for unlocking new capital resources,
the Working Group evaluated different values for how this increased funding may best
2
be allocated to address higher education capital needs, and identified the following set
of guiding principles for consideration:
• Ensuring greater predictability and transparency of funding
• Preserving flexibility to meet evolving needs
• Prioritizing deferred maintenance and critical repairs of existing facilities
• Prioritizing alignment with administration priorities, including:
Net zero carbon emissions goals
o
Strategy outlined in the Workforce Skills Cabinet Regional Blueprints
o
• Developing smarter and more innovative program delivery models, including:
Preparing facilities for changing student demographics and enrollment
o
trends
Modernizing and optimizing space utilization to support evolving
o
pedagogies and new learning needs
Finding opportunities to encourage or support cross-institutional
o
collaboration and space sharing
Meeting needs for research and applied learning space
o
• Requiring (and providing support for) longer-term planning to inform project
evaluation and selection, in the form of master plans
• Recognizing the distinct missions and needs of the different public higher
education sectors in developing and administering capital funding programs
Finally, the Working Group evaluated the application, approval, design, and delivery of
current and recent state capital programs to understand what has worked well in
existing programs, to expose unmet need, and to identify opportunities for improvement
over the current process. The takeaways are included in the full report.
Next Steps
Legislation is necessary to translate these findings into transformational capital
improvements for our public institutions of higher education. Specifically, legislation is
needed to pledge Fair Share revenues for debt service until the final maturity of the debt
for a Higher Education Special Obligation Credit and to authorize spending of the
resulting higher education capital funding over the next 10 years.
In parallel, the Working Group’s findings should be used to continue refining the state’s
processes for awarding and deploying higher education capital funds. While there is
much work to be done, our campuses and students will begin to feel the impact of these
new capital resources in the near future. Based on prior experience, smaller
“accelerated infrastructure” projects can be accomplished within 2 years, while larger
“major capital” projects can take 4-5 years to be constructed.
Conclusion
Massachusetts faces critical capital challenges in its public higher education system,
with aging infrastructure, deferred maintenance, and decarbonization demands
threatening its ability to meet modern student and workforce needs. These challenges
3
require bold solutions, as the state’s traditional capital programs are insufficient to meet
these significant needs. Leveraging Fair Share revenue through a special obligation
bond structure, in the model of the Commonwealth Transportation Fund, is a valid and
viable approach to expanding the pie of higher education capital resources while also
maintaining the flexibility to support other priorities and commitments with that revenue
stream. The borrowing made possible by this approach would support a 10-year higher
education bond bill that will provide the type of transformational change and investment
our public higher education campuses need to best serve their students, our workforce,
and our state.

Working Group Process
The Working Group was formed by Outside Section 196 of the FY25 GAA and tasked
with: 1) identifying new sources of capital to support higher education transformation
and 2) considering options for best deploying that capital to address the challenges
facing the system. The outside section instructed the working group to study and report
on:
(i) the feasibility and impacts of establishing a permanent financing structure
using income surtax revenues for the issuance of debt for the benefit of public
higher education capital needs; (page 17)
(ii) support for the University of Massachusetts Building Authority and the
Massachusetts State College Building Authority to identify and finance
investments in public higher education infrastructure; (page 27)
(iii) the capital funding necessary for public higher education campuses, broken
down by campus; (page 32)
(iv) potential federal sources of reimbursement or grant funding for public higher
education capital projects; (page 19)
(v) a prioritization process for public higher education capital needs; (page 21)
(vi) the total bonding capacity available for a public higher education capital
projects bond legislation, including recommendations for the use of any
general or special obligation bonds; (page 16)
(vii) a recommendation for a funding amount for future bond legislation for public
higher education capital needs; (page 17)
(viii) potential processes for application, approval, design and delivery of capital
projects for public higher education campuses; and (page 24)
(ix) possible investments for future bond legislation for public higher education
capital needs, including, but not limited to, decarbonization, deferred
maintenance and facilities improvement for the public higher education
system of the commonwealth. (page 29)
Starting in September 2024, the Working Group convened four meetings. The full slides
from these meetings are included in Appendix 3 of this report. The first meeting topic
was “Objectives, Background, and Level Setting”. The second meeting topic was
“Campus Needs and Financing Structure and Sources”. The third meeting topic was
“Review of Current Process and Discussion of Priorities and Concerns for Allocation of
Funding”. The fourth meeting was used to review a draft of this report.
The ideas in this report reflect the discussions held by and have broad support from the
members of the Working Group, though no vote was taken.

The Challenges
Higher education is a defining part of Massachusetts’ identity. The state has long been
a beacon of innovation and opportunity, driven by the intellectual and economic
contributions of its public institutions of higher education. Over generations, higher
education in Massachusetts has opened doors for young adults, providing them with
transformative opportunities and preparing them to shape the future. Our public
institutions in particular have served as vital equalizers, making quality education
accessible and affordable while supplying a highly skilled workforce that strengthens the
state’s economy.
Massachusetts’ public higher education system includes fifteen community colleges,
nine state universities, and five University of Massachusetts campuses. These
institutions work collaboratively with the Division of Capital Asset Management and
Maintenance (DCAMM), the Executive Office of Education (EOE), and the Department
of Higher Education (DHE) under a strategic framework that guides long-term capital
investment decisions. Together, they focus on supporting students, addressing
workforce demands, and advancing campus priorities.
While each campus has its own mission and needs, they share similar challenges when
it comes to capital infrastructure. Construction across the state’s higher education
system peaked in the 1970s, meaning that much of the core infrastructure in buildings
across campuses has reached the end of its functional lifespan. This widespread aging
of facilities presents urgent challenges that require coordinated investment.
Figure 1. "Shark" Chart of DCAMM's Capital Portfolio
Compounding these infrastructure issues, the costs of construction, renovation, and
demolition have risen significantly, adding new hurdles to efforts to modernize
campuses and ensure they meet the needs of current and future students. Addressing
these challenges will be critical to maintaining Massachusetts’ leadership in education
and preparing the state’s workforce to thrive in the decades ahead.

Capital Funding Needs at Public Higher Education Institutions
The aging infrastructure of Massachusetts’ public higher education system is
increasingly costly to repair, modernize, and decarbonize. Outdated facilities not only
hinder the state’s ability to meet ambitious decarbonization goals but also fail to support
modern learning, workforce development, and research. State-owned higher education
buildings account for 47% of the total DCAMM portfolio, making them a critical focus for
decarbonization efforts to meet the Commonwealth’s commitments. Addressing these
needs is further complicated by rising costs driven by a range of factors, including:
• Climate mandates. Legislative and executive mandates require the
Commonwealth to eliminate fossil fuel consumption and reduce carbon
emissions from state buildings by 95% by 2050. To meet these goals, institutions
must upgrade building energy performance, replace heating and cooling
infrastructure, modernize electrical services to campuses, and retrofit facilities to
maximize space efficiency.
• Building code updates. Massachusetts regularly updates its building codes to
incorporate advancements in safety, materials, and technology. While these
updates aim to achieve positive outcomes – such as protection of life safety and
reducing carbon emissions – they often lead to higher costs for design and
materials. Additionally, they can extend the survey and schematic design phases
of capital projects, which in turn may further escalate overall construction costs.
• Increased regulatory demands. Increasing regulatory demands contribute to
rising costs by requiring adherence to a range of complex and evolving
standards. These include permitting and environmental review processes, wage
laws, procurement rules, accessibility standards, and more. While these
regulations promote safety, sustainability, and equity, they also add
administrative overhead, increase labor and materials costs, and extend project
timelines, driving up overall expenses for campus infrastructure projects.
• Construction labor shortages. Ongoing shortages in skilled construction labor
increase wages and slow project timelines. Massachusetts had a 2.5%
construction unemployment rate in June, the lowest of any June in at least 17
years.1 This analysis of federal data also shows that construction employment
has increased by only 2.8% since February of 2020, while the annual rate of
construction projects has risen by 44.4%. These persistent labor shortages are
subsequently leading to an increase in wages; Massachusetts had one of the
highest average hourly earnings (AHE) rates in the country, at $49 per hour, and
the year-over-year growth was greater than 6%, above the national average.2
• Rising material costs. Inflation, transportation and energy costs for fabricators
and distributors, and the ongoing scarcity of manufacturing labor are all putting

upward pressure on the cost of building materials, even while the cost of input
commodities is more stable.
Declining enrollment across public higher education institutions further strains the ability
of campuses to fund capital needs. Enrollment across all sectors has declined 34%
since 2010, driven both by expected demographic shifts in the state and by the COVID
pandemic. Although recent tuition-free programs like MassEducate and MassReconnect
have boosted community college enrollments over the past two years, experts project a
“demographic cliff” when the number of high school graduates in Massachusetts is
expected to decline by 10% between 2026 and 2036.3 Enrollment pressures are a
burden on institutions’ ability to contribute to capital funding needs because they collect
less student revenue and have less ability to impose fees sufficient to cover debt
service when those costs could push students elsewhere. Programs like
MassReconnect are also resulting in changing needs from our student populations,
because they are driving increased enrollment of nontraditional students.

To address the mandate set before this Working Group, DCAMM conducted a detailed
assessment of capital funding needs across the public higher education system. This
assessment included the development of dashboards that break down needs at the
institutional level and provide contextual data such as current gross square footage
broken down by high-level use categories, enrollment since 2010, a “shark” chart

showing building age, research expenditures since 2010, and space utilization data.
The dashboards show institutional need, broken into three categories:
• Deferred maintenance. This refers to the backlog of repairs and upkeep
required to address wear and tear on and deterioration of campus buildings and
infrastructure. Normal obsolescence as building components reach the end of
their useful lives is compounded by frequent deferral of preventative
maintenance due to budget constraints, resulting in aging and deteriorating
facilities that may no longer meet basic functional or safety standards. Spending
in this category would ensure the continued operability and safety of existing
infrastructure by addressing issues such as roofing, HVAC systems, plumbing,
and electrical systems. This category also includes work needed to bring
buildings up to contemporary life safety, accessibility, energy, and other code
requirements adopted after the facilities’ initial construction. The estimates of
deferred maintenance come from Facility Condition Assessment (FCA) studies
supplemented with data from institutions for building authority-owned buildings.
• Decarbonization. This involves retrofitting and upgrading facilities to meet the
Commonwealth’s climate mandates, including to eliminating fossil fuel
consumption and reducing 95% of carbon emissions from state buildings by

Section 2:
2050. This includes improving energy efficiency, installing renewable energy
systems, modernizing heating and cooling systems, and increasing campus
resilience to a changing climate. The estimated costs of decarbonization come
from DCAMM’s internal assessments based on square footage and recent dollar-
per-square-foot project costs, and are then adjusted to eliminate overlap with
deferred maintenance. These cost estimates do not account for embodied
carbon considerations.
• Programmatic modernization. This refers to renovations and new construction
designed to better align campus facilities with current academic and workforce
needs. This includes updating laboratories, classrooms, and other spaces to
support modern teaching methods, research, and student services. The cost of
programmatic modernization was estimated by taking lists from institutions and
the capital plans adopted by the UMass Board of Trustees and then adjusting for
consistency across campuses and sectors by DCAMM’s application of standard
construction cost metrics to campus square footage.
All three categories often overlap in practice, as projects addressing program
improvements or aging infrastructure frequently present opportunities for code
upgrades, energy efficiency, and carbon reduction. However, in this analysis, DCAMM
adjusted estimates to eliminate duplication of costs. By separating these needs,
DCAMM provides a clearer understanding of the distinct investments required to
address foundational infrastructure deficiencies and meet the Commonwealth’s climate
mandates. The below chart presents estimated capital funding needs aggregated at the
sector level. Further information on the dashboards is available in Appendix 2.

Figure 3. Projected Capital Funding Needs by Sector
Capital Constraints and Available Bond Capacity
The capital needs across Massachusetts’ institutions of higher education are extensive
but the resources available through traditional funding sources are highly constrained.
The below section outlines the functions and limits of the state’s Capital Investment
Plan (CIP) and the state’s historic and current role in financing public higher education
capital projects.
CIP Uses and Constraints
Massachusetts’ CIP is a five-year rolling plan that funds construction and maintenance
of key infrastructure. It is focused on community grant programming and projects related
to state-owned assets, including facilities, infrastructure, and land or natural
environment. Projects include maintaining, repairing, modernizing, and strengthening
state assets, supporting housing development, fostering economic development, and
supporting cities and towns through grant programming.
The FY25-29 CIP’s primary source of funding is $3.117 billion in General Obligation
(GO) bonds, which are issued to investors who are repaid over time via debt service
that is paid from the state’s annual operating budget. Bond authorization, secured in
bond bills enacted by the Legislature, enables the Commonwealth to spend bond cap.
However, authorization does not require bond spending; actual spending and annual
growth in capital spending is determined through the annual CIP process.
12
Growth in the bond cap is subject to statutory and policy limits and is ultimately based
on the recommendation of the Debt Affordability Committee (DAC). The statutory direct
debt limit restricts the total amount of outstanding principal on the Commonwealth’s
direct debt to no more than 105% of the previous fiscal year’s limit. The annual
borrowing limit limits annual debt service payments to less than 8% of budgeted
revenues. Annual growth in the bond cap is generally limited to less than $125 million.
The DAC takes these limits into consideration in their recommendation, along with credit
factors – rating agencies continually cite elevated debt levels as Massachusetts’ biggest
credit negative factor – and how much an increase in debt service will put pressure on
the operating budget or limit future flexibility to fund critical infrastructure projects.
The Debt Affordability Committee’s FY25 recommendation to the Governor cited recent
inflation and construction market trends and data as a factor in their recommendation
for a conservative increase in bond cap.5 Recent escalating levels of construction costs
are limiting the purchasing power of the CIP, and further, state agencies have reported
that individual project costs are far exceeding original estimates.
History of Higher Education Financing and Investments.
In response to the growing capital challenges faced by Massachusetts’ public higher
education system, Governor Patrick launched a 10-year comprehensive education
reform initiative shortly after taking office, including a focus on higher education
financing reform. At the time, investments in higher education accounted for only 3% of
the Commonwealth’s total capital budget. By FY13, the Patrick administration had
increased this share to 12%, reflecting a significant prioritization of higher education
capital needs.6
A cornerstone of these efforts was the 2008 filing of a $2.2 billion, 10-year higher
education bond bill. This dramatically increased funding for capital projects across all
public higher education institutions. As a result, every community college, state
university, and UMass campus benefited from at least one major new capital project.
Those projects included a range of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math
(STEM) buildings, new academic and lab space, new libraries and student areas, and
crucial infrastructure and deferred maintenance projects essential to allowing campuses
to operate at the highest level. Many of these projects addressed decades of deferred
maintenance and marked the first major construction efforts on several campuses since
the 1970s. This period of investment is reflected in Figure 1, which shows a notable
increase in higher education construction from 2008 to 2014.
Additionally, the 2008 life sciences bond bill provided targeted support for UMass,
enhancing the ability of campuses and graduates to contribute to the state’s life
sciences sector. UMass received one-fifth of the bill’s proceeds for projects including a
life sciences center at the Amherst campus, an “Advanced Therapeutics Cluster” at
UMass Medical School, and an Advanced Technology Manufacturing Center near the

Dartmouth campus, among others.7 Some small grants were available for community
colleges, but otherwise this bill did little to support state universities and community
colleges.
More recently, the 2022 general governmental bond bill authorized $750 million in
additional borrowing for repairs and improvements at state higher education institutions.
This authorization relied on general obligation debt, as did the 2008 bond bill
authorization, so although it enabled crucial spending at the higher education
institutions, spending was still limited by the constraints on the bond cap, and any bond
cap spending on higher education displaced spending in other areas.
Even with these infusions of funding, there continues to be significant need, occurring in
a time where the above outlined pressures make additional progress challenging.
Current and Recent Higher Education Capital Project Programs Funded Through the CIP.
As of the most recent CIP, DCAMM accounts for 23% of planned bond cap spending in
the next 5 years, or approximately $722 million per year. In FY25, $156.5 million of this
is programmed directly for higher education. Institutions have also benefited in other
ways related to funding – campuses received a significant share of DCAMM’s
decarbonization investment in FY24 – and related to strategic planning – DCAMM
accelerated the flow of capital funding commitments to UMass projects at the end of
FY24 by transferring money to UMBA that had been pledged in FY25.
The recent approach has apportioned state capital funding for higher education to three
programs. The first is a formula distribution of Critical Repairs funding to address
deferred maintenance. The second is the Accelerated Infrastructure program, which
prioritized investments based on Infrastructure Assessments and Facility Condition
Assessments. The third is a competitive program for awarding major capital funding,
capped at $30 million per project.
The Critical Repairs program addresses urgent repair and deferred maintenance needs
in state-owned higher education facilities. Targeting projects under $5 million, it ensures
campuses can address essential issues like building envelopes, mechanical systems,
accessibility, and life safety compliance. Funding is allocated in five-year-long rounds,
which creates predictability and allows institutions to plan and execute larger-scale
repairs. To date, two rounds have been funded, each providing $250 million in state
bond funds, matched by campus contributions. Allocations are determined using a
formula: a base amount of $3 million is distributed to each institution, with remaining
funds apportioned based on factors like gross square footage, documented deferred
maintenance, and enrollment headcount. Campuses have discretion to prioritize their
projects, with oversight provided by DCAMM.
The campus-wide Accelerated Infrastructure program funds strategic investments in
large-scale infrastructure projects that fall outside the scope of the Critical Repairs
program. These projects address essential systems like sub-surface utilities and parking

lots, focusing on preventing catastrophic failures that could disrupt campus operations.
This program also addresses security concerns, like improved crosswalk safety
measures and curb cuts, as well as maintenance or construction of new roads and
pedestrian walkways and bridges, and maintenance of water and sewer systems,
among other projects. By targeting these issues, the program enables campus leaders
to focus some resources on programmatic priorities without compromising infrastructure
needs. Projects are identified, planned, managed, and executed by DCAMM, with
typical timelines of two years from initial studies to completion. To date, $193.1 million in
state capital funds have been spent or committed, supplemented by modest
contributions from institutions. While the program is not currently funded for new
projects, it has been suggested as a potential model for tackling campus-wide
decarbonization initiatives in the future.
The Major Capital Projects program supports transformative investments that align with
institutional priorities and state goals for education and workforce development. The
program was initiated in FY19 following the Strategic Framework for Massachusetts
Public Higher Education, which aimed to create an open, competitive, and information-
driven process for evaluating capital projects based on the needs across the whole
higher education system. Designed for larger-scale projects, the program creates a
transparent, competitive process for allocating state funds. All 29 public higher
education institutions are eligible to submit one project per round, with approximately
five projects funded each cycle. Proposals with significant campus contributions are
prioritized, and 80% of funded projects to date have been at community colleges and
state universities. UMass projects are typically executed by the UMass Building
Authority (UMBA), while DCAMM oversees projects for community colleges and state
universities. To date, $451.6 million in state bond funds have been spent or committed,
matched by $375.5 million in campus contributions. Modest grants to institutions for
project development have also been a key feature of the program, supporting the
development of strong, competitive applications. While the program has been highly
impactful, it is currently unfunded for new rounds.
15
New Sources of Capital to Support Higher Education Transformation
While the above programs and investments have had a significant positive impact on
higher education capital, the need on our public higher education campuses is growing
well above and beyond what the Capital Investment Plan can accommodate. The
Working Group, therefore, investigated options for growing the available amount of
funding, before then evaluating different models for how the funding may best be
allocated to address capital needs.
In the last two budget proposals, FY24 H.1 and FY25 H.2, the Healey-Driscoll
Administration proposed pledging $140 million and $125 million respectively of Fair
Share revenues to support capital investments on university and community college
campuses to address the substantial backlog in deferred maintenance. These proposals
were not enacted by the Legislature, although a one-time investment of $50 million of
Fair Share revenue was allocated to institutions of higher education in FY24 for use on
decarbonization projects, accessibility improvements, and campus security investments.
The Fair Share revenue is constitutionally dedicated to education and transportation.
The Administration proposed using this revenue to unlock more capital, similar to what
had been done for transportation with the Commonwealth Transportation Fund (CTF).
The Administration projected that this could unlock up to $2.5 billion in borrowing
capacity over the next 10 years by securitizing this new revenue stream. The Working
Group investigated this idea to ensure its feasibility and to develop a clearer vision for
how new resources would be utilized.
Evaluation of Special Obligation Bonds as a Structure for New Capital Funds
Most bond bills in Massachusetts authorize the issuance of General Obligation (GO)
debt, which supports most of the state’s capital spending as outlined in the CIP. Recent
examples include the $5.16 billion in GO debt authorized in the Affordable Homes Act
and the $3.96 billion in GO debt authorized by the MassLeads Act. However,
Massachusetts has established a precedent for using special obligation bonds as an
alternative to GO debt. These bonds are tied to specific revenue streams, allowing the
Commonwealth to address strategic priorities while safeguarding its GO credit rating. By
diversifying its borrowing strategies, Massachusetts enhances its financial flexibility,
strengthens market access, and ensures better funding for priorities such as
transportation and infrastructure improvements.
Creating special obligation bonds presents a viable option for generating new capital
funds to address deferred maintenance and other critical needs in public higher
education, akin to what the Commonwealth Transportation Fund (CTF), created in
2009, has done for public transportation. The CTF has proven to effectively allocate
transportation-related fees and taxes to fund its obligations over the last 15 years. The
model is trusted enough that the FY25 budget authorized a $250 million transfer of Fair
Share revenues to the CTF. With over 4.5 times coverage for bonds, the CTF supports
robust borrowing capacity while still allowing for significant expenditures on a pay-as-
you-go basis after meeting its bonding obligations. The CTF’s strong credit profile,
currently rated Aa1 by Moody’s and AAA by S&P and Kroll, demonstrates the
16
effectiveness and reliability of this approach. A standalone credit structure could
similarly expand the Commonwealth’s capital borrowing program for higher education
capital projects. The amount of borrowing that the Commonwealth can do is contingent
on how much funding is pledged to cover debt service. By dedicating revenues to debt
service while the bonds are outstanding, the program minimizes risk while providing
financial predictability. Although the CTF’s credit rating is uniquely high, the external
analysis confirms that securing bonds with existing Fair Share revenues will provide
coverage of debt service costs that rating agencies and bondholders will seek. In other
words, it is expected to achieve a credit rating in the high investment grade category
(Double-A ratings).
Importantly, such a credit structure would not negatively affect the Commonwealth’s
general credit ratings. This new revenue source is segregated from the General Fund
and would be pledged to bondholders. Like the CTF, this structure would involve no
pledge of the Commonwealth’s taxing power or have an implied moral obligation, and
there would be no contract assistance pledge.
The Feasibility of Establishing a Dedicated Financing Structure Using Income Surtax
Revenue
The Working Group looked at three aspects of feasibility:
• Whether such a proposal is legally feasible,
• Whether it is financially feasible, and
• Whether this is a good policy solution to address institution needs.
The constitutional earmarking of Fair Share funds provides a clear and justifiable basis
for using income surtax revenue to support public higher education. These funds are
specifically dedicated to “quality public education and affordable public colleges and
universities, and for the repair and maintenance of roads, bridges, and public
transportation,” creating a lawful foundation for addressing higher education capital
needs.
Next, the group considered whether it was financially feasible to use Fair Share to
establish a new standalone credit structure for higher education capital funding.
Although Fair Share revenue—derived from a surtax on high-income earners—is
inherently variable, the Commonwealth has implemented safeguards to mitigate
volatility and protect long-term investments. These include a Fair Share stabilization
fund and restrictions on using the revenue for recurring expenses, with the balance
directed toward one-time projects. These mechanisms provide stability while enabling
strategic and sustainable allocations.
There are safeguards in place to protect against the overall variability of Fair Share.
Once pledged to a capital financing structure, revenues must first be used to cover debt
service before being used for other eligible purposes. Moreover, the amount of revenue
that needs to be committed to unlock significant borrowing is small compared to the
overall size of Fair Share. External analysis estimates that a pledge of $100 to 150
million in Fair Share revenues annually will allow the Commonwealth to borrow $2 to 3.5
17
billion over the next 10 years under current market conditions. The estimated scale of
proposed debt obligations, between $100 to 150 million, is modest compared to the size
of Fair Share collections; the Department of Revenue certified $2.460 billion in revenue
for FY24. This ensures that the risk of failing to meet debt service commitments remains
minimal, even in years with revenue fluctuations. Fair Share revenues can be used in
this way without taking away flexibility to spend the rest of the Fair Share revenue on
other prior and planned education and transportation commitments.
In sum, leveraging Fair Share revenue to support a higher education capital financing
structure is both lawful and financially viable. The safeguards, modest debt levels, and
strategic alignment with constitutional mandates make this proposal feasible while
maintaining the flexibility to support other priorities within the broader scope of public
education and transportation.
The Impact of Issuing Special Obligation Bonds Using Fair Share Revenues
A special obligation credit structure would likely secure a high investment-grade credit
rating. The securitization of Fair Share revenues allows for significant debt service
coverage while maintaining flexibility for other operational needs. Like with the CTF,
routing Fair Share revenues through this flow of funds would create large amounts of
debt service coverage without impacting the ability to use the remaining Fair Share
revenue, as those revenues would pass through to the Commonwealth after debt
service has been captured. Although it may take some years for the debt service to
ramp up, it will be critical to pledge the amount needed to fund debt service at its peak
in order for the bond market to have confidence that the funding will be available when
necessary. Any amount of the dedication that is not immediately needed for debt
service could still be used to address the capital needs of our public higher education
institutions.
The Working Group found that this approach aligns with the priorities of stakeholders:

Preliminary modeling scenarios indicate that with a pledge of $100 to $150 million in
Fair Share revenues annually for debt service, the Commonwealth would be able to
generate $2 to 3.5 billion in total funding unlocked to address the capital needs of our
public institutions of higher education over 10 years without any growth in the annual
appropriation.
Potential Federal Sources of Reimbursement or Grant Funding
Growing the pool of funding for capital projects also means ensuring that no federal
resources are left on the table. Leveraging federal reimbursements or grant
opportunities can help Massachusetts maximize its investments and accelerate its
higher education transformation.
Direct Pay reimbursements under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) present a promising
federal funding source. This program, designed to expand access to clean energy tax
credits, enables public entities like the state of Massachusetts to receive refunds for
clean energy investments, helping projects moving forward more quickly and affordably.
DCAMM, A&F’s Federal Funds and Infrastructure Office, and public higher education
campuses are already collaborating to explore these opportunities for reimbursement.
They have begun by submitting projects completed in 2023 for consideration for
reimbursement, but importantly, the state faces no cap on the number or value of its
applications and the program will remain in place through 2032. Any refunds from this
program will go directly to the state rather than to individual institutions, because the
state officially pays the taxes on behalf of our public institutions. The state is currently
exploring options to reinvest these funds into additional decarbonization projects to
further address climate goals.

The Working Group recognizes that future federal opportunities may emerge and
advises monitoring developments under the incoming federal administration. New
opportunities may become available, or the Direct Pay reimbursements may be put at
risk. While few additional opportunities can be identified at this time, federal funding
priorities may shift or expand in ways that could benefit public higher education
institutions in Massachusetts. Flexibility and vigilance will ensure the Commonwealth is
well-positioned to take advantage of new funding streams as they arise.

and compare the total projects need to the combined effect of investments including
Fair Share securitization, the IRA Direct Pay program and other energy and
decarbonization incentives, space optimization efforts, and more.
Figure 5. Illustration of Total Projected Need Compared to Potential Investments
These funding sources will make meaningful progress but still leave extensive need to
be addressed beyond the 10-year horizon of the proposed funding program. Given the
20
duration of major construction activity and the disruptive nature of projects implemented
on active campuses, it would not be practical to assume that all of the documented
need could reasonably be addressed in only one decade. The Working Group
recommends continuing to explore additional funding options that continue into the late
2030s and beyond to meet these needs comprehensively.
Findings on Deploying New Capital to Address Needs
In order to effectively address the capital needs identified across Massachusetts’ higher
education institutions, the Working Group considered how to best distribute new
funding. The group examined various factors that should inform any funding allocations,
including the specific needs of the different sectors, and identified a set of guiding
principles for strategic investment. In addition, the group evaluated the existing
processes for the application, approval, design, and delivery of capital projects,
identifying both strengths and areas for improvement that could enhance efficiency and
better meet institutional needs. The group also considered how to strengthen the
supports available to institutions and authorities to identify and be more strategic about
financing their capital investments. The following sections outline these findings for
improving the capital investment process at all levels.
Process of Prioritizing Higher Education Capital Needs
The process of prioritizing higher education capital needs should be informed by a set of
guiding principles designed to ensure strategic, equitable, and forward-thinking
investments across all sectors and project types. The Working Group identified the
following set of principles for consideration:
• Ensuring greater predictability and transparency of funding. A clear funding
model can create predictability for institutions and allow for more strategic
decision-making. Well-resourced institutions are generally better positioned to be
strategic and maximize funding; creating predictability may allow struggling
institutions more opportunities to be strategic. The Working Group also found that
institutions appreciate the transparency of the recent rounds of the Major Capital
Projects program, in which institutions understood the criteria and could receive
feedback and make edits to the applications over several months.
• Preserving flexibility to meet evolving needs. Capital construction projects in
Massachusetts often take between 2 to 5 years to complete, but campus needs
can evolve rapidly from the time an application is submitted to the time
construction begins, and the process must recognize that. Within the last five
years alone, campuses have seen a number of changes: rising construction
costs across the state, an increase in the population of first-time college students
due to the success of MassEducate, and a shift towards hybrid and online
learning as a result of adaptations made during the pandemic. Cost escalation
that occurs during the study and design phases means that the awarded funding
cannot purchase what was originally intended by the time the construction starts.
• Prioritizing deferred maintenance and critical repairs of existing facilities.
Deferred maintenance poses significant risks, including safety hazards, inefficient
21
energy use, and disruptions to educational activities. Institutions can better
protect students and staff by addressing issues including aging infrastructure,
structural vulnerabilities, campus accessibility, and inadequate emergency
systems. However, this prioritization should not necessarily preserve all existing
structures; in some cases, disposition or demolition may be the most practical
solution, particularly when the presence of hazardous materials or the high cost
of renovation makes continued use unfeasible. By addressing these issues
proactively, the Commonwealth ensures the longevity of its existing infrastructure
while avoiding higher costs associated with emergency repairs.
• Prioritizing alignment with administration priorities, including:
Net zero carbon emissions goals. The Commonwealth’s public higher
o
education system generates two-thirds of the carbon emissions in the
DCAMM portfolio. The state has promised to achieve net zero emissions
by 2050. Renewing facilities, systems, and infrastructure on higher
education campuses is a necessary step towards decarbonizing state
assets.
Strategy outlined in the Workforce Skills Cabinet Regional
o
Blueprints.8 The Cabinet and the regional blueprints aim to develop a
workforce that is sufficient in size, well-prepared, and well-educated in
high-demand fields. The blueprints establish educational and training
pathways, up through higher education, to align Massachusetts students
with priority industries. Integrating blueprint alignment with funding
decisions would ensure higher education capital investments are also
investments in the state’s future workforce.
• Developing smarter program delivery models, including:
Preparing facilities for changing student demographics and
o
enrollment trends. Massachusetts higher education institutions are
seeing enrollment shifts due to initiatives like MassEducate and
MassReconnect. Enrollment at community colleges has increased by 14
percent, while state universities and UMass show more modest increases.
Despite these increases, even community college enrollments remain well
below where they were ten years ago, and most other institutions lag pre-
pandemic peaks, sometimes by very large percentages. Demographic
forecasts and increased uncertainty about the value of college degrees
(even the state has eliminated most degree requirements for hiring)
suggest that enrollment is unlikely to recover. Whether enrollment
numbers stabilize or decline again, institutions should consider
consolidating space to better align with current and future enrollment
projections, reducing overall square footage to meet emerging needs and
avoid maintaining excess capacity.
Modernizing and optimizing space utilization to support evolving

22
hybrid office models have reduced utilization of instructional and
administrative space on many campuses. Additionally, programs like
MassReconnect have significantly increased the number of nontraditional
students enrolling in community colleges, driving demand for retraining
programs. Optimizing space for more efficient utilization could greatly
reduce carbon impacts, operating costs, and deferred maintenance.
Modernizing spaces to better serve a range of student types—such as
nontraditional students—can lead to more efficient, flexible environments
that support contemporary teaching, learning, and administrative
functions.
Finding opportunities to encourage or support cross-institutional
o
collaboration and space sharing. Strategic collaboration among higher
education institutions and with external partners in K-12 education and
industry can lead to cost savings, more robust academic offerings, and
improved resource utilization. Shared spaces for research, career training,
or student services allow institutions to collaborate, pool resources, and
avoid duplicating efforts.
Meeting needs for research and applied learning space. Specialized
o
facilities for research and career training equip students with skills that
meet workforce demands. High-demand industries in Massachusetts have
already found ways to build partnerships with institutions, like through the
limited-use Workforce Skills Capital grant program. Applications and
awards from that program reveal a need for technology related to
programming and web development, robotics and automation, advanced
manufacturing, construction management and building trades, and more.
• Requiring (and providing support for) longer-term planning to inform
project evaluation and selection, in the form of master plans. Master
planning helps institutions take a comprehensive, long-term approach to facility
management, aligning investments with strategic priorities and demographic
trends. Providing support for these efforts ensures campuses can make data-
driven decisions about future projects. Robust planning also enhances the
efficiency and effectiveness of capital projects.
• Recognizing the distinct missions and needs of the different public higher
education sectors in developing and administering capital funding
programs. Community colleges focus on workforce development, offering job
training, retraining, certification, skills improvement, and developmental courses
for students preparing for college-level study or entering the workforce. State
universities provide baccalaureate and master’s degree programs that integrate
liberal arts, sciences, and professional education. Meanwhile, the University of
Massachusetts serves as a public research university system, advancing
knowledge through comprehensive instruction, research, and public service.
Related to these differing missions, it will be important to consider how factors
like square footage and enrollment are incorporated into any kind of funding
23
formula – so as to not disincentivize institutions from serving their unique needs
and student bodies – see callout box for more details.
Square Footage, Enrollment, and the Importance of Treating Sectors Differently
Square footage reflects deferred maintenance needs, decarbonization
requirements, and the space required for program modernization. Considering
square footage avoids penalizing institutions that have historically made investments
in maintaining and upgrading their facilities. However, using square footage alone
does not account for how efficiently those spaces are utilized, and institutions with
less efficient space utilization could receive more funding, possibly leading to
inefficiencies.
Enrollment is another important metric, as it reflects demand for institutional
services. Metrics like headcount, which counts the total number of enrolled students,
and full-time equivalent (FTE), which normalizes enrollment by accounting for part-
time students’ reduced attendance, offer different perspectives. Headcount could
disproportionally benefit institutions with many part-time students, while FTE might
favor those with a greater percentage of full-time students. But institutions that serve
a significant number of non-traditional, part-time students—such as community
colleges—should not be incentivized to shift away from serving these students, and
the formula should account for their unique needs. Likewise, institutions with a larger
proportion of full-time students, such as those in the UMass system, should not be
penalized for their enrollment patterns.
A combined square-foot-per-student metric may reflect the actual demand for
facilities by accounting for both the amount of space and the number of students it
serves. However, a square-foot-per-student approach could disadvantage institutions
with substantial research programs or a high share of resident students, as these
types of institutions often require additional space for non-instructional purposes like
labs, housing, and student services.
Process for Application, Approval, Design, and Delivery of Capital Projects
The Working Group evaluated the application, approval, design, and delivery of current
and recent state capital programs to understand what has worked well in existing
programs, to expose unmet need, and to identify opportunities for improvement over the
current process.
What has worked well:
• The focus of the three historical programs – critical repairs, campus-wide
infrastructure, and major capital projects. The critical repairs program
addresses deferred maintenance needs in Commonwealth-owned facilities,
established in Facility Condition Assessments (FCAs) and supplemented with
data provided by institutions. Campus-wide infrastructure projects reduce the risk
of catastrophic failures, revealed in FCAs and Infrastructure Assessments (IAs).
The major capital projects program serves as the main opportunity for institutions
to address the programmatic priorities of students and the state.
24
• The predictability and flexibility of the critical repairs program. The
formulaic allocation and the five-year funding cycle allow campuses to plan for
larger projects and adjust to evolving priorities. This model particularly suits the
centralized strategic planning structure within the UMass system, because the
program allows reallocation of funds across campuses to address urgent needs.
• The model of the infrastructure program to support priorities like
decarbonization. This program prevents campus leaders from having to choose
between programmatic modernization projects and large-scale infrastructure
projects that are often hidden from view but pose major risks to campus
operations should failure occur. This program could serve as a model for future
efforts to support campus-wide decarbonization, through its central planning and
prioritization, its focus on systems serving multiple buildings, and its efficient
delivery mechanisms.

• Demolishing outdated buildings where the building is unsafe and there is
no intention or need to replace. High upfront costs deter campuses from
addressing these issues, even though maintaining unsafe, outdated buildings
can be more expensive long-term.
• Vertical infrastructure projects. The three previous phases of the Accelerated
Infrastructure program focused on major campus-wide horizontal infrastructure at
14 campuses, mainly addressing problems in pipes and steam tunnels. However,
vertical infrastructure projects, like elevators that also enhance accessibility, are
not covered under existing programs.
Opportunities for improvement:
• The major capital project application process is perceived as taking too
long relative to the level of funding available. The current program model
requires a full fiscal year between the opening of an application round and award
announcements. Accelerating this process could be more responsive to urgent
campus needs and reduce the impact of construction cost escalation on the
amount of work that can be completed with available funding.
• The timeline from award announcement to project construction is a
significant bottleneck. Projects often encounter delays, particularly in the study
phase. A campus might be awarded funding, only for issues like unanticipated
building code compliance requirements to arise during the study phase, forcing
delays for value engineering to realign the project scope with the available
funding in order to meet the statutory requirement for study certification. During
periods of particularly high construction cost escalation, like the post-pandemic
years, this can create a vicious cycle where the redesign delay period
compounds funding gaps as projected costs continue to rise.
Study/SD Design Bid Construction
Year 1 Year 2 Year 3 Year 4 Year 5
• The $300,000 statutory threshold for requiring a study has not kept pace
with inflation. Originally meaningful, this threshold now applies to nearly all
deferred maintenance projects, imposing excessive pre-design requirements on
comparatively modest, straightforward repair projects, and often delays
implementation.
• The major project request funding cap level is a constraint on project
delivery and creates financial burdens for campuses. The funding cap level
was set at $30 million for the round awarded in FY23, and $25 million for the
rounds awarded in FY22 and FY19. Although understandable as a measure of
fiscal responsibility, the cap severely constrains the scopes and sizes of projects
26
or forces institutions to fund the difference, which not all institutions have the
same capacity to do.
• Spending requirements should align with multi-year construction timelines.
Many projects span fiscal years, because of the seasonal nature of most
construction and because institutions may prefer construction disturbances
during the summer when there are fewer students and fewer classes to disrupt.
As a result, it is seldom practical to use operating budget sources to fund capital
investments, as was done in FY24 with the one-time allocation of Fair Share
funding that year to higher education capital projects. It can also be challenging
to project cash flows and align expenditure needs with timing of funding
availability in the traditional CIP.
• The matching funds model could benefit from greater flexibility and
transparency. While matching funds have only been encouraged in recent
rounds of the major capital projects program, they have functioned as a de facto
requirement. This is challenging for public higher education institutions due to
limited borrowing capacity for institutional advancement and limits on student fee
increases. Working Group members expressed support for greater transparency
in match expectations and for considerations of alternative forms of matching,
such as leveraging public-private partnerships or surplus land disposition.
• Reporting requirements can be overly burdensome for some institutions.
Several institutions testified that the reporting requirements associated with
critical repairs funding can be a significant challenge, particularly for smaller
schools with fewer resources. While well-staffed institutions may be able to
manage these requirements more efficiently, smaller institutions often lack the
staff or expertise needed to navigate the reporting system, leading to
inefficiencies and delays. Streamlining the reporting process or providing
additional support to these institutions could help mitigate this burden.
• Competitive applications across all three segments of higher education
forces difficult and unfair comparisons. The Working Group heard interest in
the idea that the segments be treated differently, rather than asking them to
compete on uneven playing fields. Some institutions both have the capacity for
and the need for longer-term strategic planning, while others have missions that
align more directly with short-term goals. One possible solution may be to create
a formulaic distribution across segments and then have a competitive application
within that.
Supports for the Institutions and Authorities to Identify and Finance Investments
In coordination with DCAMM and the Board of Higher Education (BHE), the
Massachusetts State College Building Authority (MSCBA) mainly supports planning,
financing, and development of revenue-producing facilities on state university and
community college campuses. Revenue-producing facilities include housing, dining,
athletic, parking, and other student activity facilities. However, exceptions have been
granted in the past; the MSCBA was specifically authorized to finance certain academic
facility projects listed in the 2008 higher education bond bill, including an academic
27
center at Mount Wachusett Community College, a wellness center at Worcester State
University, and a theater at Salem State University. The MSCBA receives no
appropriation from the Commonwealth; all revenues are derived from the rents and fees
paid by the students for the use of the facilities and services. The projects are financed
through revenue bonds that are repaid through student fees, vendor contributions, and
university operating and reserve funds. When a campus needs new student housing or
other facilities, they work with the MSCBA to identify the need and develop a project
plan. The MSCBA is not selecting or prioritizing among projects proposed by
institutions.
UMBA is responsible for designing, building, and maintaining facilities on the University
of Massachusetts campuses. This includes hiring the architects, engineers, and
construction firms to design and build facilities. To the extent that projects across the
UMass system are considered and planned more holistically, this is a result of the
capital plan developed and updated by the UMass president’s office every two years.
The plan prioritizes projects and identifies funding sources. UMBA works with the
president’s office and each campus to manage projects. UMBA can borrow funds by
issuing bonds, and each campus pledges to pay the principal and interest on the bonds
issued for their facilities. Facilities are financed with student fees.
The Working Group found broad interest in strengthening the MSCBA. One idea that
surfaced in a Working Group meeting is to increase the MSCBA’s ability to contribute
resources to academic building projects and support community colleges as well as
state universities. This might resemble the direction in the 2008 higher education bond
bill for the MSCBA to issue debt to fund specified academic building projects, done
through a language change to the Authority’s statute, or by expanding their statute to
cover all academic buildings. Another aspect may be to encourage pooled fees and
revenues across facilities, where currently any revenue generated by a facility is sunk
back in for maintenance of that same facility.
Another idea that surfaced to strengthen Massachusetts’ public higher education
institutions would be for the state to offer guidance to standardize the development of
and required content included in master plans, in part to ensure consistent alignment
with applicable state policy priorities that influence capital investment, including
decarbonization mandates. As enrollment numbers and institutions grew for several
decades until recently, master plans often were focused on what buildings and
programs institutions needed to grow and attract students, and then considered how
funds might be raised. In this new era of capital funding where allocations may be
planned further in advance, master plans may instead focus on how to spend and
prioritize among the available and expected dollars. These master plans have been
available for DCAMM and BHE, but if they become more standardized, they might be
used to plan more strategically and holistically across the system of higher education.
28
Future Bond Legislation Investments and Next Steps
Legislation will be needed to establish a permanent financing structure using income
surtax revenues for the issuance of debt for the benefit of public higher education
institutions. A higher education bond bill must propose sufficient bond issuance
authorization to cover expected higher education capital spending over the next 10
years. The borrowing capacity authorized in this bond bill should be informed by the
amount the Commonwealth expects can be leveraged from the Fair Share revenue that
is set aside. A pledge of Fair Share revenues to a new Higher Education Special
Obligation Credit should also be authorized in legislation. Once pledged, the agreement
to repay debt service will become permanent for the life of the debt. Although both the
authorization and the agreement to repay debt service will be needed to support such a
program, they can be drafted in such a way that either can be passed first.
This strategy entails a series of bond issuances over the next 10 years. Bond issuances
will be structured such that the debt service on outstanding bonds will not exceed an
amount between $100 and 150 million in any given year, which outside financial
consultants expect will allow the Commonwealth to borrow between $2 to 3.5 billion
over 10 years. The debt service required in the early years will be less than the pledged
amount, given the relatively small amount of bonds that will be outstanding. However,
as more bonds are issued, debt service will gradually increase to the pledged amount
between $100 and 150 million. To the extent that the debt service amount that’s
pledged annually is more than what is needed in a given year, that funding can be used
to relieve institution debt or fund additional higher education capital projects.
Current modeling assumes that the administration issues $500 million of debt every two
years, although there are many possible models. Based on the planning done to date
and the state’s recent experience in allocating capital funds to higher education capital
projects, this funding can be allocated quickly and bring meaningful, tangible impacts
within the first year or two. Smaller accelerated infrastructure or lab modernization
projects can be accomplished within 2 years, while larger major capital projects may
take 4-5 years to be constructed.
Securing funding to address higher education capital needs is only the first step.
DCAMM, EOE, A&F, and other members of the administration should continue to
engage members of the Working Group and other stakeholders on implementation of
any programs that come out of this new financing mechanism. This collaborative effort
may include reviewing anticipated formulas, criteria for existing programs, and the
substance of any potential new capital programs to support unmet needs like nimble
workforce programming.
29
Conclusion
The public higher education system in Massachusetts is facing a critical set of capital
challenges that threaten its ability to meet the evolving needs of students and the
workforce. Outdated infrastructure, a backlog of deferred maintenance, and the
pressing demands of decarbonization are all creating obstacles for institutions striving to
provide a modern, high-quality education. These issues, if left unaddressed, risk
undermining the Commonwealth’s ability to remain a leader in creating educational
opportunity and economic growth. To address these systemic challenges, the state
must adopt innovative, long-term solutions that go beyond the limitations of traditional
funding mechanisms. By leveraging Fair Share revenue through a special obligation
bond structure, similar to the model used by the Commonwealth Transportation Fund,
Massachusetts can create a sustainable, dedicated funding stream for higher education
capital needs, while retaining the flexibility to support broader state priorities with Fair
Share revenues.
This report outlines a set of findings and proposed strategies to address the challenges
faced by the public higher education system. Expanding funding through innovative
financing mechanisms will provide the flexibility needed to modernize campuses, reduce
deferred maintenance, and support critical decarbonization efforts. In doing so, the state
can prioritize values such as safety, predictability, and transparency in capital project
processes, while ensuring alignment with broader state goals for sustainability and
workforce development. With these measures in place, Massachusetts can not only
address the pressing needs of its public higher education system but also secure its
future as a hub of opportunity for students, faculty, and the workforce. By taking bold,
decisive action now, Massachusetts will strengthen its higher education institutions and
help ensure the long-term success of the state and its residents.

Executive Summary
Massachusetts is known for its excellent higher education system, which drives
innovation and strengthens our economy. Our public institutions of higher education are
a big part of this success, offering affordable, high-quality education and preparing
students for jobs that help our state grow. This year, we have seen remarkable
progress: thanks to historic investments in free community college, applications to
community colleges have surged, and enrollment has increased by double digits,
reversing more than a decade of declines. Public four-year colleges are also seeing
their first enrollment growth since 2013.
However, our public higher education system is facing significant capital challenges.
Much of the construction on these campuses happened in the 1970s, resulting in aging
academic buildings and infrastructure that now require major upgrades. Deferred
maintenance is coming due, and campuses are struggling to meet the modern needs of
students and the workforce. While each campus faces unique capital challenges,
common themes include rising construction costs, the need to modernize pedagogical
technology and ensure ADA compliance, and substantial investments in
decarbonization to meet the state’s ambitious climate goals. Meeting these challenges
on the scale required is all but impossible within the constraints of the state’s traditional
capital program.
Recognizing these challenges, section 196 of the FY25 GAA directed the creation of a
working group to identify new sources of capital to support higher education
transformation and consider options for best deploying those new resources in a way
that will benefit students, institutions, the workforce, and the Commonwealth as a whole.
New Sources of Capital to Support Higher Education Transformation
Through months of investigation, the Working Group confirmed the viability of
leveraging Fair Share revenue to unlock an estimated $2 to $3.5 billion in new
capital resources for Massachusetts’ community colleges, state universities, and
the University of Massachusetts system over the next 10 years, an approach that
imitates the Commonwealth’s successful creation and use of the Commonwealth
Transportation Fund.
With the support of external financial advisors, the group confirmed that the proposed
scale of debt issuance is modest relative to anticipated Fair Share collections, ensuring
minimal risk in meeting debt service commitments and allowing for the creation of a new
capital bonding program without constraining other operational goals and uses of Fair
Share revenue. Moreover, the analysis confirmed that the creation of a standalone
credit structure secured by Fair Share can be done without having any impact on
existing credits of the Commonwealth’s General Obligation debt capacity.
Findings on Deploying New Capital to Address Needs
Having confirmed that Fair Share is a viable source for unlocking new capital resources,
the Working Group evaluated different values for how this increased funding may best
2

be allocated to address higher education capital needs, and identified the following set
of guiding principles for consideration:
• Ensuring greater predictability and transparency of funding
• Preserving flexibility to meet evolving needs
• Prioritizing deferred maintenance and critical repairs of existing facilities
• Prioritizing alignment with administration priorities, including:
Net zero carbon emissions goals
o
Strategy outlined in the Workforce Skills Cabinet Regional Blueprints
o
• Developing smarter and more innovative program delivery models, including:
Preparing facilities for changing student demographics and enrollment
o
trends
Modernizing and optimizing space utilization to support evolving
o
pedagogies and new learning needs
Finding opportunities to encourage or support cross-institutional
o
collaboration and space sharing
Meeting needs for research and applied learning space
o
• Requiring (and providing support for) longer-term planning to inform project
evaluation and selection, in the form of master plans
• Recognizing the distinct missions and needs of the different public higher
education sectors in developing and administering capital funding programs
Finally, the Working Group evaluated the application, approval, design, and delivery of
current and recent state capital programs to understand what has worked well in
existing programs, to expose unmet need, and to identify opportunities for improvement
over the current process. The takeaways are included in the full report.
Next Steps
Legislation is necessary to translate these findings into transformational capital
improvements for our public institutions of higher education. Specifically, legislation is
needed to pledge Fair Share revenues for debt service until the final maturity of the debt
for a Higher Education Special Obligation Credit and to authorize spending of the
resulting higher education capital funding over the next 10 years.
In parallel, the Working Group’s findings should be used to continue refining the state’s
processes for awarding and deploying higher education capital funds. While there is
much work to be done, our campuses and students will begin to feel the impact of these
new capital resources in the near future. Based on prior experience, smaller
“accelerated infrastructure” projects can be accomplished within 2 years, while larger
“major capital” projects can take 4-5 years to be constructed.
Conclusion
Massachusetts faces critical capital challenges in its public higher education system,
with aging infrastructure, deferred maintenance, and decarbonization demands
threatening its ability to meet modern student and workforce needs. These challenges
3

require bold solutions, as the state’s traditional capital programs are insufficient to meet
these significant needs. Leveraging Fair Share revenue through a special obligation
bond structure, in the model of the Commonwealth Transportation Fund, is a valid and
viable approach to expanding the pie of higher education capital resources while also
maintaining the flexibility to support other priorities and commitments with that revenue
stream. The borrowing made possible by this approach would support a 10-year higher
education bond bill that will provide the type of transformational change and investment
our public higher education campuses need to best serve their students, our workforce,
and our state.

About the Higher Education Capital Working Group
Working Group Process
The Working Group was formed by Outside Section 196 of the FY25 GAA and tasked
with: 1) identifying new sources of capital to support higher education transformation
and 2) considering options for best deploying that capital to address the challenges
facing the system. The outside section instructed the working group to study and report
on:
(i) the feasibility and impacts of establishing a permanent financing structure
using income surtax revenues for the issuance of debt for the benefit of public
higher education capital needs; (page 17)
(ii) support for the University of Massachusetts Building Authority and the
Massachusetts State College Building Authority to identify and finance
investments in public higher education infrastructure; (page 27)
(iii) the capital funding necessary for public higher education campuses, broken
down by campus; (page 32)
(iv) potential federal sources of reimbursement or grant funding for public higher
education capital projects; (page 19)
(v) a prioritization process for public higher education capital needs; (page 21)
(vi) the total bonding capacity available for a public higher education capital
projects bond legislation, including recommendations for the use of any
general or special obligation bonds; (page 16)
(vii) a recommendation for a funding amount for future bond legislation for public
higher education capital needs; (page 17)
(viii) potential processes for application, approval, design and delivery of capital
projects for public higher education campuses; and (page 24)
(ix) possible investments for future bond legislation for public higher education
capital needs, including, but not limited to, decarbonization, deferred
maintenance and facilities improvement for the public higher education
system of the commonwealth. (page 29)
Starting in September 2024, the Working Group convened four meetings. The full slides
from these meetings are included in Appendix 3 of this report. The first meeting topic
was “Objectives, Background, and Level Setting”. The second meeting topic was
“Campus Needs and Financing Structure and Sources”. The third meeting topic was
“Review of Current Process and Discussion of Priorities and Concerns for Allocation of
Funding”. The fourth meeting was used to review a draft of this report.
The ideas in this report reflect the discussions held by and have broad support from the
members of the Working Group, though no vote was taken.

The Challenges
Higher education is a defining part of Massachusetts’ identity. The state has long been
a beacon of innovation and opportunity, driven by the intellectual and economic
contributions of its public institutions of higher education. Over generations, higher
education in Massachusetts has opened doors for young adults, providing them with
transformative opportunities and preparing them to shape the future. Our public
institutions in particular have served as vital equalizers, making quality education
accessible and affordable while supplying a highly skilled workforce that strengthens the
state’s economy.
Massachusetts’ public higher education system includes fifteen community colleges,
nine state universities, and five University of Massachusetts campuses. These
institutions work collaboratively with the Division of Capital Asset Management and
Maintenance (DCAMM), the Executive Office of Education (EOE), and the Department
of Higher Education (DHE) under a strategic framework that guides long-term capital
investment decisions. Together, they focus on supporting students, addressing
workforce demands, and advancing campus priorities.
While each campus has its own mission and needs, they share similar challenges when
it comes to capital infrastructure. Construction across the state’s higher education
system peaked in the 1970s, meaning that much of the core infrastructure in buildings
across campuses has reached the end of its functional lifespan. This widespread aging
of facilities presents urgent challenges that require coordinated investment.
Figure 1. "Shark" Chart of DCAMM's Capital Portfolio
Compounding these infrastructure issues, the costs of construction, renovation, and
demolition have risen significantly, adding new hurdles to efforts to modernize
campuses and ensure they meet the needs of current and future students. Addressing
these challenges will be critical to maintaining Massachusetts’ leadership in education
and preparing the state’s workforce to thrive in the decades ahead.

Capital Funding Needs at Public Higher Education Institutions
The aging infrastructure of Massachusetts’ public higher education system is
increasingly costly to repair, modernize, and decarbonize. Outdated facilities not only
hinder the state’s ability to meet ambitious decarbonization goals but also fail to support
modern learning, workforce development, and research. State-owned higher education
buildings account for 47% of the total DCAMM portfolio, making them a critical focus for
decarbonization efforts to meet the Commonwealth’s commitments. Addressing these
needs is further complicated by rising costs driven by a range of factors, including:
• Climate mandates. Legislative and executive mandates require the
Commonwealth to eliminate fossil fuel consumption and reduce carbon
emissions from state buildings by 95% by 2050. To meet these goals, institutions
must upgrade building energy performance, replace heating and cooling
infrastructure, modernize electrical services to campuses, and retrofit facilities to
maximize space efficiency.
• Building code updates. Massachusetts regularly updates its building codes to
incorporate advancements in safety, materials, and technology. While these
updates aim to achieve positive outcomes – such as protection of life safety and
reducing carbon emissions – they often lead to higher costs for design and
materials. Additionally, they can extend the survey and schematic design phases
of capital projects, which in turn may further escalate overall construction costs.
• Increased regulatory demands. Increasing regulatory demands contribute to
rising costs by requiring adherence to a range of complex and evolving
standards. These include permitting and environmental review processes, wage
laws, procurement rules, accessibility standards, and more. While these
regulations promote safety, sustainability, and equity, they also add
administrative overhead, increase labor and materials costs, and extend project
timelines, driving up overall expenses for campus infrastructure projects.
• Construction labor shortages. Ongoing shortages in skilled construction labor
increase wages and slow project timelines. Massachusetts had a 2.5%
construction unemployment rate in June, the lowest of any June in at least 17
years.1 This analysis of federal data also shows that construction employment
has increased by only 2.8% since February of 2020, while the annual rate of
construction projects has risen by 44.4%. These persistent labor shortages are
subsequently leading to an increase in wages; Massachusetts had one of the
highest average hourly earnings (AHE) rates in the country, at $49 per hour, and
the year-over-year growth was greater than 6%, above the national average.2
• Rising material costs. Inflation, transportation and energy costs for fabricators
and distributors, and the ongoing scarcity of manufacturing labor are all putting

upward pressure on the cost of building materials, even while the cost of input
commodities is more stable.
Declining enrollment across public higher education institutions further strains the ability
of campuses to fund capital needs. Enrollment across all sectors has declined 34%
since 2010, driven both by expected demographic shifts in the state and by the COVID
pandemic. Although recent tuition-free programs like MassEducate and MassReconnect
have boosted community college enrollments over the past two years, experts project a
“demographic cliff” when the number of high school graduates in Massachusetts is
expected to decline by 10% between 2026 and 2036.3 Enrollment pressures are a
burden on institutions’ ability to contribute to capital funding needs because they collect
less student revenue and have less ability to impose fees sufficient to cover debt
service when those costs could push students elsewhere. Programs like
MassReconnect are also resulting in changing needs from our student populations,
because they are driving increased enrollment of nontraditional students.

To address the mandate set before this Working Group, DCAMM conducted a detailed
assessment of capital funding needs across the public higher education system. This
assessment included the development of dashboards that break down needs at the
institutional level and provide contextual data such as current gross square footage
broken down by high-level use categories, enrollment since 2010, a “shark” chart

showing building age, research expenditures since 2010, and space utilization data.
The dashboards show institutional need, broken into three categories:
• Deferred maintenance. This refers to the backlog of repairs and upkeep
required to address wear and tear on and deterioration of campus buildings and
infrastructure. Normal obsolescence as building components reach the end of
their useful lives is compounded by frequent deferral of preventative
maintenance due to budget constraints, resulting in aging and deteriorating
facilities that may no longer meet basic functional or safety standards. Spending
in this category would ensure the continued operability and safety of existing
infrastructure by addressing issues such as roofing, HVAC systems, plumbing,
and electrical systems. This category also includes work needed to bring
buildings up to contemporary life safety, accessibility, energy, and other code
requirements adopted after the facilities’ initial construction. The estimates of
deferred maintenance come from Facility Condition Assessment (FCA) studies
supplemented with data from institutions for building authority-owned buildings.
• Decarbonization. This involves retrofitting and upgrading facilities to meet the
Commonwealth’s climate mandates, including to eliminating fossil fuel
consumption and reducing 95% of carbon emissions from state buildings by
2050. This includes improving energy efficiency, installing renewable energy
systems, modernizing heating and cooling systems, and increasing campus
resilience to a changing climate. The estimated costs of decarbonization come
from DCAMM’s internal assessments based on square footage and recent dollar-
per-square-foot project costs, and are then adjusted to eliminate overlap with
deferred maintenance. These cost estimates do not account for embodied
carbon considerations.
• Programmatic modernization. This refers to renovations and new construction
designed to better align campus facilities with current academic and workforce
needs. This includes updating laboratories, classrooms, and other spaces to
support modern teaching methods, research, and student services. The cost of
programmatic modernization was estimated by taking lists from institutions and
the capital plans adopted by the UMass Board of Trustees and then adjusting for
consistency across campuses and sectors by DCAMM’s application of standard
construction cost metrics to campus square footage.
All three categories often overlap in practice, as projects addressing program
improvements or aging infrastructure frequently present opportunities for code
upgrades, energy efficiency, and carbon reduction. However, in this analysis, DCAMM
adjusted estimates to eliminate duplication of costs. By separating these needs,
DCAMM provides a clearer understanding of the distinct investments required to
address foundational infrastructure deficiencies and meet the Commonwealth’s climate
mandates. The below chart presents estimated capital funding needs aggregated at the
sector level. Further information on the dashboards is available in Appendix 2.

Figure 3. Projected Capital Funding Needs by Sector
Capital Constraints and Available Bond Capacity
The capital needs across Massachusetts’ institutions of higher education are extensive
but the resources available through traditional funding sources are highly constrained.
The below section outlines the functions and limits of the state’s Capital Investment
Plan (CIP) and the state’s historic and current role in financing public higher education
capital projects.
CIP Uses and Constraints
Massachusetts’ CIP is a five-year rolling plan that funds construction and maintenance
of key infrastructure. It is focused on community grant programming and projects related
to state-owned assets, including facilities, infrastructure, and land or natural
environment. Projects include maintaining, repairing, modernizing, and strengthening
state assets, supporting housing development, fostering economic development, and
supporting cities and towns through grant programming.
The FY25-29 CIP’s primary source of funding is $3.117 billion in General Obligation
(GO) bonds, which are issued to investors who are repaid over time via debt service
that is paid from the state’s annual operating budget. Bond authorization, secured in
bond bills enacted by the Legislature, enables the Commonwealth to spend bond cap.
However, authorization does not require bond spending; actual spending and annual
growth in capital spending is determined through the annual CIP process.
12

Growth in the bond cap is subject to statutory and policy limits and is ultimately based
on the recommendation of the Debt Affordability Committee (DAC). The statutory direct
debt limit restricts the total amount of outstanding principal on the Commonwealth’s
direct debt to no more than 105% of the previous fiscal year’s limit. The annual
borrowing limit limits annual debt service payments to less than 8% of budgeted
revenues. Annual growth in the bond cap is generally limited to less than $125 million.
The DAC takes these limits into consideration in their recommendation, along with credit
factors – rating agencies continually cite elevated debt levels as Massachusetts’ biggest
credit negative factor – and how much an increase in debt service will put pressure on
the operating budget or limit future flexibility to fund critical infrastructure projects.
The Debt Affordability Committee’s FY25 recommendation to the Governor cited recent
inflation and construction market trends and data as a factor in their recommendation
for a conservative increase in bond cap.5 Recent escalating levels of construction costs
are limiting the purchasing power of the CIP, and further, state agencies have reported
that individual project costs are far exceeding original estimates.
History of Higher Education Financing and Investments.
In response to the growing capital challenges faced by Massachusetts’ public higher
education system, Governor Patrick launched a 10-year comprehensive education
reform initiative shortly after taking office, including a focus on higher education
financing reform. At the time, investments in higher education accounted for only 3% of
the Commonwealth’s total capital budget. By FY13, the Patrick administration had
increased this share to 12%, reflecting a significant prioritization of higher education
capital needs.6
A cornerstone of these efforts was the 2008 filing of a $2.2 billion, 10-year higher
education bond bill. This dramatically increased funding for capital projects across all
public higher education institutions. As a result, every community college, state
university, and UMass campus benefited from at least one major new capital project.
Those projects included a range of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math
(STEM) buildings, new academic and lab space, new libraries and student areas, and
crucial infrastructure and deferred maintenance projects essential to allowing campuses
to operate at the highest level. Many of these projects addressed decades of deferred
maintenance and marked the first major construction efforts on several campuses since
the 1970s. This period of investment is reflected in Figure 1, which shows a notable
increase in higher education construction from 2008 to 2014.
Additionally, the 2008 life sciences bond bill provided targeted support for UMass,
enhancing the ability of campuses and graduates to contribute to the state’s life
sciences sector. UMass received one-fifth of the bill’s proceeds for projects including a
life sciences center at the Amherst campus, an “Advanced Therapeutics Cluster” at
UMass Medical School, and an Advanced Technology Manufacturing Center near the

Dartmouth campus, among others.7 Some small grants were available for community
colleges, but otherwise this bill did little to support state universities and community
colleges.
More recently, the 2022 general governmental bond bill authorized $750 million in
additional borrowing for repairs and improvements at state higher education institutions.
This authorization relied on general obligation debt, as did the 2008 bond bill
authorization, so although it enabled crucial spending at the higher education
institutions, spending was still limited by the constraints on the bond cap, and any bond
cap spending on higher education displaced spending in other areas.
Even with these infusions of funding, there continues to be significant need, occurring in
a time where the above outlined pressures make additional progress challenging.
Current and Recent Higher Education Capital Project Programs Funded Through the CIP.
As of the most recent CIP, DCAMM accounts for 23% of planned bond cap spending in
the next 5 years, or approximately $722 million per year. In FY25, $156.5 million of this
is programmed directly for higher education. Institutions have also benefited in other
ways related to funding – campuses received a significant share of DCAMM’s
decarbonization investment in FY24 – and related to strategic planning – DCAMM
accelerated the flow of capital funding commitments to UMass projects at the end of
FY24 by transferring money to UMBA that had been pledged in FY25.
The recent approach has apportioned state capital funding for higher education to three
programs. The first is a formula distribution of Critical Repairs funding to address
deferred maintenance. The second is the Accelerated Infrastructure program, which
prioritized investments based on Infrastructure Assessments and Facility Condition
Assessments. The third is a competitive program for awarding major capital funding,
capped at $30 million per project.
The Critical Repairs program addresses urgent repair and deferred maintenance needs
in state-owned higher education facilities. Targeting projects under $5 million, it ensures
campuses can address essential issues like building envelopes, mechanical systems,
accessibility, and life safety compliance. Funding is allocated in five-year-long rounds,
which creates predictability and allows institutions to plan and execute larger-scale
repairs. To date, two rounds have been funded, each providing $250 million in state
bond funds, matched by campus contributions. Allocations are determined using a
formula: a base amount of $3 million is distributed to each institution, with remaining
funds apportioned based on factors like gross square footage, documented deferred
maintenance, and enrollment headcount. Campuses have discretion to prioritize their
projects, with oversight provided by DCAMM.
The campus-wide Accelerated Infrastructure program funds strategic investments in
large-scale infrastructure projects that fall outside the scope of the Critical Repairs
program. These projects address essential systems like sub-surface utilities and parking

lots, focusing on preventing catastrophic failures that could disrupt campus operations.
This program also addresses security concerns, like improved crosswalk safety
measures and curb cuts, as well as maintenance or construction of new roads and
pedestrian walkways and bridges, and maintenance of water and sewer systems,
among other projects. By targeting these issues, the program enables campus leaders
to focus some resources on programmatic priorities without compromising infrastructure
needs. Projects are identified, planned, managed, and executed by DCAMM, with
typical timelines of two years from initial studies to completion. To date, $193.1 million in
state capital funds have been spent or committed, supplemented by modest
contributions from institutions. While the program is not currently funded for new
projects, it has been suggested as a potential model for tackling campus-wide
decarbonization initiatives in the future.
The Major Capital Projects program supports transformative investments that align with
institutional priorities and state goals for education and workforce development. The
program was initiated in FY19 following the Strategic Framework for Massachusetts
Public Higher Education, which aimed to create an open, competitive, and information-
driven process for evaluating capital projects based on the needs across the whole
higher education system. Designed for larger-scale projects, the program creates a
transparent, competitive process for allocating state funds. All 29 public higher
education institutions are eligible to submit one project per round, with approximately
five projects funded each cycle. Proposals with significant campus contributions are
prioritized, and 80% of funded projects to date have been at community colleges and
state universities. UMass projects are typically executed by the UMass Building
Authority (UMBA), while DCAMM oversees projects for community colleges and state
universities. To date, $451.6 million in state bond funds have been spent or committed,
matched by $375.5 million in campus contributions. Modest grants to institutions for
project development have also been a key feature of the program, supporting the
development of strong, competitive applications. While the program has been highly
impactful, it is currently unfunded for new rounds.
15

New Sources of Capital to Support Higher Education Transformation
While the above programs and investments have had a significant positive impact on
higher education capital, the need on our public higher education campuses is growing
well above and beyond what the Capital Investment Plan can accommodate. The
Working Group, therefore, investigated options for growing the available amount of
funding, before then evaluating different models for how the funding may best be
allocated to address capital needs.
In the last two budget proposals, FY24 H.1 and FY25 H.2, the Healey-Driscoll
Administration proposed pledging $140 million and $125 million respectively of Fair
Share revenues to support capital investments on university and community college
campuses to address the substantial backlog in deferred maintenance. These proposals
were not enacted by the Legislature, although a one-time investment of $50 million of
Fair Share revenue was allocated to institutions of higher education in FY24 for use on
decarbonization projects, accessibility improvements, and campus security investments.
The Fair Share revenue is constitutionally dedicated to education and transportation.
The Administration proposed using this revenue to unlock more capital, similar to what
had been done for transportation with the Commonwealth Transportation Fund (CTF).
The Administration projected that this could unlock up to $2.5 billion in borrowing
capacity over the next 10 years by securitizing this new revenue stream. The Working
Group investigated this idea to ensure its feasibility and to develop a clearer vision for
how new resources would be utilized.
Evaluation of Special Obligation Bonds as a Structure for New Capital Funds
Most bond bills in Massachusetts authorize the issuance of General Obligation (GO)
debt, which supports most of the state’s capital spending as outlined in the CIP. Recent
examples include the $5.16 billion in GO debt authorized in the Affordable Homes Act
and the $3.96 billion in GO debt authorized by the MassLeads Act. However,
Massachusetts has established a precedent for using special obligation bonds as an
alternative to GO debt. These bonds are tied to specific revenue streams, allowing the
Commonwealth to address strategic priorities while safeguarding its GO credit rating. By
diversifying its borrowing strategies, Massachusetts enhances its financial flexibility,
strengthens market access, and ensures better funding for priorities such as
transportation and infrastructure improvements.
Creating special obligation bonds presents a viable option for generating new capital
funds to address deferred maintenance and other critical needs in public higher
education, akin to what the Commonwealth Transportation Fund (CTF), created in
2009, has done for public transportation. The CTF has proven to effectively allocate
transportation-related fees and taxes to fund its obligations over the last 15 years. The
model is trusted enough that the FY25 budget authorized a $250 million transfer of Fair
Share revenues to the CTF. With over 4.5 times coverage for bonds, the CTF supports
robust borrowing capacity while still allowing for significant expenditures on a pay-as-
you-go basis after meeting its bonding obligations. The CTF’s strong credit profile,
currently rated Aa1 by Moody’s and AAA by S&P and Kroll, demonstrates the
16

effectiveness and reliability of this approach. A standalone credit structure could
similarly expand the Commonwealth’s capital borrowing program for higher education
capital projects. The amount of borrowing that the Commonwealth can do is contingent
on how much funding is pledged to cover debt service. By dedicating revenues to debt
service while the bonds are outstanding, the program minimizes risk while providing
financial predictability. Although the CTF’s credit rating is uniquely high, the external
analysis confirms that securing bonds with existing Fair Share revenues will provide
coverage of debt service costs that rating agencies and bondholders will seek. In other
words, it is expected to achieve a credit rating in the high investment grade category
(Double-A ratings).
Importantly, such a credit structure would not negatively affect the Commonwealth’s
general credit ratings. This new revenue source is segregated from the General Fund
and would be pledged to bondholders. Like the CTF, this structure would involve no
pledge of the Commonwealth’s taxing power or have an implied moral obligation, and
there would be no contract assistance pledge.
The Feasibility of Establishing a Dedicated Financing Structure Using Income Surtax
Revenue
The Working Group looked at three aspects of feasibility:
• Whether such a proposal is legally feasible,
• Whether it is financially feasible, and
• Whether this is a good policy solution to address institution needs.
The constitutional earmarking of Fair Share funds provides a clear and justifiable basis
for using income surtax revenue to support public higher education. These funds are
specifically dedicated to “quality public education and affordable public colleges and
universities, and for the repair and maintenance of roads, bridges, and public
transportation,” creating a lawful foundation for addressing higher education capital
needs.
Next, the group considered whether it was financially feasible to use Fair Share to
establish a new standalone credit structure for higher education capital funding.
Although Fair Share revenue—derived from a surtax on high-income earners—is
inherently variable, the Commonwealth has implemented safeguards to mitigate
volatility and protect long-term investments. These include a Fair Share stabilization
fund and restrictions on using the revenue for recurring expenses, with the balance
directed toward one-time projects. These mechanisms provide stability while enabling
strategic and sustainable allocations.
There are safeguards in place to protect against the overall variability of Fair Share.
Once pledged to a capital financing structure, revenues must first be used to cover debt
service before being used for other eligible purposes. Moreover, the amount of revenue
that needs to be committed to unlock significant borrowing is small compared to the
overall size of Fair Share. External analysis estimates that a pledge of $100 to 150
million in Fair Share revenues annually will allow the Commonwealth to borrow $2 to 3.5
17

billion over the next 10 years under current market conditions. The estimated scale of
proposed debt obligations, between $100 to 150 million, is modest compared to the size
of Fair Share collections; the Department of Revenue certified $2.460 billion in revenue
for FY24. This ensures that the risk of failing to meet debt service commitments remains
minimal, even in years with revenue fluctuations. Fair Share revenues can be used in
this way without taking away flexibility to spend the rest of the Fair Share revenue on
other prior and planned education and transportation commitments.
In sum, leveraging Fair Share revenue to support a higher education capital financing
structure is both lawful and financially viable. The safeguards, modest debt levels, and
strategic alignment with constitutional mandates make this proposal feasible while
maintaining the flexibility to support other priorities within the broader scope of public
education and transportation.
The Impact of Issuing Special Obligation Bonds Using Fair Share Revenues
A special obligation credit structure would likely secure a high investment-grade credit
rating. The securitization of Fair Share revenues allows for significant debt service
coverage while maintaining flexibility for other operational needs. Like with the CTF,
routing Fair Share revenues through this flow of funds would create large amounts of
debt service coverage without impacting the ability to use the remaining Fair Share
revenue, as those revenues would pass through to the Commonwealth after debt
service has been captured. Although it may take some years for the debt service to
ramp up, it will be critical to pledge the amount needed to fund debt service at its peak
in order for the bond market to have confidence that the funding will be available when
necessary. Any amount of the dedication that is not immediately needed for debt
service could still be used to address the capital needs of our public higher education
institutions.
The Working Group found that this approach aligns with the priorities of stakeholders:

Preliminary modeling scenarios indicate that with a pledge of $100 to $150 million in
Fair Share revenues annually for debt service, the Commonwealth would be able to
generate $2 to 3.5 billion in total funding unlocked to address the capital needs of our
public institutions of higher education over 10 years without any growth in the annual
appropriation.
Potential Federal Sources of Reimbursement or Grant Funding
Growing the pool of funding for capital projects also means ensuring that no federal
resources are left on the table. Leveraging federal reimbursements or grant
opportunities can help Massachusetts maximize its investments and accelerate its
higher education transformation.
Direct Pay reimbursements under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) present a promising
federal funding source. This program, designed to expand access to clean energy tax
credits, enables public entities like the state of Massachusetts to receive refunds for
clean energy investments, helping projects moving forward more quickly and affordably.
DCAMM, A&F’s Federal Funds and Infrastructure Office, and public higher education
campuses are already collaborating to explore these opportunities for reimbursement.
They have begun by submitting projects completed in 2023 for consideration for
reimbursement, but importantly, the state faces no cap on the number or value of its
applications and the program will remain in place through 2032. Any refunds from this
program will go directly to the state rather than to individual institutions, because the
state officially pays the taxes on behalf of our public institutions. The state is currently
exploring options to reinvest these funds into additional decarbonization projects to
further address climate goals.

The Working Group recognizes that future federal opportunities may emerge and
advises monitoring developments under the incoming federal administration. New
opportunities may become available, or the Direct Pay reimbursements may be put at
risk. While few additional opportunities can be identified at this time, federal funding
priorities may shift or expand in ways that could benefit public higher education
institutions in Massachusetts. Flexibility and vigilance will ensure the Commonwealth is
well-positioned to take advantage of new funding streams as they arise.

and compare the total projects need to the combined effect of investments including
Fair Share securitization, the IRA Direct Pay program and other energy and
decarbonization incentives, space optimization efforts, and more.
Figure 5. Illustration of Total Projected Need Compared to Potential Investments
These funding sources will make meaningful progress but still leave extensive need to
be addressed beyond the 10-year horizon of the proposed funding program. Given the
20

duration of major construction activity and the disruptive nature of projects implemented
on active campuses, it would not be practical to assume that all of the documented
need could reasonably be addressed in only one decade. The Working Group
recommends continuing to explore additional funding options that continue into the late
2030s and beyond to meet these needs comprehensively.
Findings on Deploying New Capital to Address Needs
In order to effectively address the capital needs identified across Massachusetts’ higher
education institutions, the Working Group considered how to best distribute new
funding. The group examined various factors that should inform any funding allocations,
including the specific needs of the different sectors, and identified a set of guiding
principles for strategic investment. In addition, the group evaluated the existing
processes for the application, approval, design, and delivery of capital projects,
identifying both strengths and areas for improvement that could enhance efficiency and
better meet institutional needs. The group also considered how to strengthen the
supports available to institutions and authorities to identify and be more strategic about
financing their capital investments. The following sections outline these findings for
improving the capital investment process at all levels.
Process of Prioritizing Higher Education Capital Needs
The process of prioritizing higher education capital needs should be informed by a set of
guiding principles designed to ensure strategic, equitable, and forward-thinking
investments across all sectors and project types. The Working Group identified the
following set of principles for consideration:
• Ensuring greater predictability and transparency of funding. A clear funding
model can create predictability for institutions and allow for more strategic
decision-making. Well-resourced institutions are generally better positioned to be
strategic and maximize funding; creating predictability may allow struggling
institutions more opportunities to be strategic. The Working Group also found that
institutions appreciate the transparency of the recent rounds of the Major Capital
Projects program, in which institutions understood the criteria and could receive
feedback and make edits to the applications over several months.
• Preserving flexibility to meet evolving needs. Capital construction projects in
Massachusetts often take between 2 to 5 years to complete, but campus needs
can evolve rapidly from the time an application is submitted to the time
construction begins, and the process must recognize that. Within the last five
years alone, campuses have seen a number of changes: rising construction
costs across the state, an increase in the population of first-time college students
due to the success of MassEducate, and a shift towards hybrid and online
learning as a result of adaptations made during the pandemic. Cost escalation
that occurs during the study and design phases means that the awarded funding
cannot purchase what was originally intended by the time the construction starts.
• Prioritizing deferred maintenance and critical repairs of existing facilities.
Deferred maintenance poses significant risks, including safety hazards, inefficient
21

energy use, and disruptions to educational activities. Institutions can better
protect students and staff by addressing issues including aging infrastructure,
structural vulnerabilities, campus accessibility, and inadequate emergency
systems. However, this prioritization should not necessarily preserve all existing
structures; in some cases, disposition or demolition may be the most practical
solution, particularly when the presence of hazardous materials or the high cost
of renovation makes continued use unfeasible. By addressing these issues
proactively, the Commonwealth ensures the longevity of its existing infrastructure
while avoiding higher costs associated with emergency repairs.
• Prioritizing alignment with administration priorities, including:
Net zero carbon emissions goals. The Commonwealth’s public higher
o
education system generates two-thirds of the carbon emissions in the
DCAMM portfolio. The state has promised to achieve net zero emissions
by 2050. Renewing facilities, systems, and infrastructure on higher
education campuses is a necessary step towards decarbonizing state
assets.
Strategy outlined in the Workforce Skills Cabinet Regional
o
Blueprints.8 The Cabinet and the regional blueprints aim to develop a
workforce that is sufficient in size, well-prepared, and well-educated in
high-demand fields. The blueprints establish educational and training
pathways, up through higher education, to align Massachusetts students
with priority industries. Integrating blueprint alignment with funding
decisions would ensure higher education capital investments are also
investments in the state’s future workforce.
• Developing smarter program delivery models, including:
Preparing facilities for changing student demographics and
o
enrollment trends. Massachusetts higher education institutions are
seeing enrollment shifts due to initiatives like MassEducate and
MassReconnect. Enrollment at community colleges has increased by 14
percent, while state universities and UMass show more modest increases.
Despite these increases, even community college enrollments remain well
below where they were ten years ago, and most other institutions lag pre-
pandemic peaks, sometimes by very large percentages. Demographic
forecasts and increased uncertainty about the value of college degrees
(even the state has eliminated most degree requirements for hiring)
suggest that enrollment is unlikely to recover. Whether enrollment
numbers stabilize or decline again, institutions should consider
consolidating space to better align with current and future enrollment
projections, reducing overall square footage to meet emerging needs and
avoid maintaining excess capacity.

hybrid office models have reduced utilization of instructional and
administrative space on many campuses. Additionally, programs like
MassReconnect have significantly increased the number of nontraditional
students enrolling in community colleges, driving demand for retraining
programs. Optimizing space for more efficient utilization could greatly
reduce carbon impacts, operating costs, and deferred maintenance.
Modernizing spaces to better serve a range of student types—such as
nontraditional students—can lead to more efficient, flexible environments
that support contemporary teaching, learning, and administrative
functions.
Finding opportunities to encourage or support cross-institutional
o
collaboration and space sharing. Strategic collaboration among higher
education institutions and with external partners in K-12 education and
industry can lead to cost savings, more robust academic offerings, and
improved resource utilization. Shared spaces for research, career training,
or student services allow institutions to collaborate, pool resources, and
avoid duplicating efforts.
Meeting needs for research and applied learning space. Specialized
o
facilities for research and career training equip students with skills that
meet workforce demands. High-demand industries in Massachusetts have
already found ways to build partnerships with institutions, like through the
limited-use Workforce Skills Capital grant program. Applications and
awards from that program reveal a need for technology related to
programming and web development, robotics and automation, advanced
manufacturing, construction management and building trades, and more.
• Requiring (and providing support for) longer-term planning to inform
project evaluation and selection, in the form of master plans. Master
planning helps institutions take a comprehensive, long-term approach to facility
management, aligning investments with strategic priorities and demographic
trends. Providing support for these efforts ensures campuses can make data-
driven decisions about future projects. Robust planning also enhances the
efficiency and effectiveness of capital projects.
• Recognizing the distinct missions and needs of the different public higher
education sectors in developing and administering capital funding
programs. Community colleges focus on workforce development, offering job
training, retraining, certification, skills improvement, and developmental courses
for students preparing for college-level study or entering the workforce. State
universities provide baccalaureate and master’s degree programs that integrate
liberal arts, sciences, and professional education. Meanwhile, the University of
Massachusetts serves as a public research university system, advancing
knowledge through comprehensive instruction, research, and public service.
Related to these differing missions, it will be important to consider how factors
like square footage and enrollment are incorporated into any kind of funding
23

formula – so as to not disincentivize institutions from serving their unique needs
and student bodies – see callout box for more details.
Square Footage, Enrollment, and the Importance of Treating Sectors Differently
Square footage reflects deferred maintenance needs, decarbonization
requirements, and the space required for program modernization. Considering
square footage avoids penalizing institutions that have historically made investments
in maintaining and upgrading their facilities. However, using square footage alone
does not account for how efficiently those spaces are utilized, and institutions with
less efficient space utilization could receive more funding, possibly leading to
inefficiencies.
Enrollment is another important metric, as it reflects demand for institutional
services. Metrics like headcount, which counts the total number of enrolled students,
and full-time equivalent (FTE), which normalizes enrollment by accounting for part-
time students’ reduced attendance, offer different perspectives. Headcount could
disproportionally benefit institutions with many part-time students, while FTE might
favor those with a greater percentage of full-time students. But institutions that serve
a significant number of non-traditional, part-time students—such as community
colleges—should not be incentivized to shift away from serving these students, and
the formula should account for their unique needs. Likewise, institutions with a larger
proportion of full-time students, such as those in the UMass system, should not be
penalized for their enrollment patterns.
A combined square-foot-per-student metric may reflect the actual demand for
facilities by accounting for both the amount of space and the number of students it
serves. However, a square-foot-per-student approach could disadvantage institutions
with substantial research programs or a high share of resident students, as these
types of institutions often require additional space for non-instructional purposes like
labs, housing, and student services.
Process for Application, Approval, Design, and Delivery of Capital Projects
The Working Group evaluated the application, approval, design, and delivery of current
and recent state capital programs to understand what has worked well in existing
programs, to expose unmet need, and to identify opportunities for improvement over the
current process.
What has worked well:
• The focus of the three historical programs – critical repairs, campus-wide
infrastructure, and major capital projects. The critical repairs program
addresses deferred maintenance needs in Commonwealth-owned facilities,
established in Facility Condition Assessments (FCAs) and supplemented with
data provided by institutions. Campus-wide infrastructure projects reduce the risk
of catastrophic failures, revealed in FCAs and Infrastructure Assessments (IAs).
The major capital projects program serves as the main opportunity for institutions
to address the programmatic priorities of students and the state.
24

• The predictability and flexibility of the critical repairs program. The
formulaic allocation and the five-year funding cycle allow campuses to plan for
larger projects and adjust to evolving priorities. This model particularly suits the
centralized strategic planning structure within the UMass system, because the
program allows reallocation of funds across campuses to address urgent needs.
• The model of the infrastructure program to support priorities like
decarbonization. This program prevents campus leaders from having to choose
between programmatic modernization projects and large-scale infrastructure
projects that are often hidden from view but pose major risks to campus
operations should failure occur. This program could serve as a model for future
efforts to support campus-wide decarbonization, through its central planning and
prioritization, its focus on systems serving multiple buildings, and its efficient
delivery mechanisms.

• Demolishing outdated buildings where the building is unsafe and there is
no intention or need to replace. High upfront costs deter campuses from
addressing these issues, even though maintaining unsafe, outdated buildings
can be more expensive long-term.
• Vertical infrastructure projects. The three previous phases of the Accelerated
Infrastructure program focused on major campus-wide horizontal infrastructure at
14 campuses, mainly addressing problems in pipes and steam tunnels. However,
vertical infrastructure projects, like elevators that also enhance accessibility, are
not covered under existing programs.
Opportunities for improvement:
• The major capital project application process is perceived as taking too
long relative to the level of funding available. The current program model
requires a full fiscal year between the opening of an application round and award
announcements. Accelerating this process could be more responsive to urgent
campus needs and reduce the impact of construction cost escalation on the
amount of work that can be completed with available funding.
• The timeline from award announcement to project construction is a
significant bottleneck. Projects often encounter delays, particularly in the study
phase. A campus might be awarded funding, only for issues like unanticipated
building code compliance requirements to arise during the study phase, forcing
delays for value engineering to realign the project scope with the available
funding in order to meet the statutory requirement for study certification. During
periods of particularly high construction cost escalation, like the post-pandemic
years, this can create a vicious cycle where the redesign delay period
compounds funding gaps as projected costs continue to rise.
Study/SD Design Bid Construction

• The $300,000 statutory threshold for requiring a study has not kept pace
with inflation. Originally meaningful, this threshold now applies to nearly all
deferred maintenance projects, imposing excessive pre-design requirements on
comparatively modest, straightforward repair projects, and often delays
implementation.
• The major project request funding cap level is a constraint on project
delivery and creates financial burdens for campuses. The funding cap level
was set at $30 million for the round awarded in FY23, and $25 million for the
rounds awarded in FY22 and FY19. Although understandable as a measure of
fiscal responsibility, the cap severely constrains the scopes and sizes of projects
26

or forces institutions to fund the difference, which not all institutions have the
same capacity to do.
• Spending requirements should align with multi-year construction timelines.
Many projects span fiscal years, because of the seasonal nature of most
construction and because institutions may prefer construction disturbances
during the summer when there are fewer students and fewer classes to disrupt.
As a result, it is seldom practical to use operating budget sources to fund capital
investments, as was done in FY24 with the one-time allocation of Fair Share
funding that year to higher education capital projects. It can also be challenging
to project cash flows and align expenditure needs with timing of funding
availability in the traditional CIP.
• The matching funds model could benefit from greater flexibility and
transparency. While matching funds have only been encouraged in recent
rounds of the major capital projects program, they have functioned as a de facto
requirement. This is challenging for public higher education institutions due to
limited borrowing capacity for institutional advancement and limits on student fee
increases. Working Group members expressed support for greater transparency
in match expectations and for considerations of alternative forms of matching,
such as leveraging public-private partnerships or surplus land disposition.
• Reporting requirements can be overly burdensome for some institutions.
Several institutions testified that the reporting requirements associated with
critical repairs funding can be a significant challenge, particularly for smaller
schools with fewer resources. While well-staffed institutions may be able to
manage these requirements more efficiently, smaller institutions often lack the
staff or expertise needed to navigate the reporting system, leading to
inefficiencies and delays. Streamlining the reporting process or providing
additional support to these institutions could help mitigate this burden.
• Competitive applications across all three segments of higher education
forces difficult and unfair comparisons. The Working Group heard interest in
the idea that the segments be treated differently, rather than asking them to
compete on uneven playing fields. Some institutions both have the capacity for
and the need for longer-term strategic planning, while others have missions that
align more directly with short-term goals. One possible solution may be to create
a formulaic distribution across segments and then have a competitive application
within that.
Supports for the Institutions and Authorities to Identify and Finance Investments
In coordination with DCAMM and the Board of Higher Education (BHE), the
Massachusetts State College Building Authority (MSCBA) mainly supports planning,
financing, and development of revenue-producing facilities on state university and
community college campuses. Revenue-producing facilities include housing, dining,
athletic, parking, and other student activity facilities. However, exceptions have been
granted in the past; the MSCBA was specifically authorized to finance certain academic
facility projects listed in the 2008 higher education bond bill, including an academic
27

center at Mount Wachusett Community College, a wellness center at Worcester State
University, and a theater at Salem State University. The MSCBA receives no
appropriation from the Commonwealth; all revenues are derived from the rents and fees
paid by the students for the use of the facilities and services. The projects are financed
through revenue bonds that are repaid through student fees, vendor contributions, and
university operating and reserve funds. When a campus needs new student housing or
other facilities, they work with the MSCBA to identify the need and develop a project
plan. The MSCBA is not selecting or prioritizing among projects proposed by
institutions.
UMBA is responsible for designing, building, and maintaining facilities on the University
of Massachusetts campuses. This includes hiring the architects, engineers, and
construction firms to design and build facilities. To the extent that projects across the
UMass system are considered and planned more holistically, this is a result of the
capital plan developed and updated by the UMass president’s office every two years.
The plan prioritizes projects and identifies funding sources. UMBA works with the
president’s office and each campus to manage projects. UMBA can borrow funds by
issuing bonds, and each campus pledges to pay the principal and interest on the bonds
issued for their facilities. Facilities are financed with student fees.
The Working Group found broad interest in strengthening the MSCBA. One idea that
surfaced in a Working Group meeting is to increase the MSCBA’s ability to contribute
resources to academic building projects and support community colleges as well as
state universities. This might resemble the direction in the 2008 higher education bond
bill for the MSCBA to issue debt to fund specified academic building projects, done
through a language change to the Authority’s statute, or by expanding their statute to
cover all academic buildings. Another aspect may be to encourage pooled fees and
revenues across facilities, where currently any revenue generated by a facility is sunk
back in for maintenance of that same facility.
Another idea that surfaced to strengthen Massachusetts’ public higher education
institutions would be for the state to offer guidance to standardize the development of
and required content included in master plans, in part to ensure consistent alignment
with applicable state policy priorities that influence capital investment, including
decarbonization mandates. As enrollment numbers and institutions grew for several
decades until recently, master plans often were focused on what buildings and
programs institutions needed to grow and attract students, and then considered how
funds might be raised. In this new era of capital funding where allocations may be
planned further in advance, master plans may instead focus on how to spend and
prioritize among the available and expected dollars. These master plans have been
available for DCAMM and BHE, but if they become more standardized, they might be
used to plan more strategically and holistically across the system of higher education.
28

Future Bond Legislation Investments and Next Steps
Legislation will be needed to establish a permanent financing structure using income
surtax revenues for the issuance of debt for the benefit of public higher education
institutions. A higher education bond bill must propose sufficient bond issuance
authorization to cover expected higher education capital spending over the next 10
years. The borrowing capacity authorized in this bond bill should be informed by the
amount the Commonwealth expects can be leveraged from the Fair Share revenue that
is set aside. A pledge of Fair Share revenues to a new Higher Education Special
Obligation Credit should also be authorized in legislation. Once pledged, the agreement
to repay debt service will become permanent for the life of the debt. Although both the
authorization and the agreement to repay debt service will be needed to support such a
program, they can be drafted in such a way that either can be passed first.
This strategy entails a series of bond issuances over the next 10 years. Bond issuances
will be structured such that the debt service on outstanding bonds will not exceed an
amount between $100 and 150 million in any given year, which outside financial
consultants expect will allow the Commonwealth to borrow between $2 to 3.5 billion
over 10 years. The debt service required in the early years will be less than the pledged
amount, given the relatively small amount of bonds that will be outstanding. However,
as more bonds are issued, debt service will gradually increase to the pledged amount
between $100 and 150 million. To the extent that the debt service amount that’s
pledged annually is more than what is needed in a given year, that funding can be used
to relieve institution debt or fund additional higher education capital projects.
Current modeling assumes that the administration issues $500 million of debt every two
years, although there are many possible models. Based on the planning done to date
and the state’s recent experience in allocating capital funds to higher education capital
projects, this funding can be allocated quickly and bring meaningful, tangible impacts
within the first year or two. Smaller accelerated infrastructure or lab modernization
projects can be accomplished within 2 years, while larger major capital projects may
take 4-5 years to be constructed.
Securing funding to address higher education capital needs is only the first step.
DCAMM, EOE, A&F, and other members of the administration should continue to
engage members of the Working Group and other stakeholders on implementation of
any programs that come out of this new financing mechanism. This collaborative effort
may include reviewing anticipated formulas, criteria for existing programs, and the
substance of any potential new capital programs to support unmet needs like nimble
workforce programming.
29

Conclusion
The public higher education system in Massachusetts is facing a critical set of capital
challenges that threaten its ability to meet the evolving needs of students and the
workforce. Outdated infrastructure, a backlog of deferred maintenance, and the
pressing demands of decarbonization are all creating obstacles for institutions striving to
provide a modern, high-quality education. These issues, if left unaddressed, risk
undermining the Commonwealth’s ability to remain a leader in creating educational
opportunity and economic growth. To address these systemic challenges, the state
must adopt innovative, long-term solutions that go beyond the limitations of traditional
funding mechanisms. By leveraging Fair Share revenue through a special obligation
bond structure, similar to the model used by the Commonwealth Transportation Fund,
Massachusetts can create a sustainable, dedicated funding stream for higher education
capital needs, while retaining the flexibility to support broader state priorities with Fair
Share revenues.
This report outlines a set of findings and proposed strategies to address the challenges
faced by the public higher education system. Expanding funding through innovative
financing mechanisms will provide the flexibility needed to modernize campuses, reduce
deferred maintenance, and support critical decarbonization efforts. In doing so, the state
can prioritize values such as safety, predictability, and transparency in capital project
processes, while ensuring alignment with broader state goals for sustainability and
workforce development. With these measures in place, Massachusetts can not only
address the pressing needs of its public higher education system but also secure its
future as a hub of opportunity for students, faculty, and the workforce. By taking bold,
decisive action now, Massachusetts will strengthen its higher education institutions and
help ensure the long-term success of the state and its residents.

Estimate of 10-year capital • For the UMass system, DCAMM used project lists and costs from the 2024
needed for programmatic Board of Trustees presentation
modernization • For the Community Colleges and State Universities, DCAMM requested and
received, over a 2-week period in September 2024, list of programmatic
modernization projects
• Where the institutions lists did not include dollar amounts, DCAMM analyzed the
requests and developed total project costs based on:
$720/square foot for non-lab renovation;
o
$1,000/square foot for lab renovation; and
o
$1,000/square foot for new construction.
