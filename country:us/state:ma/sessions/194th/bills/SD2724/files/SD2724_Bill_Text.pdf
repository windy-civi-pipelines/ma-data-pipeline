RE: Community Behavioral Health Promotion and Prevention Commission
Dear Clerks Hurley and Carroll:
On behalf of the Community Behavioral Health Promotion and Prevention Commission
(Commission), I am pleased to provide the following letter summarizing the Commission’s
activities from the prior year, pursuant to M.G.L. Chapter 6, Section 219. Please accept this
letter as the Commission’s annual report.
In the past year, the Commission met five times, focusing primarily on efforts to support the
Executive Office of Health and Human Services (EOHHS) and the Department of Mental Health
(EOHHS) in establishing the Office of Behavioral Health Promotion and Prevention (OBHPP).
After a six-month recruitment process, EOHHS selected an outstanding candidate, Dr. Funmi
Aguocha, who joined in June 2024 and brings a wealth of experience in behavioral health
promotion and prevention. Assistant Commissioner Aguocha immediately began engaging the
Commission on a number of initiatives, including a priority-setting exercise, which incorporated
members’ goals, expectations, and potential priorities for the Commission in the upcoming year.
Additionally, members were instrumental in collaborating on a Request for Information (RFI)
released in October by the OBHPP to gather information from communities about their specific
behavioral health needs and innovative approaches they would seek to implement.

The Commission’s members remain committed to promoting initiatives centered on behavioral
health promotion, focusing on children/young adults, ensuring the voices of community
coalitions are reflected in the Commission’s work, along with equity and young adults,
particularly those in marginalized communities.
The Commission is deeply grateful that $19,849,679 has been allocated to the Community
Behavioral Health Promotion and Prevention Trust Fund, a portion of which has been utilized to
staff the OBHPP and support critical public health needs affecting children and young adults
through the establishment of an Interagency Response Team (IRT), established to coordinate
and expedite support for youth with complex behavioral health or special needs. In the coming
years, through a grant-making program led by the OBHPP, these Trust Fund dollars will foster
numerous community-based initiatives focused on behavioral health promotion and prevention
across the Commonwealth.
As the Commission’s members continue to develop the specific recommendations for the
EOHHS Secretary, the Commission will ensure that its proposals will complement the
behavioral health initiatives of the Healey-Driscoll Administration.
I would be happy to offer additional details on the Commission’s ongoing work and answer any
questions you may have.
Sincerely,
Kiame Mahaniah, MD, MBA
Undersecretary for Health
Executive Office of Health and Human Services
