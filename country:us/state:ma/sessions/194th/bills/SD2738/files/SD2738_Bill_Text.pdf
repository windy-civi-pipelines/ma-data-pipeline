ANNUAL REPORT

INTRODUCTION
The Workforce Training Fund is a
resource for Massachusetts employers
to train incumbent workers, which in
turn strengthens the productivity and
competitiveness for employers in a
variety of industries throughout the
state. The Workforce Training Fund
Program is funded through an
assessment on Massachusetts
employers’ Unemployment Insurance
contributions. Commonwealth
Corporation, a quasi-public agency,
administers the Workforce Training
Fund on behalf of the Executive Office
of Labor and Workforce Development.
The enabling legislation for the Workforce Training Fund (Massachusetts General Laws
Chapter 29 Section 2RR) calls for a report to be filed with the Joint Committee on Labor
and Workforce Development and the House and Senate Ways and Means Committees, of
each year. The report highlights grants made during the previous fiscal year together with
recommendations and additional information as considered appropriate. The report
must also include information concerning the collection of the workforce training
contributions for the previous calendar year including (i) the amount collected in each
quarter and the total amount collected for the calendar year; (ii) the total number of
employers that contributed to the fund and the total number of employees employed by
that group of employers; and (iii) the contribution rate.

2024 HIGHLIGHTS
JOB GROWTH @ 5X THE
NATIONAL RATE:
Previously awarded General Program grantees that completed
training in FY24 added 5,502 new jobs in Massachusetts,
growing their net number of Massachusetts employees by 21.3
percent over the past two years. During the same employment
period, Massachusetts experienced 2.4 percent statewide
growth in employment while the country experienced 3.7
percent national growth. These comparisons demonstrate the
effectiveness of the Workforce Training Fund as a tool that
spurs job creation.
SMALL BUSINESS-
FOCUSED GROWTH:
In FY24, Commonwealth Corporation continued to increase
access for small and diverse businesses to pursue Workforce
Training Fund programs. Since the global COVID-19 pandemic,
the Workforce Training Fund has pivoted to directly address the
needs of smaller businesses given they were disproportionately
impacted by the pandemic.
Specifically, 96 percent of FY24 grants were awarded to
businesses with 100 or fewer employees in Massachusetts. The
largest number of grants awarded in FY24 went to businesses
with 10 or fewer employees in Massachusetts which received an
increase of 6 percent in awarded grants, the segment of small
businesses with the most growth in FY24.

Commonwealth Corporation has also made improvements to
the Workforce Training Fund including an enhanced, efficient,
and streamlined application process and increased investment
in technology to improve customer support and the user
experience. These improvements continue to provide greater
access to businesses, especially a value proposition for small
businesses to leverage the Express Program.

2024 HIGHLIGHTS
DIVERSE BUSINESS ENGAGEMENT:
Commonwealth Corporation has also enhanced its outreach and marketing of
the Workforce Training Program, including a strategic focus on minority-owned
and women-owned enterprises as well as businesses located in gateway cities.
In FY24, Commonwealth Corporation approved 707 grants to 472 diverse
businesses through Workforce Training Fund Programs. In total, this includes
$7.16 million to train more than 5,000 employees of diverse businesses working
in 173 different cities across Massachusetts. Diverse business are those
employers who are certified by the Massachusetts Supplier Diversity Office as
meeting one or more of several standards diverse business certification such as
minority-owned enterprises, women-owned
enterprises, LGBT business enterprises, or disability-owned enterprises.
Additionally, included as diverse businesses are employers certified by other
recognized authorities such as New England Supplier Diversity Council,
Women’s Business Enterprise National Council, as well as those diverse
businesses without certification. Total funding to diverse businesses was led by
Manufacturing firms ($1.8 million), followed by firms providing Professional,
Scientific, and Technical Services ($1.3 million).
INVESTMENT IN GATEWAY CITIES:
In FY24, Commonwealth Corporation approved 139 applications from 92
employers located in Gateway Cities through Workforce Training Fund Programs.
In total, this represented $1.5 million to train more than 1,100 workers in Gateway
Cities.
Total funding in Gateway Cities was led by Manufacturing firms ($515,275),
followed by firms providing Educational Services ($177,515).
WORKPLACE ESOL
Commonwealth Corporation has established Workplace ESOL (English for
Speakers of Other Languages) training as a priority of the Workforce Training
Fund Program. The most transformative impact of any training funded by
Workforce Training Fund Program grants takes place when workers with low
English-language proficiency access training to improve their ability to read,
write, and communicate in English. In FY24, program investment in workplace
ESOL training exceeded previous records with a total of 33 grants awarded
through both Workforce Training Fund programs for an investment of $2,096,780
to train 1,053 workers in ESOL at 39 employers. Among grants awarded includes
six Bridge Grants through the General Program totaling $317,100 to train 136
workers from 7 employers. In FY24, Commonwealth Corporation launched Bridge
Grants as part of the General Program as a funding resource available to
employers who have previously received funding for workplace ESOL and wish to
continue to provide workplace ESOL training during the 1 year waiting period
between standard General Program Training Grants.

2024
2024 HIGHLIGHTS
WORKPLACE DEI TRAINING
Commonwealth Corporation promotes workplace Diversity,
Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) training within the business
community. Through the Workforce Training Fund programs, 98
applications were approved in FY24 for training related to DEI for
a total of $539,992 to train 1,634 workers from 73 businesses.
Examples of training related to DEI include Working With
Families From Diverse Backgrounds, Transformational DEI
Certificate Program, and Addressing Implicit Bias.
TRAINING RELATED
TO CLIMATE-CHANGE:
Commonwealth Corporation promotes training related to the
impact of climate-change to the business community. Through
the Workforce Training Fund programs, 91 applications were
approved in FY24 for training related to climate-change for a
total of $161,353 to train 413 workers from 45 businesses.
Examples of climate-related training include Certified Passive
House Consultant (CPHC) Training, High-Performance Building
For Carpenters, and Intro to Designing a Net Zero Building.
POST-COVID PLANNING TO
SUPPORT BUSINESS NEEDS:
From 2020 through 2022, the COVID-19 pandemic dramatically
impacted employers’ ability to conduct incumbent worker
training. On-going, grant-funded training projects were scaled
back or canceled and applications to initiate new projects
decreased significantly.
Beginning in 2022, employee skills training once again became
a top priority for Massachusetts employers. By 2023, the
Workforce Training Fund Programs experienced unprecedented
demand for employee training resources as Massachusetts
businesses began to return to normal operations. Throughout
the pandemic recovery, especially in 2022 and 2023, the
Workforce Training Fund Program exceeded previous levels of
grant-making to meet this renewed demand and increased
availability of funds due to the surplus accumulated in 2020
and 2021.
10

2024 HIGHLIGHTS
POST-COVID PLANNING TO SUPPORT
BUSINESS NEEDS: CONTINUED
Demand and funding awards peaked in FY23 when more than $39 million in grant
applications were approved despite only $26.6M in new revenue collection; in FY23,
$39.1 million was available for new grants from the Workforce Training Fund Program.
In response to increased funding and demand, Commonwealth Corporation
experienced greater engagement with small businesses who were disproportionally
impacted by pandemic-related challenges, reaching thousands of new small
businesses who had not previously used Workforce Training Fund programs.
However, as the surplus diminished, Commonwealth Corporation in consultation with
Workforce Training Fund Program Advisory Board, adopted policy changes seeking to
grow business engagement and worker participation while managing more limited
grant resources in FY24 and beyond. The following changes took effect July 10, 2023:
Reinstated a 1 year waiting period between General Program grants.
Reduced the maximum General Program grant from $250,000 to $200,000.
Reduced the Express Program annual limit from $30,000 to $20,000.
Focused participation in the Express Program to businesses with 100 or fewer
Massachusetts employees.
Allow participation among active employers in only one Workforce Training
Fund program at a time.
Considering resource limitations, changes were driven by a need to maintain a Just-
in-Time, year-round rolling application process that prioritizes small businesses.
Policy changes were also intended to maximize employer and workforce engagement
while also aligning with opportunities to market in priority areas such as Workplace
ESOL. Nevertheless, despite $1.9 million in reduced funding and policy adjustments,
Commonwealth Corporation awarded Workforce Training Fund grants to 14 more
businesses for a total of $37.2 million in FY24 compared to FY23.

GAINING COMPETITIVE EDGE
THROUGH WORKPLACE ESOL
Jordan's Furniture, a prominent furniture retailer in New England with a major
distribution center in East Taunton, has made a strategic investment in its workforce
through Workforce Training Fund Grant Program funding. This grant has allowed
Jordan’s to partner with Bristol Community College to provide ESOL (English for
Speakers of Other Languages) classes on site. By enhancing communication skills
among their non-native English-speaking employees, the company has not only
improved their quality of life but also strengthened their overall operational efficiency
and employee retention.
Jennifer Ruggiero, Senior Manager of Human Resources at Jordan’s Furniture, describes
the program’s impact: “The ESOL classes have greatly improved our ability to
communicate with our employees. By paying them for the time they spend in class,
we’ve created a strong incentive for them to join and stay with us. This has been crucial
for retaining talent.”
The ESOL training focuses on essential skills like reading, writing, and speaking English,
and has already shown tangible results. Jennifer says they have seen how employees
who began in entry-level positions have advanced within the company, reflecting the
program's effectiveness in professional development.
13

“This program, funded by Commonwealth Corporation, provides real-life training that
significantly impacts employees' personal and professional lives,” Jennifer says.
Carlos Fernandes, who moved from Cape Verde 11 years ago and has been with Jordan’s
for 7 years, shares his experience: “This is the best job I’ve had in this country. I was
juggling two jobs before. The [ESOL] classes have been fantastic—I’m improving every day.
I can now communicate more effectively, even at the bank and in my community. I hope
more people get this chance to learn.” Carlos’s progress has led to his promotion to Team
Leader.
Wagner Montero, who has been at Jordan’s for 5 years and also hails from Cape Verde,
reflects on his journey: “The ESOL program has been invaluable. It has enhanced my
English skills and provided me with opportunities for growth. I had some basic English
before, but the classes were like the cherry on top. Being promoted for the first time in my
life means a lot. I feel like the company recognizes my value and I want to go for more and
more and grow.”
Brian Faucher, Receiving Manager, notes the program's broader benefits. “Many of our
employees are from Cape Verde and work diligently every day,” he says. “This program has
allowed them to secure better positions and improve their language skills. It has been a
tremendous asset as we learn more about culture and enhance overall communication. I
take pride in their progress and promotions, which would not have been possible without
the ESOL classes.”
Jennifer Ruggiero proudly highlights the overall success. “We are incredibly proud of our
employees’ dedication and progress,” she says. “The ESOL program has been one of the
most rewarding aspects of my career in HR. Recently, we celebrated the graduation of
staff who completed the classes, and their achievements have been truly inspiring.”
Jordan’s Furniture wrapped up a grant in January 2024 and is set to begin a General
Bridge ESOL grant in September 2024.

ENHANCING WORKFORCE
EFFICIENCY THROUGH
LEAN TRAINING
M.L. Schmitt Inc., an established electrical contractor in Western Massachusetts for a
century, has consistently prioritized quality, innovation, and a strong commitment to its
workforce. In FY24, the company took a significant step forward by securing a General
Program training grant from the Workforce Training Fund Program, enabling them to
partner with ICG Industrialized Construction to provide Lean Fundamentals Training to
their employees.
“We are trying to stay relevant and efficient in everything we do,” says Peter Coppez,
Owner and President of M.L. Schmitt “This grant has enabled us to retrain our workforce,
making us more competitive in a fast-paced industry.”
The lean training, led by ICG Industrialized Construction, focused on improving project
management, streamlining material movement, and enhancing safety protocols.
Employees participated in full-day sessions where they learned about the Five Principles
of Lean and strategies to increase productivity on construction sites.
“This training has helped us be a more effective team,” Peter explains. “We’re really trying
to bring construction into the modern world, and that is what we are hoping to
accomplish. The market is strong, and there’s a lot of work, but efficiency is key.”
20

One of the key sites where these new skills were put to the test is the historic Goodell Hall
at UMass Amherst. M.L. Schmitt is working on renovating this building by updating its
fire alarm system, power, and special systems while preserving its historical integrity.
“This was really tough to do Lean on because it’s a moving target,” says Mark Trembly,
Foreman at M.L. Schmitt “But we were able to identify issues, get ahead, and it honestly
benefited our trade. With this training, we’ve been able to implement changes right off
the bat—like thinking about where we place equipment for access, having materials
closer to the door, and putting everything on wheels. Every little thing is handy.”
Mark adds that the training has also fostered better communication and efficiency
throughout the company. “We found ways to better plan and communicate,” he notes.
“Having support from the office to the site has been a big help. This training has helped
us see where we’re losing time and money and find better ways to communicate. It also
supports us in understanding how to better help our workers physically.”
Craig Amelisko, Project Manager at M.L. Schmitt, further highlights the broader impact of
the training: “This opens your eyes to areas where you can be more efficient. This funding
has done good for our workers, our offices, our job sites—we want to keep going with it,
and we are very happy.”
Since the start of the grant in FY24, M.L. Schmitt has increased its full-time workforce
from 52 to 123 employees, reflecting a substantial impact on the local economy. “Over the
course of this year, we’ve increased our number of employees significantly,” Peter notes.
“We’re able to be aggressive with our pricing, and we’re winning more work because of
our well-trained, efficient staff. The Workforce Training Fund General Grant program has
been instrumental in helping us build a workforce that’s skilled and capable of driving
our company forward.” 21

Wirefab, Inc., a small, employee-owned

strides in workforce development through the
implementation of on-site ESOL training.
With the support of a Workforce Training Fund Express grant, Wirefab partnered with
Aspire Training and Development LLC to provide essential English language training to
eight employees, aiming to improve communication between team members and
supervisors.
“This training through Aspire has been so convenient to have here on-site,” said Peter
Armanetti, President of Wirefab. “In our manufacturing environment, where we work with
machinery and heavy equipment, effective communication is critical to operating
efficiently and safely. The training has been very favorable, increasing morale, confidence,
and teamwork across our team.”
Among those benefiting from the program is Candy Vizcaino Gaspar, a machine operator
who has been with Wirefab for four years. As a mother and head of her household, Candy
has faced significant challenges in learning English since arriving in Massachusetts from
the Dominican Republic 11 years ago. The convenience of on-site training has been a game-
changer for her.
“Working for so long and being a parent, it’s difficult to find time for learning,” Candy
shared. “Through this training, I’ve learned a lot, and I feel like I can communicate better
and express myself more. When I started working here, I struggled to understand, but now,
with a more diverse team and this training, it has helped.”
Candy also highlighted the importance of programs like these, noting that many people in
the state don’t have the resources to pay for ESOL training. “Programs like this are crucial,”
she said, expressing her hope for continued opportunities for growth within Wirefab.
Wirefab’s commitment to its employees through language training not only enhances
individual skills but also strengthens the overall team dynamic, ensuring a safer and
more efficient workplace.

GRANTS COMPLETED IN FY24
BY WORKFORCE REGION CONTINUED
The original amount awarded to the 100 grantees totaled $12.01 million. The final amount
expended by the end of these grants was $10.11 million (84 percent of the amount
awarded). Only 34 grantees expended their full contract amount. 66 grantees did not
exhaust awarded funds.
In total, the 100 grantees planned to train 7,864 employees; the actual number of trainees
reported was 8,336 (106 percent of planned). 51 grantees trained more workers than
planned, 14 grantees trained as many workers as planned, and 35 grantees trained fewer
workers than planned.
GENERAL PROGRAM TRAINING GRANTS
WITHDRAWN IN FISCAL YEAR 2024
During FY24, 32 businesses that had been awarded General Program training grants in
FY24 or earlier elected to withdraw from the program prior to completing training. These
grantees were awarded a total of $4,209,762 in General Program grant funds but used
only $1,778,772 (42 percent) prior to withdrawing due to unanticipated circumstances,
that resulted in cancelation of training. Circumstances that may result in a withdrawal
may include an acquisition by another business, unexpectedly high demand for worker
time away from training due to operational capacity issues, or unexpected changes in
training needs due to emerging business needs. Unused funds are reprogrammed for
future Workforce Training Fund Program grants.
