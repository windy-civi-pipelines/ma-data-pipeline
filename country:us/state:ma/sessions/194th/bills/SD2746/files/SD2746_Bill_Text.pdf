LETTER FROM THE COMMISSION CO-CHAIRS
On behalf of the Catastrophic Illness in Children Relief Fund (CICRF) Commission, we
are pleased to provide this annual report for Fiscal Year 2023 pursuant to M.G.L. Chapter
111K, Section 11.
CICRF provided nearly $2.35 million in FY2023 in financial assistance directly to
families or to vendors on behalf of families for medical related expenses for children and
youth with special health needs.
During FY2023, CICRF worked closely with a developer to customize and test a new
Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system to replace the outdated Access
database. CICRF also developed a new electronic application to reduce paper-based files
and make it more convenient for families to apply to the Fund. Families provided input
on the new online application and were compensated for their time and feedback. The
CRM system and new online application will be implemented in FY2024 along with a
reengineered workflow to streamline the application review process, reduce the wait time
for families to receive confirmation of their eligibility for financial assistance, and
enhance monitoring controls and performance standards.
The Commission welcomes your input as we seek to improve our ability to serve children
and families.
Sincerely,
John S. Maypole, MD ErinKate Greeley

Catastrophic Illness in Children Relief Fund Annual Report: Fiscal Year 2023
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Purpose of the Fund
The Catastrophic Illness in Children Relief Fund (CICRF) was established by legislation
for FY2001 to provide assistance to families for catastrophic medical and related
expenses that are not covered by insurance, public benefits, or other financial sources.
Massachusetts families with children 21 years of age and younger whose medical and
related expenses for one child exceed 10% of the first $100,000 plus 15% thereafter of
the family’s annual income, are eligible to apply for assistance from the CICRF. The
CICRF continues to support some of the most vulnerable children in Massachusetts,
improving financial stability for eligible families. Between FY2001 and FY2023, the
CICRF provided over $39.2 million in reimbursements to the families of 2,724 children.
Fiscal Year 2023 Data Highlights
• During FY2023, 142 families received nearly $2.35 million in reimbursements. The
median reimbursement was $7,613 per family.
• The children assisted by the CICRF have a variety of diagnoses, typically coming
from families with lower incomes, and have health insurance coverage. Most notably,
during FY2023, approximately 66% of the families who received assistance had
annual incomes of less than 200% of the federal poverty level and approximately
37% of the children who were helped during this period were under age five at the
time the application was submitted.
• The CICRF supports a wide variety of non-covered services, including medical
equipment, medical services, hospital and physician services, medications, family
support, and home and vehicle modifications that enable children to live more
comfortably at home and in their communities.
• CICRF also provides referrals and technical assistance related to accessing other financial
resources, such as information on low interest loans for accessible vehicles through
Easter Seals.
• Five out of six CICRF program coordinators speak languages other than English (Spanish
and Haitian-Creole), improving program capacity to explain documentation needs and
complex Fund policies directly to families.
• The CICRF ended FY2023 with a balance of $6,251,374.11.

Catastrophic Illness in Children Relief Fund Annual Report: Fiscal Year 2023
I. INTRODUCTION
The Catastrophic Illness in Children Relief Fund (CICRF) was established by state legislation in
July 2000 to help families bear the excessive financial burdens associated with the care of
children with significant medical and related expenses. It provides last resort financial assistance
for families in Massachusetts who are struggling to pay for medical or related expenses not
covered by a private insurer, federal or state health care assistance, or any other financial source.
The CICRF was established within the Department of Public Health (DPH), in accordance with
M.G.L. Chapter 29, Section 2ZZ, and is administered by the CICRF Commission, which was
established and is governed by M.G.L. Chapter 111K. A catastrophic illness is defined as “any
illness or condition treated at a pediatric specialty hospital, including ambulatory care and
services provided by or ordered through such a hospital, the medical and related expenses of
which are not covered by any other state or federal program…or any insurance contract and
which exceed 10 percent of the first $100,000 of annual income of a family and 15 percent of
any family income in excess of $100,000.” Originally created for families of children ages 18
and under, in FY2007 Chapter 111K was amended to expand age eligibility for the Fund through
age 21.
The Fund is overseen by a Commission consisting of 11 members (four state agency ex-officio
members and seven public members) and is staffed by DPH. The Fund is financed by quarterly
transfers from the Commonwealth Care Trust if sufficient funds are available.
The cost of caring for a chronically ill child can be overwhelming, even to a family with health
insurance. High insurance premiums, deductibles, co-insurance and co-payments, combined with
medical and related expenses incurred because of coverage limitations and exclusions, can result
in a serious drain of a family’s financial resources. The bills incurred can send the family into
extreme debt and cause severe emotional stress. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation,
medical debt – and a host of related problems – can result when people cannot afford to pay their
medical bills. While the chances of falling into medical debt are greater for people who are
uninsured, most people who have trouble paying medical bills have health insurance. Medical
debt can arise when people must pay out-of-pocket for care not covered by health insurance or to
which cost-sharing (such as deductibles and co-insurance) applies. Medical debt also might
result from health insurance premiums that individuals find difficult to afford. The consequences
of medical debt can be severe. People with unaffordable medical bills report higher rates of other
problems – including difficulty affording housing and other necessities, credit card debt,
bankruptcy, and barriers accessing health care.1 In the 2022 National Survey of Children’s
Health (NSCH), 10.9% of families with children with special health needs in Massachusetts
reported having problems paying for their child’s medical or health care bills within the past 12
months.2

The impact of a child’s illness can have severe ripple effects. The time and energy necessary to
care for a sick child often places further debilitating strain on a family and often results in loss of
employment for one or both parents. In the NSCH, 19.6% of Massachusetts families with
children with special health needs reported having to cut back or stop working due to their
child’s condition.2 In such situations, the family loses not only income, but frequently also loses
continuity of health benefits, since access to health insurance is often through one’s employer.
The family must then identify other insurance coverage, which may involve accessing a different
provider network for their child and paying higher health insurance premiums, further adding to
family stress. There are also many expenses resulting from a child’s medical condition that are
not covered by insurance. In the NSCH, 21.2% of Massachusetts families of children with
special health needs reported having to pay between $1,000 and $5,000 in out-of-pocket medical,
health, dental and vision care during the past 12 months, and only 58.8% reported having
continuous and adequate private and/or public insurance to pay for the services they need.2 The
CICRF thus provides valuable, stabilizing financial and emotional relief for families facing
incredible life challenges.
II. CATASTROPHIC ILLNESS IN CHILDREN RELIEF FUND
PROGRAM
Eligibility
For a family to be eligible for assistance, they must have a child who:
• Is 21 years of age or younger
• Is a Massachusetts resident
• Is under the care of a licensed health care provider who has staff privileges at a hospital
which is licensed or accredited to provide pediatric or neonatal care
• Has catastrophic medical or related expenses (defined as annual out-of-pocket expenses
totaling more than 10% of the first $100,000 of the family’s income plus 15% of any income
more than $100,000, after all other avenues of reimbursement have been exhausted)
Eligible Services
Consistent with the Community First Olmstead Plan and the Administration’s support of
community-based rather than institutional care, the CICRF supports children to remain at home
in their communities to the maximum extent feasible. It therefore considers reimbursement to
families for a broad range of medical and related services and expenses that may not be
reimbursable under traditional health insurance policies, or for which the family does not have
coverage, including but not limited to:
• Medically related home and vehicle modifications
• Travel and incidental expenses associated with a child’s admissions and outpatient care
• Insurance co-payments, coinsurance and deductibles
• Mobility equipment and other medical supplies
• Medications
2

Catastrophic Illness in Children Relief Fund Annual Report: Fiscal Year 2023
• CommonHealth and MassHealth premiums
• Funeral expenses
Following a special review, experimental treatment or medications, assistive technology,
alternative or complementary treatment, home health care and other medically related services
may be considered for reimbursement.
Generally, families who apply to the Fund seek assistance with multiple expenses. As a payor of
last resort, the CICRF ensures that private and public insurance coverage is sought first. Some
reimbursements reflect partial payments for medical and related services, such as co-payments
and deductibles for physician visits, hospitalizations, medications, and rehabilitation therapies.
Commission Responsibilities
The CICRF Commission consists of 11 members (see current Commission Member list),
including designees of the Secretary of Health and Human Services, the Commissioner of Public
Health, the Commissioner of Insurance, the State Treasurer and seven public members (including
a representative of the AFL-CIO and three providers of health care services to children in
Massachusetts, and a parent of a child with special health needs). The Commission is responsible
for establishing the policies and procedures necessary for administration of the CICRF, including
application to the Fund, application review, determination of eligibility for services, and
reimbursement. The Commission’s goal is to act in the best interest of the child while ensuring
the Fund remains the payor of last resort.
The Department of Public Health is responsible for the general management and administration
of the program, including maintaining confidential records for each child, determining eligibility
and the amount of reimbursement, and preparing application or case materials for review by the
entire Commission. DPH staff devotes significant resources to case management and referral
activities. If, upon review of an application, the applicant is found to be potentially eligible for
funding through other sources or programs, DPH staff assists the applicant in applying for
alternate benefits and resources.
III. DATA
Fund Accomplishments and Highlights
From its inception through FY2023, the CICRF provided funds to 2,724 children with a wide
array of medical conditions and diagnoses. Their families come from across the state, from all
income levels, and are largely insured either through private coverage and/or MassHealth.
Families have been reimbursed for a variety of eligible expenses including hospital and
physician services, medication, medical equipment and supplies, travel and lodging, funeral
expenses, special therapies, accessible vehicle purchases, home and vehicle modifications, and
expenses incurred while caring for a sick child in the hospital.

Catastrophic Illness in Children Relief Fund Annual Report: Fiscal Year 2023
CICRF has proven to be an invaluable resource for families struggling with the need to preserve
family life in the face of substantial financial obligations. The Fund has assisted families from a
variety of income levels with a wide range of awards in proportion to their need. Payments to an
individual family in FY2023 ranged from a low of $698 to a high of $54,190.3 The median
amount was $7,613; the mean was $16,547 (later sections in this report provide more
information on services supported and reimbursements). Some families have been eligible to
receive CICRF assistance over multiple fiscal years.
Applications Received in Fiscal Year 2023
From FY2001 through FY2023, 6,188 applications were submitted to the CICRF. Table 1 shows
the number of applications submitted each year for the last five years. The number of first-time
applicants was 62% of applications received in FY2023, which indicates that new families are
aware of the help the Fund can provide. The COVID-19 pandemic lockdown starting in March
2020 with continued system impact through 2023 resulted in fewer new children being referred
to CICRF.

CICRF staff has determined the eligibility status for 96% of the 251 applications submitted to the
Fund in FY2023: 50% (126) were eligible and resulted in payments to the family; another 21%
(52) were determined ineligible because they did not meet the financial, age or residency criteria;
and 25% (62) of applications initiated were not completed by the family or other resources were
found. The remaining 4% (11) of the 251 applications received in FY2023 are in the process of
eligibility review and determination by CICRF staff.
3 For some families, most of the reimbursements were received in a prior fiscal year. For others, payment in FY2023
could include expenses incurred over several years.

Families Receiving Financial Assistance in Fiscal Year 20234
Unless otherwise indicated, the data below are based on the 142 families who received financial
assistance from the Fund (“families served”) in FY2023.
Applications may be received in one fiscal year and associated reimbursements may not occur
until the following fiscal year due to the timing of receipt of applications and the documentation
required for eligibility determination. Also, one application may result in multiple payments over
time, sometimes in multiple fiscal years.
Reimbursements to Families
Total reimbursements to families in FY2023, and in all years since the creation of the Fund, are
shown in Tables 2 and 3. From July 1, 2022 to June 30, 2023, the Fund reimbursed nearly $2.35
million to 142 families.

5 As explained in the FY2010 Annual Report, in mid-FY2010, faced with decreased revenues and increased
applications, the Commission made significant changes to reimbursement policy, with the intended effect of reducing
per-family reimbursements. The Commission’s aim was to assist as many families as possible while ensuring funds
remained to assist families in FY2011 and beyond. This is partly responsible for the decrease in total reimbursements
after FY2010.

Catastrophic Illness in Children Relief Fund Annual Report: Fiscal Year 2023
Diagnoses
The CICRF provides support for children with a wide variety of serious medical conditions. The
broad categories of diagnoses of CICRF applicants include anoxic brain injuries and cerebral
palsy, neuromuscular conditions (such as muscular dystrophy), genetic and metabolic conditions,
cancers, primary neurologic disorders, developmental disorders, psychiatric disorders,
prematurity and associated sequelae, and traumatic injuries. Most of these diagnoses have
associated conditions that dramatically impact the lives of the children including seizure
disorders, vision and hearing loss, incontinence, respiratory conditions, and inability to eat safely
by mouth. Often children with these challenges are entirely dependent on others for aspects of
daily living, such as getting dressed, toileting, or rolling over in bed. Many use wheelchairs or
have substantial mobility impairments. The scope of impact of these medical conditions on the
quality of life of the children and families who apply for support from CICRF cannot be
overstated.
The chart below summarizes the types of conditions of the children assisted by the CICRF in
FY2023. The six categories of conditions comprising 80% of the children supported by the Fund
were: genetic and metabolic disorders, anoxic brain injuries and cerebral palsy, prematurity and
associated conditions, congenital anomalies, primary neurologic disorders and cancer. Numerous
children assisted by the Fund had multiple diagnoses that would fit into more than one diagnostic
category. Many of the conditions are chronic and require significant, ongoing medical care
and/or pharmaceutical regimens. Other conditions severely impact mobility, resulting in families
needing to make their living space and modes of transportation accessible to the child to allow
the child to live and participate fully in the community.
7

Catastrophic Illness in Children Relief Fund Annual Report: Fiscal Year 2023
Funded Services
The Fund reimburses families for a diverse set of medically related services and expenses.
Reimbursable expenses are defined in the Fund’s policies set by the Commission. The
Commission – with Fund staff support – reviews policies regularly to respond to feedback from
families and referral sources as well as changes in medical practice, technology, insurance
coverage and available monies in the Fund. After analyzing the financial impact of any policy
change on the Fund, the Commission must vote to approve the policy change. In general, if a
family meets the eligibility criteria for the Fund, then CICRF reimburses the family according to
the Fund’s sliding fee scale.6
Examples of eligible expenses include medical supplies and equipment, such as stair lifts;
physical, occupational, and speech therapy; hospital and physician services; per diem travel and
related expenses during inpatient hospitalizations; and some alternative or complementary
treatments (following an in-depth review by the Commission). Most families receive
reimbursement from the Fund for more than one type of expense. Some expenditures reflect
partial payment for medical and related services, such as co-payments and deductibles.
Financial support from the Fund allows many families to avoid residential or institutional care by
enabling them to make structural or other modifications that are necessary to care for their child
at home (such as an accessible bathroom or a wheelchair accessible home entrance/exit). The
Fund also assists families who need an accessible vehicle to transport their child to medical visits
and elsewhere within the community.7 The largest percent of payments to families in FY2023
was for expenses related to vehicle purchases and/or modifications, accounting for over half
(68.2%) of all reimbursements to families.
The next highest (17.2%) was for Family Support, a per diem stipend toward expenses parents
incur while being with and caring for a sick child in the hospital or expenses incurred by driving
to outpatient appointments, such as in-state transportation costs, parking, meals, etc. Many
children have multiple and/or lengthy hospitalizations – sometimes for months at a time – and
the presence of parents at the hospital and parental involvement in the child’s care team are
critical components to the child’s care, making this support essential.
6 There are additional limitations to the amount of reimbursement for certain types of expenses, including home and
vehicle modifications, vehicle purchases, funeral expenses, whole house generators and short-term placements.
7Vehicle purchases and modifications are reimbursed according to a sliding scale based on income; families have a
lifetime limit on the total amount that the Fund will reimburse for these types of expenditures which is also
determined by a sliding scale.

Family travel & lodging (primarily related to out-of-state treatment) $ 4,773.00 0.2%
Total Expenditures $ 2,349,717.04 100.0%
As children grow, their needs change, and families may reapply to the Fund for additional
assistance. For example, as children get older, they outgrow certain equipment, such as leg
braces and wheelchairs, which require replacement or modification to continue to meet the
child’s needs. Parents who may have been able to lift their child into a vehicle when the child
was smaller may now require a wheelchair lift. Also, equipment simply wears out over time.
For example, an eight-year-old wheelchair accessible van may no longer be roadworthy and
may need to be replaced.

Catastrophic Illness in Children Relief Fund Annual Report: Fiscal Year 2023
Income Level
The CICRF provides financial assistance to families at all income levels, but 77% of the families
helped by the CICRF in FY2023 had incomes under 300% of the federal poverty level (FPL);
this is a measure of family income that is calculated each year by the U.S. Department of Health
and Human Services (USDHHS). It is used to determine financial eligibility for a variety of
programs, for example, MassHealth eligibility for children extends to 300% of FPL. These
guidelines are a simplified version of the “poverty thresholds” developed by the U.S. Census
Bureau.8 In Calendar Year 2023, 300% of FPL was $90,000 for a family of four.
Often a family with a catastrophically ill child had large, immediate expenses which, in
conjunction with their low-income level, made traditional loans unavailable or unaffordable. For
some families, the Fund represented a major and sometimes sole source of hope and support.

Catastrophic Illness in Children Relief Fund Annual Report: Fiscal Year 2023
Insurance Status
All children assisted by the CICRF in FY2023 had health insurance.9 Nevertheless, these
families still had catastrophic medical or related expenses. Often this is because the insurance did
not cover certain services or expenses, such as home and vehicle modifications. Families with
private insurance can have significant co-payments, co-insurance, or deductibles associated with
care. Medically complex children and youth seeing multiple ancillary providers (e.g., physical
therapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy) can reach benefit limits under private insurance
depending upon the individual plan. Other times, families with private health insurance do not
qualify for secondary MassHealth insurance right away. Since Fund staff consider expenses
incurred up to 24 months prior to the date of the application, a family might not have secondary
insurance when an expense was incurred but does have secondary insurance at the time of their
CICRF application, when insurance type is entered into the Fund database. Fund staff make
every effort to ensure insurance is used first and the Fund is the payor of last resort.
The table below shows the insurance coverage of the families reimbursed by CICRF in FY2023.
Most families with private insurance had secondary state Medicaid (MassHealth) coverage.
Almost all families had some form of MassHealth as a primary or secondary insurer.
As noted in the chart, a small percentage of children had MassHealth Limited, which is
emergency medical coverage for non-citizens who meet MassHealth eligibility except for their
immigration status. While most of those children were also covered by the Children’s Medical
Security Plan (CMSP) for basic health coverage, CMSP and MassHealth Limited does not
support all the service, medication and equipment needs of children with chronic or complex
medical conditions.

Geography
The CICRF serves children and families from across all regions of Massachusetts. Fund staff
conducts outreach activities in collaboration with the DPH Division for Children & Youth with
Special Health Needs. Most children served are located outside of the Greater Boston area, and
often must travel to Boston to receive specialized care (a significant family expense when many
visits or hospitalizations are required). The map below shows the number of families served by
region for FY2023 for a total of 142 families.

IV. REVENUE AND EXPENDITURES
CICRF is funded by quarterly transfers made from employers’ contributions to the
Commonwealth Care Trust if funds are available after other obligations have been met.11,12 In
approving the annual Fund budget each year, the Commission has agreed that there should
always be at least one year’s reserve on hand since the total amount of transfers into the Trust
each year is unknown and not guaranteed.
In FY2023, four transfers were made into the CICRF Trust. Total deposits (transfers plus
interest) were almost $3.1 million, while total expenditures for payments to families, staffing and
other expenses were slightly under $3.5 million. FY2023 ended with a healthy balance of $5.8
million.
Table 9 on the next page lists a breakdown of annual revenue and expenditures from the CICRF
Trust.
11 Prior to January 1, 2014: Chapter 111K, Section 9 of the Massachusetts General Laws provides that funding is to
come through an employer’s contribution to the office of employment and training, as $1 annually for each
employee “whose wages determine such employer’s total unemployment health insurance contribution” under
Chapter 151A section 14G of the General Laws.
12 As of January 1, 2014: Chapter 111K, Section 9 of the Massachusetts General Laws provides that funding is to
come through an employer’s medical assistance contribution under section 189 of chapter 149, “$1 annually for each
employee whose wages determine such employer's total employer medical assistance contribution.”

13 During FY2003, FY2004, and from FY2009-FY2013 the Fund did not receive the full number of anticipated
transfers from the Medical Security Trust. In FY2004 and from FY2010-FY2013, no transfers were made; deposits
reflect interest payments only. Transfers resumed in FY2014; five transfers were received in FY2014 because the 4th
quarter FY2013 transfer was made in early FY2014.
14 As explained on the previous page, state appropriated funds were used to supplement CICRF Trust funds in
FY2012-FY2014; only those expenditures from the CICRF Trust are represented here.

V. CONCLUSION
The Catastrophic Illness in Children Relief Fund provides vital support to families of children
with varied and significant health conditions and special health care needs throughout
Massachusetts. The Fund allows children with significant health problems to remain with their
families and as a part of their communities. In addition, the illnesses or injuries of the children
the Fund assists demand a wide range of medical services.
The diverse needs the Fund encounters attest to the value of this unique safety net. Ultimately,
the Fund serves to improve the quality of life for many children and their families.
The Commission is proud of the assistance the Fund has provided to families over the past 23
years.
