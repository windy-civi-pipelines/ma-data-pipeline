NARRATIVE
The Hampden County Sheriffs Office York Street Industries (YSI) program was established in
1986, as a public / private venture. A unique and groundbreaking partnership spearheaded by
Supreme Court Justice Warren Burger, the Private Industry Council, the Chamber of Commerce
and the Hampden County Sheriffs Office (HCSO) was led by then Sheriff Michael J. Ashe, Jr.
Special legislation to allow the pilot conception to proceed was signed by then Governor Michael
S. Dukakis, allowing commercial sales in both the government and business sectors. From there,
private funding was needed, as there was no provision included for public funding. This
comprehensive program had a strategic, two-fold mission. First, the program was designed to
offer inmate workers an educational, realistic work experience and basic life skills. Second, it
was structured to operate as a small business enterprise to financially support staffing and jail
necessities. From humble beginnings, this vocational program has grown to be a national model
and leader within the corrections industry. Since its inception, YSI has been self-sustaining and
has grown to become profitable.
Most notably, this innovative approach has changed lives while securing thousands of jobs and
improving overall quality of life for our transitioning citizens.
On June 30", York Street Industries finished the Fiscal Year 2024 with revenue of
$3,529,796.23. We expended $3,525,892.12 and returned $3,904.11 to the state.
York Street Industries began with manufacturing desk chairs and other office furniture,
marketing them to municipal and public agencies. Today, this speculative undertaking has
progressed into a multi-faceted, revenue-generating business that has created employment and
other economic development opportunities. YSI has earned state and national recognition, as
evidenced by the following examples:
o The Associated Industries of Massachusetts (AIM), a longtime business advocacy group
whose mission is to promote economic opportunities, innovation and entrepreneurship for
the betterment of businesses and citizens of MA recognized York Street Industries during
their 100" Anniversary Celebration. AIM noted that YSI has made a unique impact on
the economy in our region and the well-being of those who live here. The other
organizations honored with the Hampden County Sheriffs Office’s YSI were Yankee
Candle and the MassMutual Center.
YSI was also honored by the White House for extraordinary work to facilitate
employment opportunities for individuals formerly involved in the justice system. The
award highlighted empowerment and helped our country meet the many challenges of the
twenty-first century.
Additionally, YSI was acknowledged as a Massachusetts Gateway Cities Innovation
Award recipient. This distinction is for finding solutions to the Commonwealth’s most
pressing issues or ambitious visions that reflect optimism for their communities.
YORK STREET INDUSTRIES
Goods and Services -
The multitude of goods produced by our industries program requires hands-on knowledge
and the ability to teach offenders the skills necessary to produce quality products ina
timely fashion. Since 2010, close to 3,000 offenders received vocational and educational
training prior to returning to our local communities.
> We manufacture and sell uniforms to the Hampden County Sheriff's Office,
including the Main Institution, Women’s Correctional Center, Stonybrook
Stabilization and Treatment Center (SSTC), Western Massachusetts Recovery
and Wellness Center, the Massachusetts Department of Youth Services
(DYS), and the Plymouth County Correctional Center.
> YSI supplies mattresses, laundry bags, shower curtains, hygiene kits,
commissary bags, and signs to our own institutions, as well as to Plymouth
County.
> YSI systematically replaces aged and worn out furniture throughout our entire
agency.
> YSI has seen significant growth in embroidery and screen printing sales to
many non-profit agencies and schools, as well as to the Hampden County
Sheriff's Office.
> We have provided re-upholstery sales to STCC, Holyoke Community College
(HCC), University of Massachusetts (UMASS), Western New England
University (WNEU), Boston University (BU) and Springfield Public Schools
(SPS) as well as local private sector companies such as Conklin Office
Furniture and Lexington Group.

Section 2:
2. Culinary Arts -
Our Culinary Arts Program is committed to providing high-quality culinary and
hospitality skills training, allowing for participants to earn nationally-recognized
certificates such as ServSafe and OSHA 10. Additionally, our participants get real world
experience working in one of our three restaurants and catering businesses.
o Stonybrook Grille is located within the walls of our Main Institution in
Ludlow and serves both staff and guests, along with making bread and
pastries for several community service agencies and community events
across Hampden County.
o 701 Grille is located within our Western Massachusetts Regional
Women’s Correctional Center (WMRWCC). This program duplicates the
program we have at the main facility in Ludlow.
o Olde Armory Grille is located in Springfield Technology Park at One
Federal Street in Springfield. This is our flagship restaurant and allows
offenders classified to be in the community to serve the general public in a
fast-paced environment in real world conditions. This restaurant allows
our Employment Team to showcase our participants’ talents for local
establishments, enhancing and growing employment opportunities. Along
with our in-custody restaurant staff, we have a Transitional Work Program
that brings back released offenders at minimum wage. These assessed
post-release offenders are given the opportunity to hone their skills to
better prepare them for a transition to full-time employment in the
community. They will continue to receive support and training with our
Employment Team to overcome the hurdles that life may present after
release.
The OAG has grown our catering area and our “Grab & Go” model on campus at
Springfield Technical Community College for students and faculty.
3
Additionally, participants in our Culinary Arts Program are given the opportunity to
attend a college accredited course in conjunction with Holyoke Community College
(HCC). These students will spend eight weeks at our minimum security facility learning
the basics of hospitality management and then travel to HCC for the next eight weeks to
integrate into the college system. Upon completion, graduates may apply to the college or
be job developed into the food service industry.
. Vocational Shops —
Vocational shops include Graphics, Welding, Building Trades, Custodial Maintenance
and our new Arborist program. Each vocational shop gives employment-based training
while producing finished goods for sale which help to defray the cost of the program.
Every vocational sector offers a real world experience to the trainees by meeting deadline
pressures, quality control and production management to meet customer expectations.
e Graphics Arts and Printing Technology
> Our Graphics Program trains workers that have been referred by caseworkers
and introduces them to all aspects of the graphic arts industry. Under
supervision and with guidance, they help meet the demanding production
needs of the Sheriff’s Office, as well as develop and advance their knowledge
and skills in graphic arts and printing technology. Additionally, participants
learn everyday job skills and responsibilities, including efficient production,
quality control, scheduling, trouble-shooting and time management. Training
also focuses on the following areas: shop safety, desktop publishing, direct-
to-plate imaging, variable data files, digital printing, offset printing, booklet
making and finishing techniques.
> The primary focus of graphics training is to give the students a basic
understanding of the fast-paced and very technical graphic arts industry. This
hands-on experience working in the shop helps to generate a level of interest
and work ethic that will benefit them in the job market. In addition to
providing industry training in a realistic working atmosphere, the Graphics
Program generates income for the Hampden County Sheriffs Office.
> Some examples of this shop’s products are: The Correctional Officer’s
Pocket Planners, The Correctional Post Newsletter (Quarterly), Updated
Inmate Handbooks (Annually), Employee Handbooks, all forms, envelopes,
business cards and booklets, as well as many other printing projects.
Graphics handles all the in-house printing including for AISS, PRC, WMRWCC,
WMRWC and SSTC and provides printing services for state and local government
agencies, and non-profit organizations. We produce about 3 million impressions per year
for in-house and outside work, resulting in huge cost savings for our agency. The Graphic
Arts and Printing Technology Department is working with the Standards Department to
continually monitor and eliminate outdated and duplicated forms for additional cost-
cutting measures to the Hampden County Sheriffs Office.
e Welding Program
> In FY24, YSI continues partnering with the Local 63 Sheet Metal Union
and a local community college to offer American Welding Society (AWS)
curriculum training and certification. The instructors are certified trainers
in all welding topics — ARC, TIG, MIG, GMAW and plasma cutting — and
well-connected with the union. After twelve weeks of hands-on and
classroom training, participants can attain their AWS certification by
passing the required tests. This program originated in FY’23.
> Grant funding in the form of a Skills Capital Grant was used to purchase
and install new equipment. The Welding Shop was also outfitted with a
new ventilation system to meet requirements. Additionally, our new
certificate program was further developed in conjunction with our
Education Department, a local community college, and the Local 63 Sheet
Metal Union located in Springfield. This program provides participants
with industry-recognized credentials which are valuable to securing
livable-wage employment upon release.
> The Welding Program provides training and experience in ARC, MIG and
TIG welding, as well as torch and plasma cutting and fabrication.
Additionally, our welding solutions play an important role in supporting
the facility’s infrastructure.
> The Welding Program supports the daily operations of the Hampden
County Sheriff’s Office. Welders are on-call for maintenance or security
improvements on an as-needed basis. Projects in support of the Hampden
County Sheriff's Office include: fabricating 15 mechanical gates for
HCSO horse stalls, construction of new floor-to-ceiling armory for Law
Enforcement Division and proper storage of weaponry, refurbishment and
fabrication on four holding cells at SSTC, to name a few. The program
also continues to support the kitchens at the Main Institution and the
WMRWCC with their repair needs by welding any broken machinery and
utensils (e.g. bread dough maker, large hot water Sterno, kitchen carts,
etc.) allowing them to feed the inmate population.
> Suicide Prevention: The Welding Program has played an essential role in
the HCSO’s suicide prevention project by retrofitting close to 2,500 beds,
adding a layer of safety for our inmate population. In the community, our
Welding Program also helped retrofit seven cell beds at the East
Longmeadow Police Department to make them safer for detainees. Along
with these noted projects, the program continues to fabricate and/or repair
handcuff security boxes for the towers, storage cabinets, fitness
equipment, doors in restrictive housing units, security gates, and even
HCSO vehicles. Cumulatively, these small projects add up to substantial
cost savings to the Sheriffs Office.
> Equally important, the Welding Program also provides its students with
the tools needed for success in the welding trades. We allow our
participants the opportunity to develop and improve upon their job and life
skills, in an effort to prepare them for greater employability and reduced
recidivism.
e Building Trades
> The Building Trades Program employs six to ten inmate workers daily.
This program is a combination learning and production environment
where we advance inmates’ technical skills and knowledge while meeting
the demands of various departments within the Hampden County Sheriff's
Office. This shop functions as a simulated job site where short production
timelines give inmate employees a realistic work experience. Our
Occupational Safety and Health Administration 10 (OSHA 10)
construction safety training course has grown in popularity. Program
enrollment has been shifted from vocational exploration to production-
oriented teaching, allowing us to keep participants interested in pursuing a
career in the building trades and provide them the skills for entry-level
employment.

e Arborist Apprenticeship Program
> The Arborist Apprenticeship Program (AAP) is designed to develop
members of our minimum security population into job-ready Tree Care
Specialist candidates, using a combination of technical knowledge, hand-
on training and industry-specific job readiness preparation.
Together with our Education Department and our partners at STCC,
UMASS, and the City of Springfield, this program offers industry-
recognized certification to enhance the participants’ employment
opportunities upon release.
The classroom consists of eight Tree Care Industry Association (TCIA)
modules, OSHA 10 General Industry, and CPR/First Aid. Again, this
program will provide hands-on training with all applicable equipment,
with an emphasis on safety.
> Notable projects from FY24 include:
o Removing large oak limbs from the field lighting at Ludlow High
School’s new athletic field, allowing students to practice precision
tree while providing a service to the community.
o Removed several dead maple trees at Greenleaf Park in
Springfield.
o Completed a planting project at Glendell Terrace in Forest Park,
where 18 trees and 124 pollinator plants were installed, teaching
apprentices about the importance of urban forestry and ecological
sustainability.
o Removal of diseased Ash trees at the Sheriff's Main Institution.
This allowed apprentices to learn about the effects of tree diseases
and how to manage them safely.
o Assisted in the creation of the Equestrian Area at the Main
Institution, providing apprentices with exposure to large-scale land
clearing operations.
o Removing several dead hazard trees at the Massachusetts State
Police Academy in New Braintree, further developing apprentices’
skills in hazard tree assessment and removal.
Each participant has received a Massachusetts DOT physical card,
which qualifies them to take the Massachusetts Hoisting License tests.
These tests will further enhance the apprentices’ credentials and
provide them with additional opportunities in the field. With these
certifications, participants are equipped not only with practical
experience but also with the necessary credentials to pursue a wide
range of career paths in arboriculture.
In FY24, YSI has been able to sustain its existing businesses (Stonybrook Grille, 701 Grille, and
the Olde Armory Grille) as well as explore other opportunities for growth, particularly in the area
of manufacturing, to recapture transitional work leading to direct hires of the YSI participants at
local businesses.
e Created in 2022, the Honorary Sheriff’s Workforce Initiative and the Hampden
County Honorary Sheriff’s Charitable Foundation continued to operate as 501(c)(3)
entities, supporting at-risk individuals in the Hampden County region of western
Massachusetts. Participants, including the currently incarcerated, the recently
8
incarcerated, homeless and jobless individuals, and individuals of limited financial
means, are provided job training, work experience and work opportunities. In addition,
the two Honorary Sheriff’s programs are designed to conduct such other activities and
programs as may be carried out by a corporation organized under Massachusetts General
Laws, Chapter 180 and described in Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code.
EMPLOYMENT SERVICES
The HCSO has developed an extensive employment model to focus on job readiness, placement
and retention through a gradual, supervised and supportive four phase program. Our employment
services program continues to provide assistance in a number of ways as we transition out of the
pandemic. Outlined below are the ways in which we seek to assist our population as we adapt to
changes in the local job market.
> Phase One: Offenders are enrolled in various educational and vocational
programs. They also create individual Employment Portfolios which include
identification credentials that are necessary for obtaining employment and
housing such as: Social Security card, birth certificate, Massachusetts ID,
résumé, job applications and any awards or certificates they have received.
> Phase Two: This phase covers interview techniques, computer skills, networking
skills, and mock interviews.
> Phase Three: This phase includes assessment, job search and job matching.
Employment staff will work one-on-one with individuals to develop short- and
long-term goals, including educational training to increase employment
opportunities and increased wage potential.
> Phase Four: \n this phase, we emphasize job retention through targeted triage to
support both employer and employee. This is achieved by on-going
communication and job site visits, which build and strengthen established
relationships with employers and employees. Participants also complete a
financial literacy course which covers personal budgeting, banking, credit report
proficiency, and certain Department of Revenue issues that may have developed
during their incarceration.
As noted throughout, the Hampden County Sheriff’s Office offers a wide range of vocational and
skills training in culinary arts, construction, painting, landscaping, welding, custodial
maintenance, graphics and the repair and re-upholstery of office furniture. Certificate programs
are offered in OSHA 10 (general industry and construction), ServSafe, Blueprint Reading, and
our new American Welding Society training and certification program.
These training efforts are crucial to developing skill sets for the offenders to utilize upon release.
The Employment Team networks with local employers to market the vocational and industries
programs, thus increasing employability for those who have participated, and ultimately resulting
in a decrease in recidivism.
As noted earlier, our Employment Team plays a vital role in the operation of the Olde Armory
Grille Restaurant, a café in Springfield Technology Park, which offers offenders real life work
experience and puts on display their talent and skill sets for local businesses looking to hire.
Collaborations have been established community entities such as STCC, HCC, MassHire, the
Springfield Housing Authority, and others offering training and education to our participants. In
FY23, our business model adapted to the changes in the community and its location. With the
departure of many of the businesses at Tech Park, we began to offer more catering and delivery
services and expanded to provide Grab and Go products to STCC students and faculty. This
continues to flourish in FY’24
Touching upon our previous mention of the Charitable Foundation and Workforce Initiative,
these non-profits were formed and designed to help female and male transitioning ex-offenders
in conjunction with habitually unemployed homeless individuals and disenfranchised workers
across Hampden County. This initiative is establishing a track record of employment and the
eventual transition to a permanent position with partnered local businesses, while providing
immediate financial payment to the participant. The program is funded by various grants with a
focus on helping the Hampden County community and Commonwealth at no cost to the
taxpayer. The Initiative operates primarily out of the All Inclusive Support Services (AISS)
building located in the Mason Square section of Springfield and has linked with MassHire for
additional services to be provided to the participants. While based out of AISS, it is evolving and
expanding in scope of work and locations to better reach participants and help them become job-
ready.
e Charitable Foundation mission:
Charitable Foundation: (1) fundraise for and support the Hampden County Honorary
Deputy Sheriffs’ Association in its mission of developing community awareness of the
criminal justice system through participation and sponsorship of any activity which has a
civic or charitable objective and will have a positive impact on the community, (2)
fundraise for and support community-based, charitable initiatives to benefit vulnerable
and at-risk populations, including the homeless, incarcerated, recently incarcerated,
10
jobless, and those of limited financial means, (3) support or promote organizations who
engage in (1) and (2) above, provided that, in each case, such organization is considered
tax exempt within the meaning of Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code, and
(4) to conduct such other activities and programs as may be carried out by a corporation
organized under Massachusetts General Laws, Chapter 180 and described in Section
501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code.
Workforce Initiative mission
(1) support at-risk individuals in Hampden County, Massachusetts, especially those who
are currently incarcerated, the recently incarcerated, homeless individuals, jobless
individuals, and individuals of limited financial means by providing work opportunities,
work experience and job training, and (2) to conduct such other activities and programs
as may be carried out by a corporation organized under Massachusetts General Laws,
Chapter 180 and described in Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code.

Section 3:
SECTION I
Comprehensive quantitative analysis of the impact of the program has on participating
inmates as compared to non-participating inmates, including their disciplinary record
while in custody, their recidivism rates after release and their employment rate after
release.
Impact on Participants:
PROGRAM IMPACT SHEET
York Street Industries 1/30/25
A factory inside the correctional facility with inmates as the workers,
York Street Industries (YSI) produces quality goods, principally for
schools, correctional facilities, and other governmental agencies. Work
includes: screen printing, embroidering, sewing, upholstery,
woodworking, welding, custodial maintenance, graphics /
Evidence Drives Excellence
printing, culinary, office furniture manufacturing / repair. The
HCSO Research Team program provides skills to enable individuals to obtain and maintain
employment upon release, a prerequisite for success in the community
after incarceration.
Climate of Productive Engagement
The Hampden County Sheriff's Office operates on the premise that productive engagement
during incarceration drives positive outcomes such as good institutional adjustment and low
recidivism rates. Sentenced inmates typically participated in 7 programs, while pretrial
detainees typically participated in 5 programs (mass.gov Cross Tracking, 2024). Robust
program engagement occurs at all sites, with program moves far outnumbering aggression-
related disciplinary incidents. In fact, the ratio of routine program moves to aggression-related
disciplinary events in 2024 was 333 to 1. Program moves here include only POWS scans into
formal programs, so additional services such as in-pod programs, health services, visits, and
gym recreation are excluded from the data (Lauzon 2025).
Program Moves-per-week in 2024

Characteristics of the 62 Industries Participants in Calendar Year 2024:
e 39.5 years of age on average (youngest age 21 & eldest age 62).
e 50% scored as medium risk, while 26% scored high, and 24% low risk, per the LSV-SV
screening for criminogenic risk / need.
e 11 were still active at the end of the calendar year.
e 28 had been released, transferred to lower security, or enrolled in other program(s).
e 23 (37.1%) were terminated from the program, with 12 (19.4%) of those terminations being for
aggressive disciplinary infractions (fights or assaults).
e Most participants were pretrial (51.6% JAL & 4.8% US Marshall), while fewer than half were
sentenced (38.7% HOC & 4.8% DOC).
Care and supervision of the participants required great diligence on the part of YSI staff, given the
population’s behavioral characteristics and high turnover.
Low Recidivism Rates
HCSO’s recidivism metrics are overall very good (low) on a state and national scale. Specific to
Reincarceration, these “Report Card” numbers are consistently lower than MA's rates.
Reincarceration rates events within a year of release (the most typical timeframe) appear below for
Hampden and all MA counties. National 1-year reincarceration figures, though less frequently
monitored and reported, have been measured at 19.9% or higher.
Outcomes for YSI participants over a 6-year span show that York Street participants fared as well as
or better than their Hampden County peers and much better than all-county releases. Specifically for
the 60 participants in the Hampden “Release To Community” cohorts, 9 individuals were
reincarcerated within their first year out.
1-year recidivism for YSI participants was 15.0%
This 15.0% rate compares with:

Section 4:
16.2% for all Hamden Releases To Community;

Section 5:
19.6% for All-County Releases to Community.
The low recidivism rate for YSI workers is impressive both because most score medium- or high-risk
on the LSI-SV and because participants must have longer stays than the usual jail population,
suggesting they have serious cases.

EMPLOYMENT RATE INFORMATION
e Since its inception, the HCSO Employment Team has connected individuals to more than
11,632 job placements.
e Averaging approximately 25 new employers annually, the HCSO’s employment database
currently lists well over 500 employers and vendors that we have partnered with over the years.
e During FY23, 289 individuals transitioned to employment using the Employment Team’s
services.
e Significantly, we also added 37 new employers to our database (9 more than our yearly
average).

Information on the participants.
Industries Participants in Fiscal Year 2024:
Potential candidates for the Prison Industries program (PI) must earn the opportunity to enroll. This is
achieved through prior work performance evaluations within facility jobs, program participation and
overall assessment. Once in the Prison Industries program, participants are required to remain incident-
and discipline-free.

o Inside the Facility:
e We utilize our programs to prepare offenders for reintegration into society by
giving them the tools and real life experiences while incarcerated to get and
maintain employment in the community.
e Prison Industries becomes a tool to reward good behavior. Offenders that want
to learn and do the right things can excel, earn money, and gain the knowledge
to become more employable when released.
e Prison Industries is also a tool used to change disruptive behavior. By allowing
individuals the opportunity to become part of a team and learn to work together,
we can slowly break the cycle of negative behavior. After working within the
industries program, these individuals become less of a problem in the living
units and more employable upon release.
o Outside the Facility:
e While taking a comprehensive review of the needs of each individual, we use
treatment, education, vocations, industries and employment to help ex-offenders
get and maintain employment within the community. If an individual has a
setback when released, we offer support through our community-based team at
our All-Inclusive Support Services program (AISS) located within the
community of Springfield. Here, we offer support for a number of reentry needs
such as substance abuse treatment, housing, child support and employment
services. These services are available to any ex-offender no matter how long
they have been released.
e Our Employment Team assists in employment placement and also with job
retention. This support is critical for the offender and the employer. In this
endeavor, we are positioned to anticipate problems and avoid potential
termination of employment.

SECTION II
Information on the customers of the program, including whether they are a public entity, a
private business or a nonprofit.
Community Restitution Crews
Products and services sold by York Street Industries are chosen carefully as not to take business away
from local vendors. Competing vendors for most products that are produced are located outside the
continental USA. Vocational training is the number one concern of our industries program and
customers are selected based on several criteria.

Section 8:
1. Public Agencies — We believe offenders should give back to the community that they came
from and in teaching offenders to take pride in a job well done and establishing a good
work ethic is paramount in maintaining employment on the outside. Our offenders come
from the local community, so when we rebuild a park or baseball field they are giving back
to the community and an offender can take pride in the fact that his or her child maybe
using that park once finished.
Nonprofit — Like public agencies, nonprofit agencies are committed to helping our
community. Helping to produce goods and services for nonprofits allows offenders the
ability to develop skill sets that will enhance their opportunities for long term employment
upon release. Ultimately, this contributes to reducing recidivism rates and strengthening the
community and families they return to.
Private Businesses — Our partnership with private business is essential to the success of our
Prison Industries program. Our model is a two-fold approach of teaching skills and
generating revenue. We teach offenders essential soft skills in our industries program such
as punctuality, time management, quality control, teamwork, communication, listening, and
taking pride in a job well done, to name a few. Together with our business partners we get
to take these skills to the next level and teach offenders specific skills needed to gain
sustainable employment. Some examples of these skills include basic construction,
welding, sewing, packaging, tool usage, quality control, shipping, receiving, inventory
control, machine and tool operation, OSHA 10, ServSafe, production deadlines, and safety.
Upon completion of the industries program, offenders have secured employment in
construction trades, food service, manufacturing, and customer service, to name a few. In
some cases, we are able to place a worker in a job while still in higher security as a result of
their acquired vocational skills. We maintain contact with these individuals to support them
and ensure they meet all requirements to maintain employment in the community.

Reentry planning begins on day one of incarceration at each of our facilities. A holistic approach to
vocational, education, employment readiness training - as well as and short- and long-term goal
defining - begins immediately. These integrated assessments and individual release plans prepare
people for returning to the community by working in partnership with hundreds of community
resources to establish a solid platform to create the highest possible impact for ex-offenders, their
families and our neighborhoods.
Our Community Restitution work crews have saved cities and towns across Hampden County millions
of dollars and performed over a million hours of labor, often completing tasks left unresolved by
others. For example, the city of Springfield alone has seen a savings of over $11 million.
FY24 Community Restitution Projects:
Our Community Restitution crews perform weekly street and park clean-ups within Hampden County.
Partnerships with the cities of Springfield, Holyoke and Chicopee yield community service projects
that are outlined below, saving the cities annually and contributing to our community’s quality of life.
Through our unique partnership with the Springfield Parks Department, the HCSO’s Community
Restitution program provides vocational training and workplace skills in the construction field.
Utilizing a city-owned saw mill and tree dump, we are able to salvage usable wooden boards for reuse.
The project has spawned a “Green” business and vocational training opportunity. The boards are
brought from the community to our Building Trades shop where students learned to measure, cut and
assemble Adirondack chairs. The local demand for these chairs is so great that we have been
increasing our efforts on this production. Gradually, we began building sheds that are constructed in
the same manner as a residential home to teach carpentry skills. This recycling program represents a
unique synergy between our outside work crews and our shops within the Main Institution and helped
earn the designation of Springfield as the fourth greenest city in America.
Additionally, the work of our Community Restitution crews has benefited the following communities
with the following FY24 projects:

PAST PROJECTS:
The seat re-upholstery of auditoriums has financially saved our Commonwealth
hundreds of thousands of dollars. These work incentive projects include schools and
colleges with seating from 400 to as large as 1,500. Boston University, University of
Massachusetts, Springfield Public Schools, Springfield Technical Community College,
Taunton Public Schools, Fall River Public schools among others, are samples of the
expansive scope of work. Each auditorium job can save a school from $100,000 to
$500,000 and this can mean the difference between bringing an auditorium back to life
and up to fire code or students sitting in ripped torn seating with exposed foam and
metal.
a. Another aspect of the re-upholstery program is the complete restoration of furniture.
Thanks to our carpentry, welding and upholstery teams, all pieces are new again. To our
despair, we are so busy that we have had to reject potential business.
b. Prison Industries has assisted numbers cities and towns across the Commonwealth
including Palmer, Ludlow, Holland, Wilbraham, Longmeadow, East Longmeadow, East
Otis, Chicopee, Russell, Westfield, West Springfield, Hampden, Monson, Taunton, Fall
River, Cohasset and towns on Cape Cod.

A vital component of the Correctional Industries system is addressing the varied needs of our inmate
population as the whole person and not just to punish them for their offenses. We also actively look to
eliminate impediments to health care, rehabilitation, education and employment. York Street Industries
plays a vital role by helping to change prior criminal behaviors which help to facilitate a successful
transition back to family and community. Our participants’ recidivism numbers are significantly lower
compared to the national average, validating the efficiencies of our strategic reentry model. There are
struggles, but this holistic philosophy has changed thousands of lives, provided pathways, and built a
firm foundation for our released citizens, their families and ultimately the quality of life within our
communities.
The Hampden County Sheriff's Office is at a place where we believe we can continue to thrive and
create measurable change by increasing our retained revenue cap.

HAMPDEN COUNTY PRISON INDUSTRIES RETAINED REVENUE
Report Submitted to
Executive Office of Public Safety and Security
Joint Committee on the Judiciary
Joint Committee on Public Safety and Homeland Security
House and Senate Committees on Ways and Means
By
Hampden County Sheriff Nicholas Cocchi
NARRATIVE
The Hampden County Sheriffs Office York Street Industries (YSI) program was established in
1986, as a public / private venture. A unique and groundbreaking partnership spearheaded by
Supreme Court Justice Warren Burger, the Private Industry Council, the Chamber of Commerce
and the Hampden County Sheriffs Office (HCSO) was led by then Sheriff Michael J. Ashe, Jr.
Special legislation to allow the pilot conception to proceed was signed by then Governor Michael
S. Dukakis, allowing commercial sales in both the government and business sectors. From there,
private funding was needed, as there was no provision included for public funding. This
comprehensive program had a strategic, two-fold mission. First, the program was designed to
offer inmate workers an educational, realistic work experience and basic life skills. Second, it
was structured to operate as a small business enterprise to financially support staffing and jail
necessities. From humble beginnings, this vocational program has grown to be a national model
and leader within the corrections industry. Since its inception, YSI has been self-sustaining and
has grown to become profitable.
Most notably, this innovative approach has changed lives while securing thousands of jobs and
improving overall quality of life for our transitioning citizens.
On June 30", York Street Industries finished the Fiscal Year 2024 with revenue of
$3,529,796.23. We expended $3,525,892.12 and returned $3,904.11 to the state.
York Street Industries began with manufacturing desk chairs and other office furniture,
marketing them to municipal and public agencies. Today, this speculative undertaking has
progressed into a multi-faceted, revenue-generating business that has created employment and
other economic development opportunities. YSI has earned state and national recognition, as
evidenced by the following examples:
o The Associated Industries of Massachusetts (AIM), a longtime business advocacy group
whose mission is to promote economic opportunities, innovation and entrepreneurship for
the betterment of businesses and citizens of MA recognized York Street Industries during

their 100" Anniversary Celebration. AIM noted that YSI has made a unique impact on
the economy in our region and the well-being of those who live here. The other
organizations honored with the Hampden County Sheriffs Office’s YSI were Yankee
Candle and the MassMutual Center.
YSI was also honored by the White House for extraordinary work to facilitate
employment opportunities for individuals formerly involved in the justice system. The
award highlighted empowerment and helped our country meet the many challenges of the
twenty-first century.
Additionally, YSI was acknowledged as a Massachusetts Gateway Cities Innovation
Award recipient. This distinction is for finding solutions to the Commonwealth’s most
pressing issues or ambitious visions that reflect optimism for their communities.
YORK STREET INDUSTRIES
Goods and Services -
The multitude of goods produced by our industries program requires hands-on knowledge
and the ability to teach offenders the skills necessary to produce quality products ina
timely fashion. Since 2010, close to 3,000 offenders received vocational and educational
training prior to returning to our local communities.
> We manufacture and sell uniforms to the Hampden County Sheriff's Office,
including the Main Institution, Women’s Correctional Center, Stonybrook
Stabilization and Treatment Center (SSTC), Western Massachusetts Recovery
and Wellness Center, the Massachusetts Department of Youth Services
(DYS), and the Plymouth County Correctional Center.
> YSI supplies mattresses, laundry bags, shower curtains, hygiene kits,
commissary bags, and signs to our own institutions, as well as to Plymouth
County.
> YSI systematically replaces aged and worn out furniture throughout our entire
agency.
> YSI has seen significant growth in embroidery and screen printing sales to
many non-profit agencies and schools, as well as to the Hampden County
Sheriff's Office.

> We have provided re-upholstery sales to STCC, Holyoke Community College
(HCC), University of Massachusetts (UMASS), Western New England
University (WNEU), Boston University (BU) and Springfield Public Schools
(SPS) as well as local private sector companies such as Conklin Office
Furniture and Lexington Group.
2. Culinary Arts -
Our Culinary Arts Program is committed to providing high-quality culinary and
hospitality skills training, allowing for participants to earn nationally-recognized
certificates such as ServSafe and OSHA 10. Additionally, our participants get real world
experience working in one of our three restaurants and catering businesses.
o Stonybrook Grille is located within the walls of our Main Institution in
Ludlow and serves both staff and guests, along with making bread and
pastries for several community service agencies and community events
across Hampden County.
o 701 Grille is located within our Western Massachusetts Regional
Women’s Correctional Center (WMRWCC). This program duplicates the
program we have at the main facility in Ludlow.
o Olde Armory Grille is located in Springfield Technology Park at One
Federal Street in Springfield. This is our flagship restaurant and allows
offenders classified to be in the community to serve the general public in a
fast-paced environment in real world conditions. This restaurant allows
our Employment Team to showcase our participants’ talents for local
establishments, enhancing and growing employment opportunities. Along
with our in-custody restaurant staff, we have a Transitional Work Program
that brings back released offenders at minimum wage. These assessed
post-release offenders are given the opportunity to hone their skills to
better prepare them for a transition to full-time employment in the
community. They will continue to receive support and training with our
Employment Team to overcome the hurdles that life may present after
release.
The OAG has grown our catering area and our “Grab & Go” model on campus at
Springfield Technical Community College for students and faculty.
3

Additionally, participants in our Culinary Arts Program are given the opportunity to
attend a college accredited course in conjunction with Holyoke Community College
(HCC). These students will spend eight weeks at our minimum security facility learning
the basics of hospitality management and then travel to HCC for the next eight weeks to
integrate into the college system. Upon completion, graduates may apply to the college or
be job developed into the food service industry.
. Vocational Shops —
Vocational shops include Graphics, Welding, Building Trades, Custodial Maintenance
and our new Arborist program. Each vocational shop gives employment-based training
while producing finished goods for sale which help to defray the cost of the program.
Every vocational sector offers a real world experience to the trainees by meeting deadline
pressures, quality control and production management to meet customer expectations.
e Graphics Arts and Printing Technology
> Our Graphics Program trains workers that have been referred by caseworkers
and introduces them to all aspects of the graphic arts industry. Under
supervision and with guidance, they help meet the demanding production
needs of the Sheriff’s Office, as well as develop and advance their knowledge
and skills in graphic arts and printing technology. Additionally, participants
learn everyday job skills and responsibilities, including efficient production,
quality control, scheduling, trouble-shooting and time management. Training
also focuses on the following areas: shop safety, desktop publishing, direct-
to-plate imaging, variable data files, digital printing, offset printing, booklet
making and finishing techniques.
> The primary focus of graphics training is to give the students a basic
understanding of the fast-paced and very technical graphic arts industry. This
hands-on experience working in the shop helps to generate a level of interest
and work ethic that will benefit them in the job market. In addition to
providing industry training in a realistic working atmosphere, the Graphics
Program generates income for the Hampden County Sheriffs Office.
> Some examples of this shop’s products are: The Correctional Officer’s
Pocket Planners, The Correctional Post Newsletter (Quarterly), Updated
Inmate Handbooks (Annually), Employee Handbooks, all forms, envelopes,
business cards and booklets, as well as many other printing projects.

Graphics handles all the in-house printing including for AISS, PRC, WMRWCC,
WMRWC and SSTC and provides printing services for state and local government
agencies, and non-profit organizations. We produce about 3 million impressions per year
for in-house and outside work, resulting in huge cost savings for our agency. The Graphic
Arts and Printing Technology Department is working with the Standards Department to
continually monitor and eliminate outdated and duplicated forms for additional cost-
cutting measures to the Hampden County Sheriffs Office.
e Welding Program
> In FY24, YSI continues partnering with the Local 63 Sheet Metal Union
and a local community college to offer American Welding Society (AWS)
curriculum training and certification. The instructors are certified trainers
in all welding topics — ARC, TIG, MIG, GMAW and plasma cutting — and
well-connected with the union. After twelve weeks of hands-on and
classroom training, participants can attain their AWS certification by
passing the required tests. This program originated in FY’23.
> Grant funding in the form of a Skills Capital Grant was used to purchase
and install new equipment. The Welding Shop was also outfitted with a
new ventilation system to meet requirements. Additionally, our new
certificate program was further developed in conjunction with our
Education Department, a local community college, and the Local 63 Sheet
Metal Union located in Springfield. This program provides participants
with industry-recognized credentials which are valuable to securing
livable-wage employment upon release.
> The Welding Program provides training and experience in ARC, MIG and
TIG welding, as well as torch and plasma cutting and fabrication.
Additionally, our welding solutions play an important role in supporting
the facility’s infrastructure.
> The Welding Program supports the daily operations of the Hampden
County Sheriff’s Office. Welders are on-call for maintenance or security
improvements on an as-needed basis. Projects in support of the Hampden
County Sheriff's Office include: fabricating 15 mechanical gates for
HCSO horse stalls, construction of new floor-to-ceiling armory for Law
Enforcement Division and proper storage of weaponry, refurbishment and

fabrication on four holding cells at SSTC, to name a few. The program
also continues to support the kitchens at the Main Institution and the
WMRWCC with their repair needs by welding any broken machinery and
utensils (e.g. bread dough maker, large hot water Sterno, kitchen carts,
etc.) allowing them to feed the inmate population.
> Suicide Prevention: The Welding Program has played an essential role in
the HCSO’s suicide prevention project by retrofitting close to 2,500 beds,
adding a layer of safety for our inmate population. In the community, our
Welding Program also helped retrofit seven cell beds at the East
Longmeadow Police Department to make them safer for detainees. Along
with these noted projects, the program continues to fabricate and/or repair
handcuff security boxes for the towers, storage cabinets, fitness
equipment, doors in restrictive housing units, security gates, and even
HCSO vehicles. Cumulatively, these small projects add up to substantial
cost savings to the Sheriffs Office.
> Equally important, the Welding Program also provides its students with
the tools needed for success in the welding trades. We allow our
participants the opportunity to develop and improve upon their job and life
skills, in an effort to prepare them for greater employability and reduced
recidivism.
e Building Trades
> The Building Trades Program employs six to ten inmate workers daily.
This program is a combination learning and production environment
where we advance inmates’ technical skills and knowledge while meeting
the demands of various departments within the Hampden County Sheriff's
Office. This shop functions as a simulated job site where short production
timelines give inmate employees a realistic work experience. Our
Occupational Safety and Health Administration 10 (OSHA 10)
construction safety training course has grown in popularity. Program
enrollment has been shifted from vocational exploration to production-
oriented teaching, allowing us to keep participants interested in pursuing a
career in the building trades and provide them the skills for entry-level
employment.

e Arborist Apprenticeship Program
> The Arborist Apprenticeship Program (AAP) is designed to develop
members of our minimum security population into job-ready Tree Care
Specialist candidates, using a combination of technical knowledge, hand-
on training and industry-specific job readiness preparation.
Together with our Education Department and our partners at STCC,
UMASS, and the City of Springfield, this program offers industry-
recognized certification to enhance the participants’ employment
opportunities upon release.
The classroom consists of eight Tree Care Industry Association (TCIA)
modules, OSHA 10 General Industry, and CPR/First Aid. Again, this
program will provide hands-on training with all applicable equipment,
with an emphasis on safety.

> Notable projects from FY24 include:
o Removing large oak limbs from the field lighting at Ludlow High
School’s new athletic field, allowing students to practice precision
tree while providing a service to the community.
o Removed several dead maple trees at Greenleaf Park in
Springfield.
o Completed a planting project at Glendell Terrace in Forest Park,
where 18 trees and 124 pollinator plants were installed, teaching
apprentices about the importance of urban forestry and ecological
sustainability.
o Removal of diseased Ash trees at the Sheriff's Main Institution.
This allowed apprentices to learn about the effects of tree diseases
and how to manage them safely.
o Assisted in the creation of the Equestrian Area at the Main
Institution, providing apprentices with exposure to large-scale land
clearing operations.
o Removing several dead hazard trees at the Massachusetts State
Police Academy in New Braintree, further developing apprentices’
skills in hazard tree assessment and removal.
Each participant has received a Massachusetts DOT physical card,
which qualifies them to take the Massachusetts Hoisting License tests.
These tests will further enhance the apprentices’ credentials and
provide them with additional opportunities in the field. With these
certifications, participants are equipped not only with practical
experience but also with the necessary credentials to pursue a wide
range of career paths in arboriculture.
In FY24, YSI has been able to sustain its existing businesses (Stonybrook Grille, 701 Grille, and
the Olde Armory Grille) as well as explore other opportunities for growth, particularly in the area
of manufacturing, to recapture transitional work leading to direct hires of the YSI participants at
local businesses.
e Created in 2022, the Honorary Sheriff’s Workforce Initiative and the Hampden
County Honorary Sheriff’s Charitable Foundation continued to operate as 501(c)(3)
entities, supporting at-risk individuals in the Hampden County region of western
Massachusetts. Participants, including the currently incarcerated, the recently
8

incarcerated, homeless and jobless individuals, and individuals of limited financial
means, are provided job training, work experience and work opportunities. In addition,
the two Honorary Sheriff’s programs are designed to conduct such other activities and
programs as may be carried out by a corporation organized under Massachusetts General
Laws, Chapter 180 and described in Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code.
EMPLOYMENT SERVICES
The HCSO has developed an extensive employment model to focus on job readiness, placement
and retention through a gradual, supervised and supportive four phase program. Our employment
services program continues to provide assistance in a number of ways as we transition out of the
pandemic. Outlined below are the ways in which we seek to assist our population as we adapt to
changes in the local job market.
> Phase One: Offenders are enrolled in various educational and vocational
programs. They also create individual Employment Portfolios which include
identification credentials that are necessary for obtaining employment and
housing such as: Social Security card, birth certificate, Massachusetts ID,
résumé, job applications and any awards or certificates they have received.
> Phase Two: This phase covers interview techniques, computer skills, networking
skills, and mock interviews.
> Phase Three: This phase includes assessment, job search and job matching.
Employment staff will work one-on-one with individuals to develop short- and
long-term goals, including educational training to increase employment
opportunities and increased wage potential.
> Phase Four: \n this phase, we emphasize job retention through targeted triage to
support both employer and employee. This is achieved by on-going
communication and job site visits, which build and strengthen established
relationships with employers and employees. Participants also complete a
financial literacy course which covers personal budgeting, banking, credit report
proficiency, and certain Department of Revenue issues that may have developed
during their incarceration.
As noted throughout, the Hampden County Sheriff’s Office offers a wide range of vocational and
skills training in culinary arts, construction, painting, landscaping, welding, custodial
maintenance, graphics and the repair and re-upholstery of office furniture. Certificate programs

are offered in OSHA 10 (general industry and construction), ServSafe, Blueprint Reading, and
our new American Welding Society training and certification program.
These training efforts are crucial to developing skill sets for the offenders to utilize upon release.
The Employment Team networks with local employers to market the vocational and industries
programs, thus increasing employability for those who have participated, and ultimately resulting
in a decrease in recidivism.
As noted earlier, our Employment Team plays a vital role in the operation of the Olde Armory
Grille Restaurant, a café in Springfield Technology Park, which offers offenders real life work
experience and puts on display their talent and skill sets for local businesses looking to hire.
Collaborations have been established community entities such as STCC, HCC, MassHire, the
Springfield Housing Authority, and others offering training and education to our participants. In
FY23, our business model adapted to the changes in the community and its location. With the
departure of many of the businesses at Tech Park, we began to offer more catering and delivery
services and expanded to provide Grab and Go products to STCC students and faculty. This
continues to flourish in FY’24
Touching upon our previous mention of the Charitable Foundation and Workforce Initiative,
these non-profits were formed and designed to help female and male transitioning ex-offenders
in conjunction with habitually unemployed homeless individuals and disenfranchised workers
across Hampden County. This initiative is establishing a track record of employment and the
eventual transition to a permanent position with partnered local businesses, while providing
immediate financial payment to the participant. The program is funded by various grants with a
focus on helping the Hampden County community and Commonwealth at no cost to the
taxpayer. The Initiative operates primarily out of the All Inclusive Support Services (AISS)
building located in the Mason Square section of Springfield and has linked with MassHire for
additional services to be provided to the participants. While based out of AISS, it is evolving and
expanding in scope of work and locations to better reach participants and help them become job-
ready.

SECTION I
Comprehensive quantitative analysis of the impact of the program has on participating
inmates as compared to non-participating inmates, including their disciplinary record
while in custody, their recidivism rates after release and their employment rate after
release.
Impact on Participants:
PROGRAM IMPACT SHEET
York Street Industries 1/30/25
A factory inside the correctional facility with inmates as the workers,
York Street Industries (YSI) produces quality goods, principally for
schools, correctional facilities, and other governmental agencies. Work
includes: screen printing, embroidering, sewing, upholstery,
woodworking, welding, custodial maintenance, graphics /
Evidence Drives Excellence
printing, culinary, office furniture manufacturing / repair. The
HCSO Research Team program provides skills to enable individuals to obtain and maintain
employment upon release, a prerequisite for success in the community
after incarceration.
Climate of Productive Engagement
The Hampden County Sheriff's Office operates on the premise that productive engagement
during incarceration drives positive outcomes such as good institutional adjustment and low
recidivism rates. Sentenced inmates typically participated in 7 programs, while pretrial
detainees typically participated in 5 programs (mass.gov Cross Tracking, 2024). Robust
program engagement occurs at all sites, with program moves far outnumbering aggression-
related disciplinary incidents. In fact, the ratio of routine program moves to aggression-related
disciplinary events in 2024 was 333 to 1. Program moves here include only POWS scans into
formal programs, so additional services such as in-pod programs, health services, visits, and
gym recreation are excluded from the data (Lauzon 2025).
Program Moves-per-week in 2024

Characteristics of the 62 Industries Participants in Calendar Year 2024:
e 39.5 years of age on average (youngest age 21 & eldest age 62).
e 50% scored as medium risk, while 26% scored high, and 24% low risk, per the LSV-SV
screening for criminogenic risk / need.
e 11 were still active at the end of the calendar year.
e 28 had been released, transferred to lower security, or enrolled in other program(s).
e 23 (37.1%) were terminated from the program, with 12 (19.4%) of those terminations being for
aggressive disciplinary infractions (fights or assaults).
e Most participants were pretrial (51.6% JAL & 4.8% US Marshall), while fewer than half were
sentenced (38.7% HOC & 4.8% DOC).
Care and supervision of the participants required great diligence on the part of YSI staff, given the
population’s behavioral characteristics and high turnover.
Low Recidivism Rates
HCSO’s recidivism metrics are overall very good (low) on a state and national scale. Specific to
Reincarceration, these “Report Card” numbers are consistently lower than MA's rates.
Reincarceration rates events within a year of release (the most typical timeframe) appear below for
Hampden and all MA counties. National 1-year reincarceration figures, though less frequently
monitored and reported, have been measured at 19.9% or higher.
Outcomes for YSI participants over a 6-year span show that York Street participants fared as well as
or better than their Hampden County peers and much better than all-county releases. Specifically for
the 60 participants in the Hampden “Release To Community” cohorts, 9 individuals were
reincarcerated within their first year out.
1-year recidivism for YSI participants was 15.0%
This 15.0% rate compares with:
16.2% for all Hamden Releases To Community;
19.6% for All-County Releases to Community.
The low recidivism rate for YSI workers is impressive both because most score medium- or high-risk
on the LSI-SV and because participants must have longer stays than the usual jail population,
suggesting they have serious cases.

EMPLOYMENT RATE INFORMATION
e Since its inception, the HCSO Employment Team has connected individuals to more than
11,632 job placements.
e Averaging approximately 25 new employers annually, the HCSO’s employment database
currently lists well over 500 employers and vendors that we have partnered with over the years.
e During FY23, 289 individuals transitioned to employment using the Employment Team’s
services.
e Significantly, we also added 37 new employers to our database (9 more than our yearly
average).
SECTION II
Information on the participants.
Industries Participants in Fiscal Year 2024:
Potential candidates for the Prison Industries program (PI) must earn the opportunity to enroll. This is
achieved through prior work performance evaluations within facility jobs, program participation and
overall assessment. Once in the Prison Industries program, participants are required to remain incident-
and discipline-free.

o Inside the Facility:
e We utilize our programs to prepare offenders for reintegration into society by
giving them the tools and real life experiences while incarcerated to get and
maintain employment in the community.
e Prison Industries becomes a tool to reward good behavior. Offenders that want
to learn and do the right things can excel, earn money, and gain the knowledge
to become more employable when released.
e Prison Industries is also a tool used to change disruptive behavior. By allowing
individuals the opportunity to become part of a team and learn to work together,
we can slowly break the cycle of negative behavior. After working within the
industries program, these individuals become less of a problem in the living
units and more employable upon release.
o Outside the Facility:
e While taking a comprehensive review of the needs of each individual, we use
treatment, education, vocations, industries and employment to help ex-offenders
get and maintain employment within the community. If an individual has a
setback when released, we offer support through our community-based team at
our All-Inclusive Support Services program (AISS) located within the
community of Springfield. Here, we offer support for a number of reentry needs
such as substance abuse treatment, housing, child support and employment
services. These services are available to any ex-offender no matter how long
they have been released.
e Our Employment Team assists in employment placement and also with job
retention. This support is critical for the offender and the employer. In this
endeavor, we are positioned to anticipate problems and avoid potential
termination of employment.

SECTION II
Information on the customers of the program, including whether they are a public entity, a
private business or a nonprofit.
Community Restitution Crews
Products and services sold by York Street Industries are chosen carefully as not to take business away
from local vendors. Competing vendors for most products that are produced are located outside the
continental USA. Vocational training is the number one concern of our industries program and
customers are selected based on several criteria.
1. Public Agencies — We believe offenders should give back to the community that they came
from and in teaching offenders to take pride in a job well done and establishing a good
work ethic is paramount in maintaining employment on the outside. Our offenders come
from the local community, so when we rebuild a park or baseball field they are giving back
to the community and an offender can take pride in the fact that his or her child maybe
using that park once finished.
Nonprofit — Like public agencies, nonprofit agencies are committed to helping our
community. Helping to produce goods and services for nonprofits allows offenders the
ability to develop skill sets that will enhance their opportunities for long term employment
upon release. Ultimately, this contributes to reducing recidivism rates and strengthening the
community and families they return to.
Private Businesses — Our partnership with private business is essential to the success of our
Prison Industries program. Our model is a two-fold approach of teaching skills and
generating revenue. We teach offenders essential soft skills in our industries program such
as punctuality, time management, quality control, teamwork, communication, listening, and
taking pride in a job well done, to name a few. Together with our business partners we get
to take these skills to the next level and teach offenders specific skills needed to gain
sustainable employment. Some examples of these skills include basic construction,
welding, sewing, packaging, tool usage, quality control, shipping, receiving, inventory
control, machine and tool operation, OSHA 10, ServSafe, production deadlines, and safety.
Upon completion of the industries program, offenders have secured employment in
construction trades, food service, manufacturing, and customer service, to name a few. In
some cases, we are able to place a worker in a job while still in higher security as a result of
their acquired vocational skills. We maintain contact with these individuals to support them
and ensure they meet all requirements to maintain employment in the community.

Reentry planning begins on day one of incarceration at each of our facilities. A holistic approach to
vocational, education, employment readiness training - as well as and short- and long-term goal
defining - begins immediately. These integrated assessments and individual release plans prepare
people for returning to the community by working in partnership with hundreds of community
resources to establish a solid platform to create the highest possible impact for ex-offenders, their
families and our neighborhoods.
Our Community Restitution work crews have saved cities and towns across Hampden County millions
of dollars and performed over a million hours of labor, often completing tasks left unresolved by
others. For example, the city of Springfield alone has seen a savings of over $11 million.
FY24 Community Restitution Projects:
Our Community Restitution crews perform weekly street and park clean-ups within Hampden County.
Partnerships with the cities of Springfield, Holyoke and Chicopee yield community service projects
that are outlined below, saving the cities annually and contributing to our community’s quality of life.
Through our unique partnership with the Springfield Parks Department, the HCSO’s Community
Restitution program provides vocational training and workplace skills in the construction field.
Utilizing a city-owned saw mill and tree dump, we are able to salvage usable wooden boards for reuse.
The project has spawned a “Green” business and vocational training opportunity. The boards are
brought from the community to our Building Trades shop where students learned to measure, cut and
assemble Adirondack chairs. The local demand for these chairs is so great that we have been
increasing our efforts on this production. Gradually, we began building sheds that are constructed in
the same manner as a residential home to teach carpentry skills. This recycling program represents a
unique synergy between our outside work crews and our shops within the Main Institution and helped
earn the designation of Springfield as the fourth greenest city in America.
Additionally, the work of our Community Restitution crews has benefited the following communities
with the following FY24 projects:
CITY OF SPRINGFIELD:
1. Refurbished snack shed at Forest Park
2. Painted Gazebo at Blunt Park the Gazebo measured 40’x60’.

10. Spirit of Springfield setting up displays for their Holiday Ball. Transported scaffolding for
fireworks display.
Quality of Life
Various community based projects such as graffiti removal, neighborhood landscaping & clean—
ups of baseball fields, terraces, etc.
PAST PROJECTS:
The seat re-upholstery of auditoriums has financially saved our Commonwealth
hundreds of thousands of dollars. These work incentive projects include schools and
colleges with seating from 400 to as large as 1,500. Boston University, University of
Massachusetts, Springfield Public Schools, Springfield Technical Community College,
Taunton Public Schools, Fall River Public schools among others, are samples of the
expansive scope of work. Each auditorium job can save a school from $100,000 to
$500,000 and this can mean the difference between bringing an auditorium back to life
and up to fire code or students sitting in ripped torn seating with exposed foam and
metal.
a. Another aspect of the re-upholstery program is the complete restoration of furniture.
Thanks to our carpentry, welding and upholstery teams, all pieces are new again. To our
despair, we are so busy that we have had to reject potential business.
b. Prison Industries has assisted numbers cities and towns across the Commonwealth
including Palmer, Ludlow, Holland, Wilbraham, Longmeadow, East Longmeadow, East
Otis, Chicopee, Russell, Westfield, West Springfield, Hampden, Monson, Taunton, Fall
River, Cohasset and towns on Cape Cod.

A vital component of the Correctional Industries system is addressing the varied needs of our inmate
population as the whole person and not just to punish them for their offenses. We also actively look to
eliminate impediments to health care, rehabilitation, education and employment. York Street Industries
plays a vital role by helping to change prior criminal behaviors which help to facilitate a successful
transition back to family and community. Our participants’ recidivism numbers are significantly lower
compared to the national average, validating the efficiencies of our strategic reentry model. There are
struggles, but this holistic philosophy has changed thousands of lives, provided pathways, and built a
firm foundation for our released citizens, their families and ultimately the quality of life within our
communities.
The Hampden County Sheriff's Office is at a place where we believe we can continue to thrive and
create measurable change by increasing our retained revenue cap.
