of Children and Families
FY2024 Fair Hearing
Report
March 2025
DEPARTMENT OF
CHILDREN AND
FAMILIES
1

The Fair Hearing is a vital process within the Department of Children and Families (DCF) to ensure
that a consumer who disagrees with certain actions or clinical decisions by the Department can
present their appeal to an impartial Hearing Officer and ensure the agency’s compliance with DCF
policy, regulations, and statutory obligations. DCF is filing this report pursuant to reporting
requirements included in Item 4800-0015 of section 2 of chapter 28 of the acts of 2023.
This report includes information on all Fair Hearing requests open at any time during Fiscal Year
(FY) 24, which spans July 1, 2023, through June 30, 2024. 1
For any Fair Hearing request open at any time during FY24, the following is reported:
• the subject matter of the appeal
• outcomes of cases resolved prior to a Fair Hearing decision
• number of days between the hearing request and first day of hearing
• number of days between the close of evidence and the Hearing Officer’s decision
• number of days of continuance granted at the appellant’s request
• number of days of continuance granted at the request of DCF or the Hearing
Officer
• the outcome of the hearing (reversal or affirm)
The report also includes information on hearing requests pending more than 180 days at any time
during FY24, including Fair Hearing requests that have been stayed by the District Attorney, as
follows:
• the number of cases
• how many have been heard but not decided
• how many have been decided by a hearing officer but not finalized
The Fair Hearing process is governed by M.G.L. c.30A, and by 110 CMR 10.00 et. seq. of the
Department’s regulations. Appellants may employ an attorney to assist them during this process,
but it is not required as a function of a Fair Hearing, and most individuals do not retain an attorney
in the defense of their claim. These hearings are not as formal as a court proceeding and do not
follow the Massachusetts Rules of Evidence; therefore, the rules regarding what can or cannot be
admitted are more flexible. Upon issuance of the Fair Hearing decision, the Appellants also have
an additional right of appellate review to the Superior Court pursuant to M.G.L. c.30A.
It is important to note that while the Fair Hearing process is occurring, there may be a separate,
distinct process occurring in the Juvenile or Probate and Family Court, which relates to the custody
of the child or children. The Juvenile or Probate and Family Court judge is the arbiter of all custody
and placement decisions relative to a child, based upon a finding regarding the parental fitness of
the child’s parents, as well as a determination as to what is in the best interest of the child. The
scope of a Fair Hearing decision is limited; it does not supersede the court’s authority in

determining whether an out-of-home placement is in the best interest of a child, whether that
placement is at home with parents or in a foster or adoptive home.
To assist consumers seeking an appeal through the Fair Hearing process, the Fair Hearing Office
uses an online appeal request form located on the DCF website at https://www.mass.gov/fair-
hearing-unit. This allows an Appellant to “e-file” an appeal request directly to the Fair Hearing
Office. The “e-file” requests are reviewed on the business day filed or on the next business day if
filed during non-working hours. In FY24, of the 2,055 requests submitted, the Fair Hearing Office
received 1,200 “e-file” submissions, which is over fifty percent of all requests made, and almost
300 more than in FY23, demonstrating increased accessibility to the Hearing process and allowing
more efficiency in scheduling. The majority of the remaining appeal requests were emailed directly
to the Fair Hearing Office mailbox.
The Fair Hearing Office has been successful in increasing the number of electronic filings and
includes tailored communications for consumers with limited English proficiency. The “e-file”
form allows consumers to identify a preferred language when filing a request, enabling DCF to
arrange for an interpreter and translate correspondence for the Appellant. The Fair Hearing Office
is actively working to create additional “e-file” request forms in alternate languages to increase
access for limited or non-English-speaking consumers seeking an appeal.
Standard documents, including initial scheduling letters used by the Fair Hearing Office, are
available in five (5) different languages: Spanish, Haitian Creole, Brazilian Portuguese, Traditional
Chinese, and Cape Verdean Creole. The Fair Hearing Office works in conjunction with the DCF
area offices and Central Office to collaborate with the Massachusetts Commission for the Deaf
and Hard of Hearing to authorize and arrange ASL and CART interpreters for individuals who are
Deaf, Hard of Hearing, or Deafblind and request accommodations. Additionally, DCF contracts
with video remote interpretation services arranged in advance of hearings and telephonic
interpretation services, which can be utilized in hearings at a moment’s notice. As such, if an
interpreter has not been arranged in advance or was arranged and becomes unavailable, the
Appellant can proceed with the hearing on the scheduled date. The Fair Hearing Office remains
committed to developing and incorporating language access aids and tools (i.e., translation of the
updated Fair Hearing Guide) to serve the needs of all consumers seeking an appeal effectively.
Fair Hearings are scheduled on a timely basis. Fair Hearings are scheduled manually by the Fair
Hearing Office, with notice sent either electronically or by regular mail to the Appellants. The Fair
Hearing Office is in the process of modernizing the scheduling process and plans to begin
transitioning to an electronic scheduling system in FY25. Fair Hearings can occur five days a week
with most conducted by videoconference via the Microsoft Teams platform. In-person hearings
occur at a designated DCF office when requested by the Appellant. Appellants are also offered
the ability to have the hearing conducted via “paper review,” where parties submit documentary
evidence and written arguments in support of their case to the assigned Hearing Officer. The
submitted evidence is considered by the Hearing Officer, without testimony, in rendering a
decision. The Fair Hearing Office’s ability to offer hearings through a virtual platform, in-person,
or by “paper review,” provides an inclusive approach for Department consumers requesting an
appeal through the Fair Hearing process.

Table 1 (below) details the number of Fair Hearing requests filed by fiscal year. The number of
Fair Hearings requested in FY24 increased by 371, of which 295 were for Fair Hearings related to
substantiated concern decisions. The increase in Fair Hearing requests was anticipated once the
Fair Hearing Office began accepting requests for substantiated concern decisions in May 2023.
The Fair Hearing Office has been successful in scheduling timely hearings, even with the increased
number of requests,

*Continuances account for most cases that extend beyond the 65 days outlined in the regulations.
As shown in Table 7, the majority of the continuance requests allowed by the Fair Hearing Office
are at the request of the Appellant. In most of those cases, the Appellant is seeking additional time
to prepare for the Hearing, to hire counsel and/or to obtain case files.
(iv) The number of days between the close of evidence and the hearing officer’s decision

All cases open during FY24 73 60
The Fair Hearing regulations require the Hearing Officer to write a decision within 60 business
days from the close of evidence. During FY24, the Department remained in compliance with
regulatory time standards for any cases filed during the fiscal year. For all cases open at any time
in FY24, the average number of days between the close of evidence and the Hearing Officer’s
decision has improved with staffing, decreasing by 19 days.
(v) The number of days of continuance granted at the Appellant's request
Table 7 provides a summary of the continuances granted on Fair Hearings for all cases open in
FY24, based upon who requested the continuance.

The Fair Hearing Office strives to reduce the number of continuances granted in an effort to resolve
all pending Fair Hearing cases within a 180-day time frame. The Department’s ability to offer
hearings using videoconferencing and teleconferencing allows the Appellants greater accessibility
and the Fair Hearing Office more flexibility when scheduling hearings and assigning Hearing
Officers. The number of allowed requests to continue a scheduled Fair Hearing remained highest
among the Appellants but remain steady from FY23. In FY24, 360 continuance requests3 were
allowed due to Appellant scheduling conflicts, because they had recently hired counsel who
needed time to prepare or had a scheduling conflict, and/or because they awaited requested
documents from the Area Office. When a continuance is allowed, the matter is scheduled on the
next available date, and when possible, with consideration given to dates offered by Appellant’s
counsel to avoid future scheduling conflicts therefore reducing the time that the case remains
open.4 In FY24, 64% of the allowed requests for continuances were made by the Appellants or
their attorneys.
(vii) Whether the Department’s decision that was the subject of the appeal was affirmed or
reversed [See Columns Y, Z, AA of attached spreadsheet]
Of the cases open in FY24, the Fair Hearing Office issued 692 decisions affirmed the Department’s
decision, 44 decisions partially reversed5 the Department’s decision, and 472 decisions that
3 This reflects requests made by an Appellant or by an Attorney, on behalf of an Appellant.
4 A request for a continuance directly correlates to the amount of time that a case remains open. The Fair Hearing
Office carefully considers each request, on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the impact of the delay and its
relation to the timeliness of rendering the Fair Hearing decision, while also balancing the Appellant’s right to due
process.
5 Partial reversal decisions include both an affirm and a reversal.

reversed the Department’s decision. The Fair Hearing Office issued 39 more decisions in FY24
compared to FY23. The increase in Fair Hearing Office staff over time, coupled with a change in
scheduling cadence and dedicated writing time, has contributed to the successful increase in the
number of decisions issued in FY24.

180 days
Total number of cases pending more than 180 1,482
days, excluding DA stays
Requests stayed by the District Attorney 106 open requests, 68 closed requests
Specific attention is given to any case pending for more than 180 days because of the regulatory
timelines from the filing of the Fair Hearing request to issuance of the decision total approximately
180 calendar days. However, even one continuance request allowed for justifiable cause, in most
cases, results in a case remaining open beyond 180 days. When a continuance requested by the
Appellant is determined necessary to accommodate their scheduling needs, the continuance is
allowed. Similarly, when a hearing involves a pending criminal court matter is “stayed”, at the
District Attorney’s (DA) request for the required minimum six-month regulatory time period the
additional time extends the appeal process beyond 180 days, where it remains until the DA stay
expires. According to DCF regulations, the DA’s office can request an extension of the DA stay
in six-month intervals for an unlimited period of time.
In FY24, the Fair Hearing Office was successful in reducing the number of cases pending for more
than 180 days. Of the 1,4827 pending cases in this category, 1,138 (77%) were closed. The success
can be attributed to the current staffing and the time to prepare for hearings and write decisions
and is intended to maintain timelines for pending decisions and ultimately reduce the pending cases
open for more than 180 days.
6 126 of these cases were heard, but the decision was not due as of the end of FY24.
7 This number excludes 174 DA stays, as the Fair Hearing has no control over the outcome until the expiration of the
stay.
9

In its continuing effort to target areas of need within the unit, the Fair Hearing Office uses monthly
data reports to monitor the productivity of the Hearing Office staff and to identify those in need of
increased supervision and training. Dedicated paralegal supervision focuses on pre-hearing
activities and dedicated Fair Hearing Officer supervision focuses on the review of draft Fair
Hearing decisions and the timeliness of submission, review, and issuance. Currently, the Hearing
Officers have dedicated writing time every 3rd week, which has contributed to increased
productivity in the Fair Hearing Office, as evidenced by the additional number of decisions issued
in FY24.
During FY25, the Fair Hearing Office will continue its commitment to schedule, convene, and
issue current decisions in a timely fashion, while also continuing its focus on reducing the number
of pending cases open for more than 180 days.
