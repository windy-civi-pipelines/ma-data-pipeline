Commissioner
January 2021
Dear Members of the General Court:
I am pleased to submit the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education’s (Department)
report on the progress made in addressing persistent disparities in achievement among student
subgroups in the aggregate and within subcategories on a statewide basis through the collection
of three-year district plans.
At the onset of the coronavirus pandemic, the Legislature provided key relief on the April 1,
2020, deadline for plan submissions. The Department expects to receive all district plans by
January 15, 2021. While this work was interrupted by the pandemic, the following report
summarizes the foundation established by this new process and initial results from the plans
collected thus far.
Massachusetts has been recognized for the progress our students have made over the last decade
in overall student achievement, but persistent opportunity and achievement gaps remain,
especially for our students of color, low-income students, English learners, and students with
disabilities. Closing these gaps is our urgent and collective work; the Student Opportunity Act
supports our efforts to ensure that all students are prepared for success after high school.
I look forward to providing future updates to you regarding the implementation of the Student
Opportunity Act. Please contact Associate Commissioner of Statewide System of Support Daniel
Anderson at daniel.anderson@mass.gov with any questions.
Sincerely,
Jeffrey C. Riley
Commissioner of Elementary and Secondary Education

Introduction
The Department of Elementary and Secondary Education respectfully submits this Report to the
Legislature pursuant to Chapter 132 of the Acts of 2019, The Student Opportunity Act:
Annually, not later than December 31, the commissioner shall submit a report to the clerks of the house
of representatives and the senate and the chairs of the joint committee on education on the progress made
in addressing persistent disparities in achievement among student subgroups in the aggregate and within
subcategories on a statewide basis; provided, however, that district and school-level data shall be made
available on the department’s website along with the report. (M.G.L. Ch. 69 § 1S (d))
A key goal of the Student Opportunity Act (Act) is to address persistent disparities in achievement
among student subgroups in the Commonwealth. The Act directs the Commissioner of Elementary and
Secondary Education to establish statewide targets for addressing persistent disparities in achievement
among student subgroups. Districts and charter schools are charged with identifying student
achievement gaps and developing three-year, evidence-based plans to address those gaps by April 1,

Section 2:
2020.
By early February 2020 districts received guidance and templates from the Department to support the
development and submission of the three-year evidence-based plans. Following the March 2020
statewide school closures due to the COVID pandemic and the prospect of extended impacts on districts
and schools, the legislature granted the Commissioner of Elementary and Secondary Education
(Commissioner) the authority to postpone the April 1 due date through Chapter 56 of the Acts of 2020.
The due date for three-year plans for districts is now January 15, 2021.
This report describes the implementation of the three-year evidence-based plan process to date, a
summary of plans that have been submitted to date, and outlines the next steps.
1
Implementation
Directly following the enactment of the Student Opportunity Act, the Department created a district plan
template and detailed guidance document for districts to follow while developing their three-year
evidence-based plans to assist them in meeting the original April 1, 2020, submission deadline. The
Department established a bifurcated process for plan submissions: a “long form” process that would be
applied to districts receiving substantial new funds and a “short form” process that would be applied to
the remaining districts. Districts receiving more than $1.5 million in incremental Chapter 70 funding in
FY2021 House 2 would be required to complete the long form, and districts receiving less than $1.5
million in incremental Chapter 70 funding would complete the short form. In FY2021 House 2, 37
districts were required to complete the long form and accounted for over 82 percent of incremental
Chapter 70 funding.
Building from the evidence-based program categories outlined in the Student Opportunity Act, the
Department identified 17 examples of high-quality programs that the Commissioner encouraged districts
to consider.1 These programs were:
Enhanced Core Instruction

Section 3:
1. Expanded access to full-day, high-quality pre-kindergarten for 4-year-olds, including potential
collaboration with other local providers (SOA categories D, E, F, and G)

Section 4:
2. Research-based early literacy programs in pre-kindergarten and early elementary grades (D, E, F,
and G)

Section 5:
3. Early College programs focused primarily on students under-represented in higher education (E,
F, and I)

Section 6:
4. Supporting educators to implement high-quality, aligned curriculum (E and F)

Section 7:
5. Expanded access to career-technical education, including “After Dark” district-vocational
partnerships and innovation pathways reflecting local labor market priorities (I)
Targeted Student Supports

Section 8:
6. Increased personnel and services to support holistic student needs (C and D)

Section 9:
7. Inclusion/co-teaching for students with disabilities and English learners (D and E)

Section 10:
8. Acceleration Academies and/or summer learning to support skill development and accelerate
advanced learners (A)

Section 11:
9. Dropout prevention and recovery programs (I)
Talent Development

Section 12:
10. Diversifying the educator/administrator workforce through recruitment and retention (D and H)

Section 13:
11. Leadership pipeline development programs for schools (D and E)
1 A) Expanded learning time in the form of a longer school day or year; B) Increased opportunity for common planning time for
teachers; C) Social services to support students’ social-emotional and physical health; D) Hiring school personnel that best support
improved student performance; E) Increased or improved professional development; F) Purchase of curriculum materials and
equipment that are aligned with the statewide curriculum frameworks; G) Expanded early education and pre-kindergarten
programming within the district in consultation or in partnership with community based organizations; H) Diversifying the educator
and administrator workforce; I) Developing additional pathways to strengthen college and career readiness; J) Any other program
determined to be evidence-based by the commissioner

Section 14:
12. Increased staffing to expand student access to arts, athletics, and enrichment, and strategic
scheduling to enable common planning time for teachers (B)

Section 15:
13. Strategies to recruit and retain educators/administrators in hard-to-staff schools and positions (D)
Conditions for Student Success

Section 16:
14. Community partnerships for in-school enrichment and wraparound services (C)

Section 17:
15. Parent-teacher home visiting programs (E)

Section 18:
16. Labor-management partnerships to improve student performance (E)

Section 19:
17. Facilities improvements to create healthy and safe school environments (C)

Section 20:
18. Managing declining enrollment to ensure robust programming at all schools (J)
The Department provided several supports for districts to complete this new requirement. These
supports included: webinars, presentations, a dedicated email address for support, and a designated

Section 21:
section of the DESE website. In addition, an accompanying document was provided to districts with
examples of evidence-based programs that included high-quality program components and
implementation considerations.
In response to the coronavirus pandemic, Chapter 56 of the Acts of 2020 granted districts an extension
to submit their three-year plans to the Department beyond the April 1, 2020 deadline. This deadline was
ultimately extended to January 15, 2021.
Progress
While districts and charter schools have until January 15, 2021, to submit their plans, many already
have. The following information is a synopsis of the plans submitted to date. Please note that these
districts may still amend their previous submissions.
As of January 11, 2020, 201 plans had been submitted from districts, 63 percent of the total expected. Of
these, 180 plans were “short-form” (64 percent of total short form plans) and 21 plans were “long-form”
(57 percent of total long form plans). In addition, 23 of 78 charter schools submitted plans. Due to the
sample size, charter school information has not been presented in this data but will be available once all
plans have been submitted.
In accordance with the Student Opportunity Act, the Department requested that districts make four
commitments as part of their three-year plans:

Section 22:
1. Intentionally focus on student subgroups who are not achieving at the same high levels as their
peers;

Section 23:
2. Adopt, deepen, or continue specific evidence-based programs to close opportunity and
achievement gaps for student subgroups and allocate resources to support these programs;

Section 24:
3. Monitor success in reducing disparities in achievement among student subgroups over three
years with a small number of metrics and targets; and

Section 25:
4. Engage families, particularly those families representing student subgroups most in need of
support and how best to meet their students’ needs.
3
Commitment #1: Focusing on Student Subgroups
Districts were asked to analyze student learning opportunities and student outcomes for groups of
students in their schools and then identify within their plans which group or groups the evidence-based
approaches would target. On average, districts selected 3.5 subgroups. Table 1 shows the student groups
that districts are prioritizing.

Commitment #2: Using Evidence-Based Programs to Close Gaps
The Department identified 17 examples of high-quality evidence-based programs that the commissioner
encouraged districts to consider when selecting evidence-based programs to support student subgroups.
Each program is aligned to one or more of the program categories outlined in the language of the
Student Opportunity Act. Table 3 indicates the number of evidence-based programs selected by districts.
Please note that districts could select multiple programs.

Since the financial commitments as part of these evidence-based programs are still uncertain, we are not
currently presenting summary financial information. After the final submission, we will provide
summary information on districts’ financial commitments.

Commitment #3: Monitoring Success with Outcome Metrics and Targets
Districts identified the outcome metrics they plan to use to measure success in addressing persistent
disparities among subgroups. The SOA plan template developed by the Department included a
dropdown menu where districts could choose from 13 different data points that the Department collects.
These metrics include student achievement and growth, high school completion, post-secondary success,
and other measures. The Department is setting annual targets for these metrics and will track districts’
progress in meeting them.
Districts also had the opportunity to provide custom metrics that they planned to use to measure
progress. Seventy percent of districts indicated that they plan to utilize custom metrics. Districts are
responsible for setting their targets for measuring progress on these metrics. The information on targets
will be collected in the April 1, 2021 updates from districts.

Commitment #4: Engaging All Families
Districts and charter schools submitted their ongoing plans for engaging families and how they would
measure increases in family engagement based on these efforts. Frequently cited strategies included
community conversations and input sessions, surveys, and school committee engagement.

Closing
With the collection of all remaining plans in January, the Department will be able to update these figures
to include all districts and charter schools. In accordance with the law, district plans will be available on
the DESE website. Additional details, including targets and annual updates, will be included in the April
1 update.

section of the DESE website. In addition, an accompanying document was provided to districts with
examples of evidence-based programs that included high-quality program components and
implementation considerations.
In response to the coronavirus pandemic, Chapter 56 of the Acts of 2020 granted districts an extension
to submit their three-year plans to the Department beyond the April 1, 2020 deadline. This deadline was
ultimately extended to January 15, 2021.
Progress
While districts and charter schools have until January 15, 2021, to submit their plans, many already
have. The following information is a synopsis of the plans submitted to date. Please note that these
districts may still amend their previous submissions.
As of January 11, 2020, 201 plans had been submitted from districts, 63 percent of the total expected. Of
these, 180 plans were “short-form” (64 percent of total short form plans) and 21 plans were “long-form”
(57 percent of total long form plans). In addition, 23 of 78 charter schools submitted plans. Due to the
sample size, charter school information has not been presented in this data but will be available once all
plans have been submitted.
In accordance with the Student Opportunity Act, the Department requested that districts make four
commitments as part of their three-year plans:
1. Intentionally focus on student subgroups who are not achieving at the same high levels as their
peers;
2. Adopt, deepen, or continue specific evidence-based programs to close opportunity and
achievement gaps for student subgroups and allocate resources to support these programs;
3. Monitor success in reducing disparities in achievement among student subgroups over three
years with a small number of metrics and targets; and
4. Engage families, particularly those families representing student subgroups most in need of
support and how best to meet their students’ needs.

Commitment #1: Focusing on Student Subgroups
Districts were asked to analyze student learning opportunities and student outcomes for groups of
students in their schools and then identify within their plans which group or groups the evidence-based
approaches would target. On average, districts selected 3.5 subgroups. Table 1 shows the student groups
that districts are prioritizing.

Commitment #2: Using Evidence-Based Programs to Close Gaps
The Department identified 17 examples of high-quality evidence-based programs that the commissioner
encouraged districts to consider when selecting evidence-based programs to support student subgroups.
Each program is aligned to one or more of the program categories outlined in the language of the
Student Opportunity Act. Table 3 indicates the number of evidence-based programs selected by districts.
Please note that districts could select multiple programs.

Commitment #3: Monitoring Success with Outcome Metrics and Targets
Districts identified the outcome metrics they plan to use to measure success in addressing persistent
disparities among subgroups. The SOA plan template developed by the Department included a
dropdown menu where districts could choose from 13 different data points that the Department collects.
These metrics include student achievement and growth, high school completion, post-secondary success,
and other measures. The Department is setting annual targets for these metrics and will track districts’
progress in meeting them.
Districts also had the opportunity to provide custom metrics that they planned to use to measure
progress. Seventy percent of districts indicated that they plan to utilize custom metrics. Districts are
responsible for setting their targets for measuring progress on these metrics. The information on targets
will be collected in the April 1, 2021 updates from districts.

Commitment #4: Engaging All Families
Districts and charter schools submitted their ongoing plans for engaging families and how they would
measure increases in family engagement based on these efforts. Frequently cited strategies included
community conversations and input sessions, surveys, and school committee engagement.

Closing
With the collection of all remaining plans in January, the Department will be able to update these figures
to include all districts and charter schools. In accordance with the law, district plans will be available on
the DESE website. Additional details, including targets and annual updates, will be included in the April
1 update.
