Probation Service
FY 2024 Annual Report:
Protecting while Building Safer, Healthier,
Stronger Communities
1
Message from the Commissioner
of the Massachusetts Probation Service (MPS) and reflect, I
found 2024 to have been one of innovative growth and
collaborative partnerships that have led to the protection and
building of safer, healthier, and stronger communities across
the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.
This could not have been possible without the support of
Chief Justice Kimberly S. Budd, Associate Justices of the
Supreme Judicial Court, Chief Justice Heidi Brieger, Court
Administrator Thomas Ambrosino, Departmental Chief
Justices, other court offices and departments, as well as
community-based agencies and providers.
I especially want to express my deepest thanks and gratitude
to the employees of the MPS, whose passion, dedication and
commitment has resulted in improved outcomes for
individuals under probation supervision, greater
access to resources through our community justice support centers, and improved services for other court users and
litigants who come in contact with the MPS.
Along with promoting accountability and responsibility, the MPS is committed to providing access to resources
and supports that contribute to the improved safety and welfare of individuals on pretrial status, under probation
supervision, returning citizens, as well as those of victims and survivors, and our community-at-large.
The MPS is also committed to evidence-based, data-driven policies and practices best suited for all phases of the
criminal justice process.The MPS commits to preserving the rights of defendants, victims, and witnesses, reducing
failure to appear rates across all court divisions, while enhancing programming and treatment initiatives that result
in better outcomes, which will in turn lead to reductions in recidivism, incarceration, and reincarceration.
An overarching goal of the MPS is also its commitment to ensuring that all justice-involved individuals have access
to adequate healthcare resources and supports to better facilitate and promote healthy living outcomes. In
addition to these core principles, the MPS is committed to conducting and using comprehensive research analysis
to better understand our performance metrics as it relates to our role in the causation of racial and ethnic
disparities (RED), and to make the necessary structural, procedural, and operational changes to eliminate RED
across all aspects of our probation supervision and business practices. We believe these actions allow the MPS
and the broader Trial Court to improve access to justice outcomes for defendants, litigants, victims, and other
court users.
MPS is expanding its footprint beyond supervision by partnering with MassHealth to bridge the coverage gap for
post disposition justice-involved individuals with mental health and substance use disorder needs. The Behavioral
Health-Justice Involved (BH-JI) initiative developed a sustainable model that includes intensive supports and
services, care coordination, and referrals for housing, social services, and benefits. This partnership fosters direct
referrals and strong care coordination for post disposition justice-involved individuals. The MPS is expanding this
initiative to include the pretrial population and expand additional services to post-dispositional probationers.
These initiatives and others like them provide the MPS and Trial Court Justices with treatment alternatives which
help to eliminate barriers to services and resources, while decreasing unnecessary probation violations, pretrial
detention, and improving outcomes for individuals on probation and pretrial supervision.

FY 2024 Initiatives
Current probation initiatives that were adopted to improve practice and reduce violations include:
Collaboration with George Mason University: Probation is working with George Mason University (GMU), in
conjunction with the American Probation and Parole Association (APPA), on a research and training project to
help probation departments with their recommendations at sentencing, that will ensure that the sentence is
most aligned with the probationer’s goals and public safety. This could decrease possible unnecessary
conditions, and in turn, increase the probationer’s ability to succeed while on supervision.
Carey Guides: The MPS has incorporated the Carey Guides as part of its ongoing commitment towards using
Evidence-Based Practices (EBP) in its work with probationers. The goal is to maximize EBP’s efficacy by
providing probation officers with the most current tools and knowledge to produce better outcomes for
probationers.
Interactive Text Response (ITR) Program: In 2020, the Pretrial Service Division collaborated with the
Massachusetts Trial Court’s Information Technology (IT) division to launch its first-ever Interactive Text
Response (ITR) program, which allows court staff to enter the party’s cell phone information into MassCourts
and enroll the party in a text messaging workflow based on events. In FY 2024, there were 357,537 text
messages sent to court users, a 27% increase since last fiscal year.
Efforts to decrease the number of warrants issued for GPS and SCRAM alerts: Within the past year, the
Warrant Management Unit (WMU) has worked carefully to decrease the number of warrants issued for clients
on GPS and remote alcohol monitoring. To decrease warrants issued, the department has strengthened
communication and collaboration with clients by using technological resources such as FaceTime and
WhatsApp to clarify equipment issues and better understand problems regarding alerts. These tools help the
WMU work with the client to improve behavior and ultimately issue less warrants. Since FY 2023, the number of
warrants issued has decreased by 35%.
MassHealth Initiative: This initiative will make it easier to link court users with mental health treatment and
medical services by eliminating barriers. In FY 2024, Pretrial Services worked with 587 referrals and assisted
371 individuals.
Community Justice Support Centers (CJSC): There are currently 18 CJSCs across the commonwealth. In FY
2024, the Quincy CJSC reopened, while the Haverhill CJSC hosted their grand opening. This past year, CJSCs
helped 561 participants avoid incarceration by providing 5,755 total programming hours across all centers.
Reentry Housing: The mission of reentry housing is to create housing opportunities which offer supportive
services to those who are reintegrating into the community or struggling with homelessness and to address the
underlying causes. MPS’ Reentry Program, in collaboration with the Massachusetts Parole Board, offered one
of the largest supplies of transitional bed housing in the state. In FY 2024, a total of 274 residents were served
by reentry housing.
3
Recovery Courts: Massachusetts currently has 31 adult recovery courts, which provide intensive, supervised
probation and mandatory treatment, as well as random drug testing with progress monitored by a
supervising probation officer. Our research shows that of those who completed Recovery Court, only 30.1%
recidivated within two years, compared to 46.9% of those who did not complete.
Supporting Victims of Crime: In FY 2024, the Victim Services Unit helped approximately 1,300 victims with a
variety of issues including crisis intervention, criminal and civil justice system assistance, information, and
referrals. A complete summary of all the work VSU does can be found in the appendix.
Rescinded Warrants: MPS takes the rescinding of warrants very seriously and has strived to reduce the
number of occurrences by refining and enhancing the warrant process. Improvements in this process are
reflected not only through the decline of total warrants issued, but also in the number of warrants rescinded.
Since FY 2018, the total number of warrants rescinded has decreased by 78%.
Training and Ongoing Education: In FY 2024, the Training Department was responsible for 489 training
sessions, totaling over 7,150 hours. The extensiveness, variety, and value of trainings can be seen
throughout this report. The material and training most applicable to each department is featured under each
division. Presenting the number of trainings relevant to each area demonstrates how much Probation and
its employees rely on and are supported by the Training Department through on-going education,
communication, and support.
The Adoption of a New Case Management System: Starting in FY 2024, Probation has been working on the
development of a new case management system (CMS). Through MPS and the company Slalom, a CMS will
be built using Salesforce, a cloud-based system that will help Probation streamline case management and
enhance productivity.

Massachusetts Probation in History
“Through supervision as a treatment method, the probation officer tries to
include a positive change in the habits, attitudes, value system and social
relationships of the probationer by guiding him and by assisting him to
marshal his own resources and to draw upon those of the community to
achieve this end. The ultimate objective is to bring about lasting change in
the attitude of the probationer.”
- Massachusetts Probation Manual, 1968
Massachusetts Probation has always been forward-focused and innovative leader. MPS has a lot to be proud
of. Probation was the first to:
Establish a registry of civil restraining orders: In 1978, MPS became the first agency to create a national
Restraining Order Registry to track domestic violence offenders and share information about offenders with
law enforcement and affiliate partners.
Introduce non-traditional hours via Operation Night Light: In 1994, MPS created Operation Nightlight, a
successful model of community supervision that pairs probation officers with police to conduct regular field
work, which includes interactions with probationers, victims, and the community at large. During special
operations, probation officers also work collaboratively with state and federal enforcement agencies on
warrant sweeps.
Implement a 24/7 electronic monitoring unit: In 2001, the MPS was among the first in the United States to
track probationers using the GPS device as an alternative to jail time, and in 2005, became one of the first
states to track high-risk offenders using the GPS monitoring device as an added supervision tool.
Massachusetts is among a few states who perform their own monitoring of offenders using the system.
Massachusetts was the first state to monitor domestic violence offenders using the GPS bracelet, and has
served as a catalyst for states such as Connecticut and Illinois, which used the MPS as a model. MPS
became one of the few state agencies to use crime correlation, a tracking system to determine if a person is
at or in the vicinity of a crime scene.
Evidence-based practices: MPS continued to lead the way in 2016, when it became one of the first
probation departments in the country to implement a set of validated risk assessment tools, the Ohio Risk
Assessment System (ORAS) and Ohio Youth Assessment System (OYAS). These new risk assessment tools
align with our mission to keep the public safe by changing the trajectory of the lives of the people who come
into our care and custody.

Field Services
The Field Services Division (FSD) at the Office of the Commissioner of Probation provides support to the over 100
local probation departments across the Commonwealth. The core work of the Field Services Division revolves
around supporting the MPS’s overall mission statement by holding probationers accountable for their actions while
supporting them as they work towards making positive changes in their lives. The FSD is also committed to
supporting the families and litigants engaged with our Juvenile and Probate and Family Court Departments for
services and dispute resolution. The FSD also oversees the local probation offices to ensure that they are
implementing statewide practices and policies.
Visiting offenders in the community in places like their homes, jobs, and schools is an integral part of probation
supervision.
New Case Management System
In FY 2024, Probation has been working on the development of a new, unified case management system (CMS).
Probation's current case management process involves juggling multiple outdated systems, making it difficult
for staff to track key tasks, determine the best course of action, and ensure compliance. This fragmented
approach hinders our ability to effectively serve our probationers and our communities.
To address these challenges, MPS has selected Slalom, a consulting company, to be our implementation
partner. Through MPS and Slalom's partnership, the new CMS will be built using Salesforce, a cloud-based
system that will help us streamline case management and enhance productivity.
As of mid-July, Probation completed a successful 12-week initial Discovery and Design Phase, which laid a
strong foundation for the project, aligning a vision of a modern system equipped with essential tools and
functionalities to support our employees in their work with probationers and the community. The project is now
one third of the way through the 30-week Development Phase.
This is an exciting opportunity to transform Probation. A system that empowers MPS to spend less time on
data entry and more time focusing on what truly matters - increasing community safety, supporting victims and
survivors, and assisting individuals and families in achieving long-term positive change - will be beneficial to all.

Trainings
Description
(continued)
This training provided an overview of the violation of probation process, with particular attention to the
District/BMC rules, the Superior Court Guidelines, and the Juvenile Court standing order. Attendees were
armed with the tools they needed to successfully prepare and argue VOPs. We reviewed: the types of
violations; when one has to  le a notice of violation; violation notice requirements; how we use discretion;
Violations of
how to request detention; gathering and introducing evidence; using substantially reliable hearsay; and
Probation (VOP) I
making recommendations for the right interventions. Attendees gained an in-depth understanding of the
probation violation process, including exposure to relevant statutes and case law, and can now better
utilize their discretion to craft individualized responses, including the use of intermediate sanctions, to
promote best possible outcomes for clients, and develop valuable perspective on the VOP process.
Violation of Probation II is designed to take what was learned in VOP I a step further. This training
equipped seasoned probation o cers with the skills needed to succeed in the courtroom. Trainers taught
the law of violations of probation practice as well as practical tips needed to be con dent and persuasive.
This training provided an in depth look at evidence – how to get it and how to use it effectively, including
substantially reliable hearsay. Next, we discussed direct and cross examination, with a focus on

Standards Training
Collaboration with George Mason University
Probation is working with George Mason University (GMU), in conjunction with the American Probation and
Parole Association, on a research and training project to help probation departments with their
recommendations at sentencing, especially condition settings, change in circumstance, or a violation of
probation. GMU is looking for insights into Probation's current supervision process to understand what methods
work well and what barriers MPS may face. It is important to understand what constitutes a good
recommendation versus a recommendation that does not contribute to the probationer’s goals or public safety.
The following courts are involved with this project:
Middlesex Superior Court Plymouth Superior Court Worcester Superior Court
Bristol Superior Court Hampden Superior Court Essex Superior Court
Northern Berkshire District Court Milford District Court Concord District Court
Ayer District Court Lynn District Court Lowell District Court

Carey Guides:
The MPS has incorporated the use of Carey Guides as part of its ongoing commitment towards using Evidence-
Based Practices (EBP) in its work with probationers. The goal is to maximize EBP’s efficacy by providing probation
officers with the most current tools and knowledge to produce better outcomes for probationers. The Carey Guides
support probation officers’ efforts to promote positive, pro-social change by using targeted Cognitive Behavioral
Interventions. For behavior change and recidivism reduction to be possible, probationers must understand the
personal and environmental factors underlying their behavior and be taught the skills that they need to make
changes to their behavior that will produce positive outcomes. The Carey guides are designed to equip probation
officers with the tools they need to support these changes among their clients.
The Carey Guides include 33 handbooks, with 14 of the guides addressing criminogenic needs and 19 of the guides
focusing on case management issues and brief intervention tools (BITs). The Carey Guides are being used by more
than 500 agencies in 42 states and four countries; BITs are being used by 450 agencies in 34 states.
The are being implemented in three phases:
April 2023 - April 3, 2024 - October 4 -

DNA Collection
As part of the Criminal Justice Reform Act of 2018, the Massachusetts Probation Service (MPS) was required to
start collecting DNA from any person under probation supervision who was convicted of an offense that was
punishable by imprisonment in state prison, as well as certain youthful offenders. The MPS issued a revised DNA
Policy (Policy No. 02.02.07(a)) which details the intent, definitions, training requirements and procedures for
collection of a DNA sample. Below is the number of DNA samples that were collected in FY 2024.

Recognition
This fiscal year, Fitchburg District Court Probation Officer II Diamily Titus
received a Trial Court Excellence Award for excellence in service.
PO Titus emigrated from her birth country, Cuba, in hopes of establishing a
better life for her and her family. She entered the U.S. as a young adult
without the ability to speak English and did not understand the cultural
customs of her new community.
As a licensed alcohol & drug counselor and certified substance use
counselor, Titus is an active member of the MPS Substance Abuse
Committee that developed and facilitates a one-week training curriculum for
new probation officers. As a result of her expertise in substance use, she has
been appointed as one of the Specialty Court Probation Officers for the
Fitchburg District Drug Court since its inception in 2019.
Of Cuban decent, Titus is bilingual and communicates in Spanish and English
and connects culturally with the Latinx clients, victims, and court users. This
is an enormous asset in the Fitchburg community, where a large percentage
of residents have limited English proficiency.

Lynn Probation Officer Kelley Montgomery has helped probationers find their way
Lynn District Court Probation Officer Kelley Montgomery was
assigned to Recovery Court within 10 months of becoming a
Probation Officer more than two decades ago.
PO Montgomery said she has seen the attitude toward
addiction in the Lynn community and throughout the country
change to one that involves a "greater understanding that it
can affect anyone." She serves on the Recovery Court
presided by Lynn District First Justice Ina Howard-Hogan.
She is known and respected in the courts and community for
her patience and compassion for working with those in the
throes of addiction. Ms. Montgomery has also seen clients
she worked with turn their lives around more than once. She
said, however, probationers must "learn to surrender and trust
the fact" that they are in need of help and resources.
PO Montgomery said she often refers to a saying when
speaking to Recovery Court participants.
"We tell them, 'You've driven your car and you've done that for
a while. But now you've driven it into a ditch. Now, it is time to
let us help you get out of it,'" she said.

with something as simple as a trim. All of the
parents seemed beyond grateful,” Ms. Swift said.
“Growing up as a child of a single parent of three,
I know what it’s like to struggle. It was such a
pleasure to be a part of the community and give
back.”

Massachusetts Juvenile Probation: A Decade of Progress
For over a decade, Massachusetts Probation has made widespread efforts to drastically reduce and change the
make-up of youth on probation through a variety of initiatives. This section explains these measures and their
outcomes.
2016: Ohio Youth Assessment System
2018: Criminal Justice Reform Bill
2019: Graduated Sanctions & Incentives
2019: Administrative Hearing Policy
Juvenile Probation's first major undertaking within the decade was the implementation of the validated Ohio Risk
03
Assessment System (OYAS) which was first used in spring 2016. According to the OYAS final report, authored by
the University of Cincinnati in 2009, the assessment “was designed to assist juvenile justice professionals in
providing the most effective interventions for youth based on their likelihood to reoffend, their criminogenic needs,
and their barriers to services, while using the least restrictive alternative” (Latessa, Lovins, & Ostrowski, 2009).1
Administering the OYAS had a dramatic effect. It significantly altered and reduced the amount of supervision to
which the majority of youths were exposed. As can be observed in the chart on the next page, the number of
youths on high-risk probation decreased significantly - by 79% in just two years. Within the past decade, the decline
is even more staggering, a 92.7% decrease between 2015 and 2024, which represents nearly 800 youth who are no
longer on high-risk probation.
This is important because some research suggests that providing too much supervision to a low-risk youth can
have a negative impact by exposing them to higher risk youth and potentially disturbing pro-social networks
(Lowenkamp and Latessa 2004)2.
Along with assessing risk, the OYAS measures youths' needs, and targets identified criminogenic needs that are
shown to correlate with criminal behavior. Among the needs identified in the assessment are criminogenic
thoughts and attitudes, peer associations, social skills, and substance use. The last aspect to the OYAS is
responsivity, which means coordinating treatment approaches to the youth’s needs. Treatment must be focused in
a way where the juvenile can learn and develop new, improved behaviors.

The second measure to have an impact on the juvenile probation caseload was the passage of the Criminal
Justice Reform Bill in 2018. This was significant because it limited the number of juveniles who were ultimately
sentenced to probation. The Bill raised the minimum age of responsibility from seven to 12 years old, while minor
offenses – civil infractions and first offense misdemeanors with penalties under six months – can no longer be
found delinquent. Furthermore, disruptive behavior in school, such as disorderly conduct or disrupting school
assembly, can no longer be the subject of a delinquency finding. In addition, many more young people are eligible
for diversion, directing them away from the criminal justice system.
The last two measures, the implementation of sanctions and incentives and the enactment of the Administrative
Hearing Policy, both in 2019, worked in tandem to substantially improve supervision and make decisions more
uniform. Due to these initiatives, Probation’s violation notices, both delinquent and non-delinquent, significantly
decreased. Between FY 2018, the year before the two policies took effect, and FY 2024, total juvenile violations
decreased by 60.7%.
These policies have significantly reshaped the way Probation supervises juveniles. More time is now spent on
the front-end of cases, being proactive instead of reactive. More strategic, intentional supervision equates to less
violations, particularly in court, and frees up time to further improve practice. Probation Officers (POs) and their
supervisors now have the time and ability to strategize more effective responses to behavior.
The Graduated Response System presents alternatives to incarceration or home removal by providing other ways
to teach youth to respect rules. Research has demonstrated that an effective way to promote compliance and
encourage progress is to use incentives for good behaviors and sanctions for bad behaviors3.
With the passage of the Administrative Hearing Policy, if a juvenile is non-compliant with their conditions but
hasn't re-offended, instead of holding a Violation Hearing in court, Probation may choose to hold a less formal
Administrative Hearing instead. PO’s now respond to troublesome behavior in real time, using skills they’ve
learned through their considerable depth of experience, as well as through on-going evidence-based training. An
officer may decide to increase reporting, set firm deadlines, or offer referrals to address issues. The work that
the PO is investing in is responsive and in-depth. In this way, the behavior of the youth may improve without
needing any sort of disciplinary action. This new way of supervising involves more work for the supervisor and
PO, but it has helped keep scores of violations from ever entering a courtroom, which not only frees up time for
Probation and the Court, but is a great benefit to the youth.

Delinquent Non-Delinquent Both
The chart above shows the total number of juvenile violations by type – delinquency, non-delinquency, and both.
As noted above, the total decline in violations between FY 2018 – 2024 was 60.7%. A significant portion of this
decline was due to the reduction in non-delinquent violations, 73.5% between FY 2018 – 2024. Delinquent
violations also decreased, by 49%.
It is also important to consider the effect of the overall caseload on violations. It could be argued that the
reduction in juvenile cases played a role in the decline in violation notices. While this may be partially true, the total
decline in adjudicated probation cases, Risk/Need and Administrative, has decreased 40%. If Pretrial cases were
included in this total, the reduction would be 17.9%. In both scenarios, the reduction in total violation notices
overtook the decline in total cases.
The substantial drop in non-delinquent violations is very important to acknowledge because it shows that
Probation's efforts to decrease in-court violations, encourage pro-social behaviors, and support juvenile's success
while on supervision have largely been successful.

Care and Protection
In Care and Protection (C&P) cases, Probation Officers (PO) help the court by visiting with children who are not
living at home. If children are placed with a parent or someone else, the PO makes sure the custody orders are
being followed. PO’s also help with drug and alcohol screens. There are four levels of Care and Protection cases:

Children Requiring Assistance
Youth may be supervised by Probation due to a delinquency and/or status offense. Status offenders, who are
habitually truant from school, repeatedly fail to obey school rules, frequently run away from home, continually fail to
obey his or her parent or legal guardian, and/or children subjected to sexual exploitation are deemed Child
Requiring Assistance (CRA) cases, as defined in M.G.L. Chapter 119, Section 21. In these cases, applicants
including parents, guardians, school officials, or police request help from the Court to manage the oftentimes-
complex needs of the youth. Once an application is accepted, the youth can receive services through Probation.
Below is a chart showing the total monthly CRA cases.

for Juvenile Attendees were given the tools they needed to successfully handle a CRA petition from beginning to
Probation dismissal. The new CRA forms, developed by MPS and AOJC, were reviewed, as well as supervision
practices and how to best make written recommendations.
This workshop reviewed MGL, Ch. 119 Sec. 24 and Care & Protection Standards promulgated in March
OCP Standards 2014. This in-person session focused on the importance of the probation o cer's role in the process,
for Probation recognizing the correlation between a child's safety risk and level of supervision and also an overview of
Supervision Care the assignment process. The objectives of the training were for participants to have an understanding of
& Protection MGL CH 119 Sec.24 and the importance of probation's responsibilities/involvement under Care and
Cases Protection Standards, to recognize the correlation between a child's safety risk and level of probation
supervision, and to understand the initial case assignment process of C&P cases.
This mandatory training provided instruction on the Risk/Need Instrument (OYAS) and the corresponding
case management system. The two-day curriculum was designed to introduce the tool, develop pro ciency
in the instrument, reinforce skills and provide feedback/support through a booster session. Upon
OYAS completion, attendees should understand the principles of the risk-need responsivity model used in
Certi cation accessing and engaging correctional populations, conduct, with a high degree of accuracy, a juvenile risk-
need assessment using the Ohio Youth Assessment System (OYAS), and utilize relevant case management
system(s) to pro ciently record risk assessment information and applicable chronological notations in
accordance with probation supervision standards.
Court presentation, relevant case law, and general CRA related information were a few of the many topics

In the Community:
Memorial Day Community Service: On Saturday, May 25th, Barnstable County/Town of Plymouth Juvenile
Probation organized a community service event in collaboration with the Office of Community Corrections. ACPO
Janet MacFarlane, PO Caitlin Kourafas (Veteran's liaison for the division), and PO Chantal Morrison, along with
Robert Doherty, Assistant Court Service Coordinator from the Office of Community Corrections, accompanied a
group of juveniles to participate in the Memorial Day ceremonies at Bourne National Cemetery and placed flags at
graves of veterans and their families.
In June, Worcester Juvenile Probation invited youth-serving agencies, schools, and public entities to breakfast. The
agencies represented included: Worcester Public Schools, Motivating Youth Recovery (MYR), CASA, DCF, DYS,
Mass Rehabilitation Commission, Worcester Youth Center, CHOICES, Youth Villages, Open Sky, and Safe Homes.
The breakfast enabled the different agencies to share the mission of their organization, distribute materials for
referrals, network, and enjoy breakfast together. A non-violence pledge was signed by the agencies and, through
Worcester Youth Center, and all received t-shirts proclaiming "Violence is Not Normal" to bring awareness to the
conversation around youth violence.

Probate and Family Probation
Probate and Family Probation Officers provide service to litigants and families on contested Probate matters,
including providing dispute intervention services, performing court-ordered investigations, supervising compliance
with court orders, and completing case interventions.
Case Interventions
A case intervention is when a probation officer or associate probation officer performs a one-time specific task at
the direction of the court. Referrals for a case intervention are generally concise and task specific. Case
interventions are generally performed immediately.
The number of case interventions has increased each year since FY 2020. In total, over 14,000 more case
interventions were completed this year compared to five years ago, an increase of 44%.

Formal and Short-Term Investigations:
In an investigation, a probation officer gathers, assesses, and analyzes information to make recommendations to
the Court. There are two types of investigations, full and short term. In full investigations, probation officers
interview all relevant parties, including children as appropriate, conduct home visits, contact professional and non-
professional collateral sources, obtain records, periodically run offender records, and produce written reports with
recommendations. Referrals for full investigations require a minimum of 90 days to complete. Short-term
investigations are limited in scope, task specific, and may contain a recommendation if ordered by the court.

This fiscal year, funding was secured for Probation staff to attend the National Association of Conciliation Courts
(AFCC) Conference in June. In total, 24 Probate & Family (PF&) staff including Probation Officers, Assistant Chief
Probation Officers, and Chief Probation Officers attended. Employees also attended the local AFCC training in
March and the Massachusetts Association of Guardian Ad Litem (MAGAL) training in May. This last training was on
professional parenting time supervisors. Marguerite Riley, Statewide Supervisor for P&F Probation served as faculty
for the MAGAL training. In addition to the trainings below, a comprehensive multi-day training in dispute resolution
techniques was developed, which will be available in Fall, 2024. There will be two, five-day trainings and an
additional three, one-day refresher classes scheduled for early winter.

In the Community: Barnstable Probate & Family Probation celebrates
guardians and caregivers
Barnstable Probate & Family Court Probation staff celebrated the efforts of
guardians and caregivers of children in the Barnstable County area with a special
luncheon on June 4th. Guardianship of a minor is a legal process that gives the
guardian authority to care for and to make decisions on behalf of a child. The idea
for the luncheon was introduced by Barnstable County Probate & Family
Probation Officer Amie Evans, who was raised by her own grandparents. “The
idea of providing appreciation and support to our guardianship community is near
and dear to me,” Ms. Evans said. In Massachusetts, there are more than 30,000
grandparents who are raising their children’s children with nearly one-third of
these grandparents being responsible for grandchildren with no parent present in
their lives, according to a study conducted by ForHealth Consulting at UMass
Barnstable County Probate &
Chan Medical School.

Story Hour with Norfolk Probate and Family Court:
On May 23rd, the Norfolk County Probate and Family Court
had the opportunity to spend time with the first grade
students at the Luce Elementary School in Canton, MA.
The Probation team, as well as First Justice Patricia Gorman
and Judicial Case Manager Kim LaDue, read stories and
passed out crayons, markers, and a book to each of the 90
students in attendance. The children enjoyed themselves
immensely and asked, “if we would come again when they
were in the second grade.”
Probation Officer Scott Goldberg was such a hit with the
students that they invited him to attend their field trip the
following day at the zoo. It was a great day for both the court
staff and the students alike.

Advocacy Center (CAC) to provide a local education training to probation staff, AJCMs, and session clerks to learn
about the CAC model in recognizing and responding to child abuse and commercial sexual exploitation of children.
The Plymouth Probate Probation Department hosted a luncheon after the training and later received a tour of the
Plymouth County CAC and delivered back-to-school supplies.

Pretrial Services
The Massachusetts Probation Service’s (MPS) Pretrial Services Division (PSD) strives to establish a system of
broad-based collaborative partnerships that include the court, criminal justice agencies, and community service
providers and to enable a set of comprehensive policies, guidelines, and practices to improve pretrial services
throughout the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. By collaborating with such agencies, the Pretrial Services
Division aims to assist with the minimization of unnecessary pretrial detention through a wide-ranging system of
pretrial services.
MassHealth Initiative
The Pretrial Services Division’s MassHealth initiative aims to close the healthcare coverage gap for the pretrial population
and post-dispositional probationers. This initiative will make it easier to link court users with mental health treatment and
medical services by eliminating any barrier the lack of health care coverage presents. This initiative will also provide
justices with alternatives to pretrial detention by providing pretrial defendants with treatment options they can engage in
while remaining in their communities during the pendency of their criminal case. Enrollment in MassHealth and the
Massachusetts Health Connector will also help expand healthcare coverage for the families of justice-involved individuals
by improving their access to healthcare to address their own physical and emotional health and well-being.
Healthcare also plays a vital role in executing evidence-based practices with justice-involved individuals. Probation
Officers complete actuarial assessments and create case plans with post-disposition, justice-involved individuals that
focus on the individual’s criminogenic needs and responsivity concerns. Case planning fosters positive behavior changes,
and access to health insurance ensures that individuals have access to vital substance use and mental health treatment,
prescriptions, and preventative medical care. The MPS addressing these issues ultimately impacts public safety and
reduces barriers for all justice-involved individuals.
The long-term goal of this initiative is to create lasting positive and sustainable change amongst all justice-involved
individuals, especially with our pretrial population, by providing individuals with direct assistance when applying for or
renewing their MassHealth or Health Connector benefits.
In FY 2024, Pretrial Services worked with 587 referrals and assisted 371 individuals. Below is how they helped
participants with their health insurance.

Text Messaging
As part of the Criminal Justice Reform Act of 2018, the PSD was tasked with developing programs in coordination
with the Massachusetts Trial Court and other criminal justice agencies to minimize unnecessary pretrial
detention. The Act required that one initiative focus on developing a program that would notify and remind
defendants of court appearance obligations to reduce the risk of accidental defaults. In 2020, the PSD
collaborated with the Massachusetts Trial Court’s Information Technology Division (IT) to launch its first-ever
Interactive Text Response (ITR) program, an automated notification system within the Trial Court’s electronic
case management system, MassCourts, operated by Equivant.
The ITR program allows court staff to enter the party’s cell phone information into MassCourts and enroll the
party in a text messaging workflow based on events. Specific events trigger ITR; each court department identified
a list of events that would be part of the program. These events were added to the ITR Event Group. When an
event is scheduled and is part of the ITR Event Group, a text reminder is sent to the party with information
regarding their case number, the event date, and event time. Two reminders are sent; a reminder is sent four days
prior and one day before the court event. This proactive approach aims to reduce the instances of missed court
appearances, ensuring a more efficient legal system.
When the program began, it was only available for criminal events in the District, Superior, and Boston Municipal
Court (BMC) Departments. In May 2021, the program expanded to the Probate & Family, Juvenile, and Housing
Court Departments. In April 2023, the ITR program expanded to civil events in the District, BMC, and Superior
Court Departments. The Probate and Family Court Department also increased the number of events included in
the ITR program.

BRAVO-M
The Brief Risk Appraisal for Violent Offending - Massachusetts' version (BRAVO-M) was developed to assess and
manage the violence risk of offenders facing sentencing in the criminal justice system by UMass Chan Medical
School and Protect International - Risk and Safety Services. It is a brief structured professional judgment
guideline based on research, supported by best practices, and acceptable for offering guidance at the
presentencing stage.
The BRAVO-M guide assists probation officers with identifying relevant risk factors during presentence
investigations for individuals awaiting sentencing and recommending risk management strategies to prevent
violence. Those strategies will then be incorporated into the probation officer’s recommendations for conditions
of probation. The goal is to recommend probation conditions tailored to the individual’s specific needs and risks
to promote compliance and the successful completion of their probationary term.
The BRAVO-M guide breaks down the appraisal process into four steps: case information, rating the presence
and relevance of risk factors, identifying primary concerns about violence risk, and suggesting case management
and probation conditions. Suffolk Superior Court began piloting the BRAVO-M in February of 2024. By the close of
FY 2024, Suffolk Superior Court Justices had ordered six presentencing investigations be conducted via the
BRAVO-M guide. The pilot will continue in Suffolk Superior Court into FY 2025.

Willful Flight: Shifting Policy & Culture
In April, the Pretrial Justice Institute selected the Boston Municipal Court Department and the Pretrial Services
Division to pilot their Bureau of Justice Assistance funded project, Willful Flight: Shifting Policy and Culture. The
project will include the creation of a committee of stakeholders to develop a willful flight standard and policy
that takes into account why individuals may miss court appearances as opposed to the presumption that they
purposefully miss court appearances to evade prosecution, through the creation of tools and systems of
communication and assessment that considers all stakeholder roles and responsibilities. The standard and
policy will be tested at initial bail decisions to determine its impact on pretrial release rates, court appearances,
flight from prosecution, and a new criminal activity while on pretrial release. The committee will be formed and
begin its work during the first half of FY 2025.

Office of Community Corrections (OCC)
The Office of Community Corrections is a department within the MPS that was statutorily established to provide
alternatives to jail and prison. The two major initiatives of the OCC are the Community Justice Support Centers
and the Community Service Program.
Community Justice Support Centers (CJSC)
Community Justice Support Centers provide services and support to people in the criminal justice system.
Support Centers help clients get treatment for substance use disorders (SUD), develop decision making skills,
identify career opportunities, further their education, and make connections to the community. Research shows
that programs focused on these need areas keep communities safe at a lower cost than jail and prison.
Services include:
● Cognitive Behavioral Treatment to address decision making and SUD
● Education such as GED/HiSET and college preparation, life skills, financial literacy, and computer
and technology basics
● Career counseling to develop resumes, training opportunities, and resources to pursue a career
Admissions by Supervising Agency: FY 2024
Typically, CJSC attendance is ordered

Behavioral Health Initiative for Justice Involved
Behavioral Health Supports for Individuals with Justice Involvement (BH-JI) started through a partnership
between the Massachusetts Office of Medicaid, MassHealth, and the Massachusetts Executive Office of the
Trial Court. It is based on other re-entry programs in Massachusetts and across the country.
BH-JI was developed with the Massachusetts Parole Board, the Massachusetts Department of Corrections,
Middlesex Sheriff’s Office, Worcester County Sheriff’s Office, and a range of other groups. Advice from the
Council of State Governments—drawn from the Massachusetts Justice Reinvestment Working Group—and
project support from UMass Chan Medical School’s ForHealth Consulting also helped with the development of
BH-JI.
In 2019, MassHealth began a state-funded demonstration to provide behavioral health supports for justice
involved individuals in Middlesex and Worcester counties. In 2021, the Executive Office of Health and Human
Services (EOHHS) put out a request for responses from organizations that would go on to provide BH-JI
supports statewide for justice-involved MassHealth-eligible individuals. MassHealth requested permission to
launch similar community supports for members enrolled in MassHealth managed care, in what became the
Community Support Program for Individuals with Justice Involvement (CSP-JI). CSP-JI services became
effective September 1, 2022 and are now available for MassHealth Standard, CarePlus, and Fee-for-Service.
Between September 2019 to June 2023, 4,950 individuals were referred to BH-JI, and 26% of this population
were Probation referrals.
Participant Data:
21% Are Black or African American More than one quarter have a severe disability
18% are of Hispanic or Latino Origin Over 50% have a diagnosis for alcohol use disorder

Statewide Substance Use Services
The Massachusetts Probation Service performs drug and alcohol testing as ordered by the court in a safe,
sanitary, and respectful fashion. Probation performs or requests appropriate confirmation testing and responds
to positive test results and attempts to defeat testing. Probation strives to create a uniform, best practice
approach to substance testing, while promoting equal access to justice through transparency and procedural
fairness.
In FY 2024, MPS and the Community Justice Support Centers performed 170,848 drug screens, with a total
positive rate of 34% (n=58,486). Below is the rate of positive tests by drug type.

Recovery Courts
Recovery Courts provide intensive, supervised probation and mandatory treatment, as well as random drug testing
with progress monitored by a supervising probation officer. The court works with treatment providers, who provide
clinical assessments, develop and monitor treatment placements, and identify ancillary counseling, case
management, and outreach services (mass.gov).
Massachusetts currently has 31 Adult Recovery Courts. The map below shows the towns and cities served by
recovery courts (in yellow). They are: Attleboro, Barnstable, Brockton, Cambridge, Charlestown, Chelsea, Dorchester,

Women’s Recovery Court Session Celebrates Sobriety and Community
Group photo of all Women's Recovery Court session attendees.
The Women’s Recovery Court Session was a day of celebration, testimony, and empowerment. It was a day when
more than 200 women came together to provide encouragement and support or to share their stories of the
challenge and triumph in the sobriety journey. The theme was “Empowering Women In Recovery: A Day of
Celebration,” presented by Malden District Court Probation and the Massachusetts Trial Court.
Malden District Court First Justice Emily Karstetter welcomed the audience and shared that Malden District Court
has a woman first justice, clerk magistrate, and chief probation officer. "It is not without its challenges for us to
have gotten here. Those challenges pale in comparison to the challenges of you in this room," Judge Karstetter
said to the audience's applause.
Malden District Court Assistant Chief Probation Officer Judith Lawler, one of the founders of the session, thanked
attendees, "Welcome to the Women's Recovery Court Session. You showed up!" Ms. Lawler told the audience that
11 years ago when the first session was held in Chelsea, "Ten women showed up."
Wareham Recovery Court Celebrates New Graduates
On November 28, 2023, the
Wareham Recovery Court
acknowledged and celebrated
five Recovery Court graduates on
their successful completion of
the Wareham Recovery Court
Program. All of the graduates
completed the 4 phases of the
Wareham Recovery Court
Program.
Every graduate shared a piece of their unique story to those attending the graduation. It was evident that this class
of graduates was grateful of the support provided by the Recovery Court team, as well as the community providers
and agencies that they interacted with. This class of Recovery Court graduates appeared to have a special bond as
they traveled the road to recovery together within the Wareham Recovery Court Program and graduated on this day.
Each graduate in their own way, expressed how they have been able to uplift and support one another and hopes
that this support will continue to be present as they move forward in their recovery journey.

Reentry Housing
The mission of reentry housing is to create housing opportunities which offer supportive services to those who are
reintegrating into the community or struggling with homelessness and to address the underlying causes. It is also
our goal to build upon existing community resources to successfully engage individuals who are in need and at risk
through a partnership with an array of private agencies.
MPS’ Reentry Program, in collaboration with the Massachusetts Parole Board, offered one of the largest supplies of
transitional bed housing in the state. This year was particularly difficult because of the increase in homelessness
among individuals exiting jail and other institutions, according to Jill Forbes, MPS’ Statewide Manager of Reentry.
Roughly 3,200 sober home beds were funded by Probation Partnership and Project NORTH grants. There was an
average of 265 participants being supported in sober houses from Probation and Project NORTH each month.
According to MPS data, 360 participants were provided transitional housing support. This year, MPS extended
housing past the six-month mark due to a rise in homelessness among individuals leaving jail or other institutions.
Fifty clients who were homeless or at the risk of homelessness this past year were provided housing which offered
immediate and emergency beds in Boston, New Bedford, and West Springfield.

Research
The Research Department oversees all data collection and analysis for the five court departments served by the
Commissioner of Probation and provides regular data analysis for caseload metrics and monthly reporting.
Caseload data, including FY 2024 data, is reported by each court monthly, and then displayed through public
tableau dashboards, which can be found at Profile - mpsresearchdept | Tableau Public.
Data in the dashboards include monthly caseload and trend dashboards for the Superior, District, BMC, and
Juvenile Courts, an additional non-delinquency dashboard for the Juvenile Court, and a Dispute Intervention
Dashboard, an Investigation Trends Dashboard, and a Monthly Caseload Dashboard for the Probate and Family
Court.

Compliance Credits
Beginning in 2020, under Mass. General Laws, c.276 § 87B, a
probationer may be eligible for Compliance Credits, which reduce
the length of post-disposition probation supervision. To be
eligible, the probationer’s sentence must include incarceration,
followed by a term of probation supervision upon conviction of
one or more criminal offenses. The offender's probation
supervision must begin after 1/13/2019, and because
compliance credit accrual only begins on the second year of
supervision, the length of probation must be thirteen months or
greater. Probationers who are under post-disposition supervision
for a sex offense as defined in section 178C of chapter 6 are not
eligible.
If a probationer is eligible, they receive five days off their
probation sentence for each month they are in compliance during
their second year of supervision, and ten days off their probation
sentence for each month they are in compliance after their
second year of supervision. Accrual of credits is incremental,
meaning that the number of credits deducted is gradually, over
time. The total number of months sentenced to probation does
not dictate the amount of time the probationer may deduct from
their sentence, only the number of months they are in
compliance. If a probationer is found in violation of probation,
they do not earn any credits for the time they were in violation.
The Research Department is responsible for the identification,
calculation, and overall tracking of Compliance Credits statewide.
At any given time, over 3,000 probationers are being tracked.
While local courts are responsible for identifying eligible cases,
Research works with the field to confirm eligibility, recalculate
end dates based on non-compliance, and conduct periodic
reviews of compliance credit eligibility rates, as well as case
closure rates.
The Department works with the Legal Unit on complex eligibility
issues and travels throughout the state to offer compliance credit
trainings.

The Massachusetts Probation Service Research Department undertakes various projects to support those in
the field. Their mission is to enhance data-driven decision-making and support the development of effective
strategies to improve probation outcomes.
The data initiatives they engage in inform policy and reflect the current state of programming within MPS.
These projects address topics of interest within each Probation Department and aim to promote evidence-
based practices. Additionally, these initiatives can require the research team to collaborate with other internal
units or outside agencies.

Victim Service Unit
The Massachusetts Probation Service’s Victim Services Unit (VSU) is dedicated to providing victims and survivors
of crime with notification, information, and assistance throughout the probationary period. The VSU provides
assistance with safety planning, referrals to appropriate resources, court accompaniment, and crisis intervention.
The VSU is committed to delivering services to victims and survivors of crime in a trauma-informed manner that
addresses the devastating and long-lasting impacts of crime. The VSU works diligently to address victims and
survivors’ questions and concerns, in addition to ensuring their rights are met under the Victim Bill of Rights (M.G.L.
Chapter 258B, Section B).
The VSU collaborates with probation officers, court personnel, post-conviction agencies, prosecutors, advocates,
law enforcement, and victim service organizations to ensure coordinated and seamless service delivery.
VSU Objectives:
Increase knowledge, skills or competency of the VSU staff
Maintain strong relationships with other service providers
Assist client/victim involvement in the criminal legal system
Provide client/victim with information to engage in the criminal justice system
Enhance the safety of client/victims
Reduce trauma symptoms of victims of crimes who are engaged in mental health services
System-wide access to justice and language implementation initiatives:
The Victim Services Unit continues to make great strides in assisting victims and survivors of crimes who are non-
English speakers. Corinn Crowninshield, the statewide manager of VSU, spoke on El Mundo's daily morning online
show "El Hora de Café." During the interview, she discussed the collaboration between Victim Services and the Trial
Court's Office of Language Access (OLA) to provide on-demand interpreter services for victims and survivors of
crime in 20 different languages.

Domestic Violence High Risk Team (DVHRTs)
DVHRTs are multi-disciplinary teams with membership from a broad spectrum of agencies who work with
victims, survivors, and offenders. The teams are focused equally on promoting victim safety and offender
accountability. Team members share information on high-risk cases to create individualized intervention
plans, provide ongoing risk management, track case dispositions, and promote victim safety. They also
work together to leverage all possible safety options for victims at highest risk. In FY 2024, the MA
Probation Service Victim Services Unit participated within 29 different teams within all counties in the
Commonwealth.
In FY 2024, the staff participated in the following:
Governors Council to Address Sexual Assault, Domestic Violence and Human Tra cking – appointed
member
Justice-Involved Women Panel – appointed member
Domestic Violence Fatality Review, State Team – appointed member
Supreme Judicial Court Committee on Restorative Justice – appointed member

Kindness Rocks
The Massachusetts Probation Service Training and
Operations Center (MTOC) hosted a Kindness Rocks
Workshop in honor of Victim Rights Month and Sexual
Assault Awareness Month in April. MPS staff
participated in the workshop led by Megan Murphy, the
creator of the widely successful Kindness Rocks Project.
Ms. Murphy led the exercise of how to look within
yourself to paint a message that may be meaningful to
the person who sees it. Kindness Rocks cultivate hope, a
message that you personally need and sending it to
others hoping it means something to them.
"The Kindness Rock workshop reminded all of us that one message at the right time can change someone’s day or
life," said Corinn Nelson, Statewide Manager of the Victim Services Unit (VSU). "Painting the rocks was an exercise
in reflection, self-compassion and recognizing the shared emotions in all of us. It was an uplifting and fun
afternoon where everyone could let their thoughts and creativity shine."

In the Community: Project PACK
Assistant Statewide Manager of Victim Services Courtney Bacon, Statewide Manager of the Victim Services Unit Corinn Crowninshield,
Victim Services Coordinators Zoe Nardone and Cara Greblick, Commissioner of Probation Pamerson Ifill, Victim Services Coordinators Mary
Nugent, Keira Hom, Erin Beech, Abigail Ford, Lindsey Maxwell, Tara Howard, and Jennifer Scott.
In April, the Victim Service Unit’s Project PACK drive collected hundreds of items which were donated to local
hospitals and provided to patients who are victims of crime. Twenty courts across the state and the
Massachusetts Probation Service Training & Operations Center (MTOC) served as collection sites.
Project PACK is a nonprofit organization that donates Post Assault Comfort kits to hospitals which then
provide them to sexual assault victims. The kits contain socks, undergarments, tissues, and toiletries such as
toothbrushes, toothpaste, lotion, and deodorant.
“I am so very thankful to our amazing staff who participated in the Project PACK drive to honor April as Sexual
Assault Awareness Month and Victim Rights Month. We donated items to victims and survivors to use during
one of the most challenging times of their lives. The MPS staff continues to make a difference in the lives of
victims and survivors of crime,” said Corinn Crowninshield, VSU Statewide Manager.
Recognition:
This year, Jennifer Scott, a Victim Services Coordinator in western
Massachusetts, was recognized for her decade of service in victim
advocacy.
“Jennifer Scott is an amazing advocate. She is one of our newest
coordinators and comes to us after years of service as a SafePlan
advocate. Her work has had a strong impact on victims and survivors,”
said Corinn Crowninshield, Statewide Manager of Victim Services.
Ms. Scott was honored virtually during a social media campaign
conducted by the Massachusetts Office of Victim Assistance (MOVA).
Ms. Scott began working as a SAFEPLAN advocate in western
Massachusetts in 2011.

Electronic Monitoring (ELMO)
The Massachusetts Probation Service’s (MPS) Electronic Monitoring (ELMO) Program was first established in April
2001 as an alternative to incarceration and to provide structure, control, and accountability for probationers who
were sentenced to house arrest by a judge. The program also provides an extra layer of supervision, with the goal
of improving public safety in the community.
The two tools ELMO uses to monitor clients are GPS and remote breath alcohol monitoring devices. A person is put
on GPS monitoring and/or remote breath alcohol monitoring after a judicial order, or an order by the Parole Board
or Department of Corrections (DOC). GPS devices are used to enforce court-mandated curfews and court orders,
including house arrest. Remote breath alcohol monitoring devices are used to monitor people who are court-
ordered to remain alcohol-free. The ELMO Unit collaborates with supervising officers throughout the state to
monitor clients.
The Electronic Monitoring (ELMO) Unit’s mission is to use technology as a tool for monitoring probationers,
parolees, inmates, and litigants (clients). ELMO provides structure and accountability, with the goal of changing
behavior, ensuring compliance with court orders, enhancing public safety in the community, and reducing
recidivism. Providing support to our stakeholders is our primary objective.
Secure Continuous Remote Alcohol Monitoring (SCRAM)
The MPS currently uses SCRAM (Secure Continuous Remote Alcohol Monitoring) remote breath device. The
SCRAM remote breath device is a handheld, wireless unit that provides an accurate and efficient way to supervise
people who are court-ordered to stay alcohol-free. The device delivers real-time access to a client’s breath alcohol
test results by pinpointing the GPS location within six feet and using advanced Automated Facial Intelligence (AFI)
software as it photographs the client breathing into a tube to test their breath alcohol concentration (BrAC).
The ELMO Unit staff monitors breath alcohol test results and responds to missed and positive alcohol tests. Clients
ordered on the SCRAM remote breath device are typically tested for alcohol multiple times per day. Daily testing
schedules, guided by court orders, are developed by supervising officers. In addition to fixed scheduled testing, the
SCRAM remote breath device can do random and on-demand testing. If a client fails to take his/her scheduled test
or tests positive for alcohol, an alert is generated to immediately notify the ELMO Unit. Violations are handled by the
same warrant protocol that applies to GPS monitoring.

Exclusion Zones
Exclusion zones are geographical areas from which a person is excluded from entering (e.g. a victim’s residence, schools,
parks, or playgrounds). If the GPS tracking device enters an exclusion zone, an immediate alert is generated. Next, ELMO
staff verify that the zone is in the proper location and check all GPS points. The client is then contacted and advised to
leave the location. If the client is a sex offender, the local police department is notified that the client traveled into the
zone. In addition, depending on the time of day, either the supervising probation officer or their supervisor will be
informed as well. Alerts may be escalated to the Warrant Management Unit for further review.
In June 2024, on any day there were over 3,000 different exclusion zones being monitored by the ELMO Unit. Exclusion
zones can vary - a zone may be a victim's residence, an entire city, town, or even a county. Exclusion zones include
restaurants, shopping malls, parks, colleges, and hospitals. To protect victims, a distribution of types of zones was not
included.
In FY 2024, a little over half of all GPS clients had an exclusion zone order (51.1%). On average, a GPS client has roughly
two exclusion zones.
The chart below shows the impact victims have on exclusion zones as part of their GPS monitoring. The data, taken from
June 2024, shows that while on average roughly half of all GPS cases include exclusion zones, this rate increases to

ELMO Phone Calls, FY 2024:
Communication is an integral part of monitoring individuals on GPS. Comprised of 70 employees, ELMO staff
monitor an average of 5,200 clients daily - 3,645 on GPS and an additional 1,575 on SCRAM. A lot of this
communication is through daily phone calls. Staff must regularly communicate with court personnel from
Probation, other law enforcement personnel, and clients on electronic monitoring regarding a myriad of different
matters regarding electronic monitoring. Courts often call with questions about equipment, installations and
removals, along with general inquiries. Clients often call about alerts. Furthermore, law enforcement call about
general monitoring questions and sometimes information requests/point tracking, most often if there is an
emergency situation.

FY 2024 After Hours Program
Recognizing the need and benefit of accommodating probationers and/or defendant outside of traditional court
hours and locations, in April 2019, the Massachusetts Probation Service established a voluntary after hour
program to increase the availability and ease-of-access of after-hours equipment resolution and DNA sampling.
Currently, there is an after-hour center in each region of Massachusetts. The centers are open between 8:00 and
noon on weekends and early evenings on weekdays. To access the centers, ELMO schedules appointments with
the clients depending upon their need and location.
In FY 2024, Probation Officer IIs completed 352 jobs at after-hours sites. After hour shift assignments include the
installation, maintenance, and support of electronic monitoring and/or remote breath monitoring equipment. This
may include replacing lost or non-functioning GPS chargers, re-strapping clients with new bracelets, and
swapping out equipment.

Within the past year, the Warrant Management Unit has worked diligently to decrease the number of warrants
issued on clients on GPS and remote alcohol monitoring. To decrease warrants issued, the department has
strengthened communication and collaboration with clients by using technological resources such as FaceTime
and WhatsApp to clarify equipment issues and better understand problems regarding alerts. These tools help the
unit work with the client to improve behavior and ultimately issue less warrants.
A good example of these resources in use would be for a strap alert. By FaceTiming the client, the WMU may get a
better appreciation of the issues regarding the strap alert, understand if the client is at fault, and recommend
solutions to avoid issuing a warrant.
Warrants for charge and straps have seen significant reductions within the past year, contributing to the overall
decline in warrants by 35.5%.

Rescinded Warrants
There are times when, once a warrant is issued, new details or facts may emerge and/or the probationer has
come into compliance, and the warrant is not suitable. When this happens, the WMU has a process in place
where First Deputy Commissioner Fasano is contacted and provided with the details or facts to determine
whether the warrant should be rescinded.
The ability to rescind a warrant is important because it demonstrates that there are safeguards in place
afterhours for probationers, as well as accountability on Probation's behalf.
Massachusetts Probation takes the rescinding of warrants very seriously and has strived to reduce the number
of occurrences by refining and enhancing the warrant process.
Improvements in this process are reflected not only through the decline of total warrants issued, but also in the
number of warrants rescinded. Since FY 2018, the total number of warrants rescinded has decreased by 78%.
In FY 2024, out of 4,097 warrants, only ten (.244%) of warrants were rescinded.

Digital Forensic Services
Digital Forensic Services (DFS) was founded in the spring of 2023 with the mission to enhance the utilization of
technology among individuals under probation supervision. DFS is dedicated to implementing evidence-based
monitoring practices, particularly in cases involving sex offenders. By adhering to industry-leading tools and
standards, DFS ensures the thorough analysis and interpretation of digital evidence to support the supervision
process.
Matthew Murphy, the new statewide manager of digital forensics
services, joined the Probation Service in May after more than 29 years
with the Massachusetts State Police, 25 of those working in Digital
Forensics Investigation with assignments in the High Tech and
Computer Crimes Division of the Attorney General’s Office, the Cyber
Enforcement Unit at the Middlesex District Attorney’s Office, and the
Unit Commander of the State Policy Cyber Crime Unit. He and a new
team of forensic examiners will provide effective, evidence-based
monitoring of the electronic devices used by probationers pursuant to
court-ordered search conditions.
Essential hardware and software tools were procured to investigate
and analyze electronic devices, such as cell phones and computers.
This will assist probation officers with their checks and oversight of
probationers who are not allowed to contact people or access certain
sites on their devices. The tools will allow the department to
forensically examine their devices to determine if they are in
compliance with their special conditions.
The department was cultivated using a phased implementation that included meetings with the new examiners
and probation officers in the field to discuss case management and digital tool utilization, as well as the
purchasing of digital screening tools. With this, when multiple probationers are at a courthouse, a DFS team
member can travel there and forensically check their devices to make sure they are in compliance.

Information Services Division (ISD)
The Information Services Division works collaboratively to bridge the gap between the status quo and overarching
strategic planning goals and priorities via: (1) the deployment and support of technology tools and resources, (2)
responsible project management, (3) high-quality data analytics, and (4) strategic planning oversight. This diverse
team maintains a deep understanding and appreciation for the complexities of probation work and the many
business processes driven by data and supported by people, passion and partnership. Team members regularly
engage in training and certification opportunities to remain current with a wide-scope of project management
modalities. Among the projects ISD worked on in FY 2024:

Departmental Profile
Recognizing that the success of the Massachusetts Probation Service (MPS) in improving outcomes for
probationers depends on a well‐trained and highly professional workforce, the MPS Training Division is
committed to providing a culture of positive change through a collaborative model of education and
development opportunities to nearly 1,850 staff. Informed by national initiatives and grounded in best
practices, the MPS Training Division fosters a continuous learning environment that is responsive to the
needs of probation staff and the diverse communities we serve. The MPS Training Division is a resource that
inspires, motivates, and, consistent with our overarching strategic plan, develops tomorrow’s probation
talent.
Core Responsibilities
Training and development focuses on continuous improvement and serves, among other purposes, to tether
our more than 100 probation departments and administrative units together. It is the intention of the MPS
Training Division to meaningfully support probation staff in sharing and building upon our culture of
excellence by providing equitable opportunity for professional development through the delivery of evidence-
based, high‐quality training programs and informational resources. Opportunities for professional
development may consist of local education, mandatory and elective instructor‐led training programs, remote
eLearning content, video training, material training, and approved external conferences. Furthering our
commitment to professional development, the MPS Training Division is pleased to offer limited scholarship
dollars to support approved external professional development opportunities aligned with our organizational
mission and vision. The MPS Training Division delivers nearly 300 instructor led training sessions annually
with nearly forty‐percent delivered off‐site at remote locations throughout the Commonwealth.
79
MPS Training Model
The MPS Training Division has embraced a model of program development and delivery that taps into the
vast talent and knowledge of our workforce with a competitive practice of training trainers to deliver
programs. This results in direct engagement of our staff while building institutional capacity for offering
programs that are responsive to the continuing, changing needs of the field. Instructor and Subject Matter
Experts call outs begin a process of development that allows staff to self‐select which opportunities align
with their professional goals and interests, resulting in low instructor attrition.
The MPS Training Division develops comprehensive curriculum that goes beyond individual training
programs. While traditional trainings tend to be of the ‘one and done’ variety, the MPS Training Division
promotes more integrated experiences resulting in application of the knowledge skills and ability learned in
more traditional settings. Resources, local application and coaching, in services, bring‐backs, booster
sessions, and performance measures all play a role in their totality of experiences.
Experiential learning also plays a role in a comprehensive curriculum model. For example, programs and
modules such as ‘A Day in the Life’ and ‘Beyond Probation’ expose staff to the work of probation departments
outside their own and partner agencies through discussion panels, facility tours, and guided discussions.
In addition to managing training and development across our organization, the MPS Training Division
provides logistical and technical support to the field as well as a wide scope of internal and external partners
holding regular meetings at the MPS Training and Operations Center. Furthermore, the MPS Training Division
is heavily engaged in managing statewide initiatives and curriculum development committees.
FY 2024, Training Throughout This Report
In FY 2024, the Training Department was responsible for 489 training sessions, totaling over 7,150 hours. The
extensiveness, variety, and value of trainings can be seen throughout this report. The material and training
most applicable to each department is featured under each division. Presenting the number of trainings
relevant to each area demonstrates how much Probation and its employees rely on and are supported by the
Training Department through on-going education, communication, and support.

Substance use disorder is prevalent within the Massachusetts Probation population. Risk Need probationers
assessed with the Ohio Risk Assessment System (ORAS) show that 64.4% have used illegal drugs, while 43.7% of
probationers have or had problems caused by drug use. Therefore, it is important that those supervising
probationers understand key concepts and ideas regarding substance use in order to support and help them in the
best ways. In FY 2024, the following trainings were provided to educate probation employees about substance use
disorder.
Training Description
Participants were introduced to fundamental addiction issues and their impact on Probation. Biological

Diversity, Equity and Inclusion
Pledge to DEI: In our ongoing commitment to uphold diversity, equity, inclusion, unity, equality,
and peace, we pledge:
To Engage in Learning - We listen, engage in thoughtful dialog, and share educational and developmental platforms for
MPS staff, one another, and community, so we may support ourselves in raising our awareness and understanding
about equality, justice, and inclusivity.
To Cultivate a Safe Sanctuary- We cultivate a department culture that embraces people of all color, faiths, gender,
partnerships, experiences, and capacities, where we foster a kind and caring environment that is safe, judgment-free,
and protected, holding ourselves responsible for honoring all as unique individuals.
To Advocate for Diversity - We embody our core principles of diversity and inclusion by actively collaborating with all
MPS staff, embracing all faiths, all cultures, and all partnerships, empowering ourselves to expand our knowledge, and
allocating resources for promoting diversity.
To Be Accountable - We are vigilant in analyzing our processes, examining our content, imagery, words, and actions to
be aligned with our core principles. We are taking accountability for our division and calling ourselves out if we are not
following our own commitment to be the change we seek.
While the Training Department regularly incorporates the values and principles of DEI, ensuring a framework that
supports the full and fair participation of all employees, there were special programs created that focused
specifically on the importance of DEI topics, among them in FY 2024:

This training was an adaptation from previous sessions offered by Maebright Group LLC. As people
are becoming more aware of LGBTQIA+ identities, it can often feel like unfamiliar terrain for some.
This training provided an overview of concepts and terms to understand the diverse array of
LGBTQIA+ identities, experiences, and cultures. We discussed the components, nuances, and
differences between sexual orientation, gender identity, and gender expression. We also paid
special attention to transgender, including non-binary, identities, as trans experiences may be newer

to some training attendees. This training also offered an understanding of what disparities in health,
People in Probation
wellness, and access look like for LGBTQIA+ people, as well as better practices for creating a
respectful, supportive environment for working with LGBTQIA+ people in a probation setting.
Objectives of this training were to integrate training curricula to better manage the identities of
probation-involved parties, have attendees gain familiarity with rules, policies and procedures
applicable to CARI and DCJIS, and expertly navigate the MassCourts application with a high degree
of e ciency.

Second Annual MPS Pride Day celebrates LGBTQIA+ community and its history
This second annual celebration, hosted
by the Massachusetts Probation
Service’s Training Division, took place
June 17th at the Massachusetts
Probation Service Training and
Operations Center (MTOC) in Clinton.
First Deputy Commissioner Dianne
Fasano, members of MPS’ LGBTQIA+
Instructors, and MPS’ Training Team
kicked off the day’s activities. James
Shultis of the Massachusetts
Commission on LGBTQ Youth shared
information, terms, and data about
young people who identify as
LGBTQIA+ in the Commonwealth. The
event was open to the Clinton
community. Kneeling, left to right: Kristin Scribner, Training Services Operations Coordinator, and

"We were excited to host MPS' Pride Day Celebration and learn about all of the important contributions and history
of the LGBTQIA+ community as well as hear the poignant stories of the current generation. MPS is committed to
hosting this informative and fun annual event and building on it each year," said First Deputy Commissioner Dianne
Fasano.
Guest speakers—mother and daughter duo: Samantha and Irene Brank—spoke about life as a transgender youth
and a mother’s story of support and challenges. Attendees played Pride trivia and decorated postcards, adding
words of encouragement and support, which will be delivered to Massachusetts LGBTQIA+ organizations.
As guests entered MTOC, they found a space decorated with the rainbow colors of the LGBTQIA+ community,
including welcoming flags, balloons, and painted stones with the word “PRIDE” along the walkway. A pop-up photo
booth with the words “MPS Has Pride“ was set up for attendees to chronicle the day.
"Having our community of Clinton take part in our event this year was such a great addition. I am really looking
forward to future Pride events where we can continue to show our support to the LGBTQIA+ community," said Ms.
Grady.
The day ended with a recording of Harvey Milk’s 1977 “Hope Speech,” performed by Sir Ian McKellen, followed by a
brief discussion.

Women's History Month, MPS Herstory Project
The 4th Annual Massachusetts Trial Court Women's History Month Celebration and Conference was held on
Wednesday, March 27th. This year's celebration featured an awards ceremony where six trailblazing women and a
community organization that helps women who are unsheltered or facing homelessness were honored.
The 2024 and fourth edition of the MPS Women Herstory Project returned this March. The MPS Training Division
celebrated six MPS women who shared their stories with us during Women's History Month. The impact of
women’s history might seem abstract to some, and less pressing than the immediate struggles of working women
today, but to ignore the vital role that women’s dreams and accomplishments play in our own lives would be a great
mistake. We draw strength and inspiration from those who came before us – and the remarkable MPS women
working among us today. They are part of our collective MPS story, and a truly balanced and inclusive history
recognizes how important women have always been.
This year's recipients were (left to right) Program Manager Jessica Alves, Probation Officer Tawauka Bryant, Program
Manager Sam Shea, Assistant Interstate Compact Coordinator Themar Dumay, Assistant Chief Probation Officer Gloria
Laboy, and Victim Service Coordinator Erin Beech.

The Legal Unit
The Legal Unit provides accessible, proactive, efficient, and risk-conscious in-agency legal representation to
support the overarching mission and priorities of the Massachusetts Probation Service. The Legal Unit strives to
provide user-friendly legal guidance and support to all levels of MPS employees, in conjunction with effectively
representing the interests of MPS with external stakeholders.
Our diverse legal team works in areas such as policy, legislation, training, procurement, contracting, legal
research, and both appellate and trial court litigation. The Legal Unit serves as the Keeper of the Records and
houses the MPS Records Unit, which is responsible for maintaining the Court Activity Record Information System
(CARI) and responding to petitions and orders from the court to seal, expunge, redact, or archive cases when
appropriate.
This Fiscal Year, the Legal Unit conducted a series of virtual trainings titled, "Legal Office Hours", to educate the
field about important legal matters within Probation. The following is a list of topics that were covered over the
past year.
Training Description
Legal O ce Hours: A Review of There are a number of recent Legal Advisories that are speci c to Juvenile Court. This
Recent New Cases in Juvenile training reviewed many of them, including Leopold L., Noah N., Preston P., Quigley Q., and
Court others.
Legal O ce Hours: Diversion This training discussed Probation’s requirement to screen for diversion eligibility in the
Screening – Adult, Juvenile, and District, Boston Municipal, and Juvenile courts. It also reviewed the diversion protocols,
Valor/Brave chart, and list of ineligible offenses.
This training discussed the recent decision of Commonwealth v. Medina, which clari ed
Legal O ce Hours: From and
when a probationary period begins when there has been an intervening SDP commitment.

federal incarceration, ICE detentions, and complex sentencing schemes in multiple courts.
This training discussed the recent decisions of Commonwealth v. Feliz, Roderick, Lehan, and
Legal O ce Hours: GPS – New Norman, putting the three together to look at the law on GPS in a holistic way. The training
Case Law Summary also reviewed best practices around GPS condition setting, how to use GPS evidence, and
how to best communicate about the GPS to the court.

DNA Conversions/ICOTS Cases
Effective November 10, 2023, to ensure that Probation Officers are aware of which incoming interstate
cases require DNA submission, the Massachusetts Probation Service (MPS) Interstate Unit sends all
accepted incoming interstate cases to the MPS Legal Unit for review. The Legal Unit conducts the felony
conversion.
Upon receiving an accepted interstate probation transfer, the Legal Unit attorney reviews the foreign state’s
statutes under which the probationer was convicted. The attorney then conducts legal research to discover
the elements necessary for conviction in the foreign state. This research may include reviewing caselaw,
trial court documents, and/or public documents which are authoritative in the foreign state.
Once complete, the attorney reviews comparable Massachusetts MA statutes which prohibit similar
conduct as the foreign statute(s). The attorney conducts legal research to discover the elements for
conviction in MA, which often includes review of Model Criminal Jury Instructions (when they are available)
but may also include reviewing other MA legal resources and MA caselaw.
At the conclusion of the analysis, the attorney produces an Interstate Report containing the analysis of the
relevant statutes and a legal recommendation of whether DNA is required as a condition of probation
pursuant G.L. c. 22E § 3 (the statute governing required DNA samples for certain convictions). This report
also includes the legal justification for the recommendation. This report is then forwarded to the Interstate
Unit, the Chief Probation Officer of the supervising court, and the Massachusetts State Police Combined
DNA Index System (CODIS) Unit. The attorney makes themselves available for any subsequent questions by
these parties regarding the legal recommendation regarding DNA.

Recognition: MPS Records Unit (Sealing, Expungement and Identity Management)
This Fiscal Year, the Records Unit
was the recipient of the Trial Court
Excellence Award for their
outstanding collaboration and
teamwork.
The MPS Records Unit is responsible
for three major tasks: sealing records,
expunging records, and identity
management.
Since the 2018 Criminal Justice
Reform Act, the sealing and
expungement of records have
Pictured Left to Right: Assistant CARI Coordinator Vanessa Pierre, Court Administrator Thomas
become a major function of the Trial
Ambrosino, Assistant CARI Coordinator Grace Viviano, CARI Coordinator Sandrine Ribeiro, Former
Court, which the MPS Records Unit is
Chief Justice of the Trial Court Jeffrey A. Locke, Assistant CARI Coordinator Christine Velez,
Administrative Coordinator Annmarie Palermo, Assistant CARI Coordinator Jennifer Montes, responsible for executing.
Assistant CARI Coordinator Rhys Malcolm, Assistant CARI Coordinator Marlene Martins, Assistant
CARI Coordinator Mohamed Abdirahman, Assistant ELMO Coordinator Keith Andrews, Assistant
CARI Coordinator Ann Appolon, Administrative Coordinator Willie English, CARI Manager Sean
Casey, First Deputy Commissioner Dianne Fasano, Deputy Commissioner of Field Services Brian
Mirasolo, and Commissioner of Probation Pamerson Ifill.
The processes for sealing and expungement are incredibly complex, but despite the size of the task, the unit has
maintained timely responses, even during the challenges of the pandemic.
When a petition to seal is received, the unit utilizes record indexes, including MassCourts, Inmate Web, Parole Web,
AFIS, the Sex Offender Registry Board, or the Department of Criminal Justice Information Services (DCJIS), to
determine eligibility. Only after checking each source can the unit execute sealing a petition. In FY 2024, the unit
sealed 59,298 charges.
The process for expungement requires many of the same checks as sealing but adds additional restrictions, such
as the petitioner's age at the time of the offense and restrictions on the type and manner. In FY 2024, they received
1,250 expungement petitions. These statistics do not include orders to expunge that are first filed with the court, as
opposed to a petition to OCP. In FY 2024, the Unit received 306 of these orders.
Finally, identity management is essential to the function of the Trial Court by maintaining the court activity record
information (i.e., CARI) and the domestic violence registry for all defendants. They ensure that the proper
information belongs on the correct person's record. Anytime there is a question, the Unit combs through digital
information to determine an accurate identity. This could include RMV records, booking photos, fingerprints, federal
and out-of-state criminal records, and records from other state agencies. The unit also maintains legacy records,
which involve searching microfiches for criminal records dating back to the early 1900s. Proper identity
management is essential to the sealing and expungement functions described above.
Other functions that the Record Units provide are out-of-state records checks for child welfare matters in the
Juvenile and Probate & Family Courts, identity merges, and reviewing and executing orders to dismiss prior to
arraignment.

“Sections 100 F, G, and H” refer to MGL c. 276, §§ 100F, 100G, and 100H (and by implication Sections 100I and
100J). When Petitions to Expunge are filed with the Office of the Commissioner of Probation, pursuant to these

Section 110:
sections, OCP staff must determine whether the petitions satisfy all the statutory eligibility requirements, and if
they do, then notify the prosecuting attorney’s offices and the courts so that the petitions may be docketed and
heard. If or once the petitions are granted (or not), OCP is notified of same.
“Section 100 K” refers to MGL c. 276, § 100K. When Petitions to Expunge are filed directly with the Court, pursuant
to this section, and the Court decides same, the Office of the Commissioner of Probation, is notified if or once any
such petitions are granted.

Massachusetts
Probation Service
FY 2024 Annual Report:
Protecting while Building Safer, Healthier,
Stronger Communities
1

Message from the Commissioner
As I begin my second year as the Commissioner of Probation
of the Massachusetts Probation Service (MPS) and reflect, I
found 2024 to have been one of innovative growth and
collaborative partnerships that have led to the protection and
building of safer, healthier, and stronger communities across
the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.
This could not have been possible without the support of
Chief Justice Kimberly S. Budd, Associate Justices of the
Supreme Judicial Court, Chief Justice Heidi Brieger, Court
Administrator Thomas Ambrosino, Departmental Chief
Justices, other court offices and departments, as well as
community-based agencies and providers.
I especially want to express my deepest thanks and gratitude
to the employees of the MPS, whose passion, dedication and
commitment has resulted in improved outcomes for
individuals under probation supervision, greater
access to resources through our community justice support centers, and improved services for other court users and
litigants who come in contact with the MPS.
Along with promoting accountability and responsibility, the MPS is committed to providing access to resources
and supports that contribute to the improved safety and welfare of individuals on pretrial status, under probation
supervision, returning citizens, as well as those of victims and survivors, and our community-at-large.
The MPS is also committed to evidence-based, data-driven policies and practices best suited for all phases of the
criminal justice process.The MPS commits to preserving the rights of defendants, victims, and witnesses, reducing
failure to appear rates across all court divisions, while enhancing programming and treatment initiatives that result
in better outcomes, which will in turn lead to reductions in recidivism, incarceration, and reincarceration.
An overarching goal of the MPS is also its commitment to ensuring that all justice-involved individuals have access
to adequate healthcare resources and supports to better facilitate and promote healthy living outcomes. In
addition to these core principles, the MPS is committed to conducting and using comprehensive research analysis
to better understand our performance metrics as it relates to our role in the causation of racial and ethnic
disparities (RED), and to make the necessary structural, procedural, and operational changes to eliminate RED
across all aspects of our probation supervision and business practices. We believe these actions allow the MPS
and the broader Trial Court to improve access to justice outcomes for defendants, litigants, victims, and other
court users.
MPS is expanding its footprint beyond supervision by partnering with MassHealth to bridge the coverage gap for
post disposition justice-involved individuals with mental health and substance use disorder needs. The Behavioral
Health-Justice Involved (BH-JI) initiative developed a sustainable model that includes intensive supports and
services, care coordination, and referrals for housing, social services, and benefits. This partnership fosters direct
referrals and strong care coordination for post disposition justice-involved individuals. The MPS is expanding this
initiative to include the pretrial population and expand additional services to post-dispositional probationers.
These initiatives and others like them provide the MPS and Trial Court Justices with treatment alternatives which
help to eliminate barriers to services and resources, while decreasing unnecessary probation violations, pretrial
detention, and improving outcomes for individuals on probation and pretrial supervision.

FY 2024 Initiatives
Current probation initiatives that were adopted to improve practice and reduce violations include:
Collaboration with George Mason University: Probation is working with George Mason University (GMU), in
conjunction with the American Probation and Parole Association (APPA), on a research and training project to
help probation departments with their recommendations at sentencing, that will ensure that the sentence is
most aligned with the probationer’s goals and public safety. This could decrease possible unnecessary
conditions, and in turn, increase the probationer’s ability to succeed while on supervision.
Carey Guides: The MPS has incorporated the Carey Guides as part of its ongoing commitment towards using
Evidence-Based Practices (EBP) in its work with probationers. The goal is to maximize EBP’s efficacy by
providing probation officers with the most current tools and knowledge to produce better outcomes for
probationers.
Interactive Text Response (ITR) Program: In 2020, the Pretrial Service Division collaborated with the
Massachusetts Trial Court’s Information Technology (IT) division to launch its first-ever Interactive Text
Response (ITR) program, which allows court staff to enter the party’s cell phone information into MassCourts
and enroll the party in a text messaging workflow based on events. In FY 2024, there were 357,537 text
messages sent to court users, a 27% increase since last fiscal year.
Efforts to decrease the number of warrants issued for GPS and SCRAM alerts: Within the past year, the
Warrant Management Unit (WMU) has worked carefully to decrease the number of warrants issued for clients
on GPS and remote alcohol monitoring. To decrease warrants issued, the department has strengthened
communication and collaboration with clients by using technological resources such as FaceTime and
WhatsApp to clarify equipment issues and better understand problems regarding alerts. These tools help the
WMU work with the client to improve behavior and ultimately issue less warrants. Since FY 2023, the number of
warrants issued has decreased by 35%.
MassHealth Initiative: This initiative will make it easier to link court users with mental health treatment and
medical services by eliminating barriers. In FY 2024, Pretrial Services worked with 587 referrals and assisted
371 individuals.
Community Justice Support Centers (CJSC): There are currently 18 CJSCs across the commonwealth. In FY
2024, the Quincy CJSC reopened, while the Haverhill CJSC hosted their grand opening. This past year, CJSCs
helped 561 participants avoid incarceration by providing 5,755 total programming hours across all centers.
Reentry Housing: The mission of reentry housing is to create housing opportunities which offer supportive
services to those who are reintegrating into the community or struggling with homelessness and to address the
underlying causes. MPS’ Reentry Program, in collaboration with the Massachusetts Parole Board, offered one
of the largest supplies of transitional bed housing in the state. In FY 2024, a total of 274 residents were served
by reentry housing.
3

Recovery Courts: Massachusetts currently has 31 adult recovery courts, which provide intensive, supervised
probation and mandatory treatment, as well as random drug testing with progress monitored by a
supervising probation officer. Our research shows that of those who completed Recovery Court, only 30.1%
recidivated within two years, compared to 46.9% of those who did not complete.
Supporting Victims of Crime: In FY 2024, the Victim Services Unit helped approximately 1,300 victims with a
variety of issues including crisis intervention, criminal and civil justice system assistance, information, and
referrals. A complete summary of all the work VSU does can be found in the appendix.
Rescinded Warrants: MPS takes the rescinding of warrants very seriously and has strived to reduce the
number of occurrences by refining and enhancing the warrant process. Improvements in this process are
reflected not only through the decline of total warrants issued, but also in the number of warrants rescinded.
Since FY 2018, the total number of warrants rescinded has decreased by 78%.
Training and Ongoing Education: In FY 2024, the Training Department was responsible for 489 training
sessions, totaling over 7,150 hours. The extensiveness, variety, and value of trainings can be seen
throughout this report. The material and training most applicable to each department is featured under each
division. Presenting the number of trainings relevant to each area demonstrates how much Probation and
its employees rely on and are supported by the Training Department through on-going education,
communication, and support.
The Adoption of a New Case Management System: Starting in FY 2024, Probation has been working on the
development of a new case management system (CMS). Through MPS and the company Slalom, a CMS will
be built using Salesforce, a cloud-based system that will help Probation streamline case management and
enhance productivity.

Massachusetts Probation in History
“Through supervision as a treatment method, the probation officer tries to
include a positive change in the habits, attitudes, value system and social
relationships of the probationer by guiding him and by assisting him to
marshal his own resources and to draw upon those of the community to
achieve this end. The ultimate objective is to bring about lasting change in
the attitude of the probationer.”
- Massachusetts Probation Manual, 1968
Massachusetts Probation has always been forward-focused and innovative leader. MPS has a lot to be proud
of. Probation was the first to:
Establish a registry of civil restraining orders: In 1978, MPS became the first agency to create a national
Restraining Order Registry to track domestic violence offenders and share information about offenders with
law enforcement and affiliate partners.
Introduce non-traditional hours via Operation Night Light: In 1994, MPS created Operation Nightlight, a
successful model of community supervision that pairs probation officers with police to conduct regular field
work, which includes interactions with probationers, victims, and the community at large. During special
operations, probation officers also work collaboratively with state and federal enforcement agencies on
warrant sweeps.
Implement a 24/7 electronic monitoring unit: In 2001, the MPS was among the first in the United States to
track probationers using the GPS device as an alternative to jail time, and in 2005, became one of the first
states to track high-risk offenders using the GPS monitoring device as an added supervision tool.
Massachusetts is among a few states who perform their own monitoring of offenders using the system.
Massachusetts was the first state to monitor domestic violence offenders using the GPS bracelet, and has
served as a catalyst for states such as Connecticut and Illinois, which used the MPS as a model. MPS
became one of the few state agencies to use crime correlation, a tracking system to determine if a person is
at or in the vicinity of a crime scene.
Evidence-based practices: MPS continued to lead the way in 2016, when it became one of the first
probation departments in the country to implement a set of validated risk assessment tools, the Ohio Risk
Assessment System (ORAS) and Ohio Youth Assessment System (OYAS). These new risk assessment tools
align with our mission to keep the public safe by changing the trajectory of the lives of the people who come
into our care and custody.

Field Services
The Field Services Division (FSD) at the Office of the Commissioner of Probation provides support to the over 100
local probation departments across the Commonwealth. The core work of the Field Services Division revolves
around supporting the MPS’s overall mission statement by holding probationers accountable for their actions while
supporting them as they work towards making positive changes in their lives. The FSD is also committed to
supporting the families and litigants engaged with our Juvenile and Probate and Family Court Departments for
services and dispute resolution. The FSD also oversees the local probation offices to ensure that they are
implementing statewide practices and policies.
Visiting offenders in the community in places like their homes, jobs, and schools is an integral part of probation
supervision.
New Case Management System
In FY 2024, Probation has been working on the development of a new, unified case management system (CMS).
Probation's current case management process involves juggling multiple outdated systems, making it difficult
for staff to track key tasks, determine the best course of action, and ensure compliance. This fragmented
approach hinders our ability to effectively serve our probationers and our communities.
To address these challenges, MPS has selected Slalom, a consulting company, to be our implementation
partner. Through MPS and Slalom's partnership, the new CMS will be built using Salesforce, a cloud-based
system that will help us streamline case management and enhance productivity.
As of mid-July, Probation completed a successful 12-week initial Discovery and Design Phase, which laid a
strong foundation for the project, aligning a vision of a modern system equipped with essential tools and
functionalities to support our employees in their work with probationers and the community. The project is now
one third of the way through the 30-week Development Phase.
This is an exciting opportunity to transform Probation. A system that empowers MPS to spend less time on
data entry and more time focusing on what truly matters - increasing community safety, supporting victims and
survivors, and assisting individuals and families in achieving long-term positive change - will be beneficial to all.

Field Services: Training
There were a variety of trainings offered to probation specifically focused on probation practice, policy, and
procedures. The following is a list of all trainings that were offered in FY 2024 by the Training Division in relation to

Trainings
Description
(continued)
This training provided an overview of the violation of probation process, with particular attention to the
District/BMC rules, the Superior Court Guidelines, and the Juvenile Court standing order. Attendees were
armed with the tools they needed to successfully prepare and argue VOPs. We reviewed: the types of
violations; when one has to  le a notice of violation; violation notice requirements; how we use discretion;
Violations of
how to request detention; gathering and introducing evidence; using substantially reliable hearsay; and

making recommendations for the right interventions. Attendees gained an in-depth understanding of the
probation violation process, including exposure to relevant statutes and case law, and can now better
utilize their discretion to craft individualized responses, including the use of intermediate sanctions, to
promote best possible outcomes for clients, and develop valuable perspective on the VOP process.
Violation of Probation II is designed to take what was learned in VOP I a step further. This training
equipped seasoned probation o cers with the skills needed to succeed in the courtroom. Trainers taught
the law of violations of probation practice as well as practical tips needed to be con dent and persuasive.
This training provided an in depth look at evidence – how to get it and how to use it effectively, including
substantially reliable hearsay. Next, we discussed direct and cross examination, with a focus on

Standards Training
Collaboration with George Mason University
Probation is working with George Mason University (GMU), in conjunction with the American Probation and
Parole Association, on a research and training project to help probation departments with their
recommendations at sentencing, especially condition settings, change in circumstance, or a violation of
probation. GMU is looking for insights into Probation's current supervision process to understand what methods
work well and what barriers MPS may face. It is important to understand what constitutes a good
recommendation versus a recommendation that does not contribute to the probationer’s goals or public safety.
The following courts are involved with this project:
Middlesex Superior Court Plymouth Superior Court Worcester Superior Court
Bristol Superior Court Hampden Superior Court Essex Superior Court
Northern Berkshire District Court Milford District Court Concord District Court
Ayer District Court Lynn District Court Lowell District Court

Carey Guides:
The MPS has incorporated the use of Carey Guides as part of its ongoing commitment towards using Evidence-
Based Practices (EBP) in its work with probationers. The goal is to maximize EBP’s efficacy by providing probation
officers with the most current tools and knowledge to produce better outcomes for probationers. The Carey Guides
support probation officers’ efforts to promote positive, pro-social change by using targeted Cognitive Behavioral
Interventions. For behavior change and recidivism reduction to be possible, probationers must understand the
personal and environmental factors underlying their behavior and be taught the skills that they need to make
changes to their behavior that will produce positive outcomes. The Carey guides are designed to equip probation
officers with the tools they need to support these changes among their clients.
The Carey Guides include 33 handbooks, with 14 of the guides addressing criminogenic needs and 19 of the guides
focusing on case management issues and brief intervention tools (BITs). The Carey Guides are being used by more
than 500 agencies in 42 states and four countries; BITs are being used by 450 agencies in 34 states.
The are being implemented in three phases:
April 2023 - April 3, 2024 - October 4 -

DNA Collection
As part of the Criminal Justice Reform Act of 2018, the Massachusetts Probation Service (MPS) was required to
start collecting DNA from any person under probation supervision who was convicted of an offense that was
punishable by imprisonment in state prison, as well as certain youthful offenders. The MPS issued a revised DNA
Policy (Policy No. 02.02.07(a)) which details the intent, definitions, training requirements and procedures for
collection of a DNA sample. Below is the number of DNA samples that were collected in FY 2024.

Recognition
This fiscal year, Fitchburg District Court Probation Officer II Diamily Titus
received a Trial Court Excellence Award for excellence in service.
PO Titus emigrated from her birth country, Cuba, in hopes of establishing a
better life for her and her family. She entered the U.S. as a young adult
without the ability to speak English and did not understand the cultural
customs of her new community.
As a licensed alcohol & drug counselor and certified substance use
counselor, Titus is an active member of the MPS Substance Abuse
Committee that developed and facilitates a one-week training curriculum for
new probation officers. As a result of her expertise in substance use, she has
been appointed as one of the Specialty Court Probation Officers for the
Fitchburg District Drug Court since its inception in 2019.
Of Cuban decent, Titus is bilingual and communicates in Spanish and English
and connects culturally with the Latinx clients, victims, and court users. This
is an enormous asset in the Fitchburg community, where a large percentage
of residents have limited English proficiency.

Lynn Probation Officer Kelley Montgomery has helped probationers find their way
Lynn District Court Probation Officer Kelley Montgomery was
assigned to Recovery Court within 10 months of becoming a
Probation Officer more than two decades ago.
PO Montgomery said she has seen the attitude toward
addiction in the Lynn community and throughout the country
change to one that involves a "greater understanding that it
can affect anyone." She serves on the Recovery Court
presided by Lynn District First Justice Ina Howard-Hogan.
She is known and respected in the courts and community for
her patience and compassion for working with those in the
throes of addiction. Ms. Montgomery has also seen clients
she worked with turn their lives around more than once. She
said, however, probationers must "learn to surrender and trust
the fact" that they are in need of help and resources.
PO Montgomery said she often refers to a saying when
speaking to Recovery Court participants.
"We tell them, 'You've driven your car and you've done that for
a while. But now you've driven it into a ditch. Now, it is time to
let us help you get out of it,'" she said.

Cathcart. “They were so very thankful and we
even received lots of hugs and smiles.”
"I have always loved making others feel good. It
is a great feeling to put a smile on a child’s face
with something as simple as a trim. All of the
parents seemed beyond grateful,” Ms. Swift said.
“Growing up as a child of a single parent of three,
I know what it’s like to struggle. It was such a
pleasure to be a part of the community and give
back.”

cares more than anyone in the Commonwealth for people
living with mental health and substance abuse. She is the
best and has saved many of our lives just by being her
kind self."

Massachusetts Juvenile Probation: A Decade of Progress
For over a decade, Massachusetts Probation has made widespread efforts to drastically reduce and change the
make-up of youth on probation through a variety of initiatives. This section explains these measures and their
outcomes.
2016: Ohio Youth Assessment System
2018: Criminal Justice Reform Bill
2019: Graduated Sanctions & Incentives
2019: Administrative Hearing Policy
Juvenile Probation's first major undertaking within the decade was the implementation of the validated Ohio Risk
03
Assessment System (OYAS) which was first used in spring 2016. According to the OYAS final report, authored by
the University of Cincinnati in 2009, the assessment “was designed to assist juvenile justice professionals in
providing the most effective interventions for youth based on their likelihood to reoffend, their criminogenic needs,
and their barriers to services, while using the least restrictive alternative” (Latessa, Lovins, & Ostrowski, 2009).1
Administering the OYAS had a dramatic effect. It significantly altered and reduced the amount of supervision to
which the majority of youths were exposed. As can be observed in the chart on the next page, the number of
youths on high-risk probation decreased significantly - by 79% in just two years. Within the past decade, the decline
is even more staggering, a 92.7% decrease between 2015 and 2024, which represents nearly 800 youth who are no
longer on high-risk probation.
This is important because some research suggests that providing too much supervision to a low-risk youth can
have a negative impact by exposing them to higher risk youth and potentially disturbing pro-social networks
(Lowenkamp and Latessa 2004)2.
Along with assessing risk, the OYAS measures youths' needs, and targets identified criminogenic needs that are
shown to correlate with criminal behavior. Among the needs identified in the assessment are criminogenic
thoughts and attitudes, peer associations, social skills, and substance use. The last aspect to the OYAS is
responsivity, which means coordinating treatment approaches to the youth’s needs. Treatment must be focused in
a way where the juvenile can learn and develop new, improved behaviors.

The second measure to have an impact on the juvenile probation caseload was the passage of the Criminal
Justice Reform Bill in 2018. This was significant because it limited the number of juveniles who were ultimately
sentenced to probation. The Bill raised the minimum age of responsibility from seven to 12 years old, while minor
offenses – civil infractions and first offense misdemeanors with penalties under six months – can no longer be
found delinquent. Furthermore, disruptive behavior in school, such as disorderly conduct or disrupting school
assembly, can no longer be the subject of a delinquency finding. In addition, many more young people are eligible
for diversion, directing them away from the criminal justice system.
The last two measures, the implementation of sanctions and incentives and the enactment of the Administrative
Hearing Policy, both in 2019, worked in tandem to substantially improve supervision and make decisions more
uniform. Due to these initiatives, Probation’s violation notices, both delinquent and non-delinquent, significantly
decreased. Between FY 2018, the year before the two policies took effect, and FY 2024, total juvenile violations
decreased by 60.7%.
These policies have significantly reshaped the way Probation supervises juveniles. More time is now spent on
the front-end of cases, being proactive instead of reactive. More strategic, intentional supervision equates to less
violations, particularly in court, and frees up time to further improve practice. Probation Officers (POs) and their
supervisors now have the time and ability to strategize more effective responses to behavior.
The Graduated Response System presents alternatives to incarceration or home removal by providing other ways
to teach youth to respect rules. Research has demonstrated that an effective way to promote compliance and
encourage progress is to use incentives for good behaviors and sanctions for bad behaviors3.
With the passage of the Administrative Hearing Policy, if a juvenile is non-compliant with their conditions but
hasn't re-offended, instead of holding a Violation Hearing in court, Probation may choose to hold a less formal
Administrative Hearing instead. PO’s now respond to troublesome behavior in real time, using skills they’ve
learned through their considerable depth of experience, as well as through on-going evidence-based training. An
officer may decide to increase reporting, set firm deadlines, or offer referrals to address issues. The work that
the PO is investing in is responsive and in-depth. In this way, the behavior of the youth may improve without
needing any sort of disciplinary action. This new way of supervising involves more work for the supervisor and
PO, but it has helped keep scores of violations from ever entering a courtroom, which not only frees up time for
Probation and the Court, but is a great benefit to the youth.

Delinquent Non-Delinquent Both
The chart above shows the total number of juvenile violations by type – delinquency, non-delinquency, and both.
As noted above, the total decline in violations between FY 2018 – 2024 was 60.7%. A significant portion of this
decline was due to the reduction in non-delinquent violations, 73.5% between FY 2018 – 2024. Delinquent
violations also decreased, by 49%.
It is also important to consider the effect of the overall caseload on violations. It could be argued that the
reduction in juvenile cases played a role in the decline in violation notices. While this may be partially true, the total
decline in adjudicated probation cases, Risk/Need and Administrative, has decreased 40%. If Pretrial cases were
included in this total, the reduction would be 17.9%. In both scenarios, the reduction in total violation notices
overtook the decline in total cases.
The substantial drop in non-delinquent violations is very important to acknowledge because it shows that
Probation's efforts to decrease in-court violations, encourage pro-social behaviors, and support juvenile's success
while on supervision have largely been successful.

Care and Protection
In Care and Protection (C&P) cases, Probation Officers (PO) help the court by visiting with children who are not
living at home. If children are placed with a parent or someone else, the PO makes sure the custody orders are
being followed. PO’s also help with drug and alcohol screens. There are four levels of Care and Protection cases:

Children Requiring Assistance
Youth may be supervised by Probation due to a delinquency and/or status offense. Status offenders, who are
habitually truant from school, repeatedly fail to obey school rules, frequently run away from home, continually fail to
obey his or her parent or legal guardian, and/or children subjected to sexual exploitation are deemed Child
Requiring Assistance (CRA) cases, as defined in M.G.L. Chapter 119, Section 21. In these cases, applicants
including parents, guardians, school officials, or police request help from the Court to manage the oftentimes-
complex needs of the youth. Once an application is accepted, the youth can receive services through Probation.
Below is a chart showing the total monthly CRA cases.

for Juvenile Attendees were given the tools they needed to successfully handle a CRA petition from beginning to
Probation dismissal. The new CRA forms, developed by MPS and AOJC, were reviewed, as well as supervision
practices and how to best make written recommendations.
This workshop reviewed MGL, Ch. 119 Sec. 24 and Care & Protection Standards promulgated in March
OCP Standards 2014. This in-person session focused on the importance of the probation o cer's role in the process,
for Probation recognizing the correlation between a child's safety risk and level of supervision and also an overview of
Supervision Care the assignment process. The objectives of the training were for participants to have an understanding of
& Protection MGL CH 119 Sec.24 and the importance of probation's responsibilities/involvement under Care and
Cases Protection Standards, to recognize the correlation between a child's safety risk and level of probation
supervision, and to understand the initial case assignment process of C&P cases.
This mandatory training provided instruction on the Risk/Need Instrument (OYAS) and the corresponding
case management system. The two-day curriculum was designed to introduce the tool, develop pro ciency
in the instrument, reinforce skills and provide feedback/support through a booster session. Upon
OYAS completion, attendees should understand the principles of the risk-need responsivity model used in
Certi cation accessing and engaging correctional populations, conduct, with a high degree of accuracy, a juvenile risk-
need assessment using the Ohio Youth Assessment System (OYAS), and utilize relevant case management
system(s) to pro ciently record risk assessment information and applicable chronological notations in
accordance with probation supervision standards.
Court presentation, relevant case law, and general CRA related information were a few of the many topics

In the Community:
Memorial Day Community Service: On Saturday, May 25th, Barnstable County/Town of Plymouth Juvenile
Probation organized a community service event in collaboration with the Office of Community Corrections. ACPO
Janet MacFarlane, PO Caitlin Kourafas (Veteran's liaison for the division), and PO Chantal Morrison, along with
Robert Doherty, Assistant Court Service Coordinator from the Office of Community Corrections, accompanied a
group of juveniles to participate in the Memorial Day ceremonies at Bourne National Cemetery and placed flags at
graves of veterans and their families.
In June, Worcester Juvenile Probation invited youth-serving agencies, schools, and public entities to breakfast. The
agencies represented included: Worcester Public Schools, Motivating Youth Recovery (MYR), CASA, DCF, DYS,
Mass Rehabilitation Commission, Worcester Youth Center, CHOICES, Youth Villages, Open Sky, and Safe Homes.
The breakfast enabled the different agencies to share the mission of their organization, distribute materials for
referrals, network, and enjoy breakfast together. A non-violence pledge was signed by the agencies and, through
Worcester Youth Center, and all received t-shirts proclaiming "Violence is Not Normal" to bring awareness to the
conversation around youth violence.

Probate and Family Probation
Probate and Family Probation Officers provide service to litigants and families on contested Probate matters,
including providing dispute intervention services, performing court-ordered investigations, supervising compliance
with court orders, and completing case interventions.
Case Interventions
A case intervention is when a probation officer or associate probation officer performs a one-time specific task at
the direction of the court. Referrals for a case intervention are generally concise and task specific. Case
interventions are generally performed immediately.
The number of case interventions has increased each year since FY 2020. In total, over 14,000 more case
interventions were completed this year compared to five years ago, an increase of 44%.

Formal and Short-Term Investigations:
In an investigation, a probation officer gathers, assesses, and analyzes information to make recommendations to
the Court. There are two types of investigations, full and short term. In full investigations, probation officers
interview all relevant parties, including children as appropriate, conduct home visits, contact professional and non-
professional collateral sources, obtain records, periodically run offender records, and produce written reports with
recommendations. Referrals for full investigations require a minimum of 90 days to complete. Short-term
investigations are limited in scope, task specific, and may contain a recommendation if ordered by the court.

This fiscal year, funding was secured for Probation staff to attend the National Association of Conciliation Courts
(AFCC) Conference in June. In total, 24 Probate & Family (PF&) staff including Probation Officers, Assistant Chief
Probation Officers, and Chief Probation Officers attended. Employees also attended the local AFCC training in
March and the Massachusetts Association of Guardian Ad Litem (MAGAL) training in May. This last training was on
professional parenting time supervisors. Marguerite Riley, Statewide Supervisor for P&F Probation served as faculty
for the MAGAL training. In addition to the trainings below, a comprehensive multi-day training in dispute resolution
techniques was developed, which will be available in Fall, 2024. There will be two, five-day trainings and an
additional three, one-day refresher classes scheduled for early winter.

In the Community: Barnstable Probate & Family Probation celebrates
guardians and caregivers
Barnstable Probate & Family Court Probation staff celebrated the efforts of
guardians and caregivers of children in the Barnstable County area with a special
luncheon on June 4th. Guardianship of a minor is a legal process that gives the
guardian authority to care for and to make decisions on behalf of a child. The idea
for the luncheon was introduced by Barnstable County Probate & Family
Probation Officer Amie Evans, who was raised by her own grandparents. “The
idea of providing appreciation and support to our guardianship community is near
and dear to me,” Ms. Evans said. In Massachusetts, there are more than 30,000
grandparents who are raising their children’s children with nearly one-third of
these grandparents being responsible for grandchildren with no parent present in
their lives, according to a study conducted by ForHealth Consulting at UMass
Barnstable County Probate &
Chan Medical School.

Story Hour with Norfolk Probate and Family Court:
On May 23rd, the Norfolk County Probate and Family Court
had the opportunity to spend time with the first grade
students at the Luce Elementary School in Canton, MA.
The Probation team, as well as First Justice Patricia Gorman
and Judicial Case Manager Kim LaDue, read stories and
passed out crayons, markers, and a book to each of the 90
students in attendance. The children enjoyed themselves
immensely and asked, “if we would come again when they
were in the second grade.”
Probation Officer Scott Goldberg was such a hit with the
students that they invited him to attend their field trip the
following day at the zoo. It was a great day for both the court
staff and the students alike.

Pretrial Services
The Massachusetts Probation Service’s (MPS) Pretrial Services Division (PSD) strives to establish a system of
broad-based collaborative partnerships that include the court, criminal justice agencies, and community service
providers and to enable a set of comprehensive policies, guidelines, and practices to improve pretrial services
throughout the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. By collaborating with such agencies, the Pretrial Services
Division aims to assist with the minimization of unnecessary pretrial detention through a wide-ranging system of
pretrial services.
MassHealth Initiative
The Pretrial Services Division’s MassHealth initiative aims to close the healthcare coverage gap for the pretrial population
and post-dispositional probationers. This initiative will make it easier to link court users with mental health treatment and
medical services by eliminating any barrier the lack of health care coverage presents. This initiative will also provide
justices with alternatives to pretrial detention by providing pretrial defendants with treatment options they can engage in
while remaining in their communities during the pendency of their criminal case. Enrollment in MassHealth and the
Massachusetts Health Connector will also help expand healthcare coverage for the families of justice-involved individuals
by improving their access to healthcare to address their own physical and emotional health and well-being.
Healthcare also plays a vital role in executing evidence-based practices with justice-involved individuals. Probation
Officers complete actuarial assessments and create case plans with post-disposition, justice-involved individuals that
focus on the individual’s criminogenic needs and responsivity concerns. Case planning fosters positive behavior changes,
and access to health insurance ensures that individuals have access to vital substance use and mental health treatment,
prescriptions, and preventative medical care. The MPS addressing these issues ultimately impacts public safety and
reduces barriers for all justice-involved individuals.
The long-term goal of this initiative is to create lasting positive and sustainable change amongst all justice-involved
individuals, especially with our pretrial population, by providing individuals with direct assistance when applying for or
renewing their MassHealth or Health Connector benefits.
In FY 2024, Pretrial Services worked with 587 referrals and assisted 371 individuals. Below is how they helped
participants with their health insurance.

Text Messaging
As part of the Criminal Justice Reform Act of 2018, the PSD was tasked with developing programs in coordination
with the Massachusetts Trial Court and other criminal justice agencies to minimize unnecessary pretrial
detention. The Act required that one initiative focus on developing a program that would notify and remind
defendants of court appearance obligations to reduce the risk of accidental defaults. In 2020, the PSD
collaborated with the Massachusetts Trial Court’s Information Technology Division (IT) to launch its first-ever
Interactive Text Response (ITR) program, an automated notification system within the Trial Court’s electronic
case management system, MassCourts, operated by Equivant.
The ITR program allows court staff to enter the party’s cell phone information into MassCourts and enroll the
party in a text messaging workflow based on events. Specific events trigger ITR; each court department identified
a list of events that would be part of the program. These events were added to the ITR Event Group. When an
event is scheduled and is part of the ITR Event Group, a text reminder is sent to the party with information
regarding their case number, the event date, and event time. Two reminders are sent; a reminder is sent four days
prior and one day before the court event. This proactive approach aims to reduce the instances of missed court
appearances, ensuring a more efficient legal system.
When the program began, it was only available for criminal events in the District, Superior, and Boston Municipal
Court (BMC) Departments. In May 2021, the program expanded to the Probate & Family, Juvenile, and Housing
Court Departments. In April 2023, the ITR program expanded to civil events in the District, BMC, and Superior
Court Departments. The Probate and Family Court Department also increased the number of events included in
the ITR program.

BRAVO-M
The Brief Risk Appraisal for Violent Offending - Massachusetts' version (BRAVO-M) was developed to assess and
manage the violence risk of offenders facing sentencing in the criminal justice system by UMass Chan Medical
School and Protect International - Risk and Safety Services. It is a brief structured professional judgment
guideline based on research, supported by best practices, and acceptable for offering guidance at the
presentencing stage.
The BRAVO-M guide assists probation officers with identifying relevant risk factors during presentence
investigations for individuals awaiting sentencing and recommending risk management strategies to prevent
violence. Those strategies will then be incorporated into the probation officer’s recommendations for conditions
of probation. The goal is to recommend probation conditions tailored to the individual’s specific needs and risks
to promote compliance and the successful completion of their probationary term.
The BRAVO-M guide breaks down the appraisal process into four steps: case information, rating the presence
and relevance of risk factors, identifying primary concerns about violence risk, and suggesting case management
and probation conditions. Suffolk Superior Court began piloting the BRAVO-M in February of 2024. By the close of
FY 2024, Suffolk Superior Court Justices had ordered six presentencing investigations be conducted via the
BRAVO-M guide. The pilot will continue in Suffolk Superior Court into FY 2025.

Willful Flight: Shifting Policy & Culture
In April, the Pretrial Justice Institute selected the Boston Municipal Court Department and the Pretrial Services
Division to pilot their Bureau of Justice Assistance funded project, Willful Flight: Shifting Policy and Culture. The
project will include the creation of a committee of stakeholders to develop a willful flight standard and policy
that takes into account why individuals may miss court appearances as opposed to the presumption that they
purposefully miss court appearances to evade prosecution, through the creation of tools and systems of
communication and assessment that considers all stakeholder roles and responsibilities. The standard and
policy will be tested at initial bail decisions to determine its impact on pretrial release rates, court appearances,
flight from prosecution, and a new criminal activity while on pretrial release. The committee will be formed and
begin its work during the first half of FY 2025.

Office of Community Corrections (OCC)
The Office of Community Corrections is a department within the MPS that was statutorily established to provide
alternatives to jail and prison. The two major initiatives of the OCC are the Community Justice Support Centers
and the Community Service Program.
Community Justice Support Centers (CJSC)
Community Justice Support Centers provide services and support to people in the criminal justice system.
Support Centers help clients get treatment for substance use disorders (SUD), develop decision making skills,
identify career opportunities, further their education, and make connections to the community. Research shows
that programs focused on these need areas keep communities safe at a lower cost than jail and prison.
Services include:
● Cognitive Behavioral Treatment to address decision making and SUD
● Education such as GED/HiSET and college preparation, life skills, financial literacy, and computer
and technology basics
● Career counseling to develop resumes, training opportunities, and resources to pursue a career
Admissions by Supervising Agency: FY 2024
Typically, CJSC attendance is ordered
by the court pursuant to General Laws
C., 211, F § 3, but it can also be a
condition of parole or pre-release

Behavioral Health Initiative for Justice Involved
Behavioral Health Supports for Individuals with Justice Involvement (BH-JI) started through a partnership
between the Massachusetts Office of Medicaid, MassHealth, and the Massachusetts Executive Office of the
Trial Court. It is based on other re-entry programs in Massachusetts and across the country.
BH-JI was developed with the Massachusetts Parole Board, the Massachusetts Department of Corrections,
Middlesex Sheriff’s Office, Worcester County Sheriff’s Office, and a range of other groups. Advice from the
Council of State Governments—drawn from the Massachusetts Justice Reinvestment Working Group—and
project support from UMass Chan Medical School’s ForHealth Consulting also helped with the development of
BH-JI.
In 2019, MassHealth began a state-funded demonstration to provide behavioral health supports for justice
involved individuals in Middlesex and Worcester counties. In 2021, the Executive Office of Health and Human
Services (EOHHS) put out a request for responses from organizations that would go on to provide BH-JI
supports statewide for justice-involved MassHealth-eligible individuals. MassHealth requested permission to
launch similar community supports for members enrolled in MassHealth managed care, in what became the
Community Support Program for Individuals with Justice Involvement (CSP-JI). CSP-JI services became
effective September 1, 2022 and are now available for MassHealth Standard, CarePlus, and Fee-for-Service.
Between September 2019 to June 2023, 4,950 individuals were referred to BH-JI, and 26% of this population
were Probation referrals.
Participant Data:
21% Are Black or African American More than one quarter have a severe disability

Statewide Substance Use Services
The Massachusetts Probation Service performs drug and alcohol testing as ordered by the court in a safe,
sanitary, and respectful fashion. Probation performs or requests appropriate confirmation testing and responds
to positive test results and attempts to defeat testing. Probation strives to create a uniform, best practice
approach to substance testing, while promoting equal access to justice through transparency and procedural
fairness.
In FY 2024, MPS and the Community Justice Support Centers performed 170,848 drug screens, with a total
positive rate of 34% (n=58,486). Below is the rate of positive tests by drug type.

Recovery Courts
Recovery Courts provide intensive, supervised probation and mandatory treatment, as well as random drug testing
with progress monitored by a supervising probation officer. The court works with treatment providers, who provide
clinical assessments, develop and monitor treatment placements, and identify ancillary counseling, case
management, and outreach services (mass.gov).
Massachusetts currently has 31 Adult Recovery Courts. The map below shows the towns and cities served by
recovery courts (in yellow). They are: Attleboro, Barnstable, Brockton, Cambridge, Charlestown, Chelsea, Dorchester,
East Boston, East Brookfield, Fall River, Falmouth, Fitchburg, Framingham, Greenfield, Haverhill, Hingham,
Lawrence, Lowell, Lynn, Malden, New Bedford, Newton, Northampton, Orange, Pittsfield, Plymouth, Quincy,
Springfield, Taunton, Uxbridge, Wareham, and Worcester.

70.3% of Recovery Court participants are male, and 29.7% female.
83.8% of participants are white.
Average age of participant: 33.5, median: 32
Only 23.2% of all Recovery Court participants recidivated (new

Women’s Recovery Court Session Celebrates Sobriety and Community
Group photo of all Women's Recovery Court session attendees.
The Women’s Recovery Court Session was a day of celebration, testimony, and empowerment. It was a day when
more than 200 women came together to provide encouragement and support or to share their stories of the
challenge and triumph in the sobriety journey. The theme was “Empowering Women In Recovery: A Day of
Celebration,” presented by Malden District Court Probation and the Massachusetts Trial Court.
Malden District Court First Justice Emily Karstetter welcomed the audience and shared that Malden District Court
has a woman first justice, clerk magistrate, and chief probation officer. "It is not without its challenges for us to
have gotten here. Those challenges pale in comparison to the challenges of you in this room," Judge Karstetter
said to the audience's applause.
Malden District Court Assistant Chief Probation Officer Judith Lawler, one of the founders of the session, thanked
attendees, "Welcome to the Women's Recovery Court Session. You showed up!" Ms. Lawler told the audience that
11 years ago when the first session was held in Chelsea, "Ten women showed up."
Wareham Recovery Court Celebrates New Graduates
On November 28, 2023, the
Wareham Recovery Court
acknowledged and celebrated
five Recovery Court graduates on
their successful completion of
the Wareham Recovery Court
Program. All of the graduates
completed the 4 phases of the
Wareham Recovery Court
Program.
Every graduate shared a piece of their unique story to those attending the graduation. It was evident that this class
of graduates was grateful of the support provided by the Recovery Court team, as well as the community providers
and agencies that they interacted with. This class of Recovery Court graduates appeared to have a special bond as
they traveled the road to recovery together within the Wareham Recovery Court Program and graduated on this day.
Each graduate in their own way, expressed how they have been able to uplift and support one another and hopes
that this support will continue to be present as they move forward in their recovery journey.

Reentry Housing
The mission of reentry housing is to create housing opportunities which offer supportive services to those who are
reintegrating into the community or struggling with homelessness and to address the underlying causes. It is also
our goal to build upon existing community resources to successfully engage individuals who are in need and at risk
through a partnership with an array of private agencies.
MPS’ Reentry Program, in collaboration with the Massachusetts Parole Board, offered one of the largest supplies of
transitional bed housing in the state. This year was particularly difficult because of the increase in homelessness
among individuals exiting jail and other institutions, according to Jill Forbes, MPS’ Statewide Manager of Reentry.
Roughly 3,200 sober home beds were funded by Probation Partnership and Project NORTH grants. There was an
average of 265 participants being supported in sober houses from Probation and Project NORTH each month.
According to MPS data, 360 participants were provided transitional housing support. This year, MPS extended
housing past the six-month mark due to a rise in homelessness among individuals leaving jail or other institutions.
Fifty clients who were homeless or at the risk of homelessness this past year were provided housing which offered
immediate and emergency beds in Boston, New Bedford, and West Springfield.

Research
The Research Department oversees all data collection and analysis for the five court departments served by the
Commissioner of Probation and provides regular data analysis for caseload metrics and monthly reporting.
Caseload data, including FY 2024 data, is reported by each court monthly, and then displayed through public
tableau dashboards, which can be found at Profile - mpsresearchdept | Tableau Public.
Data in the dashboards include monthly caseload and trend dashboards for the Superior, District, BMC, and
Juvenile Courts, an additional non-delinquency dashboard for the Juvenile Court, and a Dispute Intervention
Dashboard, an Investigation Trends Dashboard, and a Monthly Caseload Dashboard for the Probate and Family
Court.

Compliance Credits
Beginning in 2020, under Mass. General Laws, c.276 § 87B, a
probationer may be eligible for Compliance Credits, which reduce
the length of post-disposition probation supervision. To be
eligible, the probationer’s sentence must include incarceration,
followed by a term of probation supervision upon conviction of
one or more criminal offenses. The offender's probation
supervision must begin after 1/13/2019, and because
compliance credit accrual only begins on the second year of
supervision, the length of probation must be thirteen months or
greater. Probationers who are under post-disposition supervision
for a sex offense as defined in section 178C of chapter 6 are not
eligible.
If a probationer is eligible, they receive five days off their
probation sentence for each month they are in compliance during
their second year of supervision, and ten days off their probation
sentence for each month they are in compliance after their
second year of supervision. Accrual of credits is incremental,
meaning that the number of credits deducted is gradually, over
time. The total number of months sentenced to probation does
not dictate the amount of time the probationer may deduct from
their sentence, only the number of months they are in
compliance. If a probationer is found in violation of probation,
they do not earn any credits for the time they were in violation.
The Research Department is responsible for the identification,
calculation, and overall tracking of Compliance Credits statewide.
At any given time, over 3,000 probationers are being tracked.
While local courts are responsible for identifying eligible cases,
Research works with the field to confirm eligibility, recalculate
end dates based on non-compliance, and conduct periodic
reviews of compliance credit eligibility rates, as well as case
closure rates.
The Department works with the Legal Unit on complex eligibility
issues and travels throughout the state to offer compliance credit
trainings.

The Massachusetts Probation Service Research Department undertakes various projects to support those in
the field. Their mission is to enhance data-driven decision-making and support the development of effective
strategies to improve probation outcomes.
The data initiatives they engage in inform policy and reflect the current state of programming within MPS.
These projects address topics of interest within each Probation Department and aim to promote evidence-
based practices. Additionally, these initiatives can require the research team to collaborate with other internal
units or outside agencies.

The Massachusetts Probation Service’s Victim Services Unit (VSU) is dedicated to providing victims and survivors
of crime with notification, information, and assistance throughout the probationary period. The VSU provides
assistance with safety planning, referrals to appropriate resources, court accompaniment, and crisis intervention.
The VSU is committed to delivering services to victims and survivors of crime in a trauma-informed manner that
addresses the devastating and long-lasting impacts of crime. The VSU works diligently to address victims and
survivors’ questions and concerns, in addition to ensuring their rights are met under the Victim Bill of Rights (M.G.L.
Chapter 258B, Section B).
The VSU collaborates with probation officers, court personnel, post-conviction agencies, prosecutors, advocates,
law enforcement, and victim service organizations to ensure coordinated and seamless service delivery.
VSU Objectives:
Increase knowledge, skills or competency of the VSU staff
Maintain strong relationships with other service providers
Assist client/victim involvement in the criminal legal system
Provide client/victim with information to engage in the criminal justice system
Enhance the safety of client/victims

Domestic Violence High Risk Team (DVHRTs)
DVHRTs are multi-disciplinary teams with membership from a broad spectrum of agencies who work with
victims, survivors, and offenders. The teams are focused equally on promoting victim safety and offender
accountability. Team members share information on high-risk cases to create individualized intervention
plans, provide ongoing risk management, track case dispositions, and promote victim safety. They also
work together to leverage all possible safety options for victims at highest risk. In FY 2024, the MA
Probation Service Victim Services Unit participated within 29 different teams within all counties in the
Commonwealth.
In FY 2024, the staff participated in the following:
Governors Council to Address Sexual Assault, Domestic Violence and Human Tra cking – appointed
member
Justice-Involved Women Panel – appointed member
Domestic Violence Fatality Review, State Team – appointed member
Supreme Judicial Court Committee on Restorative Justice – appointed member

Kindness Rocks
The Massachusetts Probation Service Training and
Operations Center (MTOC) hosted a Kindness Rocks
Workshop in honor of Victim Rights Month and Sexual
Assault Awareness Month in April. MPS staff
participated in the workshop led by Megan Murphy, the
creator of the widely successful Kindness Rocks Project.
Ms. Murphy led the exercise of how to look within
yourself to paint a message that may be meaningful to
the person who sees it. Kindness Rocks cultivate hope, a
message that you personally need and sending it to
others hoping it means something to them.
"The Kindness Rock workshop reminded all of us that one message at the right time can change someone’s day or
life," said Corinn Nelson, Statewide Manager of the Victim Services Unit (VSU). "Painting the rocks was an exercise
in reflection, self-compassion and recognizing the shared emotions in all of us. It was an uplifting and fun
afternoon where everyone could let their thoughts and creativity shine."

In the Community: Project PACK
Assistant Statewide Manager of Victim Services Courtney Bacon, Statewide Manager of the Victim Services Unit Corinn Crowninshield,
Victim Services Coordinators Zoe Nardone and Cara Greblick, Commissioner of Probation Pamerson Ifill, Victim Services Coordinators Mary
Nugent, Keira Hom, Erin Beech, Abigail Ford, Lindsey Maxwell, Tara Howard, and Jennifer Scott.
In April, the Victim Service Unit’s Project PACK drive collected hundreds of items which were donated to local
hospitals and provided to patients who are victims of crime. Twenty courts across the state and the
Massachusetts Probation Service Training & Operations Center (MTOC) served as collection sites.
Project PACK is a nonprofit organization that donates Post Assault Comfort kits to hospitals which then
provide them to sexual assault victims. The kits contain socks, undergarments, tissues, and toiletries such as
toothbrushes, toothpaste, lotion, and deodorant.
“I am so very thankful to our amazing staff who participated in the Project PACK drive to honor April as Sexual
Assault Awareness Month and Victim Rights Month. We donated items to victims and survivors to use during
one of the most challenging times of their lives. The MPS staff continues to make a difference in the lives of
victims and survivors of crime,” said Corinn Crowninshield, VSU Statewide Manager.
Recognition:
This year, Jennifer Scott, a Victim Services Coordinator in western
Massachusetts, was recognized for her decade of service in victim
advocacy.
“Jennifer Scott is an amazing advocate. She is one of our newest
coordinators and comes to us after years of service as a SafePlan
advocate. Her work has had a strong impact on victims and survivors,”
said Corinn Crowninshield, Statewide Manager of Victim Services.
Ms. Scott was honored virtually during a social media campaign
conducted by the Massachusetts Office of Victim Assistance (MOVA).
Ms. Scott began working as a SAFEPLAN advocate in western
Massachusetts in 2011.

Electronic Monitoring (ELMO)
The Massachusetts Probation Service’s (MPS) Electronic Monitoring (ELMO) Program was first established in April
2001 as an alternative to incarceration and to provide structure, control, and accountability for probationers who
were sentenced to house arrest by a judge. The program also provides an extra layer of supervision, with the goal
of improving public safety in the community.
The two tools ELMO uses to monitor clients are GPS and remote breath alcohol monitoring devices. A person is put
on GPS monitoring and/or remote breath alcohol monitoring after a judicial order, or an order by the Parole Board
or Department of Corrections (DOC). GPS devices are used to enforce court-mandated curfews and court orders,
including house arrest. Remote breath alcohol monitoring devices are used to monitor people who are court-
ordered to remain alcohol-free. The ELMO Unit collaborates with supervising officers throughout the state to
monitor clients.
The Electronic Monitoring (ELMO) Unit’s mission is to use technology as a tool for monitoring probationers,
parolees, inmates, and litigants (clients). ELMO provides structure and accountability, with the goal of changing
behavior, ensuring compliance with court orders, enhancing public safety in the community, and reducing
recidivism. Providing support to our stakeholders is our primary objective.
Secure Continuous Remote Alcohol Monitoring (SCRAM)
The MPS currently uses SCRAM (Secure Continuous Remote Alcohol Monitoring) remote breath device. The
SCRAM remote breath device is a handheld, wireless unit that provides an accurate and efficient way to supervise
people who are court-ordered to stay alcohol-free. The device delivers real-time access to a client’s breath alcohol
test results by pinpointing the GPS location within six feet and using advanced Automated Facial Intelligence (AFI)
software as it photographs the client breathing into a tube to test their breath alcohol concentration (BrAC).
The ELMO Unit staff monitors breath alcohol test results and responds to missed and positive alcohol tests. Clients
ordered on the SCRAM remote breath device are typically tested for alcohol multiple times per day. Daily testing
schedules, guided by court orders, are developed by supervising officers. In addition to fixed scheduled testing, the
SCRAM remote breath device can do random and on-demand testing. If a client fails to take his/her scheduled test
or tests positive for alcohol, an alert is generated to immediately notify the ELMO Unit. Violations are handled by the
same warrant protocol that applies to GPS monitoring.

Exclusion Zones
Exclusion zones are geographical areas from which a person is excluded from entering (e.g. a victim’s residence, schools,
parks, or playgrounds). If the GPS tracking device enters an exclusion zone, an immediate alert is generated. Next, ELMO
staff verify that the zone is in the proper location and check all GPS points. The client is then contacted and advised to
leave the location. If the client is a sex offender, the local police department is notified that the client traveled into the
zone. In addition, depending on the time of day, either the supervising probation officer or their supervisor will be
informed as well. Alerts may be escalated to the Warrant Management Unit for further review.
In June 2024, on any day there were over 3,000 different exclusion zones being monitored by the ELMO Unit. Exclusion
zones can vary - a zone may be a victim's residence, an entire city, town, or even a county. Exclusion zones include
restaurants, shopping malls, parks, colleges, and hospitals. To protect victims, a distribution of types of zones was not
included.
In FY 2024, a little over half of all GPS clients had an exclusion zone order (51.1%). On average, a GPS client has roughly
two exclusion zones.
The chart below shows the impact victims have on exclusion zones as part of their GPS monitoring. The data, taken from
June 2024, shows that while on average roughly half of all GPS cases include exclusion zones, this rate increases to
80.9% when a victim is involved with the case.

ELMO Phone Calls, FY 2024:
Communication is an integral part of monitoring individuals on GPS. Comprised of 70 employees, ELMO staff
monitor an average of 5,200 clients daily - 3,645 on GPS and an additional 1,575 on SCRAM. A lot of this
communication is through daily phone calls. Staff must regularly communicate with court personnel from
Probation, other law enforcement personnel, and clients on electronic monitoring regarding a myriad of different
matters regarding electronic monitoring. Courts often call with questions about equipment, installations and
removals, along with general inquiries. Clients often call about alerts. Furthermore, law enforcement call about
general monitoring questions and sometimes information requests/point tracking, most often if there is an
emergency situation.

FY 2024 After Hours Program
Recognizing the need and benefit of accommodating probationers and/or defendant outside of traditional court
hours and locations, in April 2019, the Massachusetts Probation Service established a voluntary after hour
program to increase the availability and ease-of-access of after-hours equipment resolution and DNA sampling.
Currently, there is an after-hour center in each region of Massachusetts. The centers are open between 8:00 and
noon on weekends and early evenings on weekdays. To access the centers, ELMO schedules appointments with
the clients depending upon their need and location.
In FY 2024, Probation Officer IIs completed 352 jobs at after-hours sites. After hour shift assignments include the
installation, maintenance, and support of electronic monitoring and/or remote breath monitoring equipment. This
may include replacing lost or non-functioning GPS chargers, re-strapping clients with new bracelets, and
swapping out equipment.

Warrant Management Unit
The Warrant Management Unit (WMU) was established in 2019 to centralize the issuance of after-hours probation
warrants for probationers who do not comply with GPS, SCRAM, and conditions, ensuring consistency and
accountability.
The Unit operates 24/7, reviewing GPS and SCRAM cases for alerts/noncompliance and issuing probation
warrants as needed. ELMO Warrants are active until 11am the next court business day. Staff includes a Chief
Probation Officer, seven Assistant Chief Probation Officers, and an Associate Probation Officer.
When the WMU are presented with an alert, they will

Within the past year, the Warrant Management Unit has worked diligently to decrease the number of warrants
issued on clients on GPS and remote alcohol monitoring. To decrease warrants issued, the department has
strengthened communication and collaboration with clients by using technological resources such as FaceTime
and WhatsApp to clarify equipment issues and better understand problems regarding alerts. These tools help the
unit work with the client to improve behavior and ultimately issue less warrants.
A good example of these resources in use would be for a strap alert. By FaceTiming the client, the WMU may get a
better appreciation of the issues regarding the strap alert, understand if the client is at fault, and recommend
solutions to avoid issuing a warrant.
Warrants for charge and straps have seen significant reductions within the past year, contributing to the overall
decline in warrants by 35.5%.

Rescinded Warrants
There are times when, once a warrant is issued, new details or facts may emerge and/or the probationer has
come into compliance, and the warrant is not suitable. When this happens, the WMU has a process in place
where First Deputy Commissioner Fasano is contacted and provided with the details or facts to determine
whether the warrant should be rescinded.
The ability to rescind a warrant is important because it demonstrates that there are safeguards in place
afterhours for probationers, as well as accountability on Probation's behalf.
Massachusetts Probation takes the rescinding of warrants very seriously and has strived to reduce the number
of occurrences by refining and enhancing the warrant process.
Improvements in this process are reflected not only through the decline of total warrants issued, but also in the
number of warrants rescinded. Since FY 2018, the total number of warrants rescinded has decreased by 78%.
In FY 2024, out of 4,097 warrants, only ten (.244%) of warrants were rescinded.

Digital Forensic Services
Digital Forensic Services (DFS) was founded in the spring of 2023 with the mission to enhance the utilization of
technology among individuals under probation supervision. DFS is dedicated to implementing evidence-based
monitoring practices, particularly in cases involving sex offenders. By adhering to industry-leading tools and
standards, DFS ensures the thorough analysis and interpretation of digital evidence to support the supervision
process.
Matthew Murphy, the new statewide manager of digital forensics
services, joined the Probation Service in May after more than 29 years
with the Massachusetts State Police, 25 of those working in Digital
Forensics Investigation with assignments in the High Tech and
Computer Crimes Division of the Attorney General’s Office, the Cyber
Enforcement Unit at the Middlesex District Attorney’s Office, and the
Unit Commander of the State Policy Cyber Crime Unit. He and a new
team of forensic examiners will provide effective, evidence-based
monitoring of the electronic devices used by probationers pursuant to
court-ordered search conditions.
Essential hardware and software tools were procured to investigate
and analyze electronic devices, such as cell phones and computers.
This will assist probation officers with their checks and oversight of
probationers who are not allowed to contact people or access certain
sites on their devices. The tools will allow the department to
forensically examine their devices to determine if they are in
compliance with their special conditions.
The department was cultivated using a phased implementation that included meetings with the new examiners
and probation officers in the field to discuss case management and digital tool utilization, as well as the
purchasing of digital screening tools. With this, when multiple probationers are at a courthouse, a DFS team
member can travel there and forensically check their devices to make sure they are in compliance.

Information Services Division (ISD)
The Information Services Division works collaboratively to bridge the gap between the status quo and overarching
strategic planning goals and priorities via: (1) the deployment and support of technology tools and resources, (2)
responsible project management, (3) high-quality data analytics, and (4) strategic planning oversight. This diverse
team maintains a deep understanding and appreciation for the complexities of probation work and the many
business processes driven by data and supported by people, passion and partnership. Team members regularly
engage in training and certification opportunities to remain current with a wide-scope of project management
modalities. Among the projects ISD worked on in FY 2024:

Training
Departmental Profile
Recognizing that the success of the Massachusetts Probation Service (MPS) in improving outcomes for
probationers depends on a well‐trained and highly professional workforce, the MPS Training Division is
committed to providing a culture of positive change through a collaborative model of education and
development opportunities to nearly 1,850 staff. Informed by national initiatives and grounded in best
practices, the MPS Training Division fosters a continuous learning environment that is responsive to the
needs of probation staff and the diverse communities we serve. The MPS Training Division is a resource that
inspires, motivates, and, consistent with our overarching strategic plan, develops tomorrow’s probation
talent.
Core Responsibilities
Training and development focuses on continuous improvement and serves, among other purposes, to tether
our more than 100 probation departments and administrative units together. It is the intention of the MPS
Training Division to meaningfully support probation staff in sharing and building upon our culture of
excellence by providing equitable opportunity for professional development through the delivery of evidence-
based, high‐quality training programs and informational resources. Opportunities for professional
development may consist of local education, mandatory and elective instructor‐led training programs, remote
eLearning content, video training, material training, and approved external conferences. Furthering our
commitment to professional development, the MPS Training Division is pleased to offer limited scholarship
dollars to support approved external professional development opportunities aligned with our organizational
mission and vision. The MPS Training Division delivers nearly 300 instructor led training sessions annually
with nearly forty‐percent delivered off‐site at remote locations throughout the Commonwealth.
79

MPS Training Model
The MPS Training Division has embraced a model of program development and delivery that taps into the
vast talent and knowledge of our workforce with a competitive practice of training trainers to deliver
programs. This results in direct engagement of our staff while building institutional capacity for offering
programs that are responsive to the continuing, changing needs of the field. Instructor and Subject Matter
Experts call outs begin a process of development that allows staff to self‐select which opportunities align
with their professional goals and interests, resulting in low instructor attrition.
The MPS Training Division develops comprehensive curriculum that goes beyond individual training
programs. While traditional trainings tend to be of the ‘one and done’ variety, the MPS Training Division
promotes more integrated experiences resulting in application of the knowledge skills and ability learned in
more traditional settings. Resources, local application and coaching, in services, bring‐backs, booster
sessions, and performance measures all play a role in their totality of experiences.
Experiential learning also plays a role in a comprehensive curriculum model. For example, programs and
modules such as ‘A Day in the Life’ and ‘Beyond Probation’ expose staff to the work of probation departments
outside their own and partner agencies through discussion panels, facility tours, and guided discussions.
In addition to managing training and development across our organization, the MPS Training Division
provides logistical and technical support to the field as well as a wide scope of internal and external partners
holding regular meetings at the MPS Training and Operations Center. Furthermore, the MPS Training Division
is heavily engaged in managing statewide initiatives and curriculum development committees.
FY 2024, Training Throughout This Report
In FY 2024, the Training Department was responsible for 489 training sessions, totaling over 7,150 hours. The
extensiveness, variety, and value of trainings can be seen throughout this report. The material and training
most applicable to each department is featured under each division. Presenting the number of trainings
relevant to each area demonstrates how much Probation and its employees rely on and are supported by the
Training Department through on-going education, communication, and support.

Substance use disorder is prevalent within the Massachusetts Probation population. Risk Need probationers
assessed with the Ohio Risk Assessment System (ORAS) show that 64.4% have used illegal drugs, while 43.7% of
probationers have or had problems caused by drug use. Therefore, it is important that those supervising
probationers understand key concepts and ideas regarding substance use in order to support and help them in the
best ways. In FY 2024, the following trainings were provided to educate probation employees about substance use
disorder.

Diversity, Equity and Inclusion
Pledge to DEI: In our ongoing commitment to uphold diversity, equity, inclusion, unity, equality,
and peace, we pledge:
To Engage in Learning - We listen, engage in thoughtful dialog, and share educational and developmental platforms for
MPS staff, one another, and community, so we may support ourselves in raising our awareness and understanding
about equality, justice, and inclusivity.
To Cultivate a Safe Sanctuary- We cultivate a department culture that embraces people of all color, faiths, gender,
partnerships, experiences, and capacities, where we foster a kind and caring environment that is safe, judgment-free,
and protected, holding ourselves responsible for honoring all as unique individuals.
To Advocate for Diversity - We embody our core principles of diversity and inclusion by actively collaborating with all
MPS staff, embracing all faiths, all cultures, and all partnerships, empowering ourselves to expand our knowledge, and
allocating resources for promoting diversity.
To Be Accountable - We are vigilant in analyzing our processes, examining our content, imagery, words, and actions to
be aligned with our core principles. We are taking accountability for our division and calling ourselves out if we are not
following our own commitment to be the change we seek.
While the Training Department regularly incorporates the values and principles of DEI, ensuring a framework that
supports the full and fair participation of all employees, there were special programs created that focused
specifically on the importance of DEI topics, among them in FY 2024:

This training was an adaptation from previous sessions offered by Maebright Group LLC. As people
are becoming more aware of LGBTQIA+ identities, it can often feel like unfamiliar terrain for some.
This training provided an overview of concepts and terms to understand the diverse array of
LGBTQIA+ identities, experiences, and cultures. We discussed the components, nuances, and
differences between sexual orientation, gender identity, and gender expression. We also paid
special attention to transgender, including non-binary, identities, as trans experiences may be newer

wellness, and access look like for LGBTQIA+ people, as well as better practices for creating a
respectful, supportive environment for working with LGBTQIA+ people in a probation setting.
Objectives of this training were to integrate training curricula to better manage the identities of
probation-involved parties, have attendees gain familiarity with rules, policies and procedures
applicable to CARI and DCJIS, and expertly navigate the MassCourts application with a high degree
of e ciency.

Second Annual MPS Pride Day celebrates LGBTQIA+ community and its history
This second annual celebration, hosted
by the Massachusetts Probation
Service’s Training Division, took place
June 17th at the Massachusetts
Probation Service Training and
Operations Center (MTOC) in Clinton.
First Deputy Commissioner Dianne
Fasano, members of MPS’ LGBTQIA+
Instructors, and MPS’ Training Team
kicked off the day’s activities. James
Shultis of the Massachusetts
Commission on LGBTQ Youth shared
information, terms, and data about
young people who identify as
LGBTQIA+ in the Commonwealth. The
event was open to the Clinton
community. Kneeling, left to right: Kristin Scribner, Training Services Operations Coordinator, and
James Hotaling, Program Manager; Standing, left to right: Patricia Gavin, Training Director;

"We were excited to host MPS' Pride Day Celebration and learn about all of the important contributions and history
of the LGBTQIA+ community as well as hear the poignant stories of the current generation. MPS is committed to
hosting this informative and fun annual event and building on it each year," said First Deputy Commissioner Dianne
Fasano.
Guest speakers—mother and daughter duo: Samantha and Irene Brank—spoke about life as a transgender youth
and a mother’s story of support and challenges. Attendees played Pride trivia and decorated postcards, adding
words of encouragement and support, which will be delivered to Massachusetts LGBTQIA+ organizations.
As guests entered MTOC, they found a space decorated with the rainbow colors of the LGBTQIA+ community,
including welcoming flags, balloons, and painted stones with the word “PRIDE” along the walkway. A pop-up photo
booth with the words “MPS Has Pride“ was set up for attendees to chronicle the day.
"Having our community of Clinton take part in our event this year was such a great addition. I am really looking
forward to future Pride events where we can continue to show our support to the LGBTQIA+ community," said Ms.
Grady.
The day ended with a recording of Harvey Milk’s 1977 “Hope Speech,” performed by Sir Ian McKellen, followed by a
brief discussion.

Women's History Month, MPS Herstory Project
The 4th Annual Massachusetts Trial Court Women's History Month Celebration and Conference was held on
Wednesday, March 27th. This year's celebration featured an awards ceremony where six trailblazing women and a
community organization that helps women who are unsheltered or facing homelessness were honored.
The 2024 and fourth edition of the MPS Women Herstory Project returned this March. The MPS Training Division
celebrated six MPS women who shared their stories with us during Women's History Month. The impact of
women’s history might seem abstract to some, and less pressing than the immediate struggles of working women
today, but to ignore the vital role that women’s dreams and accomplishments play in our own lives would be a great
mistake. We draw strength and inspiration from those who came before us – and the remarkable MPS women
working among us today. They are part of our collective MPS story, and a truly balanced and inclusive history
recognizes how important women have always been.
This year's recipients were (left to right) Program Manager Jessica Alves, Probation Officer Tawauka Bryant, Program
Manager Sam Shea, Assistant Interstate Compact Coordinator Themar Dumay, Assistant Chief Probation Officer Gloria
Laboy, and Victim Service Coordinator Erin Beech.

The Legal Unit
The Legal Unit provides accessible, proactive, efficient, and risk-conscious in-agency legal representation to
support the overarching mission and priorities of the Massachusetts Probation Service. The Legal Unit strives to
provide user-friendly legal guidance and support to all levels of MPS employees, in conjunction with effectively
representing the interests of MPS with external stakeholders.
Our diverse legal team works in areas such as policy, legislation, training, procurement, contracting, legal
research, and both appellate and trial court litigation. The Legal Unit serves as the Keeper of the Records and
houses the MPS Records Unit, which is responsible for maintaining the Court Activity Record Information System
(CARI) and responding to petitions and orders from the court to seal, expunge, redact, or archive cases when
appropriate.
This Fiscal Year, the Legal Unit conducted a series of virtual trainings titled, "Legal Office Hours", to educate the
field about important legal matters within Probation. The following is a list of topics that were covered over the
past year.
Training Description
Legal O ce Hours: A Review of There are a number of recent Legal Advisories that are speci c to Juvenile Court. This

DNA Conversions/ICOTS Cases
Effective November 10, 2023, to ensure that Probation Officers are aware of which incoming interstate
cases require DNA submission, the Massachusetts Probation Service (MPS) Interstate Unit sends all
accepted incoming interstate cases to the MPS Legal Unit for review. The Legal Unit conducts the felony
conversion.
Upon receiving an accepted interstate probation transfer, the Legal Unit attorney reviews the foreign state’s
statutes under which the probationer was convicted. The attorney then conducts legal research to discover
the elements necessary for conviction in the foreign state. This research may include reviewing caselaw,
trial court documents, and/or public documents which are authoritative in the foreign state.
Once complete, the attorney reviews comparable Massachusetts MA statutes which prohibit similar
conduct as the foreign statute(s). The attorney conducts legal research to discover the elements for
conviction in MA, which often includes review of Model Criminal Jury Instructions (when they are available)
but may also include reviewing other MA legal resources and MA caselaw.
At the conclusion of the analysis, the attorney produces an Interstate Report containing the analysis of the
relevant statutes and a legal recommendation of whether DNA is required as a condition of probation
pursuant G.L. c. 22E § 3 (the statute governing required DNA samples for certain convictions). This report
also includes the legal justification for the recommendation. This report is then forwarded to the Interstate
Unit, the Chief Probation Officer of the supervising court, and the Massachusetts State Police Combined
DNA Index System (CODIS) Unit. The attorney makes themselves available for any subsequent questions by
these parties regarding the legal recommendation regarding DNA.

Recognition: MPS Records Unit (Sealing, Expungement and Identity Management)
This Fiscal Year, the Records Unit
was the recipient of the Trial Court
Excellence Award for their
outstanding collaboration and
teamwork.
The MPS Records Unit is responsible
for three major tasks: sealing records,
expunging records, and identity
management.
Since the 2018 Criminal Justice
Reform Act, the sealing and
expungement of records have
Pictured Left to Right: Assistant CARI Coordinator Vanessa Pierre, Court Administrator Thomas
become a major function of the Trial
Ambrosino, Assistant CARI Coordinator Grace Viviano, CARI Coordinator Sandrine Ribeiro, Former
Court, which the MPS Records Unit is
Chief Justice of the Trial Court Jeffrey A. Locke, Assistant CARI Coordinator Christine Velez,
Administrative Coordinator Annmarie Palermo, Assistant CARI Coordinator Jennifer Montes, responsible for executing.
Assistant CARI Coordinator Rhys Malcolm, Assistant CARI Coordinator Marlene Martins, Assistant
CARI Coordinator Mohamed Abdirahman, Assistant ELMO Coordinator Keith Andrews, Assistant
CARI Coordinator Ann Appolon, Administrative Coordinator Willie English, CARI Manager Sean
Casey, First Deputy Commissioner Dianne Fasano, Deputy Commissioner of Field Services Brian
Mirasolo, and Commissioner of Probation Pamerson Ifill.
The processes for sealing and expungement are incredibly complex, but despite the size of the task, the unit has
maintained timely responses, even during the challenges of the pandemic.
When a petition to seal is received, the unit utilizes record indexes, including MassCourts, Inmate Web, Parole Web,
AFIS, the Sex Offender Registry Board, or the Department of Criminal Justice Information Services (DCJIS), to
determine eligibility. Only after checking each source can the unit execute sealing a petition. In FY 2024, the unit
sealed 59,298 charges.
The process for expungement requires many of the same checks as sealing but adds additional restrictions, such
as the petitioner's age at the time of the offense and restrictions on the type and manner. In FY 2024, they received
1,250 expungement petitions. These statistics do not include orders to expunge that are first filed with the court, as
opposed to a petition to OCP. In FY 2024, the Unit received 306 of these orders.
Finally, identity management is essential to the function of the Trial Court by maintaining the court activity record
information (i.e., CARI) and the domestic violence registry for all defendants. They ensure that the proper
information belongs on the correct person's record. Anytime there is a question, the Unit combs through digital
information to determine an accurate identity. This could include RMV records, booking photos, fingerprints, federal
and out-of-state criminal records, and records from other state agencies. The unit also maintains legacy records,
which involve searching microfiches for criminal records dating back to the early 1900s. Proper identity
management is essential to the sealing and expungement functions described above.
Other functions that the Record Units provide are out-of-state records checks for child welfare matters in the
Juvenile and Probate & Family Courts, identity merges, and reviewing and executing orders to dismiss prior to
arraignment.

“Sections 100 F, G, and H” refer to MGL c. 276, §§ 100F, 100G, and 100H (and by implication Sections 100I and
100J). When Petitions to Expunge are filed with the Office of the Commissioner of Probation, pursuant to these
sections, OCP staff must determine whether the petitions satisfy all the statutory eligibility requirements, and if
they do, then notify the prosecuting attorney’s offices and the courts so that the petitions may be docketed and
heard. If or once the petitions are granted (or not), OCP is notified of same.
“Section 100 K” refers to MGL c. 276, § 100K. When Petitions to Expunge are filed directly with the Court, pursuant
to this section, and the Court decides same, the Office of the Commissioner of Probation, is notified if or once any
such petitions are granted.
