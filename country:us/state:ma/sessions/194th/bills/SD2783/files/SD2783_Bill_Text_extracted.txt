2-GEN ECONOMIC MOBILITY PROGRAMS REPORT
AUGUST 2024
REPORT OVERVIEW
Pursuant to line item 4401-1003 of the fiscal year 2024 (FY24) General Appropriations Act (GAA),
the Department of Transitional Assistance (DTA) is required to report on the status of the
administration of a 2-Gen grant program that supports economic mobility among high-risk young
parents. The grant program is jointly administered by DTA and the Department of Public Health
(DPH) through the Massachusetts Pregnant and Parenting Teen Initiative. Because FY2024 has
not concluded before the submission of this report, DTA reported on the previous fiscal year’s
activities.
DEPARTMENT OF TRANSITIONAL ASSISTANCE MISSION
The Department of Transitional Assistance’s; mission is to assist and empower low-income
individuals and families to meet their basic needs, improve their quality of life, and achieve long-
term economic self-sufficiency. We do this through a comprehensive system of programs and
supports, including food and nutritional assistance, economic assistance, and employment
supports. DTA serves one out of every six people in the Commonwealth including working
families, children, older adults, and people with disabilities.
BACKGROUND
In recent years, DTA has emphasized removing economic mobility barriers through policy reforms
and the enhancement of the Department’s employment support programming. Part of this
barrier removal is exploring new approaches to meaningfully engage with families who receive
Transitional Aid to Families with Dependent Children (TAFDC) benefits. Beginning with our Young
Parent Program Request for Responses (RFR) in 2018, the Department has implemented a Two-
Generational (2-Gen) approach in many of our employment and training programs. The 2-Gen
approach recognizes that outcomes for parents and children are intertwined and cannot develop
independently of one another. A 2-Gen approach is of the utmost importance as it is necessary
to address not only the current economic disparities, but how those disparities will continue to
affect future generations.
Additionally, DTA has focused on increasing support and opportunities for parents under 25 in
recent years so that they might receive more coordinated and streamlined services. This work is
coordinated through the Whole Family Approach to Jobs, with leadership and representation
from DTA and the Department of Public Health (DPH). This collaboration supports improving
cross-sector service coordination, particularly for high-risk parents under 25 with young children,
who often are falling through the cracks of service delivery.
2-GEN ECONOMIC MOBILITY PROGRAMS FOR HIGH-RISK YOUTH
Following an investment of $3.5 million in the state’s previous FY23 GAA, DTA entered into an
interagency service agreement (ISA) with the Department of Public Health to continue
administering a 2-Gen grant program that supports economic mobility and cross-sector service
2
collaboration among parents under 25 through the Massachusetts Pregnant and Parenting Teen
Initiative (MPPTI). For more than a decade, MPPTI has provided multidisciplinary, team-based
case management to young parents in Massachusetts; with a goal of increasing life opportunities
and enhancing family stability among expectant adolescents and young families in priority
populations and communities.
DTA and DPH continued to work with nine community-based agencies to provide targeted
support to high-risk expectant and parenting adolescents using the MPPTI model. All funded
agencies served at least one community with high teen birth rate (Tier 1 community), while some
agencies also served a geographically nearby Tier 2 community with moderate teen birth rates.
Please reference (Table 1) for currently funded community-based agencies and T1/T2 priority
communities.

Since the partnership between DTA and DPH began, MPPTI has served a total of 1,007 parents
under age 25. In FY23, MPPTI served 549 participants. Demographics for FY23 program
participants can be found in Table 2. When the collaboration between DTA and DPH began in
FY21, MPPTI participants included COVID-19 response participants who received services 1-3
times to meet urgent needs related to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, like housing or
rental assistance, utility payment assistance, food, transportation, and assistance with applying
for benefits. Beginning in FY22 and continuing into FY23 and FY24, all participants served are
MPPTI case management participants, meaning they receive more comprehensive ongoing
services, including not only meeting urgent concrete needs, but also case management, health
promotion, education/employment, and child health/parenting services and resources.

CONCLUSION
This DTA and DPH collaboration, along with additional support from Whole Family Approach to
Jobs consultants, has led to concrete efforts that support parents under 25. The agencies have
partnered with the National Parent Leadership Institute to pilot community-based parents under
25 advisories in New Bedford, Worcester, Lawrence, Boston, Holyoke, and Fitchburg. The
importance of their voices in providing quality services and supporting economic mobility has
become increasingly clear, and these advisories provide the opportunity for parents under 25 to
share their story in a safe, meaningful, and effective way. As leaders of the Young Parents with
Young Children Working Group, DTA and DPH are committed to providing all parent under 25
stakeholders an equitable voice in policy and practice. DTA and DPH served as advisors on
matters relating to parents under 25 on the STEPS for Youth: Science to Enhance Policy Success
from the UCLA Center for the Developing Adolescent. STEPS is an interactive, online tool to
inform policymakers and ensure that procurement, programs rules, funding, and policies are
aligned to meet the developmental goals of young people. Additionally, DTA and DPH have been
collaborating with the Center for Child Well Being and Trauma on the development of a toolkit
and community of practice for young parent practitioners. The toolkit is strength-based and racial
equity informed, and the workgroup is in the process of training parent practitioners in the
6
contents of the toolkit. The toolkit draws upon the expertise of many of our organizations and
was reviewed by parents. It covers topics such as adolescent brain development, resilience and
healing centered engagement, best practices in working with parents under 25; focus on key
populations including immigrants; and offers training resources and links to a range of
publications nationally focused on parents under 25. Both DTA and DPH value and look forward
to this continued partnership.

DEPARTMENT OF TRANSITIONAL ASSISTANCE
2-GEN ECONOMIC MOBILITY PROGRAMS REPORT
AUGUST 2024
REPORT OVERVIEW
Pursuant to line item 4401-1003 of the fiscal year 2024 (FY24) General Appropriations Act (GAA),
the Department of Transitional Assistance (DTA) is required to report on the status of the
administration of a 2-Gen grant program that supports economic mobility among high-risk young
parents. The grant program is jointly administered by DTA and the Department of Public Health
(DPH) through the Massachusetts Pregnant and Parenting Teen Initiative. Because FY2024 has
not concluded before the submission of this report, DTA reported on the previous fiscal year’s
activities.
DEPARTMENT OF TRANSITIONAL ASSISTANCE MISSION
The Department of Transitional Assistance’s; mission is to assist and empower low-income
individuals and families to meet their basic needs, improve their quality of life, and achieve long-
term economic self-sufficiency. We do this through a comprehensive system of programs and
supports, including food and nutritional assistance, economic assistance, and employment
supports. DTA serves one out of every six people in the Commonwealth including working
families, children, older adults, and people with disabilities.

In recent years, DTA has emphasized removing economic mobility barriers through policy reforms
and the enhancement of the Department’s employment support programming. Part of this
barrier removal is exploring new approaches to meaningfully engage with families who receive
Transitional Aid to Families with Dependent Children (TAFDC) benefits. Beginning with our Young
Parent Program Request for Responses (RFR) in 2018, the Department has implemented a Two-

share their story in a safe, meaningful, and effective way. As leaders of the Young Parents with
Young Children Working Group, DTA and DPH are committed to providing all parent under 25
stakeholders an equitable voice in policy and practice. DTA and DPH served as advisors on
matters relating to parents under 25 on the STEPS for Youth: Science to Enhance Policy Success
from the UCLA Center for the Developing Adolescent. STEPS is an interactive, online tool to
inform policymakers and ensure that procurement, programs rules, funding, and policies are
