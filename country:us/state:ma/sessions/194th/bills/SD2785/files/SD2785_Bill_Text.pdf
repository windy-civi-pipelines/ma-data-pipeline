About the JJPAD Board
In April 2018, the Legislature passed An Act Relative to Criminal Justice Reform, which created
the Juvenile Justice Policy and Data (JJPAD) Board under M.G.L. Chapter 119, Section 89. The
Legislature charged the JJPAD Board with evaluating juvenile justice system policies and
procedures, making recommendations to improve outcomes based on that analysis, and
reporting annually to the Governor, the Chief Justice of the Trial Court, and the Legislature.

About the Office of the Child Advocate
The Office of the Child Advocate (OCA) is an independent executive branch agency with
oversight and ombudsperson responsibilities, established by the Massachusetts Legislature in
2008. The OCA’s mission is to ensure that children receive appropriate, timely and quality state
services, with a particular focus on ensuring that the Commonwealth’s most vulnerable and at-
risk children have the opportunity to thrive. Through collaboration with public and private
stakeholders, the OCA identifies gaps in state services and recommends improvements in
policy, practice, regulation, and/or law. The OCA also serves as a resource for families who are
receiving, or are eligible to receive, services from the Commonwealth.

Executive Summary
The Juvenile Justice Policy and Data (JJPAD) Board was created by An Act Relative to Criminal
Justice Reform (2018). The Board is chaired by the Child Advocate and comprised of members
representing a broad spectrum of stakeholders involved in the juvenile justice system.
The Legislature charged the JJPAD Board with evaluating juvenile justice system policies and
procedures, making recommendations to improve outcomes based on that analysis, and
reporting annually to the Governor, the Chief Justice of the Trial Court, and the Legislature. The
statute creating the JJPAD Board also placed an emphasis on improving the quality and
availability of juvenile justice system data.
This year’s annual report summarizes the JJPAD Board’s work in Calendar Year (CY) 2024,
including:
• The Board’s completion of a research project focusing on the pretrial phase of the
state’s juvenile justice system, which resulted in a report published in January 2025.1
• An update on the Board’s ongoing research project focused on youth with child welfare
and juvenile justice system involvement (“dually involved youth”).
• The Childhood Trauma Task Force (CTTF)’s 2024 work.
• Monitoring of initiatives launched as a result of JJPAD Board recommendations,
including the Massachusetts Youth Diversion Program and OCA’s Juvenile Justice Data
Website.
Current and prior legislation impacting the juvenile justice system.
o
This report also describes juvenile justice system Fiscal Year (FY) 2024 data trends and key
takeaways from the data, including:
1. The increase in entries to the juvenile justice system has slowed significantly in the
last year after two years of large increases following the Covid-19 pandemic. Overall,
the use of Massachusetts' juvenile justice system in FY24 was largely consistent with
FY23 across most court process points, suggesting that the system has stabilized after
the increases in the immediate years after the height of the pandemic.
2. Despite the plateau in overall system use, the use of physical custody is increasing.
There was an increase in the use of physical custody, such as placing a youth under
arrest or holding them in pretrial detention in FY24 compared to FY23. Specifically, the
number of pretrial detention admissions increased 17% between FY23 and FY24, and

the number of arrests increased 7%, while there was no increase in applications initiated
by summons.
3. This increase in the use of physical custody is primarily driven by an increase in arrests
and detention admissions for lower-level offenses. The increase in arrests is primarily
driven by a 13% increase in arrests for misdemeanor offenses, and the increase in
pretrial detention is partially driven by a 21% increase in admissions for lower “grid”2
level offenses.
4. The vast majority of youth held in a locked detention facility are not found to be
dangerous and not ultimately committed to DYS. Research on the negative long-term
impact that even a short stay in a locked detention facility can have on youth is clear –
and yet our system regularly holds youth for a variety of reasons that, the data suggests,
have little to do with their potential threat to public safety, but rather are due to other
circumstances surrounding the youth.3 In FY24, 86% of detention admissions were a
result of something other than a determination that the youth alleged of committing an
offense was “dangerous” as a result of a 58A hearing. This is consistent with previous
years, with data showing that many youth are detained as a result of failing to post cash
bail or due to violations of pretrial or probation condition.4 Additionally, in FY24, 87% of
pretrial detention admissions did not result in commitment once the case was resolved
in the court system. This data suggests that if appropriate community supports are
provided, a portion of youth detained pretrial could be safely diverted away from
pretrial detention.
5. Racial disparities are worsening across many process points: Disparities are worsening
as a result of a decrease in system use for white youth, and an increase in system use for
Black and Latino youth between FY23 and FY24. As the Board has highlighted in previous
reports, disparities are starkest at the “front door” of the juvenile justice system. In
FY24:
• Black youth were 4.03 times more likely to be the subject of an application for
complaint in Juvenile Court compared to white youth in Massachusetts. Black
youth were 5.42 times more likely to be arrested compared to white youth in
MA, compared to 2.96 times more likely to be issued a summons.
2 DYS measures offense severity by a numerical (1-7) “grid level.” Grid levels 1-2 are categorized as low, grid level 3= medium
and grid levels 4-7 = high. The most common charge for a youth held in detention is assault & battery, which is classified as Grid
Level 2 (low). Grid 2 can also include other assault and battery charges, such as assault and battery with a dangerous weapon
(ABDW), no/minor injury. The charge type, which is determined by the District Attorney’s Office, is only one factor among many
that the judicial system is legally required to consider when making decisions regarding pretrial detention. For more
information on DYS’ grid level system, see Appendix E.

• Latino youth were 2.53 times more likely to be the subject of an application
for complaint in Juvenile Court compared to white youth in Massachusetts.
Latino youth were 3.26 times more likely to be arrested compared to white
youth in MA, compared to 1.98 times more likely to be issued a summons
Further, data shows that applications for complaint for Black and Latino youth are
dismissed or diverted at a substantially higher rate than applications for white youth.
An estimated 77% and 74% of applications for complaint involving Black and Latino
youth, respectively, did not reach a disposition. This is compared to 31% of applications
for complaints involving white youth. This suggests that Black and Latino youth may be
more likely to be brought to court for situations that the court system ultimately
determines do not require prosecution and adjudication than white youth. Given the
negative impact that any arrest and court involvement, even if it is resolved at an early
stage of the process, can have on youth, this is a concerning trend.
6. There are substantial increases in the use of physical custody for girls. Between FY23
and FY24, arrests of girls increased by 19%, overnight arrests by 22%, detention
admissions by 49%, and first-time commitments to DYS by 10%. Although the majority
of arrests and admissions are for boys, in all cases the rate of increase for girls was
substantially higher this past year than in prior years, signaling a concerning change in
practice, youth behaviors and needs, or all of these.
7. Key state-level reforms have made an impact on the number of young people coming
into the system, but room for improvement, particularly in the use of physical
custody, remains. The number of youth coming into contact with the juvenile justice
system had declined across almost every process point for which the Board has data
since 2018, when Massachusetts passed the Criminal Justice Reform Act.5 This piece of
legislation, along with the 2020 Policing Bill,6 were two major pieces of legislation with
specific juvenile justice-related provisions. However, as the data in this report highlights,
there is room for improvement, most notably in the arrest, overnight arrest, and pretrial
detention stages and for the following cohorts of youth:
• Black and Latino youth
• Girls
• Youth alleged of lower-level offenses
• Youth held pretrial due to reasons other than public safety threats
The Board is concerned about the trends in system use of custodial process points and for
certain cohorts of youth, and encourages the state to implement recommendations that the

Board has made in prior reports, specifically those aimed at reducing racial and ethnic
disparities as well as the use of arrests and pretrial detention:
1. The state should divert more youth pre-arraignment by expanding opportunities for
state diversion including supporting and expanding both the Massachusetts Youth
Diversion Program and the list of offenses eligible for judicial diversion.
2. The state should improve how pretrial conditions of release are set and re-visited
throughout the pretrial process, and create a well-resourced continuum of
interventions across state to support youth in the community rather than pretrial
detention.
3. Police departments should re-examine which department policies and practices may
be contributing to racial and ethnic disparities in arrests through data informed
measures such as reviewing the Department’s internal data to see if the disparities in
arrests highlighted in this report are replicated at the department and/or individual
officer level, and requiring officers to document why they decided to arrest a youth
instead of seeking a summons.
The state should also fully implement the juvenile provisions in the 2020 Policing Bill to
address the increase in arrests for certain populations like Black youth, Latino youth, and girls.
Specific provisions yet to be fully implemented include:7
1. The 2020 Policing Act requirement that all law enforcement agencies be certified by the
POST Commission regarding juvenile operations, among other procedures. This is
ongoing work by POST Commission and, as of January 2025, POST has received public
comment on its draft requirement for police department certification regarding juvenile
operations. If the POST Commissions’ police department certification includes provisions
on when to issue a summons, make an arrest, or divert a youth, as recommended by the
Board’s 2022 Report,8 the number of arrests could go down, and youth might be treated
more equitably across the state.
2. The 2020 Policing Act directs DESE to report school-based arrests, citations, and court
referrals made each school year. DESE started reporting this data in 2020. However,
data quality concerns remain given the small number of school districts reporting data
and the very low counts reported by some large school districts.9 The Commonwealth
does not currently have available data on where the increase in custodial arrests is
7 Several other key provisions have not been implemented in the 2020 Policing Bill. Those are listed in Appendix B.

taking place, and school-based data could provide an important piece of information for
informed policy solutions.
Each year, the JJPAD Board relies on the data presented in this report to determine what new
research projects or initiatives to launch. Previous annual reports informed the Board’s ongoing
work to make recommendations to prevent crossover from DCF to DYS. This year’s data also
indicates the need for a deeper dive into the data on justice system involvement of girls and
Black/Latino youth, as well as county-level differences, to make further policy
recommendations. The OCA will release additional analyses of these areas later this year.

Introduction
The Juvenile Justice Policy and Data (JJPAD) Board was created by An Act Relative to Criminal
Justice Reform (2018).10 The Board is chaired by the Child Advocate and comprised of members
representing a broad spectrum of stakeholders involved in the juvenile justice system.
The Legislature charged the JJPAD Board with evaluating juvenile justice system policies and
procedures, making recommendations to improve outcomes based on that analysis, and
reporting annually to the Governor, the Chief Justice of the Trial Court, and the Legislature. The
statute creating the JJPAD Board also placed special emphasis on improving the quality and
availability of juvenile justice system data, as well as measuring racial/ethnic and gender
disparities in the system.
The JJPAD Board has two standing subcommittees,
one focused on data (referred to as the “Data
Subcommittee” in this report) and one on
community-based interventions (CBI) such as
diversion (referred to as the “CBI Subcommittee”
JJPAD Board
in this report). The Childhood Trauma Task Force
(CTTF), which was also created by An Act Relative
Community Based
Data Childhood Trauma
Interventions to Criminal Justice Reform, and which, by statute,
Subcommittee Task Force
Subcommittee
has its membership drawn from the membership
of the JJPAD Board, also operates under the
umbrella of the JJPAD Board. The CTTF is
statutorily mandated to produce an annual report
to the Legislature as well.11

Summary of JJPAD Board & Childhood Trauma Task Force 2024 Work
The JJPAD Board, CTTF, and Subcommittees met virtually throughout the year. This year, the
Board completed a project on the pretrial phase of the juvenile justice system, continued
research into a project on youth involved in both DYS and DCF in Massachusetts and continued

its ongoing work of monitoring the implementation of its previous recommendations as well as
state legislation.13
This next section summarizes these initiatives, as well as the work of each Subcommittee and
the JJPAD Board in 2024.
JJPAD Board Research Projects: The Juvenile Pretrial Phase and Dually Involved
Youth
Massachusetts has made a concerted effort to directly and indirectly decrease the use of
pretrial detention for youth over the past decade-plus by limiting the circumstances in which
youth are detained pretrial, as well as limiting overall youth contact with the juvenile justice
system. This effort has been driven by a growing body of research showing pretrial detention
stays – for any length of time – can be harmful and result in negative outcomes for youth and
public safety.14
At the same time, the effort to keep youth out of pretrial detention has impacted other aspects
of the juvenile justice system, specifically throughout the pretrial phase (post-arraignment and
pre-disposition). Further, not all youth who come into contact with our state’s system have fully
realized the benefits of the state’s efforts to limit system contact, most notably youth who are
involved in DCF as well as youth of color.
These concerns led the JJPAD Board to launch two
The JJPAD Board’s Pretrial Report
initiatives in 2022: one focused on the pretrial phase,
was published January 2025 and
and one focused on “dually involved” youth who cross
can be found here
over from the child welfare system to detention or
commitment with the Department of Youth Services.
Work on these two projects has continued throughout 2024, and the pretrial phase project was
completed in December.
Dually Involved Youth (DIY) Project
Youth with DCF involvement are significantly overrepresented in our state’s juvenile justice
system. In FY24, 47% (n=420) of all pretrial detention admissions involved youth with current
DCF involvement.15

15 DYS defines DCF involvement as a youth who enters DYS care/custody and either has a pending response, open case with
DCF, or is in the care/custody of DCF. Due to multiple factors including but not limited to the definition of open case, the
definition of dually involved youth, the quality of the youth matching process, and the data quality and timeliness of data entry,
these counts and rates will vary. Numbers in this report should not be compared to other reports.
Data is unavailable for youth with DCF involvement at other points of the juvenile justice system (e.g., arraigned, placed on
probation). Further breakdowns can be found in the “Specific Cohorts” section of this report.

A youth may experience more than one detention admission within a fiscal year. A youth may be counted one
or more times within a fiscal year. Source: Data provided to the OCA by the Department of Youth Services
Similarly, 37% (n=69) of youth committed to DYS for the first time in FY24 had DCF involvement
at the time of their commitment.
While both local and national data clearly demonstrate that child welfare involvement can
increase the likelihood of juvenile justice system involvement, we know very little about the
unique circumstances specific to Massachusetts that lead to youth involved with DCF being
detained pretrial and/or committed to DYS. This project aims to fill that gap by answering the
following questions:
1. Who is dually involved and why?
2. Are there policies and practices specific to Massachusetts that are contributing to dual
involvement?
3. Are there policies and practices that could help prevent/reduce dual involvement?
4. Can any of these youth be diverted – either from detention or the juvenile justice
system entirely?
5. What community-based interventions or supports need to exist for that to happen?
To answer these questions, the Board is employing mixed methods:
Interviews with stakeholders: OCA staff have been conducting interviews with professionals,
stakeholders, and people with experience in the juvenile justice and child welfare system to
learn about first-hand experiences and practices within these systems. To date, OCA staff have

conducted 64 interviews, representing 94 stakeholders. The OCA plans to continue these
interviews in 2025.
Data Analysis: In partnership with DYS, DCF, and OCA, the Data Subcommittee will analyze data
on youth with both DYS and DCF involvement in FY22 or FY23.
Case File Review: Additionally, OCA staff will conduct a case file review for each youth
identified. The goal of this case file review is to collect and analyze detailed qualitative data on
the circumstances surrounding the alleged delinquent offense that initiated contact with the
juvenile justice system (e.g., time and place of arrest) as well as the youth’s involvement with
DCF.
In addition to the methods above, the CBI Subcommittee will also conduct a review of any
current policies that could be contributing to youth being dually involved and conduct a
national review of other state’s policies and practices for this population.
Childhood Trauma Taskforce (CTTF) 2024 Work
In 2024, the CTTF continued its legislative mandate to determine how the Commonwealth can
better identify and provide services to youth who have experienced trauma. The CTTF Annual
Report16 summarizes the work of the CTTF and the Office of the Child Advocate’s (OCA) Center
on Child Wellbeing & Trauma (CCWT).
The CTTF’s 2024-2025 Work Plan (detailed more in the group’s Annual Report) focuses on
Massachusetts state agencies’ and partners’ training on childhood trauma and resilience. This
project has three goals:
1. Map out training provided to state employees and contracted providers working with
children and families.
2. Assess whether state agencies have adequate resources and capacity to increase child
serving professionals’ knowledge of childhood trauma and resilience.
3. Develop recommendations to support agencies in offering child trauma and wellbeing
training to their staff and contracted providers.
The CTTF is actively engaged in the research phase of this project and anticipates developing
findings and recommendations in the Task Force’s 2025 Annual Report
Continued Oversight of Prior Initiatives and Impact of Legislation
The JJPAD Board is charged with studying “the implementation of any statutory changes to the
juvenile justice system” and continues to monitor prior recommendations and projects.

Maintaining and Updating the Interactive Juvenile Justice Data Website
As recommended in the JJPAD Board’s June 2019 report, and as envisioned by the Legislature in
An Act Relative to Criminal Justice Reform, the OCA, in partnership with the Executive Office of
Technology Services and Security (EOTSS) and with the Data Subcommittee as advisors,
launched a juvenile justice system data website in 2020 which makes aggregate juvenile justice
system data publicly accessible.
In July 2024, the Office of the Child Advocate published a new data dashboard reporting data
on racial and ethnic disparities. The JJPAD Board has highlighted the persistent racial and ethnic
disparities in the juvenile justice system in each of its annual reports17 and in its 2022 report
titled Racial and Ethnic Disparities at the Front Door of Massachusetts’ Juvenile Justice
System.18
This new racial and ethnic disparities page explains how the state measures disparities in the
juvenile justice system and gives users the ability to explore the racial and ethnic disparities
that exist across juvenile justice process points and over time.
Monitoring the Implementation of the Massachusetts Youth Diversion Program
In its 2019 report on diversion, the JJPAD Board found that there were no statewide standards
or guidelines in Massachusetts regarding the use of diversion, and no entity that provided
oversight for diversion practices. 19 That report recommended the creation of a statewide
diversion program to ensure that youth across the Commonwealth had equitable access to high
quality, state-funded diversion programming.

Timeline
the Legislature in the state budget, the Office of
the Child Advocate (OCA) partnered with the
Department of Youth Services (DYS) to
launch the Massachusetts Youth Diversion Program
(MYDP), a multiphase state-funded youth
diversion initiative that provides high-quality,
evidence-based programming that can serve as an
alternative to arresting youth or prosecuting them
through the Juvenile Court.
In 2024, the OCA contracted with ForHealth, the
consulting division at UMass Chan Medical School,
to provide an independent assessment of the
MYDP program, examining initial data from the
first three pilot sites and conducting qualitative
interviews to identify what was working and what
could be improved. The evaluation found high
levels of program fidelity to the original evidence-
based model and high rates of satisfaction among
referrers. Importantly, youth participants also
reported high levels of satisfaction with the
program. This evaluation is available online here.
In June of 2024,20 the OCA released a report
analyzing the implementation of the second year of diversion programming .21 Key findings from
the report include:
• The program grew its reach: In CY23, 229 youth participated in the program, a 151%
increase (n=91) from CY22.
• More youth completed diversion successfully: by the end of CY23, 178 diversion cases
were closed, with 160 of those youth (90%) completing the program successfully,
compared to 74% (n=45) in CY22.
Monitoring and Reporting on the Implementation of Any New Legislation Impacting the Juvenile
Justice System
Each year, the JJPAD Board monitors the implementation of new legislation and uses available
data to analyze whether legislative and agency policy changes are having their intended effect

and if there are any implementation challenges. Since the Board began meeting in 2018, two
major pieces of legislation have passed that impact the juvenile justice system: An Act relative
to criminal justice reform (2018), which established the JJPAD Board 22 and An Act relative to
justice, equity and accountability in law enforcement in the Commonwealth (2020)23 referred
to in this report as the “2020 Policing Act.”
As the “Key Takeaways” section below notes, these state reforms have made a positive impact
on the Commonwealth’s juvenile justice system, but room for improvement remains.
Implemented Juvenile Provisions of the 2018 Criminal Justice Reform Act
• Raised the lower age of criminal responsibility from age 7 to age 12
• Removed Juvenile Court jurisdiction for violations of local ordinances and first, low-
level misdemeanor offenses including disorderly conduct
• Decriminalized “disturbing lawful assembly” and “disorderly conduct” offenses for
students under 18 when in school or at school events
• Authorized Juvenile Court judges to divert youth pre-arraignment for certain charges
• Removed the requirement that police departments contact Probation when there is
a written request to detain a child overnight
• Mandates that a child shall not be placed in restraints during court proceedings
unless there is reason to believe that a juvenile presents an immediate and credible
risk of escape or poses a threat to their safety or the safety of others.
• Mandates the creation of a uniform booklet of informational material provided to
youth in the custody of DYS regarding their juvenile record and how that information
can be accessed and distributed, as well as information on sealing records. EOPSS
published this booklet of information in 2019. *

Implemented Juvenile Provisions of the 2020 Policing Bill
• Established a “Model School Resource Officer MOU Commission” to address
Memoranda of Understanding (MOU) between schools with school resource officers
(SROs) and local police departments to reconvene every five years. As a result of a
state-led commissions, in February 2022, a model SRO MOU was released by EOPSS
and DESE with minimum standards for all school districts with an SRO to follow. *
• Mandated that DESE “collect data on the number of mental and social emotional
health support personnel and school resource officers … employed by each local
education agency and shall publish a report of the data on its website.” **
• Required the Municipal Police Training Committee (MPTC) to establish an in-service
training program on multiple domains including developmentally appropriate de-
escalation tactics and other alternatives to use of force on youth.
• Required MPTC to establish an in-service training program School Resource Officer
(SRO) training to include specific components as outlined by statute, and that the
curriculum be created shall be created in consultation with experts.
• Gave the POST Commission power to create a specialized certification for SROs. The
POST Commission establishes minimum police certification standards and can deny
an application or limit, condition, restrict, revoke, or suspend a certification for any
reasonable cause. There is an SRO-specific certification that is required of all SROs in
order to serve.
• Required that the Massachusetts Peace Officer Standards and Training (POST)
Commission issue guidance on developmentally appropriate de-escalation and
disengagement tactics and other alternatives to the use of force on youth. ^

Monitoring New Legislation
In addition to monitoring the implementation and impact of enacted legislation, the Board
makes recommendations to the Legislature for needed changes to statutes impacting the
juvenile justice system.
A majority of JJPAD Board members are not able, due to their position in state government, to
endorse specific pieces of legislation. The table below outlines bills that have been filed in the
2025-2027 legislative session that relate to prior policy recommendations made by the JJPAD
Board.24

Juvenile Justice System Data Trends
This section provides an overview of Massachusetts’ juvenile justice system data for fiscal year
(FY) 2024 (July 1, 2023- June 30, 2024) and identifies recent trends in use of the system at
various points in the process.
This section is further broken down into three major parts of the juvenile justice system process
in Massachusetts:
1. The “initial stages” of the juvenile justice system, including data on the use of
diversion, overnight arrest admissions, applications for complaint, the manner in which
youth come to the Juvenile Court’s attention (i.e., via an arrest or summons), and
delinquency filings.
2. Arraignments and pretrial proceedings, including data on 58A (“dangerousness”)
hearings, pretrial supervision and monitoring, pretrial detention admissions, and the
reasons why youth are detained pretrial.
3. Dispositions, sanctions, and dismissals as determined at the time of the initial dismissal
or disposition, as well as data on probation supervision levels and first-time
commitments to DYS.
To the extent available, the data is broken down by:
• offense severity and type,31
• race/ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, and transgender status of youth at the
point of analysis
31 Offense types tell us what kind of offenses youth involved with the justice system are alleged of committing; offense severity
measures the seriousness of offenses. For data tables detailing offense types, and common examples listed, please see
Appendix D.
22

Figure 3: Juvenile Justice System Process Points Whenever possible, data on each process point
is compared to data from:
1. FY23: The Board compares this year’s data to
the prior fiscal year to see what, if any, changes
occurred throughout the system.
2. FY18: Given the JJPAD Board’s charge to
measure the impact of statutory changes to the
juvenile justice system, this report also compares
changes in system use in FY24 to FY18. FY18 is
one year prior to the implementation of the
Criminal Justice Reform Act (CJRA), which
included provisions aimed at keeping youth out
of the juvenile justice system, particularly those
youth accused of first time, lower-level offenses.
The data presented in this annual report is the
most comprehensive to date. This is due to the
JJPAD Board and Data Subcommittee identifying
critical data elements in the state’s juvenile
justice system and the JJPAD member entities
fulfilling increasingly detailed and complex data
requests each year. As discussed in the Board’s
2022 Data Availability Report, data gaps exist in
some places/process points, but since the JJPAD
Board began meeting in FY19, tremendous progress has been made in the amount of publicly
reported data.32
This year, new data reported in this report includes initial bail decisions33 and data on all lead
charges filed in Juvenile Court, due to increased reporting by the Trial Court on its public
dashboards.34

34 “Lead charge” is the first listed charge at case filing, not disposition. This if often, though not always, the most serious charge
alleged against the youth. For more information, see:

The OCA’s Interactive Data Dashboard
In addition to the state-level trends detailed in this report, the OCA’s interactive data
website also presents*:
• county level trends by demographics whenever possible and total system utilization
heat maps at each process point adjusting for youth population rates
• data broken down by age at each process point
• overnight arrest admissions, detention admissions, first-time commitments, and YES
transitions by calendar year
• monthly probation caseload and violation of probation notices issued
• detention and commitment caseload (i.e., individual youth) utilization trends and
demographic breakdowns

Due to continuous data updates, it is recommended that readers do not compare the numbers in this report to previous
reports or presentations. Further, data presented in this report and on the OCA’s website should not be compared to
agency’s public data reporting, as individual entities may update their data at different points in time.
Key Takeaways
1. The increase in entries to the juvenile justice system has slowed significantly in the last
year after two years of large increases following the Covid-19 pandemic. Overall, the use of
Massachusetts' juvenile justice system in FY24 was largely consistent with FY23 across most
court process points, suggesting that the system has stabilized after the increases in the
immediate years after the height of the pandemic.

2. Despite the plateau in overall system use, the use of physical custody is increasing. There
was an increase in the use of physical custody, such as placing a youth under arrest or
holding them in pretrial detention, in FY24 compared to FY23. Specifically, the number of
pretrial detention admissions increased 17% between FY23 and FY24, and the number of
arrests increased 7%, while there was no increase in applications initiated by summons.

3. This increase in the use of physical custody is primarily driven by an increase in arrests
and detention/commitment admissions for lower-level offenses.
• The increase in arrests is primarily driven by a 13% increase in arrests for
misdemeanor offenses.
• The increase in overnight arrest admissions is primarily driven by a 35% increase in
admissions for higher-level severity offenses. However, consistent with prior years,
the majority (60%, n=382) of ONA admissions were for still for an alleged lower
“grid” level offense.
• The increase in pretrial detention admissions is primarily driven by a 21% and 28%
increase in admissions for lower and moderate “grid” level offenses respectively.35
Almost half (48%, n=428) of all detention admissions were for youth alleged of
committing a lower “grid” level offense (i.e., Grid 1 or 2). This is the third year in a
row in which the number of detention admissions has gone up for youth alleged of
committing lower-level offenses, reversing the downward trend of the prior years.
• The increase in first-time commitments was primarily driven by a 16% increase in
commitments for lower “grid” level offenses.
35 DYS measures offense severity by a numerical (1-7) “grid level.” Grid levels 1-2 are categorized as low, grid level 3= medium
and grid levels 4-7 = high. The most common charge for a youth held in detention is assault & battery, which is classified as Grid
Level 2 (low). Grid 2 can also include other assault and battery charges, such as assault and battery with a dangerous weapon
(ABDW), no/minor injury. The charge type, which is determined by the District Attorney’s Office, is only one factor among many
that the judicial system is legally required to consider when making decisions regarding pretrial detention. For more
information on DYS’ grid level system, see Appendix E.

4. The vast majority of youth held in a locked detention facility are not found to be
dangerous as a result of a court hearing and not ultimately committed to DYS. Research
on the negative long-term impact that even a short stay in a locked detention facility can
have on youth is clear – and yet our system regularly holds youth for a variety of reasons
that, the data suggests, has little to do with their potential threat to public safety.36 Indeed,
holding a youth perceived to be a flight risk or who might not have a safe place to return to
are each legal reasons why a youth may be held who is not subject of a 58A Hearing. In
FY24:
• 49% of overnight arrest admissions did not result in a detention admission. This
means that half of youth admitted on an ONA are arrested and then detained for
anywhere between a couple hours to up to about four days, but ultimately released
by a judge who decides the youth does not need to be detained pretrial. The

percentage of ONA admissions that have resulted in a detention admission has gone
down in recent years (58% in FY21 to 51% in FY24).
• 87% of pretrial detention admissions did not result in commitment. This means that
for every 10 detention admissions, almost 9 are held pretrial for an average of about
a month and a half, and ultimately those cases are resolved without a commitment
to the Department of Youth Services post-adjudication.37
• 86% of detention admissions were a result of something other than a determination
that the youth alleged of committing an offense was “dangerous” as a result of a
58A hearing. This is consistent with previous years, with data showing that many
youth are detained as a result of not posting cash bail or due to violations of pretrial
or probation conditions. This may be a result of an increase in the use of pretrial
conditions of release for youth over releasing youth on personal recognizance, or a
lack of community or school supports. In FY24, youth were initially released on PR in
an estimated 56% cases, down from 62% of cases in FY23.38

5. Racial disparities are worsening across many process points: Disparities are worsening as a
result of a decrease in system use for white youth and an increase in system use for Black
37 There are a number of reasons youth detained pretrial are not ultimately committed to the Department including, but not
limited to, a judge using a probation sanction rather than commitment, the case was dismissed, the youth was adjudicated not
delinquent, etc.

and Latino youth between FY23 and FY24. As the Board has highlighted in previous reports,
disparities are starkest at the “front door” of the juvenile justice system. In FY24:
• Black youth were 4.03 times more likely to be the subject of an application for
complaint in Juvenile Court compared to white youth in Massachusetts. Black youth
were 5.42 times more likely to be arrested compared to white youth in MA,
compared to 2.96 times more likely to be issued a summons.
• Latino youth were 2.53 times more likely to be the subject of an application for
complaint in Juvenile Court compared to white youth in Massachusetts. Latino youth
were 3.26 times more likely to be arrested compared to white youth in MA,
compared to 1.98 times more likely to be issued a summons.

Further, data shows that applications for complaints for Black and Latino youth are dismissed or
diverted at a substantially higher rate than applications for white youth. An estimated 77% and
74% of applications for complaint involving Black and Latino youth, respectively, did not reach a
disposition. This is compared to 31% of applications for complaints involving white youth. This
suggests that Black and Latino youth may be more likely to be brought to court for situations
that the court system ultimately determines do not require prosecution and adjudication than
white youth. Given the negative impact that any arrest and court involvement, even if it is
resolved at an early stage of the process, can have on youth, this is a concerning trend.

6. There are substantial increases in the use of physical custody for girls. Between FY23 and
FY24, arrests of girls increased by 19% (from 1,095 in FY23, to 1,304 in FY24), overnight
arrests by 22% (from 104 in FY23 to 127 in FY24), detention admissions by 49% (from 106 in
FY23, to 158 in FY24) and first-time commitments to DYS by 10% (from 20 in FY23 to 22 in
FY24). Although the majority of arrests and admissions are for boys, in all cases the rate of
increase for girls was substantially higher this past year than in prior years.
This higher rate of increase is at least partially driven by the fact that the number of girls in
the system overall is smaller – which means even a small increase in numbers will lead to a
higher percent change. That said, the increases this year are notably higher than prior years,
signaling a concerning change in practice, youth behaviors and needs, or all of these.
Although further research on the underlying drivers of this increase is needed, numerous
interviewees for recent JJPAD Board research projects have raised concerns about the use
of pretrial detention for girls involved with DCF, girls perceived as being at risk for sexual
exploitation, and girls who run away from placements.

7. Key state-level reforms have made an impact on the number of young people coming into
the system, but room for improvement, particularly in the use of physical custody,
remains. As Figure 11, details, the number of youth coming into contact with the juvenile
justice system declined across almost every process point for which the Board has data
since 2018, when Massachusetts passed the Criminal Justice Reform Act. This piece of
legislation, along with the 2020 Policing Bill, were two major pieces of legislation with
specific juvenile justice-related provisions.
The CJRA aimed to reduce the number of youth coming into contact with the system in
general. This has largely been successful. The number of applications for complaint is down
7%, and the number of arraignments has declined 28% since pre-CJRA implementation.

OCA by DYS’ Department of Research
However, as the data in this report highlights, there is room for improvement, most notably
across the following stages:
• Arrests and overnight arrests: In FY24, the number of arrests for youth returned to pre-
CJRA implementation numbers, partially driven by an increase in misdemeanor arrests.
The increase in custodial arrests led to an increase in overnight arrests admissions,
which is a departure from the large decreases in previous years. While that increase was
driven partially by higher-grid level severity offenses and felonies, about half (49%,
n=320) of the youth held on an overnight arrest are not held pretrial by a judge once the
court is back in session.
Further, there is room for improvement in who arrests are used for. As this report
highlights, racial and ethnic disparities are particularly stark at this stage of the juvenile
justice system, and there were increases in arrests and overnight arrests for both Black
and Latino youth between FY23 and FY24, while arrests and ONA admissions declined
for white youth during the same period. Data indicate Black youth and Latino youth are
more likely to be arrested (compared to being issued a summons) and more likely to be
held overnight than white youth in Massachusetts. Further, while boys make up the
majority of arrests, the use of arrests increased 19% for girls between FY23 and FY24.
• Pretrial detention admissions: While overall detention admissions are down 28% from
pre-CJRA, the data indicate room for improvement in the reasons why detention is used,
especially as the number of detention admissions increased between FY23 and FY24. As
mentioned, the increase in pretrial detention admissions is primarily driven by an
32
tniop
ssecorP
Figure 11:
FY18-FY24 Change in Cases/Admissions

increase in admissions for lower and moderate “grid” level offenses. Still, almost half
(48%, n=428) of all detention admissions were for youth alleged of committing a lower-
level offense (i.e., Grid 1 or 2 at DYS).
Data indicates that many youth detained pretrial are not deemed “dangerous” or are
not held as a result of threats to public safety following a 58A hearing. The majority of
detention admissions do not result in youth being committed each year. Instead, many
youth are detained pretrial as a result of failure to post cash bail or violations of pretrial
or probation conditions. This may be a result of an increase in the use of pretrial
conditions of release for youth over releasing youth on personal recognizance, or a lack
of community supports.
Further, there is room for improvement in who is detained pretrial. Data shows that
many detention admissions are for youth with underlying (potentially unmet) needs and
traumatic histories who could be better served in the community prior to juvenile
justice involvement. There are a variety of reasons youth with unmet needs may not
have access to community-based supports. For example, some youth may not be given
that chance due to systemic biases, while other youth may experience institutional
barriers like eligibility requirements, service deserts in the youth’s area, or long waiting
lists.
There are also stark racial disparities. While pretrial detention admissions increased
between FY23 and FY24 across all races, the rate of increase was steepest for Black and
Latino youth. In FY24, Hispanic/Latino youth and Black youth were 2.47 and 2.08 times
more likely to be detained pretrial than white youth, respectively. Additionally, the
number of detention admissions for girls during this time increased 49%.
These concerning trends were also documented in the Board’s Pretrial Report. In the
Board’s research for that report, stakeholders expressed concern that youth were being
held due to factors outside of the alleged offense. This included factors such as inability
to find an appropriate DCF placement for the youth if released, a parent/caregiver’s
refusal to take a youth home from court, or other safety concerns a judge may have for
a youth like if they are sexually exploited or at risk of running away from home.39
The Board is concerned about the trends in system use of custodial process points, and
encourages the state to implement recommendations that the Board has made in prior
reports, specifically those aimed at reducing racial and ethnic disparities as well as the use of
arrests and pretrial detention:
39 The Board is exploring this concept in its ongoing “Dually Involved Youth” project.
33

• The state should divert more youth pre-arraignment by expanding opportunities for
state diversion including supporting and expanding both the Massachusetts Youth
Diversion Program and the list of offenses eligible for judicial diversion.
• The state should improve how pretrial conditions of release are set and re-visited
throughout the pretrial process. This could include providing more guidance on when to
set conditions for youth, re-developing the form used by the Juvenile Court when
conditions are set for release, and/or providing more guidance on the process for
revisiting pretrial conditions of release for youth and addressing violations.
• The state should create a well-resourced continuum of interventions across state
entities (e.g., agencies within the Executive Office of Health and Human Services,
Massachusetts Probation Service) for supervision in the community that meet the
individual needs of each youth rather than pretrial detention.
• Police departments should review internal data to see if the disparities in arrests
highlighted in this report and the Board’s 2022 report are replicated at the department
and/or individual officer level to guide further practice recommendations.
• Police departments should require officers to document why they decided to arrest a
youth instead of seeking a summons and publish their findings.
• Police departments should re-examine which department policies and practices may
be contributing to racial and ethnic disparities in arrests, including policies and
practices regarding how decisions on where (e.g., what neighborhood), when (e.g.,
during the day, in school, overnight), how (e.g., traffic stops, on foot patrol, in schools)
and in what manner (e.g., use of stop & frisk techniques) police enforce public safety.
The state should also fully implement the juvenile provisions in the 2020 Policing Bill to
address the increase in arrests for certain populations like Black youth, Latino youth, and girls.
Specific provisions yet to be fully implemented include:40
• The 2020 Policing Act requirement for all law enforcement agencies to be certified by
the POST Commission regarding juvenile operations, among other procedures. This is
ongoing work by POST Commission and, as of January 2025, POST has received public
comment on its draft requirement for police department certification regarding juvenile
operations. If the POST Commissions’ police department certification includes provisions
on when to issue a summons, make an arrest, or divert a youth, as recommended by the
40 Several other provisions have not been implemented in the 2020 Policing Bill. Those our listed in Appendix B.
34

Board’s 2022 Report,41 the number of arrests could go down, and youth might be
treated more equitably across the state.
• The 2020 Policing Act directs DESE to report school-based arrests, citations, and court
referrals made each school year. DESE started reporting this data in 2020. However,
data quality concerns remain given the small number of school districts reporting data
and the very low counts reported by some large school districts.42 The Commonwealth
does not currently have available data on where the increase in custodial arrests is
taking place, and school-based data could provide an important piece of information for
informed policy solutions.
Each year, the JJPAD Board relies on the data presented in this report to determine what new
research projects or initiatives to launch. Previous annual reports informed the Board’s ongoing
work to make recommendations to prevent crossover from DCF to DYS. This year’s data also
indicates the need for a deeper dive into the data on justice system involvement of girls and
Black/Latino youth, as well as county-level differences, to make further policy
recommendations. The OCA will release additional analyses of these areas later this year.

The Initial Stages of the Juvenile Justice System
If a youth is accused of committing an offense, a police officer has the option to:
• Issue a warning or formally divert the youth to a program.
• Physically arrest the youth, which is called a “arrest” (i.e., using handcuffs and placing a
youth in a police cruiser and/or police lock up).
• Seek a summons for the youth to appear before the Court on a set day.
Massachusetts’ general law states that “a summons is the preferred method of bringing a
juvenile to court.”43 This is reiterated in the state’s Municipal Police Training Committee’s
training and resource materials and in guidance issued by the Peace Officer Standards and
Training (POST) Commission.44 Police officers are instructed to reserve arrests for when an
alleged offense threatens public safety, or if there is “reason to believe the child will not appear
upon a summons.”45
If a youth is arrested, they will be taken back to a police station. Youth cannot be held in a
police lock-up facility for more than six hours, at which point the officer in charge must
determine whether to request the youth be detained or released to a parent/guardian.46 If this
occurs at a time when the Juvenile Court is not in session, a youth may be held overnight or
until the next business day if the arrest is on a weekend at a secure placement operated by or
contracted by the Department of Youth Services (This is called an “overnight arrest”).
If an officer chooses to proceed by summons, they then file an application for complaint with
the Juvenile Court. This is the first step of the Juvenile Court process. After review, or hearing, a
Clerk Magistrate may issue a delinquency complaint. A Clerk Magistrate may decline to issue a
delinquency complaint for a number of reasons, including if they believe there is not probable
cause to find that the youth committed the alleged delinquent act, or if they choose to divert
the youth from further court proceedings. As a result of the 2018 CJRA, Clerk Magistrates
automatically dismiss cases in which youth are alleged to have committed their first
misdemeanor offense away from the Juvenile Court.
Collectively, we refer to these initial steps taken by law enforcement and Clerk Magistrates as
the “initial stages” of the juvenile justice system.

44 See: https://399759da.rocketcdn.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Youth-Guidance1298662.1.pdf
45 In certain instances, police officers do not have the option to seek a summons and must use an arrest (e.g., domestic violence
offenses). For many offenses, however, police officers have the sole discretionary authority to decide whether to arrest a
youth, seek a summons, or give them a warning or offer diversion. MPTC Legal Standards & Procedures for Police Interactions

Diversion
Diversion is a process that allows a youth who is alleged to have committed a delinquent
offense to be directed away from formal juvenile justice system processing. Diversion is
considered an alternative response to arrest and/or prosecution.
In general, diversion types can be divided into two categories:
1. Informal diversion can include any measure that turns youth away from the system,
such as a police officer letting a youth go with a warning.
2. Formal diversion typically takes the form of a specific, structured program with
eligibility and completion requirements. This may include an agreement with a youth
that they will take a specific action, such as writing an apology letter, participating in a
therapeutic program or performing community service.
In Massachusetts, four separate decision-makers – police, clerk magistrates, district attorneys,
and judges – may apply formal and informal diversion practices at various points for youth
involved with the system, from initial contact with police to pre-arraignment.
The point in the process at which youth are diverted matters: earlier use of diversion or case
dismissal can reduce the length of time a youth is involved with the juvenile justice system and
therefore help minimize some of the documented harmful effects to youth of contact with the
justice system.47
State Diversion: Massachusetts Youth Diversion Program (MYDP)
The Massachusetts Youth Diversion Program (MYDP) is a multiphase state-funded youth
diversion initiative that provides high-quality, evidence-based programming that can serve as
an alternative to arresting youth or prosecuting them through the Juvenile Court.
The MYDP is currently operational in seven counties and will be expanding to Norfolk and
Suffolk County in early 2025 (Graphic 2).

In FY24, the MYDP received 343 referrals, representing a 67% increase in referrals from FY23.
This increase was largely a result of a 230% increase in referrals from District Attorneys.

Police Diversion
Police may divert a youth instead of making an arrest or seeking a summons. Although the
system that police use to report data to the state and federal government (the National
Incident Based Reporting System, or NIBRS) has the ability to capture information on police-
offered diversion, and some police departments do report it, there is no statutory requirement
that departments report this data – and many do not. Due to the significant inconsistencies in
police department reporting of their use of diversion/warnings, the Board does not include this
data in our report.
Clerk Magistrate Process
If police proceed by seeking a summons,48 and the alleged offense was a misdemeanor that
occurred outside of police view or the police specifically request one, a clerk magistrate
conducts a hearing (called a “magistrate hearing”) to decide whether to issue a delinquency
complaint.49 A delinquency complaint (otherwise known as a “delinquency filing” in subsequent
sections of this report) may be issued by a clerk magistrate if probable cause is found on an
48 A notice to a person alleging them of committing the specified delinquent offenses and ordering them to attend a hearing on
a date certain.
49 If a case is initiated by an arrest (as opposed to a summons; see the Applications for Complaint section below for this data),
the case generally proceeds directly to a delinquency complaint without a formal magistrate hearing. See “About Applications
for Complaint” here:

application for complaint. A clerk magistrate may also choose to divert a youth’s case at this
point.50
Clerk magistrates may decide not to issue a complaint for several reasons, including diversion,
lack of probable cause, lack of jurisdiction, or failure to prosecute.51 Data is not available on the
various reasons a complaint was not issued, and so the Board cannot report specifically on clerk
magistrate use of diversion. Still, clerk magistrate diversion is the reason that some portion of
these 4,959 cases did not result in a delinquency complaint being issued. Similarly, a portion of
the cases are dismissed as a result of the 2018 CJRA, which requires that youth alleged of their
first misdemeanor offense be diverted away from the system at this point.
More than half (57%, n=2,825) of all summons-initiated applications for complaint did not
result in a delinquency complaint being issued in FY24.
Representation
Consistent with FY23, in FY24, youth were represented by an attorney in 11% of magistrate
hearings (n=567).52 Youth with an attorney present at the magistrate hearing were more likely
to have their complaint diverted/dismissed (64%, n=361) than youth who did not have
representation (56%, n=2,464).
District Attorney Diversion
District attorneys may divert a youth pre-arraignment. In CY24, District Attorneys’ Offices
(DAOs) report53 that DAOs diverted 5,427 delinquency cases across the state, a 33% increase
from CY23 (n=4,094). In the same annual submission, the DAOs report the number of cases that
were arraigned, which in CY23 DAOs report as 10,774, a 1% increase from CY23.54

52 The Trial Court began to publicly report youth representation data in FY23.
53 In 2021 (CY), the Legislature began publishing online annual reports submitted by District Attorneys across all eleven District
Attorney Offices (DAOs), compiled by the MDAA. These reports detail the number of cases diverted/not charged each year by
the underlying case type. Pursuant to item 0340-2100 of Chapter 24 of the Acts of 2021, the legislative language requesting this
data directs DAOs, through the MDAA, to report the “number of cases reviewed but not charged.” The DAO reports specifically
list the cases as “diverted,” but there is not a definition of what is meant by that term. As a result, the Board is unsure if the
number reported is only cases diverted, or if it also includes cases that were reviewed but did not move forward for other
reasons (e.g., lack of evidence or prosecutor decision to nolle prosequi a case). For all MDAA’s reports submitted to the
Legislature, see: https://malegislature.gov/Reports/Search?searchTerms=mdaa
54 The number of arraignments reported by the DAO offices is significantly more than the number reported by the Trial Court
(10,291 compared to 4,148). The arraignment data reported by DAO is reported by calendar year, while the arraignment data
reported by the Trial Court is based on the fiscal year. This may account for some of the difference, but it is unlikely to account
for an arraignment count that is nearly double what is reported by the Trial Court. Other possibilities may be that the DAO
offices are defining an arraignment differently than the Trial Court, or, in situations where youth have multiple charges,
counting each as a separate arraignment. The DAO report does not include a definition for arraignments.
40

The Board uses these two data points (number of cases arraigned and number of cases
diverted) to derive an estimate of the percentage of delinquency cases each DAO diverted out
of total delinquency cases in CY24.55 (See Figure 14 below). Statewide, DAOs diverted an
estimated 33% of cases in CY24, up five-percentage points from CY23.

Judicial Diversion & Case Dismissals
As a result of the CJRA, judges may divert youth pre-arraignment. The Trial Court reports the
number of cases that are dismissed between the delinquency filing stage and the acceptance of
a plea or conclusion of a trial but does not currently distinguish between cases dismissed due to
diversion or for any other reason. The Trial Court also does not report whether the case was
dismissed by a judge or withdrawn/nolle prossed56 by a prosecutor. Cases may be dismissed for

As Figure 15 shows, most cases that enter the Juvenile Court are not disposed by a CWOF, plea,
or trial. This means that most youth who enter the Juvenile Court system have their case
dismissed or diverted at some point.
57 Cases may also be dismissed after successfully completing the terms of their probation in a CWOF case, however the Juvenile
Court reports CWOF cases in the “Not Dismissed/Prosecuted” data below The youth will not have a record of a delinquent
adjudication if they successfully comply with the terms of the CWOF, although the fact that they were arraigned and the case
was Continued Without a Finding will appear on their record. A CWOF can also be used as the basis for a “subsequent offense”
charge.

In FY24 an estimated 81% of applications for complaint and 70% of delinquency filings were
resolved prior to a CWOF, plea, or trial during the same year.58 Given the negative impact that
court involvement can have on youth, this is, overall, a positive finding. (Although the Board
notes that these rates are lower than last year, see Figure 16, below.)

However, the Board also finds that there are a significant number of youth who are arraigned
but later have their charges dismissed (an estimated 49% of arraignments). This suggests that at
least some of these youth could have been considered for diversion or case dismissal earlier in
the process to avoid extended court involvement or be better served in their communities than
through exposure to the juvenile justice system.
58 It’s possible the length of time it takes a case to process through the system may account for some of the difference between
the number of cases coming into court compared to the number resolved by a CWOF, plea, or trial.

Applications for Complaint
An application for delinquent complaint may be filed with the clerk magistrate’s office when a
police officer or other person believes a youth has committed a delinquent offense. The
application for delinquent complaint includes a sworn statement of the alleged facts and is the
first step in the court process. Due to inconsistencies in the reporting of arrest data,
applications for complaint currently provide the most accurate measure of the total frequency

59 Due to significant data quality concerns, the Board does not include data from police departments on arrests. For a detailed
explanation of these concerns, see the Board’s 2022 Annual Report: https://www.mass.gov/doc/jjpad-2022-annual-

delinquency cases initiated by an arrest compared to a summons. See the “Applications for Complaint” section for this data.

In FY24, 10,372 applications for complaints were filed across the state – a 3% increase from
FY23. This rate of increase is substantially lower than the 14% increase between FY22 and FY23.
The number of applications is down 7% from pre-CJRA.
How Youth Enter the Juvenile Court Process: Arrests and Summons
If a youth is suspected of having committed a delinquent offense, a police officer may divert the
youth, arrest the youth, or seek a summons for their appearance at the Juvenile Court. Total
applications for complaint, reported above, are a sum total of applications initiated by arrest
and those initiated by summons. This section breaks down data on applications for complaint
based on how the complaint was initiated: either through an arrest or summons.
Between FY23 and FY24, there was a 7% increase in applications initiated by arrest, while there
was no increase in applications initiated by summons. The number of applications initiated by
arrest have reached their pre-CJRA implementation levels, while the use of summons has
decreased 13% since FY18.

In FY24, more than 65% (n=3,531) of applications initiated by arrest were for underlying felony
offenses, compared to only 17% (n=836) of applications initiated by summons. However, as was
the case in FY23, there was a larger increase, 13%, in applications initiated by arrest for cases
involving a misdemeanor compared to cases involving a felony (4%).
Further as Figure 20, below, highlights, the percent of arrests for underlying misdemeanor
offenses has increased in recent years. For example, 35% of all arrests in FY24 were for
misdemeanors, up from 29% in FY19.

Overnight Arrest Admissions
When a youth under the age of 18 has been arrested by the police (either on a new offense or
an active warrant) when court is not in session or after being held at a police station for six
hours and court has subsequently closed for the day, the officer in charge has the options of
referring the youth to DYS to be held as an “overnight arrest” placement (ONA) or releasing the
youth. Youth under 21 with pending juvenile matters may also be referred for ONA placement,

if being held on the juvenile matter. If the officer in charge requests the youth be held at DYS, it
is then up to the bail commissioner whether to set bail or release the youth to a
parent/guardian. Youth are held in a secure placement operated or contracted for by DYS
overnight or until the next court day. The ONA admissions data in this section provides further
information on arrests. This is an important process point given the consequences arrest and
detention, even for short periods of time, can have for a youth.60
In FY24, there were 647 overnight arrest admissions across the state, a 9% increase from FY23.
Despite the increase in admissions in FY23 and FY24, ONA admissions are down 48% since the
CJRA was implemented.61

Many youth admitted on an ONA are subsequently released after their first hearing once the
court is back in session. Of the 647 ONA admissions in FY24, 49% (n=320) of overnight arrest
admissions did not result in a detention admission. This means that approximately half of youth
admitted on an ONA are arrested and then detained for anywhere between a couple hours to
up to about four days, but ultimately released by a judge who decides the youth does not need
to be detained pretrial. As the next section details, the majority of youth admitted to DYS
overnight were arrested for lower-level offenses. Taken together, this data suggests

Delinquency Filings
A delinquency complaint is issued (called a “delinquency filing”) if a clerk magistrate finds
probable cause to believe that a juvenile has committed the delinquent act detailed on the
application for delinquent complaint and decides to “issue the delinquent complaint.” Clerk
magistrates may also divert a youth instead of issuing a delinquent complaint (as detailed in the
“Clerk Magistrate Diversion” section, above).
In FY24, there were 6,609 delinquency complaints issued. About two-thirds of applications for
complaint resulted in a delinquency filing.62
62 This is an estimate due to the fact that the Board does not have the data tracking individual cases over time. Some
delinquency filings in FY24 may be a result of applications in FY23 and/or some applications in FY24 may become filings in FY25.

Offense Severity at the “Initial” Stages of the Juvenile Justice System
Juvenile Court Data by Offense Severity
The Trial Court reports offense severity by classifying offenses as a misdemeanor offense or a
felony offense. Misdemeanor offenses are relatively lower severity offense types, while felony
offenses are more serious.
In FY24:
• A majority (58%, n=6,005) of applications for complaint were for misdemeanors.63
However, between FY23 and FY24, applications for complaint for felonies increased at a
higher rate than applications for complaint for misdemeanors (6%, an additional 253
applications, and 1%, an additional 71 applications, respectively).
• When looking at the data on how youth come to court, there has been much more
variance in the percent of misdemeanors, compared to felonies, that come in via an
arrests over the years.
63 Applications for complaint may contain more than one charge. The data presented in this section reports the first charge that
is entered into the case processing system and the corresponding measures (i.e., offense type, severity) for the first charge.

• 42% (n=2,807) of delinquency filings involved youth alleged of misdemeanor offenses.64
Delinquency filings involving misdemeanor offense decreased by 2% (representing 54
filings) between FY23 and FY24, while cases involving felonies increased by 2% (an
additional 62 filings). In FY24, more than a third of cases involved youth with a “lead
charge” of Assault & Battery. This is consistent with recent years.

DYS categorizes offense severity by “grid level.” This is a numeric representation, ranging from
1 (least serious) to 7 (most serious), based on adult sentencing guidelines.65 Consistent with
prior years, the majority (60%, n=382) of ONA admissions were for an alleged lower “grid” level
offense. However, admissions for high “grid” level offenses increased by 35%, from 68 in FY23

65 DYS measures offense severity by a numerical (1-7) “grid level.” Grid levels 1-2 are categorized as low, grid level 3= medium
and grid levels 4-7 = high. The most common charge for a youth held in detention is assault & battery, which is classified as Grid
Level 2 (low). Grid 2 can also include other assault and battery charges, such as assault and battery with a dangerous weapon
(ABDW), no/minor injury. The charge type, which is determined by the District Attorney’s Office, is only one factor among many
that the judicial system is legally required to consider when making decisions regarding pretrial detention. For more

Arraignments and Pretrial Proceedings, Supervision &
Monitoring, and Detention
66
Once a delinquency complaint is issued by a Clerk Magistrate and a delinquency filing is
created, a prosecutor (called an “assistant district attorney”) determines whether there is
sufficient evidence to officially charge or “arraign” a youth for a delinquent offense. A judge
may also, upon motion, dismiss a complaint before arraignment based on the absence of
probable cause. Once a youth has been arraigned, the incident will appear on a youth’s court
record.
Following (and oftentimes at the same court hearing as) an arraignment, the court holds a bail
hearing. Bail hearings may also be held if new information becomes available that may warrant
a change in bail status. At this hearing, a judge makes a determination as to whether the youth
is unlikely to appear for their court hearing (referred to as “risk of failure to appear” or “a flight
risk”) and may set monetary bail, set other pretrial release conditions, and/or place the youth
on pretrial monitoring and/or supervision to ensure their appearance in court.67 Judges must
consider the youth’s financial resources if they set bail.68 If the youth is unable to post the
monetary bail and/or meet other pretrial release conditions, they are held in detention before
their trial (called “pretrial detention”). A judge may determine a youth is not a flight risk and
therefore, bail is not needed, at which point the youth is released on their own “personal
recognizance.”
Data on bail determinations for all youth is not currently available. Data on bail determinations
for youth ultimately admitted to DYS and held on bail is detailed in the “Pretrial Detention”
section below.
Further, youth charged with certain offenses can be detained pretrial if the prosecution moves
for an order of pretrial detention based on dangerousness. Following a hearing, called a “58A
hearing” or “dangerousness hearing,” a judge will determine if the court finds the youth
“dangerous” and then makes the determination as to whether conditions of release will
reasonably assure the safety of any other person or the community.69 If a judge finds that no
conditions of release will reasonably assure the safety of any other person or the community,

pretrial release with conditions as a result of a 58A Hearing.
Arraignments
An arraignment occurs when a youth is before the court and officially “charged” by a
prosecutor with an offense.71 Once a youth has been arraigned, the incident will appear on a
youth’s court record.

In FY24, the most frequent “lead charge” was for assault and battery. Assault and Battery
charges have been the most frequent “lead charge” in delinquency cases since FY19, the
earliest year for which the Board has data.72 The JJPAD Board notes that in some cases, the
underlying conduct leading to an assault & battery charge can be more serious – and, in some
70 If youth are detained pretrial as a result of a dangerousness hearing, they cannot be held for more than 120 days without
being brought to trial. However, certain court processes (e.g., filing certain motions) can “pause” the clock tracking how long
youth are detained as a result of a dangerousness hearing (this is referred to as “tolling time”). As a result, youth can be held
pretrial beyond the 120 days outlined in the statue prior to their case being brought to trial.
71 On rare occasions when there is no judicial coverage, clerks can also conduct an arraignment.

How Many Youth are Detained at an Initial Arraignment?
In FY24, there were 3,919 decisions made as to whether to detain a youth or release them at
the initial arraignment.
Of those decisions, 14% (n=537) were ordered to be detained. Of the 537 cases in which the
youth was detained:
• 85% (n=455) involved an alleged underlying felony offense compared to 64% (n=2,157)
of youth not detained at initial arraignment
• 51% (n=274) involved an underlying person-related offense compared to 49%
(n=1,665) of youth not detained at initial arraignment
• 20% (n=105) involved an alleged weapons offense compared to 5% (n=168) of youth

Personal Recognizance
At arraignment, the youth may be given a bail warning by the judge and leave court on their
own “personal recognizance” (referred to as “PR”), meaning the youth is released from court
with the promise that they will return for future court hearings.73
In FY24, youth were initially released on PR in an estimated 56% (n=1,891) cases, down from
62% (n=1,340) in FY23.
73 A bail warning at arraignment informs youth that if they are charged with a new offense while their case is pending their bail
may be revoked, and as a result, the youth will be detained.

Pretrial Monitoring & Supervision74
After arraignment, a youth may be placed on pretrial monitoring and/or supervision, which is
provided by the Massachusetts Probation Service (MPS). In FY24, 1,547 new pretrial monitoring
and supervision cases started.75 This is a less than 1% decrease from the 1,550 case starts in
FY23.76
74 MPS “monitors” youth under “category A” supervision and provides “supervision” to youth under “category B” supervision.
This applies to youth placed on pretrial probation as a disposition as well as those on conditions of release.
75 An individual youth can have more than one pretrial monitoring and supervision case.

There are two different types of pretrial monitoring and supervision cases:
1. Pretrial Conditions of Release: depending on the court's order, probation either
monitors the pretrial conditions or actively supervises the individual to ensure
compliance with the conditions of release from pretrial detention while their case is
pending, and they remain in the community.
2. Pretrial Probation as a Disposition: Youth can be placed on pretrial probation as a
“disposition” post-arraignment by a judge. If the youth complies with all of the
conditions of their pretrial probation, the matter will ultimately be dismissed by the
prosecution. If the youth fails to comply, the prosecution of the matter may resume
(at the discretion of the district attorney).

The majority of MPS pretrial cases are for youth who have
pretrial conditions of release. This has been consistent over
the past four years. Between FY21 and FY24, the number
cases in which youth were monitored on pretrial conditions
of release increased 53%.
There are two types of supervision levels for youth: 77
• Cases that are monitored by MPS are pretrial cases that are not actively supervised by a
probation officer at the local level. Rather, they are monitored by the statewide Pretrial
Unit. Youth with pretrial cases monitored by MPS have conditions set under a category
called “Category A.” Examples of Category A conditions include:
Obey all laws and court orders
o
Obey any no contact or stay away orders
o
Refrain from illegal drugs, recreational marijuana, and/or alcohol
o
• Cases that are supervised by MPS are pretrial cases that are actively supervised by a
probation officer at the local level. Youth with pretrial cases supervised by MPS have

distribution of pretrial conditions youth in either “Category” are required to follow.
58A “Dangerousness” Hearings
A prosecutor may move for a “58A hearing,” also called a “dangerousness hearing,” if they
believe the youth is a threat to public safety if released pretrial.78 If a judge finds a youth to be
dangerous and there are no conditions that would assure a youth and the community’s safety,
the youth is held in detention prior to their trial.79
78 See: M.G.L Chapter 276 §58A https://malegislature.gov/laws/generallaws/partiv/titleii/chapter276/section58A
79 If youth are detained pretrial as a result of a dangerousness hearing, they cannot be held for more than 120 days without
being brought to trial. After 120 days, the law states that youth should be released from detention. However, there are a

In FY24, there were 342 58A Hearings held, representing a 1% increase from FY23. Following a
12% decrease in the number of hearings one year into CRJA implementation, the number of
58A hearings held has increased each year since FY19. This has resulted in a 53% increase in the
number of hearings held in FY24 compared to FY18.
It is important to note that the Board does not have data on the outcomes of these hearings,
which makes it difficult to assess whether this increase is due to either or both of the following
reasons:
• An overall increase in severity of the types of cases coming into Juvenile Court.
• A change in prosecutorial decision-making on when to motion for a 58A Hearing, and to
what degree that may be influenced by the 2017 SJC decision that narrowed the
circumstances for which the prosecution asks for and a judge sets cash bail.80
Although data on the outcomes of hearings is not available, the Board can calculate a rough
estimate of the number of 58A Hearings in Juvenile Court that result in a pretrial detention
admission that same year. Data on detention admissions from DYS indicates that in FY24,
variety of legal reasons youth may be (and, indeed, are) held beyond 120 days. See Finding 3 of the Board's report on the

Pretrial Detention
A youth can be committed to the physical care of DYS (commonly referred to as “detained
youth”) for the following reasons:
• If a judge finds no conditions of release will reasonably assure the safety of any
person(s) or the community to release the youth pretrial as the result of a 58A
(“Dangerousness”) Hearing
• If they are unable to make the cash bail and/or the condition(s) of release that has
been set for them (e.g., release to a parent only, release to DCF only)
• If their bail or personal recognizance was revoked after previously being released
from detention
• As a result of a post-adjudication probation violation hearing
81 This is an estimate derived by taking the number of detention admissions under 58A (as reported by DYS) and dividing it by
the total number of 58A hearings held (as reported by the Trial Court). We are unable to match specific hearings to their
outcomes.

Pretrial Detention Admissions by Offense Severity
The increase in pretrial detention admissions was partially a result of an increase in pretrial
detention admissions for lower grid level offenses, which increased 21% from FY23 admissions.
This influx resulted in almost half (48%, n=428) of all detention admissions being for youth
alleged of committing a lower-level offense. This is the third year in a row in which the number
of detention admissions has gone up for youth alleged of committing lower-level offenses,
reversing the downward trend of the prior years. Some of this increase may be due to an
increase in assault and battery-related charges during this time frame which, in some cases,
may be classified by DYS as “Grid 2” and therefore, “low level.”

Pretrial Detention Admissions Where Bail was Not Set
Youth can be held without bail for several reasons, including because of a dangerousness
hearing (as highlighted above), a probation violation hearing,83 or if bail or personal
recognizance (“PR”) was revoked. Consistent with the past four years, a little under half (46%,
n=310) of all detention admissions where youth were held without bail in FY24 were for youth
detained as a result of bail/PR being revoked or a probation violation hearing. These youth had
been previously in the community as a result of being released on personal recognizance or as a

Pretrial Detention Admissions Where Bail was Set
A far smaller percentage (25%) of detention admissions are for youth who were detained as a
result of bail being set. As detailed above, if a judge determines a youth is at risk of failing to
appear for their next court date, they may choose to set a monetary bail to assure a youth’s
appearance in court.84 Judges must consider the youth’s financial resources if they set bail.85
83 Data includes both pretrial violation hearings and post-disposition probation violations. Youth can be held in detention
pending a violation probation hearing or as the result of a violation of their pretrial conditions of release.

If the youth is unable to make cash bail or meet other pretrial release conditions for any reason,
they are held in pretrial detention. Research shows that most adult individuals show up to
court, and that cash bail is not effective at reducing failure to appear rates. 86 While research
into the effectiveness of cash bail in juvenile court is not as well researched, the JJPAD Board
heard in stakeholder interviews that youth failure to appear rates are similarly low in
Massachusetts.87 Many youth (or their families) cannot afford even a relatively small bail
amount, which means – in many cases—they must remain in a locked facility away from their
schools and communities until trial or until they are able to raise the money to pay the bail.
The overall percentage of detention admissions resulting from youth detained on cash bail has
remained relatively stable over the past three fiscal years (consistently representing about a
quarter of all cases). Bail amounts are detailed in the figure below.

Youth Detained Pretrial: Placement Settings as of June 30, 2024
Data on detention admissions reflect youth who may have been admitted to detention more
than once throughout the fiscal year. To understand the different types of facilities youth
are detained in, the Board also examines point-in-time or “snapshot” data. The data
takeaways presented in this text box reflect the youth who were in the custody of DYS on
June 30, 2024. On that date, there were 133 youth detained at DYS.
• Of the 133 youth detained on this day, 77% (n=103) were detained in a hardware
secure facility and 20% (n=27) were detained in a staff secure setting.
• On average, youth in detention on 6/30/24 had spent 74.9 days detained. The
median length of time spent in detention for youth detained on this day was 32.0
days.
*Placement type is determined by the youth’s risk level and offense type.

Characteristics of Youth Detained Pretrial at Admission
DYS reports data to the Board detailing some of the needs of youth admitted to pretrial
detention. This includes self-reported data on any history of sexual and/or physical abuse as
well as any mental health and educational needs.
Data on Physical & Sexual Abuse
As a result of the federal Prison Rape Elimination Act (PREA), youth admitted to detention
answer a series of questions related to any history of physical and/or sexual abuse, as well as
other questions regarding if youth had ever heard other individuals make negative comments
about the youth’s appearance, race, sexual orientation, gender identity or religion.89 DYS has
also added a question to their intake to capture whether a youth has experienced commercial
sexual exploitation (CSEC).
Compared to FY23, the self-disclosures of abuse, neglect, and other concerns of youth captured
on the PREA questionnaire remained relatively stable.

Data on Mental & Behavioral Health Needs
All youth receive a mental health screening upon first entering a DYS facility. DYS uses the
MAYSI-2 (Massachusetts Youth Screening Instrument-Version 2) behavioral health screening,
which was designed to assist juvenile justice facilities in identifying special mental health needs
among 12-17-year-olds.90 The MAYSI-2 screens for signs of depression, suicidal/self-harm
ideation, substance use, psychosis, aggression, and PTSD. Depending on the score, DYS has
multiple policies and procedures in place to ensure youth in their care and custody are safe and
supported, including providing appropriate clinical services, monitoring for suicidality, and
establishing necessary safety protocols.
Compared to FY23, the needs of youth captured on the MAYSI decreased across all measures.

Data on Educational Needs & Disability Status Data
On a weekly basis, DYS receives special education and disability-related information for the
youth admitted to detention that week from the Department of Elementary and Secondary
Education (DESE).91 In FY24, this analysis was omitted from this report due to 45% (n=404) of
detention admissions missing DESE data.92 This could be due to one or more reasons:
1. Youth being held for less than 7 days, and therefore not being captured on DYS’ school
roles.
2. Youth are from out of state, and therefore, DESE does not have education data available
for this youth.
3. The increased age of the detention admission population. In FY24, 35% (n=313) were 17
years old and above at time of admission. It is possible that some of these youth had
completed their K-12 education or were of age to (legally) drop out of school.
4. Error in data reporting.
91 DYS and DESE match data across agencies twice a week based on new detention admissions and first commitments. Local
schools are only required to report data to DESE three times a year, and DYS receives the DESE data based on the last time the
school reported to DESE.
92 This data was previously reported by the JJPAD Board. It was most recently reported in the Board’s 2023 annual report:

Dispositions & Sanctions
There are a few different options (“dispositions”) for how a case may be resolved after a youth
is arraigned in court. The data in this section reports the initial disposition for a case, not the
final disposition. It is also important to note that a case can be dismissed prior to a plea or trial
due to a number of procedural or legal reasons. That data is reported in the “Judicial Diversion”
section above.
In FY24, there were 1,982 delinquency cases that proceeded to a plea or trial or were resolved
by a CWOF, a 14% increase from FY23. As was highlighted in the Diversion section of this report
above, fewer arraignments are being dismissed or diverted (an estimated 49% of arraignments
did not proceed to CWOF/plea/trial in FY24, down from an estimated 57% in FY23). Some of the
increase in the number of dispositions could also be a result of the Juvenile Court clearing
through a backlog of cases or an increase in timeliness from charging a youth to resolving their
case.
The number of cases resolved by plea/trial or a CWOF hearing is down 22% compared to FY18.

Dispositions (FY18-FY24)

Dispositions
If a case resolves as a result of a CWOF, a plea being accepted or a completed trial,94 it results in
what is called a “disposition.”95
1. A youth’s case can be resolved with something called a “continuance without a finding”
(CWOF). A CWOF determination comes before an adjudication and means a case is
continued without entering a formal adjudication on the case or into the youth's record.
For there to be a CWOF determination, a youth must give up their right to trial and
admit there are sufficient facts to merit a finding of delinquency; in exchange, the court
agrees to continue the case without a finding for a set period, subject to the youth’s
compliance with specific conditions.
The case can be dismissed if the youth meets all of the conditions of probation during
the length of the CWOF. If the youth does not meet the conditions of probation, the
case may be brought back to court, a finding of delinquency may be entered and the
youth may face additional consequences up to commitment to DYS. The youth will not
have a record of a delinquent adjudication if they successfully comply with the terms of
the CWOF, although the fact that they were arraigned and the case was Continued
Without a Finding will appear on their record, along with an entry that the case was
dismissed.
2. A youth can be adjudicated not delinquent (equivalent to “not guilty” in the adult
system) on all or some of the charges.
3. A youth can be adjudicated delinquent (equivalent to “guilty” in the adult system) on all
or some of the charges. If youth are adjudicated delinquent, they can receive one of the
following sanctions:96
• be placed on post-adjudication, delinquent probation,
• be placed on a “suspended DYS commitment” which is supervised by probation,
• be committed to DYS, or
• may also receive no sanction after being adjudicated delinquent.
In FY24, almost two thirds (64%, n=1,266) of all cases that were resolved were resolved by a
CWOF. The breakdowns in dispositions have remained relatively consistent over the past
several years despite increases in the number of initial dispositions over the past two years.
94 Youth can have a trial before a judge or a jury.
95 Cases can also be “dismissed”, however, the counts reported here included all cases resolved by a CWOF, cases adjudicated
delinquent, and cases adjudicated not delinquent. CWOFs can be used in the court’s determination of subsequent offenses.
96 Additional sanction options are available to Juvenile Court judges for youth who are found to be a “youthful offender.” That is
detailed in the “Youthful Offender Cases” section below.

Compared to FY23, there was a:
• 16% increase in the number of cases resolved by a CWOF
• 9% increase in the number of cases adjudicated delinquent
• 10% decrease in the number of cases adjudicated not delinquent
Since CJRA implementation, the 19% decline in the number of cases resolved with a CWOF
accounted for most of the decline in total number of total dispositions, rather than those cases
adjudicated either delinquent or not delinquent.
Sanctions
Sanctions can be described as the outcome of a case in which a youth has been adjudicated
delinquent. In adult court, this is referred to as a "sentence."
Common options for sanctions in Juvenile Court include:
• Imposing no sanction:97 In FY24, there were 87 cases in which a youth was adjudicated
delinquent yet no sanction was imposed, representing a 23% decrease from FY23. The
number of dispositions with “no sanction” have been cut in half since FY18.
97 In these cases, judges adjudicate a youth delinquent for a given case, and put the case “on file” unless or until a certain
circumstance occurs.
76

• Giving the youth a suspended DYS commitment:98 Youth with a suspended DYS
commitment are supervised by MPS, and if successful, are not committed to DYS. If
unsuccessful, youth may be committed to DYS until 18 years of age (or, in some cases,
19, 20, or 21 years old). In FY24, there were 91 cases in which a youth was adjudicated
delinquent and given a suspended commitment to DYS, a 10% increase from FY23. Cases
involving a suspended commitment to DYS are down 44% from FY18.
• Placing the youth on probation for a period of time: In FY24, there were 248 cases in
which a youth was adjudicated delinquent, or their case was resolved via a CWOF and
they were placed on probation, a 28% increase from FY23. Cases resulting in a sanction
of probation are down 6% from FY18.
• Committing a youth to the custody of the Department of Youth Services (DYS): The
most serious sanction a judge can enter when a youth is adjudicated delinquent is to
commit a youth to the physical custody of DYS until their 18th birthday (or until their
19th, 20th, or 21st birthday in certain circumstances).99 There was an 8% increase in the
number of commitments in FY24 compared to FY23. There were 15% fewer
commitments in FY24 than FY18.
Additionally, the Juvenile Court can impose or suspend an adult sentence if the youth was
adjudicated as a youthful offender.100
98 During a suspended DYS delinquency commitment, the youth is placed on probation with the possibility of a DYS
commitment. If the youth is found by a judge to have violated a condition of probation, the judge may commit the youth to
DYS.
99 Youth charged as a juvenile but whose cases are disposed after their 18th birthday can be committed to DYS until they are 19
or 20 years old. Youth with a youthful offender case can be committed to DYS until age 21. (MGL c. 119 §58.) While youth are
committed to the physical custody of DYS, youth may live in the community or a DYS facility at different points throughout their
commitment disposition.

Post-Disposition Probation
Youth who have been adjudicated delinquent can be placed on probation by the court as a
disposition, as well as those youth adjudicated delinquent and placed on a suspended
commitment to DYS (until age 18 or 21), or whose cases is resolved with a CWOF. In FY24:
• 248 cases adjudicated delinquent/resolved with a CWOF had probation imposed as a
sanction, and
• 91 cases adjudicated delinquent had a suspended commitment DYS imposed as a
sanction
Supervision Types & Levels
MPS reported 1,410 new probation “case starts” in FY24.101 This is an 8% increase from FY23. In
addition to the cases adjudicated delinquent and imposed a sanction, as described above, these
cases include youth supervised pre-adjudication on a CWOF.
A judge determines which type of probation to impose:
• Risk-Need Probation: A classification of probation supervision for adjudicated youth
in which probation officers have direct supervision of youth consistent with
established supervision standards in place for maximum, moderate, or minimum
101 MPS reports the number of cases started during the year. One individual can have more than one “case start.”

supervision. These levels are determined by an assessment tool and classification
process.102
• Administrative Probation:103 A classification of probation supervision where the
number of directly supervised conditions are limited. Unlike risk/need probation,
there is no assessment tool used for this classification of probation.

In FY24, a little more than half (53%, n=743) of case starts were for administrative probation,
down slightly from 56% (n=729) in FY23.
Of the 667 probation cases that involved youth placed on risk/need probation, the majority of
youth (74%, n=494) were assessed at a low risk/need level. Over the past four fiscal years, the
percentage of cases in which youth are assessed at a low risk/need level has increased.

If a youth on probation fails to meet the conditions of probation set by a judge, a probation
officer has three response options:
1. issue a warning or other sanction,
2. conduct an administrative hearing, or
3. issue a “violation of probation” notice.
A violation of probation notice informs the youth of the condition(s) the probation officer
alleges they violated and orders the youth to appear in court. There are three types of violation
notices: delinquent,105 non-delinquent,106 or both delinquent & non-delinquent.107 The data
below represents violations of pretrial and post-adjudication probation, as well as youth whose
case was resolved with a CWOF. MPS is unable to disaggregate violations by probation type.108
In FY24, there were 459 violation of probation notices issued, a 4% increase from FY23. The
number of violation of probation notices has declined substantially (61%) since FY18 when MPS
implemented a new policy in an effort to limit the number of violation of probation notices
issued.
105 In this type of violation, the probation officer is alleging that the youth committed a new delinquent offense while under
probation supervision, on the basis of a new arrest or summons by the police. An example is a youth being arrested for
shoplifting while a youth is being supervised for a previous offense.
106 Sometimes called a “technical” violation. In this case, the probation officer is alleging that the youth did not comply with one
or more conditions of probation. The alleged behavior is not by itself a delinquent offense and would not otherwise result in an
arrest. An example of this would be the youth not attending a mandatory anger management group and after many attempts
to have the youth attend, they never go.
107 A youth can receive one violation notice that includes allegations of a new delinquent offense (Delinquent Violation Notice)
and non-compliance with conditions of probation (Non-Delinquent Violation Notice). For a description of MPS’ policy and
procedural changes to issuing violations to post-adjudication probation cases, see pg. 110 of the Board’s 2022 Annual Report.
108 As of this report, MPS reports having begun to collect this data and will be able to disaggregate violation data by probation
type in the future.

Commitments to the Department of Youth Services (DYS)
The most serious disposition a judge can enter when a youth is adjudicated delinquent is to
commit a youth to the physical custody of DYS until their 18th birthday (or until their 19th, 20th,
or 21st birthday in certain circumstances).109
There was an 8% increase in the number of commitments in FY24 compared to FY23. There

First-time Commitments
Data on commitments presented above is for youth who are committed to DYS – whether for
the first time or subsequent times after their first commitment. For that reason, the Board also
reports “first-time commitments” data from DYS. This data reflects the number of committed
youth who have never previously been committed to DYS’ custody.110
In FY24, there were 189 youth committed to DYS for the first time. This represents a 2%
increase from FY23. Still, first-time commitments to DYS are down 19% since pre-CJRA
implementation.
109 Youth charged as a juvenile but whose cases are disposed after their 18th birthday can be committed to DYS until they are 19
or 20 years old. Youth charged as a youthful offender can be committed to DYS until age 21. (MGL c. 119 §58.) While youth are
committed to the physical custody of DYS, youth may live in the community or a DYS facility at different points throughout their
commitment disposition.
110 First-time commitment data does not include youth who have been committed previously and are subsequently
“recommitted” to DYS on new charges.

Most youth (78%, n=186) committed to DYS are committed as a result of being adjudicated
delinquent on an underlying felony offense. This has remained the case over the past several
years. Still, about a quarter to a third of commitments each year are for youth adjudicated on
an underlying misdemeanor offense.

DYS reports data to the Board that details some of the needs of youth with first-time
commitments. This includes data on any self-reported history of sexual and/or physical abuse,
and any mental health and educational needs. 112
Data on Physical & Sexual Abuse
Compared to FY23, the percent of youth with a first-time commitment to DYS that disclosed
abuse or negative comments remained relatively stable, except a higher percentage of youth
disclosed having heard negative comments about their appearance or race and having fears
about being at DYS.
112 For more information on the tools collecting these measures, see the “Characteristics of Youth Detained Pretrial” section in
this report.

Youth Committed to DYS: Placement Settings as of June 30, 2024
First-time commitments data reflect youth who were committed to DYS for the first time
that year. Commitment point-in-time or “snapshot” data shows all youth committed on a
given day and not just those new to a commitment with DYS. This includes youth who have
been adjudicated delinquent more than once, and includes youth committed to DYS who
have not aged out of their commitment yet and remain on the DYS caseload. The data
takeaways presented in this text box reflect the youth who were in the custody of DYS on
June 30, 2024. On that date, there were 283 youth committed to DYS.
Since a youth’s placement type can change throughout their DYS commitment, it is best to
use snapshot data to analyze the number of committed youth in various types of
placements. On this day, 60% (n=170) of youth committed to DYS were placed in a
residential placement setting and 40% (n=113) were supervised in a community setting.
• Of the 170 committed youth in a residential placement, 56% (n=96) were in a
hardware secure facility, and 44% (n=74) were in a staff secure placement.
• For youth placed in a residential program, DYS’ continuum of care designates the
different reasons youth are held in a residential placement. On June 30, 2024, of the
170 youth in a residential placement, 56% (n=96) were in a treatment program, 10%
(n=17) were found to be in violation of their Grant of Conditional Liberty (GCL) and
returned to residential custody, and 34% (n=57) were in a residential placement for
another reason (e.g., youth was detained, participating in an assessment, or in a
transition to independent living program for DYS).^
• On that day, committed youth in a residential placement had spent an average of 82
days committed to DYS. The median length of stay in their current (as of 6/30/24)
placement was 48 days.
• On that day, committed youth placed in the community had spent an average of 171
days committed to DYS. The median length of stay in the community (as of 6/30/24)
placement was 109 days.
* Placement type is determined by the youth’s risk level and offense type. Youth committed to DYS who are living in the
community do so on a “Grant of Conditional Liberty” or GCL. A GCL can be revoked based on a violation of a condition, and
a youth can be brought back to a DYS facility at the discretion of DYS. This is roughly equivalent to “parole” in the adult
justice system.
^Youth who are already committed to DYS can be held in detention for another case.

Youthful Offender Cases
A youthful offender case involves a youth between 14 and 18 years old who is indicted by a
grand jury for allegedly committing an offense against a law of the Commonwealth which, if
they were an adult, would be punishable by imprisonment in state prison and who meets any of
the following criteria:113
1. the youth has previously been committed to the Department of Youth Services
2. the youth has committed an offense which involves the infliction or threat of serious
bodily harm in violation of law
3. the youth has committed certain firearms and weapons offenses
District attorneys may choose to present certain juvenile cases to a grand jury, whose role is to
decide whether there is enough evidence to charge the youth with the crime alleged and
whether the crime and/or the youth meets the criteria necessary for the youth to be indicted as
a youthful offender. If the grand jury determines there is sufficient evidence to charge the
youth with the crime alleged and that the youth meets youthful offender criteria, they issue an
“indictment” accusing the youth of specific offenses and a separate indictment accusing the
youth of being a youthful offender.114
If the grand jury determines the youthful offender criteria have not been satisfied, the district
attorney may continue to proceed against the youth as a delinquency case; However, Board
members note it is rare that a grand jury determines that there is insufficient evidence. If a
youth is indicted, they are brought before the Juvenile Court and arraigned. The rest of their
case proceeds similarly to a delinquency case except in two ways:
1. Youth in these cases have the right to be tried by a jury of 12 adults (compared to six
adults in delinquency proceedings)
2. Youthful offender trials are open to the public (compared to delinquency proceedings,
which are closed to the public)
In FY24, there were:
• 146 youthful offender case indictments
113 As defined in M.G.L c119 §52: https://malegislature.gov/Laws/GeneralLaws/PartI/TitleXVII/Chapter119/Section52 ; In other
states, laws permit youth alleged of certain offenses to be transferred to adult court (referred to as “waivers” or “direct file”).
Instead of using waivers/direct transfers for non-homicide cases, Massachusetts uses the youthful offender statute to give
judges more flexibility at the sanctions/sentencing phase for youth adjudicated delinquent/found guilty, including using adult
sentencing options (e.g., jail and prison). For more information on national numbers, see:

• 144 youthful offender case arraignments
• 94 youthful offender cases that resulted in a CWOF, delinquent adjudication, or guilty
adult sentence
• 6 youthful offender cases that were adjudicated not a youthful offender
Unlike delinquency cases, which mostly plateaued or decreased between FY23 and FY24, the
number of youthful offender cases increased at each process point. The number of youthful
offender cases have increased at each process point consistently beginning in FY22.

Murder Charges
In Massachusetts, the juvenile justice system has jurisdiction over any individual age 12 through
17 charged with a delinquency offense regardless of the type of offense except for homicide
charges. A case in which a youth over the age of 14 is accused of murder in first or second
degree115 is automatically arraigned in (adult) District Court and further court proceedings are
heard in Superior Court (i.e., indictment, arraignment, and sentencing). In Massachusetts,

Prior to 2024, young people (between 18 and 21 years old) convicted of first-degree murder
could be sentenced to life without the possibility of parole in state prison. In January 2024, the
SJC ruled in Commonwealth v. Mattis117 that youth (under the age of 21) can no longer be
sentenced to life without parole.
Sanctions/Adult Sentences
If the youth is “found to be a youthful offender,” the court may impose one or a combination of
the following sanctions in addition to the delinquency sanctions reported above:
• commit the youth to DYS until age 21
• commit the youth to DYS until age 21, with that commitment suspended, while the
youth is placed on a period of probation supervision
• any adult sentence allowed for by law for the adjudicated offense, including a sentence
to the house of correction, state prison, or adult probation
• commit the youth to DYS until age 21 with a suspended adult sentence. If the youth
successfully complete their commitment, the case may conclude; if not, the youth may
be sentenced to an adult facility.118
116 This changed in 2014. Prior to 2014, youth could be sentenced to life without parole. See the SJC decision that changed that
in 2013 http://masscases.com/cases/sjc/471/471mass12.html and the legislation that codified it in 2014:
https://malegislature.gov/Laws/SessionLaws/Acts/2014/Chapter189
117 https://hls.harvard.edu/events/mattis-panel/ ; As of this report, 8 people have been granted parole under this decision.
Lawyers estimate 200 people currently incarcerated in MA DOC are impacted by this decision.
https://www.boston.com/news/local-news/2025/01/13/8-convicted-of-murder-while-young-adults-become-first-to-be-
paroled-under-new-sjc-decision/
118 This is referred to as a “combination sentence” because it combines a commitment to DYS with the potential for a youth to
complete an adult sentence if the youth fails to comply with the terms of the combination sentence. Typically, if the youth
successfully completes their commitment the case will conclude without the youth serving an adult sentence; however, the
court may also decide that the probationary period associated with the suspended sentence should begin after the youth is
discharged from commitment. In either case, if the youth successfully meets the court’s terms, they will not have to serve the
91

The most frequent sanction imposed on youth adjudicated on youthful offender cases is a
commitment to DYS until 21 years old. Probation is required to complete a sentencing report to
provide sentencing recommendations. In some cases, the Juvenile Court can refer the youth to
the Juvenile Court Clinic and have the Court Clinic conduct a “youthful offender evaluation”.
However, in FY24 there were no referrals to the Court Clinic for youthful offender
evaluations.119

Post-Commitment Services: Youth Engaged in Services (YES)
Transitions
YES is an agreement between DYS and a young person, where the youth voluntarily extends
their engagement with DYS after reaching the statutory age of discharge from DYS (after age 18
or 21), for example, to complete an education program or to continue case management.
Through this program, DYS supports youth transitioning out of typical juvenile services into
adulthood. Youth can terminate their YES status at any time and can seek to resume YES
services at any time prior to their 22nd birthday.
YES transition counts include the number of youth who age out of DYS commitments (18,19, 20
or 21 years old) and then sign up for YES participation within 90 days of discharge. Youth who
stop YES participation and restart at a later date are only counted once. The YES program is
available for youth until age 22.
Total YES transitions increased 22% in FY24 (from 96 in FY23 to 117 in FY24). Additionally, the
percent of youth who opted into the program when they were discharged from commitment
(i.e., are no longer required to remain involved with DYS) increased from 69% in FY23, to 71% in
FY24. This is a consistent trend in recent years, indicating a greater need and desire for
supports by youth committed to DYS as they enter young adulthood.

Specific Cohorts of Youth
Dually Involved Youth: Youth with both DYS and DCF Involvement
In FY21, the JJPAD Board began studying “crossover” for youth who are involved with both the
child welfare and juvenile justice systems. The Board specifically looks at youth with DCF
involvement at:120
• time of pretrial detention admission
• time of first-time commitment
In FY24:
• There was a decline in the percent of detention admissions for youth with DCF
involvement compared to FY23. In FY24, 47% (n=420) of admissions were for youth
who had DCF involvement, down from 51% (n=395) and 50% (n=335) in FY23 and FY22
respectively.

120 DYS defines DCF involvement as a youth who enters DYS care/custody and either has a pending response, open case with
DCF, or is in the care/custody of DCF. Due to multiple factors including but not limited to the definition of open case, the
definition of dually involved youth, the quality of the youth matching process, and the data quality and timeliness of data entry,
these counts and rates will vary. Numbers in this report should not be compared to other reports.
Data is unavailable for youth with DCF involvement at other points of the juvenile justice system (e.g., arraigned, placed on
probation). Further breakdowns can be found in the “Specific Cohorts” section of this report.

Black & Latino Youth
As noted in this and all previous JJPAD annual reports, there are persistent racial and ethnic
inequities in the Commonwealth’s juvenile justice system, stemming from a long history of
systemic racism at the local, state, and federal levels as well as in our society at large. While
individual implicit and explicit biases can and do impact practices, the work of the JJPAD Board
is to address the systemic policies and practices perpetuating the overrepresentation of youth
of color in the state’s juvenile justice system. Examining data on use of state systems is one way
the Board can identify particularly troubling trends and work toward equity in the
Commonwealth’s systems.
As Figure 68 depicts, Black and Latino youth remained overrepresented at each process point in
the juvenile justice system. This has been a consistent trend in the data since the Board’s first
annual report.121

Between FY23 and FY24, there was an increase in cases involving Black and Latino youth at
most process points, and a decrease in cases involving white youth. At some process points,
particularly custodial process points and at the initial stage of the juvenile justice system, this
has worsened disparities.122
There were large increases in system use for Black youth particularly across the initial stages of
the juvenile justice system. Disparities between Black youth and white youth were worse at the
arrest and overnight arrest stage. Between FY23-FY24:
• Applications for complaints initiated by an arrest involving Black youth increased by
14%. In FY24, Black youth were 5.42 times more likely to be arrested than issued a
summons compared to white youth in the state (up from 4.89 times more likely in
FY23).
• Overnight arrest admissions involving Black youth increased by 13%. In FY24, Black
youth were 3.30 times more likely to be held overnight compared to white youth. (up
from 2.66 times more likely in FY23).
The number of cases involving Latino youth increased at almost every process point – with the
largest increases happening across custodial process points. Disparities between Latino youth
and white youth were worse at the overnight arrest and first-time commitment stages and
overnight arrest stage. Between FY23-FY24:
• Overnight arrest admissions involving Latino youth increased by 16%. In FY24, Latino
youth were 3.44 times more likely to be held overnight compared to white youth (up
from 2.79 times more likely in FY23).
• First time commitments involving Latino youth increased by 20%. In FY24, Latino youth
were 3.26 times more likely to be committed compared to white youth (up from 1.19
times more likely in FY23).
Further, data shows that applications for complaint for Black and Latino youth are dismissed or
diverted at a substantially higher rate than applications for white youth. An estimated 77% and
74% of applications for complaint involving Black and Latino youth, respectively, did not reach a
disposition. This is compared to 31% of applications for complaints involving white youth. This
suggests that Black and Latino youth may be more likely to be brought to court for situations
that the court system ultimately determines do not require prosecution and adjudication than
white youth. Given the negative impact that any arrest and court involvement, even if it is
resolved at an early stage of the process, can have on youth, this is a concerning trend.

This increase could be due to a number of potential factors, including:
• Girls are committing more alleged delinquent offenses, and the system is responding,
• There was an increase in girls being arrested on serious felony offenses, creating fewer
opportunities for court stakeholders to divert/dismiss cases, and/or
• There is a change in the way juvenile justice decisionmakers are responding to girls
alleged of committing or adjudicated delinquent of a delinquent offense, resulting in
more girls in the system

At this time, the Board is unable to determine, what, if any, of the above factors are
contributing to this increase. The OCA will do a deeper dive into the data on girls coming into
the system in the year ahead in partnership with the JJPAD Data Subcommittee.
LGBTQ+ Youth
DYS reports the sexual orientation, transgender status, and intersex status of youth in their care
and custody. 124 Six percent (n=56) of pretrial detention admissions were for youth who
identified as LGBTQ+.125 As the MA LGBTQ+ Youth Commission has highlighted in recent
reports, this is below national estimates.126 The underrepresentation of LGBTQ+ youth detained
pretrial in Massachusetts may be a positive sign – or it may be due to underreporting of
detained youth who may decide not to disclose their gender identity or sexual orientation
status at intake. However, it is important to note that DYS’ policy is to revisit this question at
each intake and create multiple opportunities for youth to disclose LGBTQ+ status as they build
trusting relationships with staff.

Regardless of whether there is over- or under- representation of LGBTQ+ youth detained in
Massachusetts, the reasons why youth who identify as LGBTQ+ are detained differ compared to
those youth who do not. Consistent with previous years, youth who identified as LGBTQ+ were
held on cash bail more frequently, and for lower amounts, than youth who did not identify as
LGBTQ+.
124 Currently, DYS is the only juvenile justice system entity that collects and reports data on sexual orientation and gender
identity/transgender/intersex status.
125 For the purposes of this report, sexual orientation and gender identity data is aggregated into one category due to low
individual case counts and to protect youth confidentiality.

Utilization of Other State Resources
In general, adolescence is a time for taking risks and testing limits; behaviors that adults may
consider “problematic” or “concerning” are common among adolescents and are in many cases
normal adolescent behavior.127 Eventually, most youth mature and grow out of risky behaviors
– and will do so without any state intervention (justice system or otherwise) required.
When behaviors do require an additional level of state intervention though, there are a variety
of state entities that youth may receive services from including the Department of Mental
Health and the Department of Public Health. There is also the option to file a Child Requiring
Assistance (CRA) petition in Juvenile Court, which in some cases, can involve DCF. The JJPAD
Board gathers data on the use of these state resources that may serve youth who are, or might
otherwise have been, involved with the juvenile justice system. The goal is to identify the
extent to which other response options are being used to address unlawful/concerning
adolescent behavior and see if changes restricting the use of the delinquency system for certain
types of behavior has led to an increase in the use of other systems.
To the degree that this can be measured with the data available to the Board, it appears that –
for the most part—the reforms in the CJRA have not led to an increase in the use of other state
resources. Most state services saw a similar plateau effect as the juvenile justice system
between FY23 and FY24. For example, since FY18 the number of:
• CRA filings declined 18%
• Youth applications for DMH services declined 46%
At the same time, there have been increases in participation of state services. For example,
since FY18:
• The number of youth participating in violence prevention programming has increased
10%
• Referrals to Juvenile Court Clinics has increased 12%
The increase in the number of youth in prevention programming is encouraging as it can serve
as a possible indicator for continued declines in system use; if prevention programming has a
greater reach, more youth will be less likely to go on to be delinquency system involved.
Many of the most effective interventions for youth do not involve state government at all:
families, schools, community organizations, faith-based organizations, and health care
providers are all systems that are likely to respond to difficult adolescent behavior without
127 Kann, L., McManus, T., & Harris, W. (2018). Youth risk behavior surveillance-- United States. Surveillance Series, (67). Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention. Retrieved from https://www.cdc.gov/healthyyouth/data/yrbs/results.htm
104

involving state government. None of these interventions will appear in the data, despite the
importance these systems and organizations have in a youth’s life.
However, as the DYS “needs and traumatic histories” data indicate above—there is still room
for referrals to these state services for support for youth still being processed through the
traditional court system.
Child Requiring Assistance (CRA) Petitions
The Child Requiring Assistance (CRA) civil court process allows parents, guardians, and school
officials to bring youth with certain behaviors into court for additional assistance.128
In FY24, there were 4,290 CRA petitions filed with the Juvenile Court, an increase of less than
1% from FY23. The number of CRA petitions is down 18% since FY18.

Types of CRA Petitions
• Stubborn Petition: a type of CRA petition that can be filed by a parent/legal guardian
for a child who repeatedly fails to obey the lawful and reasonable commands of the
child's parent, legal guardian or custodian, thereby interfering with their ability to
adequately care for and protect the child.
• Runaway Petition: a type of CRA petition filed by the child’s parent or legal
guardian/custodial for a child who repeatedly runs away from their home.
• Truancy Petition: a type of CRA petition that can be filed by schools for a child who
is habitually truant by willfully not attending school for more than 8 days a quarter.
• Habitual School Offender Petition: a type of CRA petition that can be filed by schools
for a child who repeatedly fails to obey the lawful and reasonable regulations of the
child's school.
• Sexual Exploitation Petition: a type of CRA petition that can be filed by a
parent/legal guardian or a police officer for a child who is sexually exploited.

The original Massachusetts Youth Violence Prevention program was funded by the CDC. Upon
expiration of federal funding, state funding for the work began in 2007. The iteration of youth
violence funding prior to HEAL included service models Primary Violence Prevention (PVP), Safe
Spaces for LGBTQIA+ youth (Safe Spaces), and Youth at Risk Grants (YARG). In FY23, the
program was reprocured, updated, and named HEAL. The current DPH CYVPU HEAL grant funds
three distinct service models:130
• Primary Violence Prevention (PVP): These programs offer developmentally and age-
appropriate support services to 10-15-year-old youth at high risk for violence, but who
are not yet necessarily engaging in violence.
• Opportunity Youth131: These programs support community organizations which address
all types of violence experienced by young people, as well as other significant public
health issues that may increase a young person’s risk for violence, such as teen
pregnancy and substance use, geared toward youth 16-24 years old.
• Safe Spaces for LGBTQIA+ Youth: These programs are designed to create inclusive
environments for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer and or questioning, intersex,
asexual and/or allied (LGBTQIA+) youth and consist of community-based organizations
currently working with LGBTQIA+ youth, to provide services that are trauma-informed,
founded in Positive Youth Development, and are culturally appropriate and specific to
LGBTQIA+ youth.
130 For information on the number of programs funded, see Appendix G.
131 Prior to FY23 this was called the “Youth at Risk Grants Program.”

Source: Data provided to the OCA from DPH CYCPU
As Appendix G illustrates, the differences in volume each year reflect differences in vendors
funded that year. Part of the shift in participants served in each program is due to the age-
range served by each program (i.e., some programs serve young adults up to 24 years old) and
the timing of program re-procurement at which time many “Opportunity Youth/Youth at Risk
Grant” programs became PVP programs.
132 DPH reports that 8 out of the 9 programs reported an increase in participants between FY23 and FY24, while just one
program reported a major decrease in the number of participants. DPH is working to understand why.

Bureau of Substance Addiction Services Admissions133
DPH’s Bureau of Substance Addiction Services (BSAS) oversees the statewide system of
prevention, intervention, treatment, and recovery support services for youth at risk of
developing a substance use disorder or affected by substance use. There were four fewer
admissions to BSAS in FY24 than FY23. The number of youth admissions to BSAS services is up
34% since FY18.

Most admissions are for BSAS’ “intervention” service.134 This is consistent with recent years.
These programs are designed to intervene with youth who have already begun to use
substances and are “at risk” for using substances. These programs include activities such as
street outreach and youth organizing. Admissions for BSAS clinical stabilization, residential
services, and outpatient counseling have declined substantially since FY18.

The number of applications for complaint for underlying drug/alcohol offenses provides a rough
proxy for the number of youth involved in the juvenile justice system who may be eligible for a
BSAS referral. The data in the table, below, compares the number of youth referred to BSAS
with the number of applications for complaint with underlying drug/alcohol offenses. In FY24,

_ ; BSAS referral data provided to the OCA by the DPH BSAS
As reported in the "Juvenile Court Clinic” section below, referrals to the Court Clinic for
Substance Abuse Commitment evaluations have also declined most years since FY18. This can
suggest one of two things:
1. Juvenile justice professionals are referring youth to BSAS less frequently than they
could.
2. Youth coming into contact with the juvenile justice system with underlying drug/alcohol
charges are there for charges related to something other than actual alcohol/drug use
(e.g., distribution of controlled substances as opposed to possession), and therefore,
BSAS services may be unnecessary.
BSAS providers may refer youth to other services once their BSAS services have ended. Multiple
referrals may be made for each youth. In FY24, the most frequent referrals at dis-enrollment
include referrals to:137
• Outpatient substance abuse counseling
• Residential treatment
• School personnel, school system
• Recovery high school
• Self, Family, Non-medical professionals
• Referral not made – client dropped out
136 Data is approximate based on aggregate applications and aggregate BSAS referrals. We are unable to match individual
applications for complaint (Trial Court data) with a BSAS referral outcome (DPH data).

Department of Mental Health
The Department of Mental Health (DMH) reports applications and program participation data
for youth in their system, as well as youth in Juvenile Courts who are referred to the Juvenile
Court Clinic.
Child, Youth, and Family Programming
Within DMH, the Child Youth and Family (CYF) Services division provides supports and services
for youth, as well as young adults up to the age of 22. For the purposes of this report, the data
presented represents only individuals between 7 and 17 years old at the end of the fiscal year.
In FY24, the number of youth applicants for DMH full-service authorization138 stayed virtually
the same as in FY23 and FY22. Of the 745 applications, DMH approved 41% (n=305) and denied
29% (n=214). The rest of the applications were withdrawn either by DMH service authorization
staff or parent/caregivers withdrawing from the process. In the case of withdrawn applications,
DMH staff ensure families receive information about other mental health services and
resources that they can access in their communities to meet their child’s mental health needs.
Approval rates for DMH applicants have stayed roughly the same since FY21. Since FY18,
applications for DMH services have declined 46%.

Service authorization regulations were updated in FY18 which created the limited service authorization (LSA)
pathway to receiving DMH services. Due to this, a sizeable portion of applications that would have been FSA were
treated as LSA applications in FY19 which impacted the FY19 FSA numbers considerably.
Source: Data provided to the OCA by the Department of Mental Health, Child, Youth, and Family Programming
138 This is the typical service authorization process that most youth/families applying to DMH go through. It includes both a
clinical and service needs review to determine whether youth are approved to receive DMH services.104 CMR 29 (mass.gov)

DMH Full Service Authorization Applicants (FY18-FY24)
Fiscal Year

In addition to the 305 youth applicants whose “full-service authorization” application was
approved for DMH services in FY24, DMH also approved 367 additional youth via a “limited
service authorization” (LSA) process (down 21% from 464 LSA applicants in FY23). DMH’s LSA
process enables more youth to access low-barrier, early intervention mental health services in
their communities.
DMH provided 2,547 youth statewide with community mental health services in FY24. The
majority of youth received Flexible Support Services. Still, the number of youth enrolled in
these services was down 23% from last year. The number of youth enrolled in the PACT-Y
program tripled between FY23 and FY24. The number of youth who received emergency room
diversion services increased just 2% after increasing 74% in FY23.139

Juvenile Court Clinics
In addition to DMH’s CYF services, DMH operates the Juvenile Court Clinics. Youth with open
delinquency cases, CRA cases, and Care and Protection cases can be referred by a judge to the
Court Clinic for evaluations and services at any time during their Juvenile Court case.

DYS categorizes offense severity by “grid level.” This is a numeric representation, ranging from 1 (least serious) to 7 (most serious),
based on adult sentencing guidelines. Table 12 below highlights common offenses and their corresponding grid level.
For the purposes of this report, grid levels have been combined into low (grid levels 1-2), medium (grid level 3), and high (grid levels
4-7) severity levels.

Appendix F: Racial and Ethnic Disparities in the Juvenile Justice System
As noted in this and all previous JJPAD annual reports, there are persistent racial and ethnic inequities in the Commonwealth’s
juvenile justice system, and in FY24 Black and Latino youth remained overrepresented at each process point in the juvenile justice
system. Table 13 below breaks down juvenile justice process point by race/ethnicity. Tables 14-16 calculate the disparities in cases
involving Black youth and Latino youth compared to cases involving white youth by process point.
There are several methods for studying disparities. The tables below highlights two:
1. Percent Change—compares year-to-year changes for each race category. For example, there was a 25% increase in the
number of applications for complaint initiated by arrest for Black/African American youth from FY23 to FY24. (Table 14)
2. Relative Rate Index (RRI)*— compares the observed rate of disproportionality for white youth to the observed rate of
disproportionality for youth of color after adjusting for “base” population rates, using either data on the demographics of all
Massachusetts youth as identified by the U. S. Census, or the demographic breakdown of the youth at an earlier stage of the
juvenile justice process. RRIs greater than 1.0 indicate an increased likelihood of involvement for people of color at that
point. RRIs less than 1.0 indicate a decreased likelihood of involvement for people of color at that point. For example, Latino
youth were 2.79 times more likely to experience an overnight arrest admission than white youth. (Tables 15 and 16)

*Data broken down by race/ethnicity is not accessible for FY20 because of a combination of MDPH staff turnover and the impacts of the COVID-19
pandemic on both community-based organizations and MDPH. **Race/ethnicity data consists of aggregated counts of all youth served, including youth who
are 18 and older. +FY23 was the first year Cape Verdean and Biracial or Multiracial were tracked in the reporting system.
Race/Ethnicity categories are NOT mutually exclusive. Youth may self-identify in as many categories as apply to their backgrounds, therefore these counts
will sum to greater than the corresponding totals in the report and the percentages will sum to greater than 100%.
These race-ethnicity counts do not reflect all youth served by these programs because race-ethnicity information was not recorded for all youth. In some
cases, this likely reflected that a program did not know the racial/ethnic self-identification of some of their youth (e.g., youth may not self-report during
interactions with staff, may decline to answer in response to a direct intake question, or were unsure of their own ancestry). Source: Data provided to the

Appendix I: BSAS Service Type Definitions
Table 19: Service Type Definitions
1st Offender Drunk Driver The Driver Alcohol Education (DAE) programs are available to those individuals who agree to the
alternative sentencing, sanction as specified within Massachusetts General Laws for the offense of
driving under-the-influence. Specifically, each DAE program participant is provided with a structured
group where they receive educational material to help them identify and understand alcohol abuse
issues and drinking-and-driving behaviors. While the major focus of these programs is on alcohol,
other substances of abuse are also discussed. The program provides 40 hours of services conducted
over 16 weeks and includes an assessment, participation in self-help and victim-impact community
meetings.
Eligibility: Individuals convicted for the first time for drunk driving and who choose this option as an
alternative to losing their license or possible incarceration. Referrals are generally made by the
adjudicating district court; however, if the client is under 21, the Registry of Motor Vehicles may
mandate the offender's participation.
129

In FY24, more than half (53%) of youth served by the DPH HEAL program identified as Black and/or Hispanic/Latinx,
consistent with FY23 but down from prior years.144
Note: Race/ethnicity data consists of aggregated counts of all youth served, including youth over 18 years old.
Race/ethnicity categories are not mutually exclusive. Youth may self-identify in as many categories as apply to
their backgrounds, therefore these percentages will sum to greater than 100% and more than the individual youth
totals presented in the above charts. These race/ethnicity counts do not reflect all youth serviced by HEAL
programs due to unknown or missing data. For FY19-FY22, between 11% and 38% of data is missing. *FY20 is
excluded from this chart because data is unavailable due to a combination of DPH staff turnover and the impacts
of the pandemic on both the programs and DPH. The overall grant was reprocured in FY23. Source: Data provided
to the OCA from DPH CYVPU
In FY24, 36% of all youth served by DPH HEAL programs identified as girls, 10% identified as
transgender, non-binary, or gender nonconforming, and 19% identified as lesbian, gay, bisexual,
queer, asexual or questioning their sexual orientation.

SOGI consists of aggregated counts of all youth served, including youth who are 18 and older. FY23 was the first
year that DPH HEAL tracked youth’s self-identified gender identity, transgender status, and sexual orientation.
These counts do not reflect all youth served by these programs because it was not recorded for all youth if it was
undisclosed or unknown to the program. Source: Data provided to the OCA from DPH CYVPU
Department of Public Health Bureau of Substance Addiction Services (BSAS)
Contrary to the juvenile justice system data presented in this report, white youth represent the
most frequent admissions to BSAS compared to other race/ethnicity categories. In FY24, 44%
(n=628) of admissions to BSAS were for white youth, though the number of admissions for
white youth declined 9% since FY23. The number of admissions increased 38% for Black youth
between FY23 and FY24 and declined 19% for Latino youth.
While admissions to BSAS for all youth increased since FY18, the number of admissions for
white youth increased at the highest rate: 461% compared to a 172% increase for Black youth
and a 73% increase for Latino youth.

In FY24, girls made up a slight majority of the BSAS admissions. The number of admissions to
BSAS for youth identifying as transgender more than doubled between FY23 and FY24. Since
FY18, the number of admissions for girls increased 90% (from 391 admissions in FY18 to 742 in
FY24) while the number of admissions for boys decreased 18% (from 793 in FY18 to 647 in

bisexual. However, this is likely an underestimate as 80% of sexual orientation data is missing.
