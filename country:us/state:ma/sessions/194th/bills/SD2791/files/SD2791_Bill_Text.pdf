Re: Report on Specialty Court Line Item 0330-0601
Dear Chairs Rodrigues and Michlewitz:
Pursuant to the provisions of Fiscal Year 2025 budget line item 0330-0601, we are pleased to report on
the Trial Court’s use of specialty court funding, specifically the interdepartmental transfers of funds to
various departments of the Commonwealth.
The Massachusetts Trial Court greatly appreciates the Legislature’s leadership and support in funding the
costs of maintaining and operating 63 existing specialty courts operating across Massachusetts. Every
Specialty Courts has a full-time or part-time Specialty Courts Clinician who provides bio-psych-social
assessments and referrals to care, short term case management while the participant is connecting to
outside treatment providers, and ongoing monitoring of participants’ engagement in treatment.
For FY2025, the Trial Court provided the Department of Mental Health (DMH) with $4,223,585 through
an Interdepartmental Service Agreement, calculated to cover the costs of the Specialty Court Clinicians
working in the 63 specialty courts. As of March 26, 2025, DMH has expended $3,886,897.19 and there is a
balance of $336,687.81 remaining in the ISA that will be expended by June 30.
Also, in FY2025, the Trial Court provided the Department of Veterans Services (DVS) with $210,000
through an Interdepartmental Service Agreement to defray the costs of assigning a member of the DVS
SAVE Team to each of the 7 Veterans Treatment Courts located across the Commonwealth. As of March 4,
2025, DVS has expended $170,385.11 with $39,614.69 remaining.
The successful operation of specialty courts, as enabled by the budget appropriation, results from
unprecedented collaboration by the Trial Court, Department of Mental Health, Department of Public
Health’s Bureau of Substance Addiction Services, and Department of Veterans Services.
We greatly appreciate your support for this important work.
