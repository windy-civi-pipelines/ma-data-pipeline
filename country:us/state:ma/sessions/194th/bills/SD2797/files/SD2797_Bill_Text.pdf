Mr. Michael D. Hurley, Clerk
Massachusetts Senate
State House, Room 335
Boston, MA 02133
Dear Mr. Clerk:
Pursuant to Section 18 of Chapter 94G of the Massachusetts General Laws, the Cannabis Control
Commission (Commission) is required to file an annual report with your office and that of the
House Clerk including (i) the number of audits performed under this section; (ii) a summary of
findings under the audits; and (iii) the cost of each audit.
Pursuant to statutory requirements, all audits shall be conducted in accordance with generally
accepted auditing standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public
Accountants. As of this date, the Commission has not conducted such audits because the
Commission requires additional funding to procure and/or pay the vendor with the relevant
expertise and experience in directing the specific audit allowed under current statute.
Please let me know if you have any questions.
Sincerely,
Travis Ahern
Executive Director
