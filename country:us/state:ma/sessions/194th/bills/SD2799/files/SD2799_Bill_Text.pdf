MASSACHUSETTS STATE LOTTERY COMMISSION
2024 ANNUAL REPORT
DEBORAH B. GOLDBERG MARK WILLIAM BRACKEN
TREASURER & RECEIVER GENERAL EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR

Letter from the Executive Director
In 2024, Charitable Gaming licensees throughout the Commonwealth reported a total of $45.2 million
in gross revenues, comprised of $19.3 million from raffles, $15.1 million from Beano games, $10.6
million from charity game ticket sales, and $68,329 from bazaars (casino nights). While this reflects
a $1.77 million decrease in gross revenues compared to 2023, Beano games saw a 4.7 percent
increase in revenue, making up 33.5 percent of the total gross receipts for 2024.
Proceeds from Charitable Gaming positively impact communities throughout the Commonwealth in
many ways. Students receive scholarships, families in need receive holiday food and gift baskets,
senior citizens celebrate holidays, veterans are honored and assisted, and many youth sports
activities are supported.
While generating revenue for many charitable causes, Bingo provides an important social component
for some citizens. The Lottery is proud to assist the Commonwealth in offering an enjoyable social
activity that provides a mechanism for organizations to support local causes.
The Lottery would like to thank all of the dedicated volunteers and patrons throughout the
Commonwealth who have contributed to the continuation of Charitable Gaming in 2024. Their tireless
commitment and devotion has helped ease some of the financial burden faced by countless charitable
organizations across Massachusetts. We are hopeful that 2025 will provide additional opportunities for
our Charitable Gaming partners and the patrons who enjoy participating in these activities.
Sincerely,
Mark William Bracken
Executive Director

History of Legislative Authority
Bingo (Beano) was legalized in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts on September 29, 1971.
Effective September 4, 1973, Chapter 729 of the Acts of 1973 transferred responsibility for control of
the operation of Bingo from the Massachusetts Department of Public Safety to the Massachusetts
State Lottery Commission. By authority conferred in Section 38 of Chapter 10 of the General Laws,
Rules and Regulations controlling Bingo were adopted on March 1, 1974 and amended in October
1974, July 1980, November 1991, March 1994 and October, 2000.
Effective January 1, 1978, Chapter 219 of the Acts of 1977 transferred responsibility for collection of
the five percent Bingo and Raffle/Bazaar (Casino Functions) Tax from the Department of Revenue
to the Massachusetts State Lottery Commission. By authority conferred in Section 39A of Chapter
10 of the General Laws, Rules and Regulations Controlling Certain Raffle and Bazaar Permits were
adopted earlier and amended in December 1980.
Senior Citizens’ Recreational Bingo
Effective March 16, 1984, Chapter 619, Acts of 1983 allowed for the conduct of Recreational Bingo
at Senior Citizens’ or Golden Age Clubs for the recreation of members. This law requires said
organizations apply for an identification number from the Massachusetts State Lottery Commission.
During 2024, the Massachusetts State Lottery Commission had on file 325 identification numbers
issued for Senior Citizens’ Recreational Bingo. Qualified organizations are provided certificates at
no cost.
