Dear Chairs Barrett, Cusack, Collins, Cabral, Rodrigues, Michlewitz, and Mr. Hurley and Mr.
Carroll,
Under the provisions of Section 10(f) of Chapter 25A of the General Laws, the Green
Communities Division is submitting the 2024 Annual Report to the Massachusetts General Court
for your review. This report summarizes the Green Communities Designation and Grant
Program. The program is committed to support our 351 Municipal Communities with both
technical and financial assistance to achieve the Commonwealth’s clean energy and climate
goals. In 2024, the Green Communities Division awarded over $17 million in grants.
During the 2024 calendar year, one Green Community (Clinton) opted to rescind the
Stretch Energy Building Code, removing the town from the Green Communities program.
However, an additional seven Communities were Designated, bringing the total to 297
Massachusetts Green Communities, which represents 90.5 percent of the Commonwealth’s
population.
The Division launched the Climate Leader Community Certification program in 2024,
which supports municipalities seeking to drastically greenhouse gas emissions created by
municipal operations. Modeled after the successful Green Communities program, municipalities
seeking Climate Leader Community status pledge to eliminate the use of onsite fossil fuels by
2050, adopt a zero-emission-vehicle-first policy, and adopt the municipal opt-in specialized
energy code.
Please reach out if you have any questions.
Sincerely,
Joanne Bissetta
Director, Green Communities Division

Green Communities 2024 Annual Report
The Green Communities Division, established under M.G.L. c. 25A, § 10, assists the
Commonwealth’s municipalities and other local governmental bodies to: reduce
energy consumption and costs; reduce pollution; facilitate the development of
renewable energy and alternative energy resources; and create local jobs related to
the building of renewable and alternative energy facilities as well as the installation of
energy-efficient equipment.
In 2024, the Green Communities Division awarded $15,965,438 in direct grants to
110 municipalities, and $160,000 worth of direct technical assistance to 20
municipalities to develop municipal decarbonization roadmaps. The Division also
awarded $1,754,000 to 45 municipalities with populations under 35,000 via the U.S.
Department of Energy’s Energy Efficiency Conservation Block Grant (EECBG)
program authorized under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.
In addition, the $987,350 Regional Energy Planning Assistance awarded in 2023 to
regional planning agencies continues to support municipal clean energy initiatives
and capacity building. Each of these grant programs are summarized below.
In November, the Division hosted its first-ever Green Communities Summit in Devens.
More than two hundred municipal officials gathered to learn about efficiency and
decarbonization practices, learn from each other, and celebrate newly designated
Green Communities and communities that achieved 20% energy savings. The
successful event spurred new collaborations and provided input for needed
resources and training.

Designation Awards
Under the Green Communities Act, cities and towns must meet five criteria to be
designated a Green Community and receive funding. Initial Designation awards are
formula-based grants awarded to newly minted Green Communities for clean energy
projects at municipal and school facilities, as well as vehicular fuel reduction projects.
Grant awards are based on a $125,000 base for each designated Green Community,
plus additional amounts tied to per capita income and population.
There are now 297 designated Green Communities, representing 90.5% of the
Commonwealth’s population. Since the inaugural designation in 2010, DOER has
awarded over $184.5 million in grants to cities and towns to upgrade municipal and
school facilities. These grant-supported projects leveraged $42.6 million in Mass
Save® incentives and cut annual energy costs by an estimated $29.2 million.
Seven municipalities applied, met the requirements, and were designated in 2024.
This newest group of Green Communities committed to reduce their energy
6
consumption by 70,872 MMBTUs in five years, energy use equivalent to heating and
powering 550 homes, and greenhouse gas emission (GHG) reduction of 4,423 tons,
equivalent to taking 931 cars off the roads.
Boxborough – one of the communities designated in 2024 – was the first community
designated under the expanded program pursuant to Chapter 179 of the Act of
2022, An Act Driving Clean Energy and Offshore Wind, which allowed the
participation of multi-jurisdictional Municipal Light Plant (MLP) communities.

South Hadley $180,350
Clinton, at a Town Meeting in June 2024, rescinded the Stretch Energy Code, thus
nullifying the town’s Green Communities designation status.
Competitive Grant Awards
Once designated as a Green Community, cities and towns are eligible for competitive
grants. These grants provide financial support for energy efficiency and renewable
energy projects that further the designated communities’ clean energy goals. In 2024,
existing Green Communities that have successfully invested their initial designation
grants and previous competitive grant awards participated in the twelfth annual
round of DOER Green Communities competitive grants. Grants are capped at
$250,000 per municipality, except for multi-year building decarbonization grants,
which were capped at $500,000. In 2024, grants were solicited in the spring and fall.
Forty-three (43) out of forty-five (45) municipalities that applied for Block 1
Competitive Grants (Spring 2024) were approved by DOER to receive $7,282,934 in
funding for at least some of their requested project(s). The proposed projects will
leverage $2,148,794 in utility incentives and yield energy cost savings of $524,842
annually. The 22,297 MMBtus expected in annual energy savings translates to the
amount of energy consumed by 172 Massachusetts households. The projects are
7
estimated to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by
1,451 metric tons annually, roughly equivalent to
taking over 280 cars off the road.
The Town of Hamilton’s $500,000 award is
supporting the decarbonization of its historic town
hall that includes the installation of a geothermal
heating and cooling system and a ground-mounted
solar PV system.
It is part of a larger building renovation project
funded by the Community Preservation Funds that
brings the building into ADA compliance, restores
historic building attributes and creates a 21st century
public facility.

DOER staff works with communities to ensure energy projects are well thought-out
and defined. Projects that were not awarded funds either had little to no energy or
emissions savings or needed additional scoping and/or analysis.
For a complete list of grant awards and projects by Green Community, see our
website.
Municipal Energy Technical Assistance Grants
Municipal Energy Technical Assistance (META) grants are offered once a year by the
Green Communities Division of the Department of Energy Resources.
All municipalities, regional school districts, and water/wastewater districts were
invited to apply for META via a Program Opportunity Notice (PON) that was posted
on CommBuys (the public procurement platform administered by the Operational
Services Division) on October 3, 2023; applications were due November 17, 2023.
Municipalities were not required to be a designated Green Community to apply.
Eligible applicants can apply for up to $25,000 to fund technical assistance and
expertise needed to complete energy projects in cities and towns to reduce energy
costs, reduce GHG emissions, and decarbonize local buildings and fleets. A total of
$268,950 was awarded to 17 municipalities.
The town of Shelburne used its $14,900 META grant award to study energy resiliency
options at two town-owned buildings, one of which recently converted to heat pump
technology from an oil-fired steam system.

Energy Efficiency Conservation Block Grants (EECBG)
Funds for these grants to municipalities was provided through a formula EECBG
grant from the United States Department of Energy (DOE) to DOER for the purpose
of disbursing funds to municipalities with populations under 35,000. DOER solicited
competitive grant applications on May 24, 2024; applications were due on August 16,

Section 2:
2024. Under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA)—also known as the
Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL)—the goals of the EECBG program are to reduce
fossil fuel emissions, reduce total energy use, and improve energy efficiency in ways
that maximize benefits to communities and disadvantaged communities. DOER
created the EECBG subgrant program for which 303 municipalities were eligible, and
awards were capped at $50,000 per municipality, or $75,000 for a building envelope
improvement project.
Twenty-nine (29) of the fifty-six (56) applications received were approved by DOER to
receive $1,754,000 in funding for at least some of their requested project(s). The
approved applications include two (2) collaborative applications involving multiple
municipalities. In total, forty-five (45) municipalities will be served by EECBG funding.
DOER prioritized projects based on several factors, including benefit to Justice40
communities (a criterion specified by DOE), benefit to Massachusetts Environmental
Justice (EJ) communities, availability of alternative funding for proposed projects,
geographic distribution, and diversity of project types.
The proposed projects will leverage $7,103,222 in utility incentives and municipal
contributions and yield annual energy cost savings of $97,263. The 9,726 MMBtus
expected in annual energy savings translates to the amount of energy consumed by
75 Massachusetts households. The projects are estimated to reduce greenhouse gas
emissions by 555 metric tons annually, roughly equivalent to taking 107 cars off the
road.
Nantucket was awarded $75,000 to replace 57 aging and leaky windows at the
municipally-owned nursing home. Once completed, this project will reduce oil use
and improve indoor air quality and occupant comfort.

Municipal Decarbonization Roadmap Assistance for Climate Leader
Communities Certification
The inaugural group of 35 Green Communities was designated in 2010. Since then,
the program has grown to include 297 municipalities. In 2021, An Act Creating a
Next-Generation Roadmap for Massachusetts Climate Policy, was enacted into law,
codifying the Commonwealth’s commitment to achieve net zero emissions in 2050
and efforts to combat climate change and protect vulnerable communities. As a
result, DOER intends to offer additional opportunities and resources to municipalities
that actively participate in the Green Communities Designation and Grant Program
through a new program that aligns with the Commonwealth’s goals. Climate Leader
Communities is a voluntary program that encourages municipalities to implement
clean energy and climate-friendly policies and programs to broaden depth and
breadth of decarbonizing municipal and school facilities, along with enhanced
community engagement.
To be eligible for Climate Leader Community certification, communities must meet
the following requirements:

Section 3:
1. Be an existing Green Community in “good standing”

Section 4:
2. Have a local body (sustainability committee, energy committee, etc.) that
advises the municipality on clean energy/climate initiatives.

Section 5:
3. Commit to eliminate on-site fossil fuel use by 2050 (municipal
buildings/operations)

Section 6:
4. Create a municipal decarbonization roadmap.

Section 7:
5. Adopt a zero-emission vehicle first policy.

Section 8:
6. Adopt the specialized opt-in building code.
Recognizing that cities and towns may need assistance to develop municipal
decarbonization roadmaps, the Green Communities Division is offering planning
assistance to eligible municipalities for roadmap development to help achieve
Climate Leader Community certification. This planning assistance is provided through
consultants selected by the Green Communities Division. In 2024, this assistance was
awarded to the municipalities listed below.

Regional Energy Planning Assistance Awards
Regional Energy Planning Assistance (REPA) grants are offered by the Green
Communities Division to augment municipal capacity necessary to: 1) participate in
the Green Communities Designation and Grant Program; and 2) advance clean
energy projects in under-resourced municipalities.
REPA grants are solicited and awarded every two years; the most recent grant award
was issued in summer 2023 and is valued at $987,350. In 2024, regional planning
agencies and Cape Light Compact carried out direct services to 159 municipalities
and continue to work on capacity building activities and regional projects to benefit
all communities within their respective regions. It is important to note that several of
the regional planning agencies are developing regional climate action plans through
the EPA’s Climate Pollution Reduction Grant (CPRG). REPA will be used to bolster
stakeholder engagement, particularly among EJ communities.

Clinton, at a Town Meeting in June 2024, rescinded the Stretch Energy Code, thus
nullifying the town’s Green Communities designation status.
Competitive Grant Awards
Once designated as a Green Community, cities and towns are eligible for competitive
grants. These grants provide financial support for energy efficiency and renewable
energy projects that further the designated communities’ clean energy goals. In 2024,
existing Green Communities that have successfully invested their initial designation
grants and previous competitive grant awards participated in the twelfth annual
round of DOER Green Communities competitive grants. Grants are capped at
$250,000 per municipality, except for multi-year building decarbonization grants,
which were capped at $500,000. In 2024, grants were solicited in the spring and fall.
Forty-three (43) out of forty-five (45) municipalities that applied for Block 1
Competitive Grants (Spring 2024) were approved by DOER to receive $7,282,934 in
funding for at least some of their requested project(s). The proposed projects will
leverage $2,148,794 in utility incentives and yield energy cost savings of $524,842
annually. The 22,297 MMBtus expected in annual energy savings translates to the
amount of energy consumed by 172 Massachusetts households. The projects are
7

estimated to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by
1,451 metric tons annually, roughly equivalent to
taking over 280 cars off the road.
The Town of Hamilton’s $500,000 award is
supporting the decarbonization of its historic town
hall that includes the installation of a geothermal
heating and cooling system and a ground-mounted
solar PV system.
It is part of a larger building renovation project
funded by the Community Preservation Funds that
brings the building into ADA compliance, restores
historic building attributes and creates a 21st century
public facility.

Municipal Energy Technical Assistance Grants
Municipal Energy Technical Assistance (META) grants are offered once a year by the
Green Communities Division of the Department of Energy Resources.
All municipalities, regional school districts, and water/wastewater districts were
invited to apply for META via a Program Opportunity Notice (PON) that was posted
on CommBuys (the public procurement platform administered by the Operational
Services Division) on October 3, 2023; applications were due November 17, 2023.
Municipalities were not required to be a designated Green Community to apply.
Eligible applicants can apply for up to $25,000 to fund technical assistance and
expertise needed to complete energy projects in cities and towns to reduce energy
costs, reduce GHG emissions, and decarbonize local buildings and fleets. A total of
$268,950 was awarded to 17 municipalities.
The town of Shelburne used its $14,900 META grant award to study energy resiliency
options at two town-owned buildings, one of which recently converted to heat pump
technology from an oil-fired steam system.

Energy Efficiency Conservation Block Grants (EECBG)
Funds for these grants to municipalities was provided through a formula EECBG
grant from the United States Department of Energy (DOE) to DOER for the purpose
of disbursing funds to municipalities with populations under 35,000. DOER solicited
competitive grant applications on May 24, 2024; applications were due on August 16,
2024. Under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA)—also known as the
Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL)—the goals of the EECBG program are to reduce
fossil fuel emissions, reduce total energy use, and improve energy efficiency in ways
that maximize benefits to communities and disadvantaged communities. DOER
created the EECBG subgrant program for which 303 municipalities were eligible, and
awards were capped at $50,000 per municipality, or $75,000 for a building envelope
improvement project.
Twenty-nine (29) of the fifty-six (56) applications received were approved by DOER to
receive $1,754,000 in funding for at least some of their requested project(s). The
approved applications include two (2) collaborative applications involving multiple
municipalities. In total, forty-five (45) municipalities will be served by EECBG funding.
DOER prioritized projects based on several factors, including benefit to Justice40
communities (a criterion specified by DOE), benefit to Massachusetts Environmental
Justice (EJ) communities, availability of alternative funding for proposed projects,
geographic distribution, and diversity of project types.
The proposed projects will leverage $7,103,222 in utility incentives and municipal
contributions and yield annual energy cost savings of $97,263. The 9,726 MMBtus
expected in annual energy savings translates to the amount of energy consumed by
75 Massachusetts households. The projects are estimated to reduce greenhouse gas
emissions by 555 metric tons annually, roughly equivalent to taking 107 cars off the
road.
Nantucket was awarded $75,000 to replace 57 aging and leaky windows at the
municipally-owned nursing home. Once completed, this project will reduce oil use
and improve indoor air quality and occupant comfort.

Municipal Decarbonization Roadmap Assistance for Climate Leader
Communities Certification
The inaugural group of 35 Green Communities was designated in 2010. Since then,
the program has grown to include 297 municipalities. In 2021, An Act Creating a
Next-Generation Roadmap for Massachusetts Climate Policy, was enacted into law,
codifying the Commonwealth’s commitment to achieve net zero emissions in 2050
and efforts to combat climate change and protect vulnerable communities. As a
result, DOER intends to offer additional opportunities and resources to municipalities
that actively participate in the Green Communities Designation and Grant Program
through a new program that aligns with the Commonwealth’s goals. Climate Leader
Communities is a voluntary program that encourages municipalities to implement
clean energy and climate-friendly policies and programs to broaden depth and
breadth of decarbonizing municipal and school facilities, along with enhanced
community engagement.
To be eligible for Climate Leader Community certification, communities must meet
the following requirements:
1. Be an existing Green Community in “good standing”
2. Have a local body (sustainability committee, energy committee, etc.) that
advises the municipality on clean energy/climate initiatives.
3. Commit to eliminate on-site fossil fuel use by 2050 (municipal
buildings/operations)
4. Create a municipal decarbonization roadmap.
5. Adopt a zero-emission vehicle first policy.
6. Adopt the specialized opt-in building code.
Recognizing that cities and towns may need assistance to develop municipal
decarbonization roadmaps, the Green Communities Division is offering planning
assistance to eligible municipalities for roadmap development to help achieve
Climate Leader Community certification. This planning assistance is provided through
consultants selected by the Green Communities Division. In 2024, this assistance was
awarded to the municipalities listed below.

Regional Energy Planning Assistance Awards
Regional Energy Planning Assistance (REPA) grants are offered by the Green
Communities Division to augment municipal capacity necessary to: 1) participate in
the Green Communities Designation and Grant Program; and 2) advance clean
energy projects in under-resourced municipalities.
REPA grants are solicited and awarded every two years; the most recent grant award
was issued in summer 2023 and is valued at $987,350. In 2024, regional planning
agencies and Cape Light Compact carried out direct services to 159 municipalities
and continue to work on capacity building activities and regional projects to benefit
all communities within their respective regions. It is important to note that several of
the regional planning agencies are developing regional climate action plans through
the EPA’s Climate Pollution Reduction Grant (CPRG). REPA will be used to bolster
stakeholder engagement, particularly among EJ communities.
