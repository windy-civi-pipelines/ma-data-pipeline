RE: April 2025 Certification of MBTA Dedicated Sales Tax Revenues for the Fiscal Year
Ending June 30, 2025
Dear Secretary Gorzkowicz and Secretary Tibbits-Nutt:
Pursuant to Subsection (b) of Section 35T of Chapter 10 the General Laws, this letter certifies the
estimated Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) dedicated sales tax revenue
projected to be credited to the MBTA State and Local Contribution Fund. The MBTA is to receive
the greater of either the base revenue or the dedicated sales tax revenue. This certification is made
in consultation with the Department of Revenue (DOR), and is based on the revised Fiscal Year
2025 sales tax revenue estimate from DOR.
I certify that based on DOR's January 2025 sales tax revenue estimate for Fiscal Year 2025, the
projected dedicated sales tax revenue amount for Fiscal Year 2025 is $1,472,324,435, which
includes an additional $160,000,000 as required by the definition of “Dedicated sales tax revenue
amount” in Section 35T of Chapter 10 of the General Laws.
As certified on March 4, 2024, the base revenue amount for Fiscal Year 2025 is $1,197,200,017.
The projected dedicated sales tax revenue amount represents the amount of, “all monies received
by the commonwealth equal to 1 per cent of the gross receipts of a sale as defined in chapter 64H
and 1 per cent of the sales price of a purchase as defined by chapter 64I from that portion of the
taxes imposed under said chapters 64H and 64I as excises upon the sale and use at retail of tangible
property or services, and upon the storage, use or other consumption of tangible property or

services, including interest thereon and penalties plus the amount of $160,000,000 but not
including any portion of the taxes imposed on the sale of meals as defined in paragraph (h) of

Section 2:
section 6 of said chapter 64H.” MGL c. 10, § 35T. The calculation of sales and meals taxes
dedicated to the MBTA is net of refunds, abatements, and amounts set aside under Paragraph (b)
of Section 10 of Chapter 152 of the Acts of 1997 (the “Convention Center Portion”).
The projected dedicated sales tax amount was calculated as follows:
As the dedicated sales tax revenue is projected to exceed the base revenue, no quarterly transfers
are expected to be necessary from the General Fund pursuant to Subsection (b) of Section 35T of
Chapter 10 of the General Laws and the Memorandum of Understanding between the MBTA, the
Treasurer’s Office, the Executive Office of Administration and Finance, the Comptroller’s Office,
and the Department of Revenue.

Officer, at Pauline.Lieu@mass.gov or (617) 352-8239 or me at William.McNamara@mass.gov or
