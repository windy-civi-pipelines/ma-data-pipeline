MASSACHUSETTS PAROLE BOARD OVERVIEW
Introduction
The Massachusetts Parole Board (the Parole Board or the Board) is an agency within the Executive
Office of Public Safety and Security (EOPSS) with the decisional authority in the Commonwealth
of Massachusetts for matters of parole granting, parole supervision, rescission, revocation,
discharges, and early termination of parole. The Parole Board has jurisdiction over all individuals
committed to state or county correctional facilities for terms of sixty days or more, in accordance
with M.G.L. c. 127, § 128, excluding those who are ineligible for parole. The agency serves the
public, victims, incarcerated individuals, formerly incarcerated individuals, and petitioners for
executive clemency throughout the Commonwealth by conducting face-to-face hearings,
supervising formerly incarcerated individuals in the community, providing notice and assistance
to victims and their families, and providing reentry services to individuals leaving custody,
pursuant to M.G.L. c. 127, § 158.
In 1837, Massachusetts enacted the first law in the United States to authorize parole. Although
over the years there have been numerous legislative changes affecting parole in Massachusetts, the
agency’s core reentry mission remains the same.
Mission
The Parole Board’s overall mission is to promote public safety by the return of incarcerated
individuals to the community through supervised, conditional release, so that a successful
transition from confinement to discharge from parole provides a basis for continued responsible
conduct.

Parole Process
In Massachusetts, parole is the procedure whereby certain incarcerated individuals are released
prior to the expiration of their sentence, permitting the remainder of their sentence to be served in
the community under supervision, subject to specific rules and conditions of behavior. The Parole
Board has statutory responsibility for administering the parole process. It determines whether and
under what conditions an eligible individual sentenced to a correctional institution should be issued
a parole permit. Once released, it supervises all individuals released under parole conditions. It
also determines whether alleged parole violations warrant revocation of parole permits, and
whether the circumstances warrant early termination of parole before the actual parole discharge
date. Figure 1 captures the Massachusetts parole process.

Organization Structure
The Chair of the Parole Board serves as the Executive and Administrative head of the agency, as
well as the Commissioner of the Massachusetts Interstate Compact for Adult Offender Supervision
(ICAOS). Each Board member, including the Chair, is appointed by the Governor to serve
staggered five-year terms. The seven-member Board serves as the decision-making authority with
respect to release, rescission, revocation, and early termination of parole, if applicable.
Additionally, the Board functions as the Advisory Board of Pardons (ABP), making
recommendations to the Governor on petitions for executive clemency.
As captured in the organizational chart (see Figure 2), there are eight divisions/units within the
agency that work collaboratively to fulfill the common mission of the Parole Board. The Executive
Director of the Parole Board assists the Chair by overseeing the operation of all units within the
agency. The eight divisions/units include:

CHAIR’S MESSAGE: Reflecting on 2023
2023 Annual Statistical Report MPB
Dear Governor Healey, Lieutenant Governor Driscoll, and Secretary Reidy,
I am pleased to present to you the Massachusetts Parole Board’s 2023 Annual Report. The year 2023 was filled with
growth, empowerment, and the collective action of many people who share our dedication to creating and upholding an
equitable, fair, and transparent parole system. Throughout the year, our shared goal of promoting a balanced and
efficient approach to lowering recidivism and enhancing public safety remained at the forefront and guided our actions
as an Agency. We are now even more focused on approaching the work we do in a new way so that it is more purpose-
driven and intentional.
The parole process in Massachusetts is a critical cornerstone of our criminal justice system. We were made stronger
every day by the efforts of many throughout the Commonwealth and we were constantly exploring new ways to
educate, motivate, and prepare individuals eligible for parole. Supporting and guiding those that are under supervision
was one of our key priorities along with holding fair and timely hearings.
These efforts were led by Parole Board Members Edee Alexander, Charlene Bonner, Tonomey Coleman, Sarah
Coughlin, and James Kelcourse as well as Executive Director Lian Hogan, General Counsel Judith Lyons, Chief of
Field Services Angelo Gomez, Chief of Transitional Services Meghan Winston, Deputy Chief of Transitional Services
Jon Spinale, Director of Victim Services Katherine Moran, Director of Research and Planning Pratikshya Bohra-
Mishra, Director of the Life Sentence Unit Joyce Crosby, and Chief of Administrative Services Debra Tata.
Most importantly, without the critical work done every day by the field and transitional parole staff, legal team, hearing
examiners, and all the support staff, none of the efforts and initiatives would have been possible. I would also like to
pay a special thanks to Former Judge Paul Chernoff and Former Parole Supervisor James McCarthy as their
contributions as Special Board Members enabled us to keep pace with the increase in full-board activities over the past
year.
I am also grateful to the many community-based organizations and service providers for the rehabilitative programming
and reentry services that they provide in the prisons and to the individuals on parole in our communities. The Board
and the Field and Transitional teams visited many community-based-organizations this year, which helped to enhance
collaboration and creativity with our community partners to better understand what works.
I also appreciate the attorneys who represent incarcerated people in the parole process, the prosecutors who appear at
our weekly public hearings, and the individuals in prison, on parole, and post-parole who have committed themselves
to positive change.
Finally, I want to acknowledge and thank crime victims and survivors for their participation in the parole process. I am
constantly inspired by their strength, courage, and resilience.
We, the Parole Board, look forward to continued growth in 2024. We are wholly focused on partner-to-partner
collaboration and ensuring a fair criminal justice system for all.
Sincerely,
Tina M. Hurley
Chair of Massachusetts Parole Board and Commissioner of Interstate Compact for Massachusetts

LOOKING BACK AT 2023: Board Members and Activities
2023 Annual Statistical Report MPB
In Massachusetts, the Governor, with the advice and consent of the Council, appoints seven members to the Parole Board to serve staggered five-
year terms. The Board has the authority to make decisions on release, rescission, revocation, and early termination of parole. The Board in its role
as the Advisory Board of Pardons (ABP) also has the authority to make recommendations to the Governor on executive clemency petitions.
In 2023, the Board had only four members from July onwards until two new Board Members were added in November and December. During the
interim with only four Board Members, retired Judge Paul Chernoff and retired Parole Board Field Supervisor James McCarthy stepped up in August
and September respectively, to serve as Special Hearing Officers to assist with conducting timely parole hearings.

LOOKING BACK AT 2023: Releases
2023 Annual Statistical Report MPB
Releases:
1,967 incarcerated individuals were released to supervision in 2023, a 5%
increase from the number released in 2022 (N=1,876). The Agency ensured
that inmates with a positive vote achieved timely release by:
• Carefully vetting home plans to maximize
the rate of suitable home approvals.
• Providing additional transitional and sober
housing options through the availability of

TRANSITIONAL SERVICES UNIT
The TSU is responsible for preparing all release, revocation, and rescission hearings to be heard
by the Parole Board related to either the Commonwealth’s Department of Correction (DOC) or a
county House of Correction (HOC). The division compiles necessary case information for the
Parole Board members to make an informed, balanced judgment. Duties include data entry for all
incarcerated individuals committed across the state, date calculations to determine parole
eligibility and discharge dates, as well as case preparation for parole hearings. The case preparation
for a parole hearing includes reviewing and investigating any inconsistencies in the parole eligible
incarcerated individual’s master file, analyzing and summarizing information for the Parole Board
members, interviewing the incarcerated individual and completing an assessment of his/her
criminogenic factors, as well as acting as an agency liaison to the incarcerated individual as they
prepare for their appearance before the Parole Board. The Level of Service/Case Management
Inventory (LS/CMI) is a validated risk/needs assessment tool used by TSU staff to assess the risk
and need areas of individuals in preparation for their hearings. The TSU is also responsible for
scheduling, coordinating, and facilitating all Parole Board hearings and office votes, with the
exception of hearings and office votes for incarcerated individuals on life sentence, early
termination of parole, and executive clemency. The TSU executes the release of incarcerated
individuals on parole and coordinates with Field staff for their successful transition to the
community. Finally, TSU tracks parole violation warrants and coordinates preliminary revocation
hearings in conjunction with Hearing Examiners for individuals who are returned to custody.
Release, Rescission, and Revocation Hearings
Three types of hearings are held across the Commonwealth of Massachusetts primarily in
correctional facilities, and are broadly categorized as release, rescission, and revocation hearings.
These hearings are primarily held at the institutions and are therefore, referred to as institutional
hearings. Institutional hearings are typically held in two locations: the HOC facilities, located in
each county within the Commonwealth, and the state DOC facilities. There are also parole hearings
held at the Parole Board’s Central Office, which include some victim access hearings (VAH)1, all
life sentence hearings, executive clemency hearings, and termination hearings. Life sentence
hearings, executive clemency hearings, and termination hearings are all open to the public and
separately reported under the sections for Life Sentence Unit and Office of the General Counsel.
Table 1 presents the number of all institutional release, rescission, and revocation hearings held in
2023 with either a positive or denied vote, broken out by facility type. In 2023, the Parole Board
held 2,934 institutional hearings with either a positive or a denied vote. Out of the total, 69% of
hearings were held for incarcerated individuals housed in the county HOCs and the remaining 31%
were held for incarcerated individuals housed in the Massachusetts DOC. As a result of these
hearings, 1,956 individuals were granted a positive parole vote. In the majority of cases,
incarcerated individuals receiving a positive vote are released to supervision in Massachusetts.
They could also be released to out of state supervision through the Interstate Compact Unit (ICU),
1 VAH hearings are included under institutional hearings.
11
2023 Annual Statistical Report MPB
to serve another state or federal sentence, or to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE)
custody. In a small number of cases, incarcerated individuals are also released to a Massachusetts
DOC or HOC facility.
As presented in Table 1, the number of positive votes this year resulted in an overall paroling rate
of 67% for all incarcerated individuals, with the paroling rate being higher (at 70%) among
individuals from the HOC compared to 58% among individuals from the DOC, which is consistent
with the historical trend.2 The paroling rate is calculated by dividing the number of hearings that
resulted in a positive Parole Board vote by the sum of total hearings held that resulted in either a
positive or denied vote.

Rescission Hearings
Rescission hearings are held when the Parole Board exercises its discretion to re-visit a prior
decision to grant parole, due to a change in circumstances following the date of the incarcerated
individual’s parole hearing to determine whether to withdraw, postpone, or allow the prior positive
parole vote to stand. A change of circumstance that prompts the Parole Board to hold a rescission
hearing could be when the incarcerated individual has received new disciplinary infractions for
institutional misconduct or availability of new information since the date of the hearing (i.e. an
outstanding warrant). Table 6 displays the paroling rate for rescission hearings by facility type.
For rescission hearings, a positive vote means rescission was either affirmed or not affirmed but
the individual was granted parole. A denied vote means rescission was affirmed and the individual
was denied parole.

conditions of parole. More information concerning parole violations, which may lead to a

Both currently and formerly incarcerated individuals may waive their right to a parole hearing,
either prior to, or during the hearing process. They may also postpone a scheduled parole hearing;
the next hearing (i.e. postponement hearing) is then scheduled to be held a year later. An
incarcerated individual may postpone if they want to receive additional time to establish a plan for
their parole, to resolve outstanding legal matters, or to have counsel present in situations where
representation is needed. In instances where it does not appear possible for a parole eligible
incarcerated individual to receive an adequate parole hearing due to circumstances outside the
individual’s control such as lack of sufficient information to make an informed decision, the Parole
Board may administratively postpone the incarcerated individual’s hearing in order to obtain the
needed information.
7 The table includes only those hearings which received a disposition of denied re-release or approved re-
release regardless of whether their revocation was affirmed or not. Out of a total of 457 eligible for final
revocation hearing in 2023, 237 hearings were held (23 received dispositions other than reserve or denied
and the remaining 214 received either a reserve or denied disposition). Of the 220 hearings not held, 75
and 145 were postponed and waived at own request respectively. Among all eligible for hearing, 375
received a disposition of revocation affirmed, which includes 145 who waived their hearing (See Table
34).

2023 Annual Statistical Report MPB
In addition to waivers and postponements, hearings may result in an action pending vote or other
types of votes. These miscellaneous votes serve as an administrative disposition. For example, if
a Board Member needs additional information to make an informed decision, they may vote
“action pending” for receipt of the desired document, and then make a final decision once in receipt
of the desired document. A hearing may result in a vote type of “other” because the incarcerated
individual was sick and could not be seen (i.e., receive a vote “not seen”), the Board Members
voted in opposition (i.e., split decision), or the case needs to be put on the next available hearing
list (i.e., PONAL). In these cases, the final disposition is captured by a subsequent hearing and
disposition. Table 9 displays the breakdown for all eligible hearings into those hearings that were
held with different dispositions, those that were postponed to a later date by the individual (as
opposed to postponed by the Board), and those waived at the individual’s request prior to hearing.
1,182 out of 5,882 eligible hearings (i.e. 20% of the total eligible hearings) were waived either
prior to the hearing (20%) or waived at the hearing (<1%) in 2023.

Office Votes
In addition to holding institutional hearings, the Parole Board makes decisions on parole related
matters that do not require an in-person hearing. This is done by using documentation of the case
to provide resolutions via office votes. Office votes require a combination of efforts by TSU, FSD,
OGC, Board Members, and hearing examiners. Office votes are used for a variety of reasons.
Examples of office vote types include requests for change of vote, provisional rescissions and
revocations, appeal requests, and requests for reconsideration. The description of each office vote
type used in 2023 is included in Appendix A. In 2023, the Parole Board processed 2,348 office
votes; this includes all office votes except office votes pertaining to executive clemencies and
termination requests, which are voted in the Executive Sessions, and have been included in the
Office of the General Counsel section.

Institutional Risk/Needs Assessments
As a Criminal Justice Agency with a commitment towards public safety, the Parole Board uses a
validated actuarial risk/needs assessment instrument in making parole release decisions. The
assessment identifies an individual’s risk to recidivate, as well as reveals their criminogenic needs,
which can then be incorporated into the formerly incarcerated individual’s supervision case plan.
The risk/needs assessment tool used by the Parole Board is the Level of Service Case Management
Inventory (LS/CMI). The Parole Board implemented the LS/CMI in early 2013 as a tool to help in
decisions to grant parole to incarcerated individuals, and for formulating appropriate supervision
strategies for formerly incarcerated individuals under supervision. The LS/CMI categorizes risk to
recidivate from very low to very high as set forth in Table 11. The institutional assessments
captured in this table include those conducted by parole officers within the TSU as well as those
conducted by Special Investigators within the LSU.
As summarized in Table 11, most of the institutional assessments scored at high risk level (43%),
followed by medium risk (35%), and very high (at 12%). Only around 10% of assessments scored
at low to very low risk. Table 12 further provides LS/CMI breakdown for major race/ethnic groups;
the same pattern holds across race/ethnic groups with a much smaller proportion scoring low to
very low while a higher proportion scoring medium to very high.
8 'Other' includes all other office vote types that were used less than 50 times in 2023, including request to
attend hearing, special consideration request, request to resolve action pending, request to postpone VAH
hearing, medical release conditions request, request for the Board to note info. memo, and withdraw
warrant request.

LIFE SENTENCE UNIT
The LSU is responsible for preparing all eligible incarcerated individuals sentenced to life in prison
for parole hearings. This includes gathering case materials, preparing case files for Parole Board
members, interviewing incarcerated individuals in preparation for hearings, and conducting the
LS/CMI risk/needs assessments. The unit is responsible for maintaining the incarcerated
individual’s master file, which is a comprehensive compilation of documents and records related
to the individual’s criminal history, institutional history, trial testimony, risk assessments, and
additional evaluative information. The unit coordinates with affiliate agencies such as the District
Attorneys’ Offices, the Attorney General’s Office, Massachusetts State Police, local police
departments, and the DOC in order to obtain such materials. The unit organizes initial life sentence
hearings and review hearings, which involves tracking initial parole eligibility and subsequent
review hearing eligibility for parole eligible individuals sentenced to life. The unit also provides
all necessary notifications of scheduled hearings at the Parole Board’s central office and supplies
notifications of subsequent decisions.
Life Sentence Hearings
There are two types of parole hearings for parole eligible individuals sentenced to life: initial and
review hearings. Adults sentenced to serve life in prison with the possibility of parole must serve
no less than fifteen (15) years before becoming eligible for parole. The Parole Board holds the
initial hearing within sixty (60) days of initial eligibility. If the Parole Board denies parole after
the initial hearing, the incarcerated individual is provided with a subsequent review hearing at five
years, or earlier, at the discretion of the Parole Board. Both the initial and review hearings take
place before all seven members of the Parole Board at the Parole Board’s central office and are
open to the public. As these hearings are public, the Records of Decision (RODs) on life sentence
hearings are made available on the Parole Board’s website. Table 13 provides paroling rates for
life sentence hearings held in 2023 with either a positive or denied vote, broken out by initial and
review hearings.10
10 There were six additional hearings held, three with a disposition of ‘Postpone (Board Decision)’, two
with a disposition of ‘Action Pending’, and one incarcerated individual passed away while awaiting their
hearing disposition.

Juveniles with Life Sentences
In Miller v. Alabama, 132 S. Ct. 2455 (2012), the United States Supreme Court held that the
“imposition of a mandatory sentence of life in prison without parole on individuals who were under
the age of 18 when they committed the murder is contrary to the prohibition on ‘cruel and unusual
punishments’ in the Eighth Amendment.” Following the Miller decision, a juvenile who had been
convicted of first-degree murder filed a petition, challenging Massachusetts laws that required all
individuals convicted of first-degree murder to serve life in prison without the possibility of parole.
On December 24, 2013, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court ruled in Commonwealth v.
Diatchenko, 466 Mass. 655 (2013), that the statutory provisions mandating life without the
possibility of parole were invalid as applied to juveniles who committed murder. The Court also
determined that its holding was retroactive for all juveniles currently serving life sentences for first
degree murder, and that Diatchenko (and others similarly situated) must be given a parole hearing.
After the Supreme Judicial Court’s decision on December 24, 2013, the Parole Board identified
cases in which incarcerated individuals were under the age of 18 on the date of the offense and
were serving a sentence of life without parole for a conviction of first-degree murder.
Among the 127 life sentence hearings held in 2023, six hearings were held with incarcerated
individuals charged with first degree murder as juveniles (see Table 15)

VICTIM SERVICES UNIT
The VSU provides statewide assistance to victims of violent crimes, whose perpetrators become
parole eligible. It provides assistance to victims of homicide, domestic violence, sexual assault,
child abuse, motor vehicle homicide, and other violent crimes. The unit provides critical services
to victims and family members, including but not limited to:
• Serve as a source of information for parole eligibility, the parole decision-making process,
parole supervision, and notification of parole events.
• Provide assistance in preparing victim impact statements and/or testimony for parole
hearings.
• Accompany victims, parents/guardians of minor aged victims, and family members of
homicide victims to parole hearings.
• Provide crisis intervention services.
• Request for parole conditions that increase the safety and wellbeing of victims.
• Provide safety planning.
• Offer information on victim compensation.
• Assist with Victim Notification Registration (VNR), which is also known as Criminal
Offender Record Information (CORI) registration, that enables victims and family
members to receive notification and services.
• Make referrals to appropriate criminal justice agencies and community-based victim
service providers.
Victim Notifications
The VSU is responsible for providing victim notification for all parole related events, including
notice of parole hearing dates, parole hearing decisions, and parole releases. The VSU is also
responsible for providing victims and CORI registered petitioners with notification related to
public parole hearings conducted for incarcerated individuals sentenced to life in prison, clemency
petitions, and applications for early termination of parole.
In 2023, the VSU sent 17,526 notifications of parole events to registered victims, surviving family
members of homicide victims, and citizen-initiated petitioners. The VSU also worked on 13
medical parole petitions and provided notifications to 23 CORI petitioners. Starting in 2023, VSU
handled 19 termination hearings, providing notification and support surrounding the hearing
process to 30 CORI petitioners. VSU further handled three executive clemency hearings and
assisted nine victims/survivors and family members regarding the process.
25
2023 Annual Statistical Report MPB
Locating Victims for CORI Registration
The VSU is responsible for locating and providing outreach to victims and their families. The VSU
continues to increase its efforts to identify victims of violent crimes who are not CORI Certified
at the time of sentencing. The Unit’s efforts include education and outreach to both District
Attorney Victim Witness Advocates and community-based victim service agencies. The VSU’s
active participation in more than 25 community collaborations and high-risk teams across the state
has increased awareness of victim rights in the parole process and created a seamless network of
services for crime victims. VSU’s goal is to ensure through education, outreach, and cross-agency
collaboration that each agency working with crime victims recognizes and understands post-
conviction victim rights; and that every victim is advised of the importance of the CORI
registration process to access post-conviction victim services. These services include timely
notification, assistance, and referrals to appropriate resources. Through their investigative efforts,
the VSU has successfully located and established 240 new CORI Registrations in 2023.
Victim Services at Parole Hearings
The VSU assists victims, family members, and survivors of homicide victims during Victim
Access Hearings (VAH) and life sentence hearings. During these hearings, victims and family
members are provided the opportunity to attend the parole hearing in person and give oral
testimony. Victim Service Coordinators (VSCs) are experienced professionals who provide
victims and family members with guidance, support, and information throughout each step of the
parole process. There are three types of Victim Access Hearings.
• Type A: Offense resulted in death
• Type B: Offense was either violent or sexual in nature
• County: County sentences in which hearings are held in HOC (excluding Type A)
The following table provides the number of VAH and life sentence hearings held in 2023 in which
the VSU assisted victims or families of victims who attended the hearing, along with the total
number of attendees at these hearings. There were 94 VAH hearings held at the Central Office

OFFICE OF THE GENERAL COUNSEL
The Office of the General Counsel represents the Parole Board in all litigation affecting the agency
in the state’s trial courts and represents the agency in labor and employment matters. It further
develops agency regulations and policies, and monitors and drafts parole related legislation. The
primary role of the Board’s General Counsel, and by extension the Office of the General Counsel
as a whole, is to support and represent the Chair and the Board in all legal and policy matters. To
that end, the General Counsel has been appointed a Special Assistant Attorney General for the
purpose of representing the agency in state and federal court.
The Office of the General Counsel evaluates the appropriateness of the provision of counsel prior
to any parole release hearing in response to the request by an incarcerated individual for
accommodation under the ADA. Each request for counsel is evaluated and a referral is made to
the Committee for Public Counsel Services (CPCS) for appointment of counsel. A referral for
counsel may also be made for rescission and revocation hearings.11
Preliminary Revocation Hearings
The hearing examiners within the Office of the General Counsel schedule and conduct preliminary
revocation hearings at all state and county correctional facilities, parole regional offices, and other
designated locations. At preliminary revocation hearings, the hearing examiner determines
whether there exists reasonable grounds to believe that a formerly incarcerated individual has
committed acts that constitute a violation of parole condition(s) or has engaged in a new crime,
and if so, whether there is probable cause to provisionally revoke parole and hold the formerly
incarcerated individual in custody, pending the result of a final revocation hearing. Following a
hearing, the hearing examiner prepares a summary and submits a recommended decision to the
Parole Board.
In 2023, the Parole Board’s hearing examiners conducted 330 preliminary revocation hearings,
compared to the 299 preliminary revocation hearings that were held in 2022.
Executive Clemency
The Office of the General Counsel reviews all executive clemency requests. In Massachusetts, the
power to grant executive clemency is held by the Governor, with the advice and consent of the
Governor’s Council. The Office of the General counsel reviews all petitions for executive
clemency submitted to the Governor for consideration to determine if the request meets the
Governor’s guidelines.12 It then presents petitions to the Parole Board, which acts as the Advisory
11 Individuals appearing for a rescission or a revocation hearing have a right to counsel regardless of any
need for an accommodation.
12 The Governor issued updated Clemency Guidelines in October 2023.
27
2023 Annual Statistical Report MPB
Board of Pardons (ABP). If a petition does not meet the Governor’s eligibility guidelines, then it
is administratively closed. If a petition meets the guidelines, the ABP votes in the executive session
to determine if the petition merits a hearing. In the event that the ABP conducts a public hearing,
a recommendation is made to the Governor thereafter.
Pardons
A pardon is the forgiveness of the underlying offense, which has the effect of treating the petitioner
as though the offense was never committed. To be granted a pardon, a petitioner should
demonstrate “good citizenship”. In making its decision, the ABP views evidence, including
support for the petitioner in the institution and community, their accomplishments and
achievements, and the nature and extent of any opposition to the petition.
Commutations
Commutation is the lessening of a penalty without forgiveness for the underlying offense. A
commutation of a sentence has the effect of releasing a petitioner from an ongoing sentence of
incarceration. A grant of commutation may also enable an incarcerated individual to appear before
the Parole Board for release consideration at a time earlier than permitted by the court-imposed
sentence.
Executive Clemency Executive Session Votes to Grant or Deny a Hearing
Table 17 captures the ABP’s votes in 2023 in response to pardon and commutation requests. The
Office of the General Counsel processed a total of 28 pardon petitions, which included six
administrative closes and three petitions that were withdrawn. The remaining 19 pardon petitions
were submitted to the ABP. The ABP voted at the executive session to determine whether a hearing
should be granted; four were granted a hearing while 15 were denied (See Table 17). Similarly,
eight commutation petitions were processed, which included one administrative close and two
petitions that were withdrawn. The remaining five petitions were submitted to the ABP. The ABP
voted at the executive session to determine whether a hearing should be granted, and all five were
denied a hearing.

and testimony necessary for the ABP to make a formal recommendation to the Governor.
Table 18 captures pardon and commutation hearings held in 2023. The ABP held seven pardon
hearings, resulting in six favorable recommendations. Likewise, it held one commutation hearing

Requests for Early Termination of Parole
On December 23, 2022, 120 CMR 700.00 was promulgated to establish new rules and procedures
to be followed by the Parole Board in order to grant an early termination of sentence and thus issue
a certificate of early termination of parole supervision. To be eligible for consideration for a
Certificate of Termination of parole under M.G.L. c. 127 § 130A, the formerly incarcerated
individual must meet the following minimum eligibility requirements, and they shall only be
eligible for consideration of termination of parole every 12 months:
13 Out of the 13 pardons granted in 2023 by Governor Healey, the Advisory Board of Pardons made
favorable recommendations on five of them during hearings held in 2023, six during hearings held in

Formerly incarcerated individuals seeking a Certificate of Termination must submit a completed
Termination Application to the Office of the General Counsel, which reviews the application to
determine whether the formerly incarcerated individual meets the minimum eligibility
requirements. If the application does not meet the requirements, the application is administratively
closed. If the application meets the minimum eligibility requirements, the Office of the General
Counsel submits the application to the Parole Board for review. The Parole Board votes in
executive session and provides a disposition to either deny the application and continue
supervision of the formerly incarcerated individual or grant a hearing to determine whether or not
to approve the application and terminate the sentence. In some cases, it can also terminate the
sentence without a hearing.
In 2023, the Office of the General Counsel processed 53 applications, which included one
application that was administratively closed and one application that was withdrawn. Among the
remaining 51 applications that were deemed eligible for early termination and submitted to the
Board, the Parole Board voted on all of them at the executive session, providing the disposition
captured in Table 19. While 30 applications were denied, and 20 were granted a hearing, only one
was terminated without a hearing.

If an application is granted a hearing at the executive session, the hearing is held at the Parole
Board’s Central Office and is open to the public.
The final determination of whether to terminate the sentence or deny the application is made by a
majority vote of the full Parole Board, which determines whether such termination is in the public
interest.
In 2023, 19 of the applications that were granted a hearing were heard; five were denied while 14
were approved, which granted the formerly incarcerated individuals early termination of their
sentence and hence, their parole supervision.
In total, in 2023, there were 15 formerly incarcerated individuals who were granted early
termination, including the one case terminated without a hearing (captured earlier). In comparison,
in 2022, only one formerly incarcerated individual was approved an early termination of their

FIELD SERVICES DIVISION
The FSD is composed of the central office management staff, nine regional parole field offices,
and specialized units namely, the Interstate Compact Unit (ICU), the Warrant and Apprehension
Unit (WAU), and the Training Unit. The division is primarily responsible for supervising and
monitoring all formerly incarcerated individuals who have been released on parole by the Parole
Board and/or via the ICU, as well as those on mandatory or medical release. Supervision duties
include conducting home and work investigations, conducting home and community visits, and
verifying formerly incarcerated individual employment, programming, treatment, etc. The duties
further include ensuring a formerly incarcerated individual is in compliance with general and
special conditions of parole, responding to any violations of Global Positioning Systems (GPS),
administering substance abuse testing, conducting LS/CMI assessments, investigating and
reporting on parole violations, making arrests, and transporting parole violators. Above all, the
FSD plays a key role in assisting with successful reintegration of formerly incarcerated individuals
into the community by building strong partnerships with community service providers and
referring individuals to these service providers for employment, housing, programming, medical,
and rehabilitation services.
Releases to Supervision
Releases resulting from a positive Parole Board vote are discretionary releases and make up the
largest proportion of all releases to parole. In 2019, as a result of the criminal justice reform laws
passed in April 2018, the Parole Board began to supervise formerly incarcerated individuals who
have been issued a parole permit for mandatory release to supervision, as well as medical releases.
A medical release occurs when an incarcerated individual’s petition for medical parole is granted
by the Commissioner of the DOC, pursuant to M.G.L. c. 127, § 119A. A mandatory release to
supervision on the other hand is granted when a state incarcerated individual completes specific
programs as determined by the DOC pursuant to M.G.L. c. 127, § 130B. Completing these
programs earns the incarcerated individual completion credits, which deduct from their maximum
sentence, allowing them to be eligible for mandatory release.
Table 21 breaks out the releases to parole supervision in 2023 by release type. In 2023,
discretionary releases made up 89% of all releases to parole, followed by mandatory releases (at
10%), and medical releases at 1%, which is consistent with 2022.

Table 22 disaggregates the releases in 2023 by commitment type. The term commitment as used
by Parole refers to a court order to confine an individual to a DOC or HOC facility for a sentence
on an offense, or a group of offenses, for which, the individual has been convicted. In cases where
an incarcerated individual serves one commitment type and is transferred to another (i.e., mixed
sentence structure), the initial commitment type will be used for classification. Also, not included
in the definition above are Out of State commitments, which refers to individuals transferred from
another state for supervision in Massachusetts.
Table 22. 2023 Releases to Supervision by Commitment Type.
Commitment Type # Released Percentage
House of Correction 1,091 55%
Department of Correction 791 40%
Out of State 85 4%
Total 1,967 100%
Upon release to parole supervision, most formerly incarcerated individuals serve the remainder of
their sentence (i.e. current commitment) in the community under the supervision of a parole officer
assigned to one of the nine regional offices. In some cases, an incarcerated individual may be
granted parole but will not be released directly to the community. (Some may later get transferred
and ultimately end up being supervised in one of the nine regional offices as well.) Examples
include, but are not limited to, an incarcerated individual who is paroled from their current
commitment to begin another consecutive sentence in a HOC, DOC, another state, or federal
facility; an incarcerated individual who is paroled to a warrant in Massachusetts, another state, or
federal jurisdiction; and an incarcerated individual who is paroled to ICE custody.
Parole releases are counted based on the initial parole of an incarcerated individual’s current
commitment and re-paroles. A re-parole or a re-release is a subsequent discretionary parole on an
incarcerated individual’s current commitment (i.e., revoked, re-committed, and re-paroled).
Releases from a detainer (i.e., warrant for temporary custody) are not included in the number of
re-paroles. Table 23 below summarizes releases to supervision in 2023.

Transitional and Sober Housing Programs
In 2019, the Parole Board collaborated with the Massachusetts Probation Service (MPS),
Community Resources for Justice (CRJ), the Sheriffs’ Departments, and the DOC to place
formerly incarcerated individuals at three transitional housing locations: Brooke House in Boston,
15 Race/ethnicity data is based on information provided by the facility. Incarcerated individuals reported
as having a Hispanic/Latino ethnicity are categorized as such for their race/ethnicity.

McGrath House in Boston, and the Western Mass Reentry Center in Springfield. In June 2020, a
fourth location named There-Is-A-Solution (TIAS) was added in New Bedford. In June 2021, a
fifth location, Rocky Hill Reentry was added in Northampton.
The transitional housing program is funded by the MPS. The program serves formerly incarcerated
individuals, probationers, and discharged incarcerated individuals. Formerly incarcerated
individuals receive free housing for up to six months with case management and referral
services. The Parole Board has been the largest referral source for this program. In 2023, a total of
251 formerly incarcerated individuals were placed in transitional housing across all five locations,
as summarized in Table 27. This is a 21 percent increase from 2022.

In order to support the goal of further reducing the prison population and improving re-entry
outcomes, the Parole Board initiated a contract with the Massachusetts Alliance of Sober Housing
(MASH) in May 2020. The contract enabled the provision of eight weeks of sober housing upon
release of formerly incarcerated individuals, probationers, and discharged incarcerated individuals,
at no cost to the individual. In 2023, a total of 497 formerly incarcerated individuals benefitted
from this initiative, a 12% increase from the 444 formerly incarcerated individuals who benefitted
from the program in 2022.
The availability of both transitional housing and MASH sober housing grants in 2023 enabled the
Agency to provide additional home plan options to formerly incarcerated individuals, thus helping
ensure their release. Approximately 38% of releases in 2023 were supported by the provision of
transitional housing and MASH sober housing programs (748 out of 1,967 releases utilized
housing beds through transitional and MASH sober housing grants).

Formerly Incarcerated Individual Monitoring
The Parole Board monitors formerly incarcerated individuals using tools such as Global
Positioning System (GPS) devices. Monitoring with GPS devices allows the agency to actively
track the whereabouts of formerly incarcerated individuals at any point in time during the
supervision period. GPS data also allow the Parole Board to set exclusion zones that the formerly
incarcerated individual must avoid while in the community. An exclusion zone is the area in or
around a particular address that, if entered by the formerly incarcerated individual, will
immediately alert designated parole staff regarding the individual’s location.
There are four ways by which a formerly incarcerated individual can be mandated to GPS
supervision as a condition of their parole:
1) By Parole Board vote,
2) By Parole Board policy for a sex offense,
17 Starting June of 2019, if an individual’s status has remained whereabouts unknown for at least 30 days,
regional offices transfer these cases to the Warrant and Apprehension Unit.
38
2023 Annual Statistical Report MPB
3) By Parole Board policy for a non-sex offense, but required to register with the Sex Offender
Registry Board (SORB) for a prior sex offense and classified by SORB as a Level 3 or
unclassified sex offender,
4) By a parole supervisor in response to a graduated sanction, as an alternative to
incarceration.
At the end of 2023, there were 491 formerly incarcerated individuals actively on GPS supervision.
Throughout the year, there were 1,281 GPS activations (i.e. GPS was deployed as a part of
supervision) (see Table 28).

Drug and Alcohol Testing
The Parole Board will periodically require urine and/or breath samples from formerly incarcerated
individuals to monitor for illicit drug and alcohol usage. Through appropriate drug testing,
treatment, and sanctions, the Parole Board will be able to monitor an individual’s integration into
the community more effectively, prevent serious criminal behavior through early intervention, and
promote appropriate treatment to assist the individual’s rehabilitation.
Parole officers use portable drug testing kits and breathalyzers, allowing for immediate access to
test results. This type of testing not only provides officers with an effective supervisory tool but
also has a deterrent effect on formerly incarcerated individuals who know if they violate the
conditions of their parole by using alcohol and/or illicit drugs, it will be quickly detected. In
addition to parole officers conducting tests, substance use tests are conducted by authorized
agencies and treatment programs.
During 2023, 11,805 drug and alcohol tests were conducted on formerly incarcerated individuals
supervised in the nine regional offices.18 Drug tests consisted of the following test types: Cocaine

Parole Reentry Navigator Program
The Parole Board’s Reentry Navigator Program (formerly known as Substance Abuse Coordinator
Program) is a collaborative initiative between the Parole Board and the Department of Public
Health’s (DPH) Bureau of Substance Addiction Services (BSAS). In 2023, there were eight full-
time Reentry Navigators from licensed DPH service vendors, placed and working at each of
Parole’s regional field offices; region 3 and Region 6 share the same Navigator. However, there
were periods of time in regions 2, 7, 8, and 9 when navigators were in transition and the regional
offices did not have any coverage.
Some of the basic duties of the Navigators include formerly incarcerated individual intake, triage,
and referral functions. They conduct evaluations for potential substance use and
mental/behavioral health disorders, provide treatment referrals and outreach to service providers,
community-based organizations and resources such as support groups, legal services, and
clinical mental health services. They are also responsible for tracking and monitoring the progress
of clients and treatment providers. The Navigators’ services assist formerly incarcerated
individuals in making a successful transition to communities across the state.
40
2023 Annual Statistical Report MPB
Parole Regional Re-entry Centers
Parole Regional Re-entry Centers (RRC) operate in eight regional areas. Each RRC is housed
within the same site as Parole’s regional field offices. This gives the Navigators close proximity
to the assigned field officer when a case needs to be supervised, reviewed, or sanctioned. Each
RRC is open Monday through Friday, 9:00 am to 5:00 pm. Onsite supervision of the Navigators
is provided jointly by the parole supervisor and the sub-contractor’s Clinical Director.
The Navigator is responsible for meeting and interviewing each formerly incarcerated individual
when they are released on parole, and for completing an “Intake” if it is the formerly incarcerated
individual’s first release on parole. They are responsible for conducting substance abuse
evaluations for every parole release. For those formerly incarcerated individuals with substance
abuse history who need support, the Navigators complete an “enrollment” in the BSAS. Finally,
after 90 days of enrollment or on being discharged from supervision, whichever date is sooner, the
enrolled formerly incarcerated individual is disenrolled. During disenrollment, BSAS makes
referrals to different services.
In 2023, 1,138 formerly incarcerated individuals were enrolled in the BSAS. The table below
further breaks down these enrollments by regional centers. Among those disenrolled from the
BSAS in 2023, they were referred to a variety of services, primarily Outpatient SA Counseling,
and mental health services.

19 There were periods of time in regions 2, 7, 8, and 9 when navigators were in transition and the regional
offices did not have any coverage, which could result in underreporting of the enrollment numbers for
these regions.
20 Region 3 and Region 6 share the same navigator.
21 The enrollment number is underreported since it is based on enrollments between January and May
2023 as the region was without a Reentry Navigator since June of 2023 until a new navigator joined and
received training. Nevertheless, all clients released after May were still getting referral services directly
through Parole Field staff.

Behavioral Health for Justice Involved Individuals (BH-JI)
In September 2019, the Parole Board collaborated with the Executive Office of Health and Human
Services (EOHHS), the Massachusetts Probation Service (MPS), the DOC, Middlesex County
Sheriff’s Office (MSO), and Worcester County Sheriff’s Office (WCSO), along with Open Sky
Community Services,22 and Advocates23 to refer high-risk individuals with acute behavioral health
support needs to an enhanced navigator program referred to as BH-JI. In 2021, EOHHS put out a
request for responses from organizations that would go on to provide BH-JI supports statewide for
justice-involved MassHealth-eligible individuals. The project was piloted in Middlesex and
Worcester counties in 2019 with Advocates, Inc and Open Sky Community Services, and was
expanded statewide on February 1, 2022.
MassHealth also requested permission to launch similar community support for members enrolled
in MassHealth managed care, which became the Community Support Program for Justice
Involvement individuals (CSP-JI). CSP-JI services became effective September 1, 2022 with the
Managed Care Organizations (MCOs), ACPPs, and the State’s behavioral health vendor.
The mission of both BH-JI and CSP-JI is to assist justice-involved population with their mental
health and substance use needs by connecting them to the right health care and community services
program.
Across the entire year, in 2022, combining BH-JI and CPS-JI, there were a total of 1,927 referrals
to the programs from all agencies, and 1,498 participants had enrolled in the programs. Among
them, there were 113 referrals (98 to BH-JI and 15 to CSP-JI) and 65 enrollees (51 to BH-JI and
14 to CSP-JI) from the Parole Board. Furthermore, there were 58 individuals referred by the DOC
who were incarcerated at referral. In 2023, there were 2,771 referrals to both the programs across
all agencies, and 1,987 participants had enrolled in the programs. Among them, there were 76
referrals (33 to BH-JI and 43 to CSP-JI) and 53 enrollees (11 to BH-JI and 42 to CSP-JI) from the
Parole Board. Additionally, there were 130 individuals referred by the DOC who were incarcerated
at referral. It should be noted that while a majority of referrals and enrollees are not formerly
incarcerated individuals, those referred and enrolled at the DOC and HOC will be eligible for
continued services upon release on parole.
Field Services Risk/Needs Assessments
In addition to conducting LS/CMI risk/needs assessments at the correctional institutions in
preparation for parole hearings, field parole officers conduct reassessments using the same
LS/CMI assessment after release of formerly incarcerated individual in the community to apply
effective supervision strategies. Outcomes of reassessments in the field can be used to ensure that
formerly incarcerated individuals are receiving appropriate services in response to their case
management needs.
22 Open Sky Community Services is a behavioral health service provider, headquartered in Worcester,
Massachusetts.
23 Advocates is a behavioral health service provider located in multiple counties within Massachusetts.
42
2023 Annual Statistical Report MPB
Consistent with the previous year, in 2023, most field assessments conducted scored medium risk
(53%), followed by low to very low risk (39%), and less than 9% scored high to very high risk
(see Table 31). This is a stark difference compared to the risk-level distribution seen at the
institutional level earlier in this report with a majority scoring at high risk. The pattern holds true
across different race/ethnic groups as summarized in Table 32, which provides LS/CMI breakdown
by race/ethnicity. This speaks to the lower risk level associated with the population that is deemed
suitable for parole supervision; the risk level might decline further for formerly incarcerated
individuals who remain stable and are successful under supervision when they are reassessed by
the Field staff.

Prison Rape Elimination Act (“PREA”)
The Parole Board is committed to zero tolerance of any form of sexual abuse and sexual
harassment. The agency collects accurate, uniform data for every allegation of sexual abuse at
facilities under its direct control. In 2023, there were no PREA-related allegation of sexual abuse
reported.

2023 Annual Statistical Report MPB
Graduated Sanctions
The Parole Board’s policy for graduated sanctions is intended to provide consistency,
transparency, fairness, and efficiency throughout the parole violation process. The installation of
graduated sanctions as a case management tool denotes a controlled delegation of authority by the
Parole Board to the officers in the FSD. If a formerly incarcerated individual is willing to work
with his or her parole officer, then the Parole Board will work toward that individual’s continued
success. The Parole Board believes success is not achieved through the individual’s automatic
return to custody in the event of a parole violation. The agency’s primary mission, however, has
been and will remain to ensure public safety.
The guidelines for imposing graduated sanctions match the severity of the violation with the
formerly incarcerated individual’s risk level to determine the appropriate treatment, intervention,
and/or sanction. For example, if a low to medium risk individual has failed to attend substance
abuse classes yet continues to be employed and maintains a healthy lifestyle, then the parole officer
has the discretion to sanction this violation of parole conditions by issuing a warning ticket,
requiring the individual to attend a meeting with the parole officer, or stage an intervention with a
substance abuse counselor at one of the regional field offices. The parole officer has the discretion
to engage the various graduated sanctions within their level of authority as an alternative to
returning the individual to custody for a parole revocation hearing and possible re-commitment to
the original terms of their sentence. If the parole officer wants to impose a sanction that is outside
their level of authority, they have to submit a completed form to their supervisor. The supervisor
may then impose an appropriate graduated sanction within their level of authority but if they decide
the sanction is insufficient, they may pursue a Parole Board level sanction. In this case, the
supervisor will pick a Parole Board level sanction and submit the graduated sanction form to the
Parole Board. The Parole Board members will review the graduated sanction and affirm the
sanction picked by the parole supervisor, reject and enter a different sanction, or request more
information from the supervisor and then process it.
In 2023, there were 1,261 graduated sanctions issued and completed as an alternative to
detainment, in response to 1,773 reported violations. A single graduated sanction can be issued for
multiple violations. Graduated sanctions are primarily used as an alternative to returning the
formerly incarcerated individual to custody for a possible revocation of parole. Figure 11 shows
that the number of reported violations between years 2022 and 2023 did not change much but there
was a 5% decline in the use of graduated sanctions as an alternative to detainment and possible
revocation of parole.
Out of the 1,261 graduated sanctions completed as an alternative to detainment for hearing, 141
(i.e. 11%) were completed by the Board. In comparison, in 2022, out of the 1,333 graduated
sanctions completed as an alternative to detainment, 154 (i.e. 11.6%) were completed by the Board.

The appropriate response in terms of use of sanctions and interventions in response to an alleged
parole violation is determined by the graduated sanctions guidelines grid, which considers the
formerly incarcerated individual’s risk level based on risk/needs assessment (LS/CMI), and the
severity of the violation. The risk distribution of individuals receiving these sanctions in 2023 can
be seen in the chart below. A majority of the graduated sanctions issued in 2023 were for
individuals with a high risk level (at 45%), closely followed by those with medium risk level (at
43%).

As presented in the chart below, the proportion of graduated sanctions imposed on higher risk
individuals (medium to very high) has increased over the past six years (from 86% in 2018 to 94%
in 2023), while the proportion of sanctions imposed on lower risk individuals (low to very low)
has steadily decreased (from 14% in 2018 to 7% in 2023).

Warrants
A warrant for detainer purposes (i.e., 15-day warrant) and an Interstate Compact warrant for
detainer purposes (i.e., 60-day warrant) are referred to as Warrants for Temporary Custody (WTC).
A 15-day detainer is issued when a parole officer has reasonable belief that a formerly incarcerated
individual has lapsed into criminal ways, has associated with criminal company, or has violated
the conditions of his or her parole. The parole officer may then, with the consent of a parole
supervisor or other superior officer, issue a WTC of the individual. A WTC authorizes the
detention of the individual for a maximum period of 15 days or up to 60 days in the case of a
formerly incarcerated individual being supervised by the authorities of another state (e.g. out of
state commitments supervised in MA), pursuant to the terms of the Interstate Compact. The
issuance of a WTC does not interrupt the formerly incarcerated individual’s sentence.
A Warrant for Permanent Custody (WPC) on the other hand, is an order of imprisonment of the
formerly incarcerated individual, which may be issued upon a finding that there exists probable
cause to believe that the individual has engaged in new crime or has violated one or more
conditions of parole. The individual’s supervision status upon issuance of a WPC, and the
underlying sentence, resumes only after service of the warrant.
With an Interstate Compact warrant for detainer purposes (i.e., 60-day warrant) and an Interstate
Compact Warrant for Permanent Custody, the Parole Board is authorized to issue and serve a
46
2023 Annual Statistical Report MPB
warrant to detain formerly incarcerated individuals whom the Parole Board is supervising under
the Interstate Compact.
In 2023, a total of 594 warrants for 15-day detainer were issued. Out of these warrants issued, 573
(i.e. 96%) served custody or were arrested. Among the 573 arrested, 91% were provisionally
revoked, 5% were issued Interstate Compact warrant for 60-day detainer, 3% had their warrant
extinguished, and the remaining 1% received a warning or final warning from the Board. The 21
who were issued a warrant but not arrested, had their provisional revocation hearing held in their
respective regional office locations, and all received a warning or final warning from the Board.
Among the 573 arrested, 521 individuals were provisionally revoked and were issued a WPC for
imprisonment, following which, they will await their final revocation hearing.

Revocations
When a parolee is criminally charged or has displayed severe misconduct (i.e., assaultive/violent
behavior, absconding, violating a restraining order, etc.) or when an appropriate range of sanctions
and interventions have been utilized and have been ineffective, a revocation occurs and the
formerly incarcerated individual is re-committed to the terms of their original sentence, following
a final revocation hearing. It should be noted that upon revocation of parole, individuals do not
necessarily serve the remainder of their commitment in a correctional facility. The Parole Board
reassesses their suitability for re-parole.
Table 34 presents revocations by commitment type, where the final revocation hearing resulted in
a “revocation affirmed” vote. This includes all dispositions including reserves, denied, waivers,
postponements, action pending, and PONAL. It is important to note that individuals whose parole
is revoked may be re-paroled; therefore, revocations will only capture a setback or failure for a
short period of time. In 2023, among all eligible for final revocation hearing (i.e. those
provisionally revoked at the preliminary revocation hearing by the hearing examiner and
25 In these cases, hearings were held in regional field offices.
47
2023 Annual Statistical Report MPB
confirmed as provisionally revoked by the Board), 375 received a disposition of revocation
affirmed, which included 145 who waived their hearing. Of the remaining 230 who had their final
revocation hearing with a revocation affirmed disposition, 51% received a positive vote for re-
parole while 40% were denied re-parole, and the remaining 8% received other dispositions.
Furthermore, out of the 375 revocations, 134 (i.e. 36% of those revoked) were re-paroled26, and
55 of them (i.e. 41% of those re-paroled) were successfully discharged from supervision by April
20, 2024.

Parole violations, which precede revocations, can be of two types: new crime violations and non-
crime or technical violations. Revocations that result from a new criminal charge (i.e., “new
crime”) are typically initiated by law enforcement, and not the formerly incarcerated individual’s
field parole officer. Non-crime or technical violations are violations of general and special
conditions of parole, excluding those that involve new criminal charges. However, non-crime
violations may include acts that involve criminal behavior that did not lead to new charges. Some
revocations may result from both new crime and non-crime violations. For example, a formerly
incarcerated individual who is arrested for assault and battery, drug trafficking, or breaking and
entering may be revoked for violations of parole conditions (i.e. non-crime or technical violation),
in addition to incurring new criminal charges (i.e. new crime violation). Table 37 below breaks
down revocations in 2023 by parole violation type.

A revocation typically results from violation of multiple parole conditions as recorded in the Parole
Violation Report (PVR). In 2023, there were a total of 375 revocations based on 1,168 reported
number of Parole Violation Report (PVR) rules that were violated. This translates to violation of
average of over three rules for each parole revocation. Although there was an increase in the
number of revocations in 2023 compared to 2022 (from 321 to 375), the change should be viewed
in the context of an overall increase in the number of active formerly incarcerated individuals
under supervision across the two years, which went up from 2,715 in 2022 to 2,917 in 202328. The
revocation number for each year also includes formerly incarcerated individuals who were not
under active community supervision in the particular year but were either already detained and
awaiting revocation hearing or were whereabouts unknown (and later revoked) at the beginning of
the year.29
For a more accurate comparison across years, we focus on the outcomes for all the Massachusetts
commitments that were under Massachusetts community supervision in year 2022 and 2023 and
break out the outcomes by the end of each year. Table 38 below captures the breakdown. In both
years, 81% of the Massachusetts commitments that were under community supervision in
Massachusetts were successfully discharged or continued to remain under supervision, and there
was no significant change in the percentage that were revoked (from 10% in 2022 to 11% in
2023).
27 Of those parolees revoked for alleged technical violation (304), a total of 163, or 54% had received at
least one prior graduated sanction before their revocation. The majority of the remaining 141 parole
violators who had not received a prior graduated sanction, incurred violations that included termination
from a residential treatment program, transitional housing, or sober housing (92 cases), or had absconded
from supervision (62 cases); among these 38 had both violations.
28 These numbers include only Massachusetts commitments under Massachusetts community supervision
and exclude Out of State cases under Massachusetts community supervision.
29 The revocation number also includes any Massachusetts commitment supervised in another state if they
are revoked.

Discharges from Supervision
As with releases to parole, discharges from parole are also based on commitments. The counts in
the table below are drawn from the point in time when the commitment was closed. A commitment
can close for a variety of reasons, the most common of which is at the parole discharge date.
However, formerly incarcerated individuals may be discharged for other reasons (e.g., Interstate
Compact Case closed interest, Good Conduct Discharge after sentence completion from
correctional facility, vacated/court release). In addition, individuals can be discharged while under
supervision by another authority. For example, an individual may end a period of supervision while
under the custody of ICE or another state’s warrant. In a majority of cases however, discharge
occurs while the individual is under parole supervision in Massachusetts. Table 39 below displays
the discharges from supervision by commitment type.

Compliance Credits
In 2019, pursuant to M.G.L. c. 127, § 130C, the Parole Board established a policy and procedure
for issuance of compliance credits to formerly incarcerated individuals for satisfactory conduct.
To be eligible for compliance credits, formerly incarcerated individuals would have to meet the
following criteria:
• An active formerly incarcerated individual released on or after January 13, 2019
• Serving a state sentence
• Released on either discretionary or medical parole
• Supervised in one of the Parole regional offices
• Not be serving a life sentence.
Eligible formerly incarcerated individuals may earn up to 15 compliance credits each month,
equivalent to reduction in Parole Discharge Date by 15 days, leading up to their earliest parole
discharge date based on adherence to their special conditions of parole. The accrued number of
credits deducts from a formerly incarcerated individual’s parole discharge date, ultimately granting
them an earlier discharge from parole supervision.
Table 43 exhibits the number and proportion of formerly incarcerated individuals who earned
compliance credits out of all formerly incarcerated individuals who were eligible, by year of
release to parole supervision, along with the average credits received by release year. 74% of
compliance credit eligible formerly incarcerated individuals released to supervision in 2023 earned
compliance credits, which is slightly higher than the 69% of eligible formerly incarcerated
individuals released in 2022 who earned compliance credits32.

Table 44 presents the number of formerly incarcerated individuals who were discharged early due
to earned compliance credits, broken out by year of discharge from parole supervision. In 2022,
out of all successful discharges from supervision that were eligible for CCs, 88% were discharged
early due to compliance credits; the proportion discharged early due to earned CCs was comparable
at 89% in 2023.33 In both the years, early discharge due to accrual of CCs resulted in average of
over two months of reduced supervision.
32 Number of earned credits for releases in 2022 and 2023 are measured as of March of 2023 and March
of 2024 respectively, for appropriate comparison across years.
33 2022 and 2023 numbers are based on data retrieved as of March of 2022 and March of 2023

Interstate Compact Unit
The Massachusetts Parole Board is a member of the Interstate Commission for Adult Offender
Supervision (ICAOS), with Massachusetts Parole Board Chair Tina M. Hurley serving as Compact
Administrator and Attorney Keara Kelley serving as the Deputy Compact Administrator.
Established in 1937 with the purpose of regulating the movement of probationers and parolees
across state lines, the ICAOS is enacted in all 50 states and three U.S. territories. The Interstate
Compact grants member states the authority to track supervised individuals who move across state
lines, in accordance with the ICAOS Mission Statement: “The Interstate Commission for Adult
Offender Supervision will guide the transfer of supervised individuals in a manner that promotes
effective supervision strategies consistent with public safety, accountability, and victims’ rights.”
The Parole Board’s designated Interstate Compact Unit (ICU) lies within the Field Services
Division. The ICU coordinates the interstate transfer of formerly incarcerated individuals entering
or leaving the state and oversees an active caseload of Massachusetts formerly incarcerated
individuals residing out of state under the Interstate Compact. The ICU also supervises all
Massachusetts incarcerated individuals paroled to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE)
detainers and deportation warrants.
At the end of 2023, there were 257 commitments under supervision through the ICU. Formerly
incarcerated individuals’ status through the ICU encompasses a variety of circumstances including
supervision by another state’s paroling authority (149), ICE custody (24), and deportation (84).
Throughout 2023, there were 116 Massachusetts commitments released to the Interstate Compact
to be supervised by other states or transferred to other types of custody. Of these cases:
• 46 Formerly incarcerated individuals were released to be supervised by another state’s
parole agency, and
• 70 formerly incarcerated individuals were released to ICE custody.
In addition, during 2023, there were 85 commitments from other states released to Massachusetts
for parole supervision.
In 2023, the ICU worked collaboratively across the Commonwealth and in conjunction with other
member states to ensure that ICAOS goals were met. In September 2023, Commissioner Hurley
attended the ICAOS Annual Business meeting in Norfolk, Virginia. At this meeting, members
voted on new rule proposals affecting the ICAOS. Compact administrators also participated in
54
2023 Annual Statistical Report MPB
several meetings of the ICAOS East Region, which allowed for collective progress on issues
affecting our geographic region. In November, the Massachusetts State Council met to discuss
compact issues affecting the individuals supervised by the Massachusetts Parole Board and
Massachusetts Probation Service. Discussion topics included the role of the Interstate Compact for
individuals supervised on medical parole or those applying for termination of parole supervision.
Warrant and Apprehension Unit
The Warrant and Apprehension Unit (WAU), which lies within the FSD, assists staff in the
regional parole offices in locating and apprehending formerly incarcerated individuals who have
violated their parole conditions and absconded from supervision. The unit also arranges for the
apprehension of formerly incarcerated individuals who have fled the Commonwealth and monitors
the Criminal Justice Information System (CJIS) for criminal activity among parole violators. The
unit is also responsible for entering, updating, and removing parole violation warrants from the
agency’s database, as well as coordinating all required extraditions.
The primary function of the WAU is to assist regional parole offices in locating and arresting
parole violators and returning them to custody. In addition to conducting these fugitive
investigations, the WAU performs numerous other duties as listed below:
• Provides and coordinates security for all life sentence and VAH hearings at the central
office in Natick, Massachusetts.
• Enters, modifies, and cancels all Parole Board Warrants for Temporary Custody (WTC)
and Warrants for Permanent Custody (WPC) into the National Crime Information Center
(NCIC) database.
• Enters, modifies, and cancels information regarding lost or stolen agency equipment.
• Enters broadcasts regarding fugitives and completing extraditions.
• Monitors Criminal Justice Information Services databases.
• Processes all paroles from Massachusetts state and county facilities to out-of-state warrants
and/or commitments, and supervises this caseload until release from out-of-state custody.
• Supervises a caseload of warrant cases held in custody out-of-state, ensuring extradition at
the appropriate time.
• Maintains a caseload of whereabouts unknown cases, including Interstate Compact cases.
• Serves as the Parole Board’s ‘After-Hour Duty Station’.
Arrests and Transportations to Custody
In 2023, the WAU parole officers participated in 398 arrests. Those arrests included 211 parole
violators (117 of them were with the status of whereabouts unknown at the time of arrest) and 187
arrests in cooperation with interagency task forces and partnerships. The unit was also responsible
for 171 prisoner transports.
55
2023 Annual Statistical Report MPB
Extraditions
The WAU is also responsible for handling the extradition of parole violators being returned to
Massachusetts from other states. The WAU works closely with law enforcement and correctional
facilities across the nation in order to fulfill extraditions. In 2023, the WAU supervised the
extradition of 27 parole violators from around the United States back to Massachusetts. This
involves collaborating with the arresting states and ensuring that all legal extradition procedures
are being followed.
Paroles to Out-of-State Warrants
The WAU processes all paroles from Massachusetts correctional facilities to out-of-state warrants
and/or out-of-state commitments. This includes supervising individuals until their release from
out-of-state custody. 44 individuals were released to out of state warrants in 2023.
Warrant Cases In Custody Out-of-State
The WAU oversees all warrant cases held in custody out-of-state. The WAU supervises these
parole violators; it monitors incarcerated and formerly incarcerated individuals’ progress with the
out-of-state correctional facility, and arranges extradition when the parole violator is made
available. The average caseload of warrant cases in custody out-of-state in 2023 was 24.
Warrant Cases – Whereabouts Unknown
The WAU has responsibility for formerly incarcerated individuals who abscond from parole
supervision and have their status changed to whereabouts unknown when they are transferred to
the WAU from a regional field office. The caseload of warrant cases with status of whereabouts
unknown at the end of 2023 was 94.
Twenty-Four Hour Duty Station
The WAU serves as the agency’s ‘Twenty-Four Hour Duty’ station, responding to all emergency
inquiries made after 5:00 pm on weekdays, as well as on weekends and holidays. All after-hour
calls are received by the Massachusetts State Police Central Dispatch, who then contacts the WAU
for further handling of the situation. The WAU officer on duty contacts the appropriate parole
officer to ensure that each case has been addressed. If the assigned parole officer is unavailable,
then the case is referred to the after-hour duty parole supervisor from a rotating list. The WAU
processed approximately 163 after-hour calls in 2023.
Training Unit
All Field Officers including supervisors completed a minimum of 40 hours of in-service training
in 2023. Training consisted of classroom, online, and practical hands-on application of certain job
duties. In partnership with UMass Chan, Field Officers received trainings on pharmacological
effects of certain street and prescription drugs. Field Officers continue to train and retrain on AED
(Automated External Defibrillator) and on Naloxone (NARCAN) for a continued response to fight
the Opioid overdose crisis. Annual training in use of force de-escalation, firearms, and defensive
56
2023 Annual Statistical Report MPB
tactics was completed. Some officers attended specialized trainings in the areas of wellness, stress
resiliency, and communication with deaf and hard of hearing. All officers completed trainings in
the following topics: trauma informed responses in Law Enforcement, hate crimes, legal updates,
digital technology, and suicide intervention and prevention. Staff also attended the 2023 summit
for emerging adults, and reentry drug court initiatives. No new Parole recruit class was held in

Parole Board shall issue a mandatory release to supervision parole permit to that prisoner for the
remainder of his or her sentence, as reduced by any good conduct deductions issued by the
Department of Corrections. The Parole Board does not make any decision on the release and
therefore, a request is submitted to set release conditions.
Request for Provisional Rescission: When the Parole Board members set a parole release date,
release on that date is contingent upon continued satisfactory conduct by the incarcerated
individual and the absence of any new and significant adverse information not known to the
parole hearing panel at the time the release decision was made. Where the Parole Board learns of
new adverse information, the Board may suspend the individual’s parole date pending
investigation by the Parole Board.
Request for Out of State/Country Travel: A request for out of state travel is submitted to
allow/deny formerly incarcerated individual’s request for travel.
Appeal Request: An incarcerated individual may petition for appeal of a parole decision.

2023 Annual Statistical Report MPB
MASSACHUSETTS PAROLE BOARD OVERVIEW
Introduction
The Massachusetts Parole Board (the Parole Board or the Board) is an agency within the Executive
Office of Public Safety and Security (EOPSS) with the decisional authority in the Commonwealth
of Massachusetts for matters of parole granting, parole supervision, rescission, revocation,
discharges, and early termination of parole. The Parole Board has jurisdiction over all individuals
committed to state or county correctional facilities for terms of sixty days or more, in accordance
with M.G.L. c. 127, § 128, excluding those who are ineligible for parole. The agency serves the
public, victims, incarcerated individuals, formerly incarcerated individuals, and petitioners for
executive clemency throughout the Commonwealth by conducting face-to-face hearings,
supervising formerly incarcerated individuals in the community, providing notice and assistance
to victims and their families, and providing reentry services to individuals leaving custody,
pursuant to M.G.L. c. 127, § 158.
In 1837, Massachusetts enacted the first law in the United States to authorize parole. Although
over the years there have been numerous legislative changes affecting parole in Massachusetts, the
agency’s core reentry mission remains the same.
Mission
The Parole Board’s overall mission is to promote public safety by the return of incarcerated
individuals to the community through supervised, conditional release, so that a successful
transition from confinement to discharge from parole provides a basis for continued responsible
conduct.
Goals
The following constitute the Agency’s 2023 goals:
1. Enhance our parole practices to ensure that we are providing the most equitable and efficient
level of services for our population while reducing recidivism and maintaining public safety.
2. Continue to ensure that all hearings are conducted in a fair, impartial, and confidential
manner, with both concern and compassion.
3. Enhance our efforts in providing appropriate reentry services to meet the complex needs of
the population we serve by continuously and actively seeking partnerships for treatment and
housing opportunities.
4. Work in collaboration with the Department of Correction (DOC) and Sheriff’s Association to
enhance rehabilitative programming opportunities to meet the specific need areas of
incarcerated individuals seeking parole.
5. Continue to collaborate with the DOC regarding Release to Supervision (RTS) and medical
release opportunities established by the Council of State Governments legislation.
6. Enhance our practices in accordance with recommendations provided in the “Special
Commission on Structural Racism in the Massachusetts Parole Process” Report.

substance use needs have access to resources through Behavioral Health for Justice-Involved
Individuals (BH-JI).
13. Reduce delays in the release of paroled individuals by incentivizing participation in and
completion of certain recidivism reduction programs in the DOC and House of Correction
(HOC) facilities.
14. Provide meaningful training opportunities pertinent to the roles and responsibilities of Board
members and staff to enhance their knowledge and competencies.
15. Continue to work to increase the morale and employment satisfaction of agency employees
through transparent communication, team building activities, and by providing positive
feedback and gratitude to staff on a consistent basis.
16. Increase third party communication and collaboration with stakeholders, including attorneys
from the defense bar, district attorney’s offices, commissioners from the DOC, the
Department of Mental Health, Department of Developmental Services, Sheriff’s
department’s, Probation, the Massachusetts Legislature's Criminal Justice Reform Caucus,
re-entry community directors, liaisons and other interested parties.
17. Fully promulgate termination regulations and assemble the Board to review and conduct
hearings for eligible candidates.
18. Work to update, finalize, and implement various agency policies, including the policy for
audio-recording of hearings.
19. Actively explore the funding avenues and software options for the implementation of a
file digitization program to enhance easier access of records to staff, Board Members,
and the Office of the General Counsel, which will ultimately promote efficiency in parole
processes including hearing preparation and response to public records requests.
20. Continuously update the Agency website, as per suggestions by our internal and external
stakeholders to ensure a user-friendly informational platform about the agency, the parole
process, and include links to all policies.
21. Institute a Parole video hearing platform in SharePoint for the video recordings of all Life
Sentence and Executive Clemency hearings for the Board members, the Office of the General
Counsel, and the Life Sentence Unit to review.

26. Continue to work collaboratively as members of the Interstate Commission for Adult
Offender Supervision (ICAOS) across the Commonwealth and in conjunction with other
member states to ensure that ICAOS goals and all new proposed rules affecting the ICAOS
are met.
Parole Process
In Massachusetts, parole is the procedure whereby certain incarcerated individuals are released
prior to the expiration of their sentence, permitting the remainder of their sentence to be served in
the community under supervision, subject to specific rules and conditions of behavior. The Parole
Board has statutory responsibility for administering the parole process. It determines whether and
under what conditions an eligible individual sentenced to a correctional institution should be issued
a parole permit. Once released, it supervises all individuals released under parole conditions. It
also determines whether alleged parole violations warrant revocation of parole permits, and
whether the circumstances warrant early termination of parole before the actual parole discharge
date. Figure 1 captures the Massachusetts parole process.

Organization Structure
The Chair of the Parole Board serves as the Executive and Administrative head of the agency, as
well as the Commissioner of the Massachusetts Interstate Compact for Adult Offender Supervision
(ICAOS). Each Board member, including the Chair, is appointed by the Governor to serve
staggered five-year terms. The seven-member Board serves as the decision-making authority with
respect to release, rescission, revocation, and early termination of parole, if applicable.
Additionally, the Board functions as the Advisory Board of Pardons (ABP), making
recommendations to the Governor on petitions for executive clemency.
As captured in the organizational chart (see Figure 2), there are eight divisions/units within the
agency that work collaboratively to fulfill the common mission of the Parole Board. The Executive

CHAIR’S MESSAGE: Reflecting on 2023
2023 Annual Statistical Report MPB
Dear Governor Healey, Lieutenant Governor Driscoll, and Secretary Reidy,
I am pleased to present to you the Massachusetts Parole Board’s 2023 Annual Report. The year 2023 was filled with
growth, empowerment, and the collective action of many people who share our dedication to creating and upholding an
equitable, fair, and transparent parole system. Throughout the year, our shared goal of promoting a balanced and
efficient approach to lowering recidivism and enhancing public safety remained at the forefront and guided our actions
as an Agency. We are now even more focused on approaching the work we do in a new way so that it is more purpose-
driven and intentional.
The parole process in Massachusetts is a critical cornerstone of our criminal justice system. We were made stronger
every day by the efforts of many throughout the Commonwealth and we were constantly exploring new ways to
educate, motivate, and prepare individuals eligible for parole. Supporting and guiding those that are under supervision
was one of our key priorities along with holding fair and timely hearings.
These efforts were led by Parole Board Members Edee Alexander, Charlene Bonner, Tonomey Coleman, Sarah
Coughlin, and James Kelcourse as well as Executive Director Lian Hogan, General Counsel Judith Lyons, Chief of
Field Services Angelo Gomez, Chief of Transitional Services Meghan Winston, Deputy Chief of Transitional Services
Jon Spinale, Director of Victim Services Katherine Moran, Director of Research and Planning Pratikshya Bohra-
Mishra, Director of the Life Sentence Unit Joyce Crosby, and Chief of Administrative Services Debra Tata.
Most importantly, without the critical work done every day by the field and transitional parole staff, legal team, hearing
examiners, and all the support staff, none of the efforts and initiatives would have been possible. I would also like to
pay a special thanks to Former Judge Paul Chernoff and Former Parole Supervisor James McCarthy as their
contributions as Special Board Members enabled us to keep pace with the increase in full-board activities over the past
year.
I am also grateful to the many community-based organizations and service providers for the rehabilitative programming
and reentry services that they provide in the prisons and to the individuals on parole in our communities. The Board
and the Field and Transitional teams visited many community-based-organizations this year, which helped to enhance
collaboration and creativity with our community partners to better understand what works.
I also appreciate the attorneys who represent incarcerated people in the parole process, the prosecutors who appear at
our weekly public hearings, and the individuals in prison, on parole, and post-parole who have committed themselves
to positive change.
Finally, I want to acknowledge and thank crime victims and survivors for their participation in the parole process. I am
constantly inspired by their strength, courage, and resilience.
We, the Parole Board, look forward to continued growth in 2024. We are wholly focused on partner-to-partner
collaboration and ensuring a fair criminal justice system for all.
Sincerely,
Tina M. Hurley
Chair of Massachusetts Parole Board and Commissioner of Interstate Compact for Massachusetts

LOOKING BACK AT 2023: Releases
2023 Annual Statistical Report MPB
Releases:
1,967 incarcerated individuals were released to supervision in 2023, a 5%
increase from the number released in 2022 (N=1,876). The Agency ensured
that inmates with a positive vote achieved timely release by:
• Carefully vetting home plans to maximize
the rate of suitable home approvals.
• Providing additional transitional and sober
housing options through the availability of

TRANSITIONAL SERVICES UNIT
The TSU is responsible for preparing all release, revocation, and rescission hearings to be heard
by the Parole Board related to either the Commonwealth’s Department of Correction (DOC) or a
county House of Correction (HOC). The division compiles necessary case information for the
Parole Board members to make an informed, balanced judgment. Duties include data entry for all
incarcerated individuals committed across the state, date calculations to determine parole
eligibility and discharge dates, as well as case preparation for parole hearings. The case preparation
for a parole hearing includes reviewing and investigating any inconsistencies in the parole eligible
incarcerated individual’s master file, analyzing and summarizing information for the Parole Board
members, interviewing the incarcerated individual and completing an assessment of his/her
criminogenic factors, as well as acting as an agency liaison to the incarcerated individual as they
prepare for their appearance before the Parole Board. The Level of Service/Case Management
Inventory (LS/CMI) is a validated risk/needs assessment tool used by TSU staff to assess the risk
and need areas of individuals in preparation for their hearings. The TSU is also responsible for
scheduling, coordinating, and facilitating all Parole Board hearings and office votes, with the
exception of hearings and office votes for incarcerated individuals on life sentence, early
termination of parole, and executive clemency. The TSU executes the release of incarcerated
individuals on parole and coordinates with Field staff for their successful transition to the
community. Finally, TSU tracks parole violation warrants and coordinates preliminary revocation
hearings in conjunction with Hearing Examiners for individuals who are returned to custody.
Release, Rescission, and Revocation Hearings
Three types of hearings are held across the Commonwealth of Massachusetts primarily in
correctional facilities, and are broadly categorized as release, rescission, and revocation hearings.
These hearings are primarily held at the institutions and are therefore, referred to as institutional
hearings. Institutional hearings are typically held in two locations: the HOC facilities, located in
each county within the Commonwealth, and the state DOC facilities. There are also parole hearings
held at the Parole Board’s Central Office, which include some victim access hearings (VAH)1, all
life sentence hearings, executive clemency hearings, and termination hearings. Life sentence
hearings, executive clemency hearings, and termination hearings are all open to the public and
separately reported under the sections for Life Sentence Unit and Office of the General Counsel.
Table 1 presents the number of all institutional release, rescission, and revocation hearings held in
2023 with either a positive or denied vote, broken out by facility type. In 2023, the Parole Board
held 2,934 institutional hearings with either a positive or a denied vote. Out of the total, 69% of
hearings were held for incarcerated individuals housed in the county HOCs and the remaining 31%
were held for incarcerated individuals housed in the Massachusetts DOC. As a result of these
hearings, 1,956 individuals were granted a positive parole vote. In the majority of cases,
incarcerated individuals receiving a positive vote are released to supervision in Massachusetts.
They could also be released to out of state supervision through the Interstate Compact Unit (ICU),
1 VAH hearings are included under institutional hearings.

2023 Annual Statistical Report MPB
to serve another state or federal sentence, or to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE)
custody. In a small number of cases, incarcerated individuals are also released to a Massachusetts
DOC or HOC facility.
As presented in Table 1, the number of positive votes this year resulted in an overall paroling rate
of 67% for all incarcerated individuals, with the paroling rate being higher (at 70%) among
individuals from the HOC compared to 58% among individuals from the DOC, which is consistent
with the historical trend.2 The paroling rate is calculated by dividing the number of hearings that
resulted in a positive Parole Board vote by the sum of total hearings held that resulted in either a
positive or denied vote.

Rescission Hearings
Rescission hearings are held when the Parole Board exercises its discretion to re-visit a prior
decision to grant parole, due to a change in circumstances following the date of the incarcerated
individual’s parole hearing to determine whether to withdraw, postpone, or allow the prior positive
parole vote to stand. A change of circumstance that prompts the Parole Board to hold a rescission
hearing could be when the incarcerated individual has received new disciplinary infractions for
institutional misconduct or availability of new information since the date of the hearing (i.e. an
outstanding warrant). Table 6 displays the paroling rate for rescission hearings by facility type.
For rescission hearings, a positive vote means rescission was either affirmed or not affirmed but
the individual was granted parole. A denied vote means rescission was affirmed and the individual
was denied parole.

conditions of parole. More information concerning parole violations, which may lead to a
revocation hearing is available in the Field Services Division section of this report. Table 7 displays
the paroling rate for revocation hearings by facility type. For revocation hearings, a positive vote

Not all eligible hearings will receive a positive or denied disposition from the Parole Board. Table
8 below breaks out the number of eligible institutional hearings in 2023. The total eligible
institutional hearings went up by 2.5 percent in 2023 (from 5,738 in 2022 to 5,882 in 2023).

Both currently and formerly incarcerated individuals may waive their right to a parole hearing,
either prior to, or during the hearing process. They may also postpone a scheduled parole hearing;
the next hearing (i.e. postponement hearing) is then scheduled to be held a year later. An
incarcerated individual may postpone if they want to receive additional time to establish a plan for
their parole, to resolve outstanding legal matters, or to have counsel present in situations where
representation is needed. In instances where it does not appear possible for a parole eligible
incarcerated individual to receive an adequate parole hearing due to circumstances outside the
individual’s control such as lack of sufficient information to make an informed decision, the Parole
Board may administratively postpone the incarcerated individual’s hearing in order to obtain the
needed information.
7 The table includes only those hearings which received a disposition of denied re-release or approved re-
release regardless of whether their revocation was affirmed or not. Out of a total of 457 eligible for final
revocation hearing in 2023, 237 hearings were held (23 received dispositions other than reserve or denied
and the remaining 214 received either a reserve or denied disposition). Of the 220 hearings not held, 75
and 145 were postponed and waived at own request respectively. Among all eligible for hearing, 375
received a disposition of revocation affirmed, which includes 145 who waived their hearing (See Table
34).
17

2023 Annual Statistical Report MPB
In addition to waivers and postponements, hearings may result in an action pending vote or other
types of votes. These miscellaneous votes serve as an administrative disposition. For example, if
a Board Member needs additional information to make an informed decision, they may vote
“action pending” for receipt of the desired document, and then make a final decision once in receipt
of the desired document. A hearing may result in a vote type of “other” because the incarcerated
individual was sick and could not be seen (i.e., receive a vote “not seen”), the Board Members
voted in opposition (i.e., split decision), or the case needs to be put on the next available hearing
list (i.e., PONAL). In these cases, the final disposition is captured by a subsequent hearing and
disposition. Table 9 displays the breakdown for all eligible hearings into those hearings that were
held with different dispositions, those that were postponed to a later date by the individual (as
opposed to postponed by the Board), and those waived at the individual’s request prior to hearing.
1,182 out of 5,882 eligible hearings (i.e. 20% of the total eligible hearings) were waived either
prior to the hearing (20%) or waived at the hearing (<1%) in 2023.

Office Votes
In addition to holding institutional hearings, the Parole Board makes decisions on parole related
matters that do not require an in-person hearing. This is done by using documentation of the case
to provide resolutions via office votes. Office votes require a combination of efforts by TSU, FSD,
OGC, Board Members, and hearing examiners. Office votes are used for a variety of reasons.
Examples of office vote types include requests for change of vote, provisional rescissions and
revocations, appeal requests, and requests for reconsideration. The description of each office vote
type used in 2023 is included in Appendix A. In 2023, the Parole Board processed 2,348 office
votes; this includes all office votes except office votes pertaining to executive clemencies and
termination requests, which are voted in the Executive Sessions, and have been included in the
Office of the General Counsel section.

Institutional Risk/Needs Assessments
As a Criminal Justice Agency with a commitment towards public safety, the Parole Board uses a
validated actuarial risk/needs assessment instrument in making parole release decisions. The
assessment identifies an individual’s risk to recidivate, as well as reveals their criminogenic needs,
which can then be incorporated into the formerly incarcerated individual’s supervision case plan.
The risk/needs assessment tool used by the Parole Board is the Level of Service Case Management
Inventory (LS/CMI). The Parole Board implemented the LS/CMI in early 2013 as a tool to help in
decisions to grant parole to incarcerated individuals, and for formulating appropriate supervision
strategies for formerly incarcerated individuals under supervision. The LS/CMI categorizes risk to
recidivate from very low to very high as set forth in Table 11. The institutional assessments
captured in this table include those conducted by parole officers within the TSU as well as those
conducted by Special Investigators within the LSU.
As summarized in Table 11, most of the institutional assessments scored at high risk level (43%),
followed by medium risk (35%), and very high (at 12%). Only around 10% of assessments scored
at low to very low risk. Table 12 further provides LS/CMI breakdown for major race/ethnic groups;
the same pattern holds across race/ethnic groups with a much smaller proportion scoring low to
very low while a higher proportion scoring medium to very high.
8 'Other' includes all other office vote types that were used less than 50 times in 2023, including request to
attend hearing, special consideration request, request to resolve action pending, request to postpone VAH
hearing, medical release conditions request, request for the Board to note info. memo, and withdraw
warrant request.

LIFE SENTENCE UNIT
The LSU is responsible for preparing all eligible incarcerated individuals sentenced to life in prison
for parole hearings. This includes gathering case materials, preparing case files for Parole Board
members, interviewing incarcerated individuals in preparation for hearings, and conducting the
LS/CMI risk/needs assessments. The unit is responsible for maintaining the incarcerated
individual’s master file, which is a comprehensive compilation of documents and records related
to the individual’s criminal history, institutional history, trial testimony, risk assessments, and
additional evaluative information. The unit coordinates with affiliate agencies such as the District
Attorneys’ Offices, the Attorney General’s Office, Massachusetts State Police, local police
departments, and the DOC in order to obtain such materials. The unit organizes initial life sentence
hearings and review hearings, which involves tracking initial parole eligibility and subsequent
review hearing eligibility for parole eligible individuals sentenced to life. The unit also provides
all necessary notifications of scheduled hearings at the Parole Board’s central office and supplies
notifications of subsequent decisions.
Life Sentence Hearings
There are two types of parole hearings for parole eligible individuals sentenced to life: initial and
review hearings. Adults sentenced to serve life in prison with the possibility of parole must serve
no less than fifteen (15) years before becoming eligible for parole. The Parole Board holds the
initial hearing within sixty (60) days of initial eligibility. If the Parole Board denies parole after
the initial hearing, the incarcerated individual is provided with a subsequent review hearing at five
years, or earlier, at the discretion of the Parole Board. Both the initial and review hearings take
place before all seven members of the Parole Board at the Parole Board’s central office and are
open to the public. As these hearings are public, the Records of Decision (RODs) on life sentence
hearings are made available on the Parole Board’s website. Table 13 provides paroling rates for
life sentence hearings held in 2023 with either a positive or denied vote, broken out by initial and
review hearings.10
10 There were six additional hearings held, three with a disposition of ‘Postpone (Board Decision)’, two
with a disposition of ‘Action Pending’, and one incarcerated individual passed away while awaiting their
hearing disposition.

Juveniles with Life Sentences
In Miller v. Alabama, 132 S. Ct. 2455 (2012), the United States Supreme Court held that the
“imposition of a mandatory sentence of life in prison without parole on individuals who were under
the age of 18 when they committed the murder is contrary to the prohibition on ‘cruel and unusual
punishments’ in the Eighth Amendment.” Following the Miller decision, a juvenile who had been
convicted of first-degree murder filed a petition, challenging Massachusetts laws that required all
individuals convicted of first-degree murder to serve life in prison without the possibility of parole.
On December 24, 2013, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court ruled in Commonwealth v.
Diatchenko, 466 Mass. 655 (2013), that the statutory provisions mandating life without the
possibility of parole were invalid as applied to juveniles who committed murder. The Court also
determined that its holding was retroactive for all juveniles currently serving life sentences for first
degree murder, and that Diatchenko (and others similarly situated) must be given a parole hearing.
After the Supreme Judicial Court’s decision on December 24, 2013, the Parole Board identified
cases in which incarcerated individuals were under the age of 18 on the date of the offense and
were serving a sentence of life without parole for a conviction of first-degree murder.
Among the 127 life sentence hearings held in 2023, six hearings were held with incarcerated
individuals charged with first degree murder as juveniles (see Table 15)

VICTIM SERVICES UNIT
The VSU provides statewide assistance to victims of violent crimes, whose perpetrators become
parole eligible. It provides assistance to victims of homicide, domestic violence, sexual assault,
child abuse, motor vehicle homicide, and other violent crimes. The unit provides critical services
to victims and family members, including but not limited to:
• Serve as a source of information for parole eligibility, the parole decision-making process,
parole supervision, and notification of parole events.
• Provide assistance in preparing victim impact statements and/or testimony for parole
hearings.
• Accompany victims, parents/guardians of minor aged victims, and family members of
homicide victims to parole hearings.
• Provide crisis intervention services.
• Request for parole conditions that increase the safety and wellbeing of victims.
• Provide safety planning.
• Offer information on victim compensation.
• Assist with Victim Notification Registration (VNR), which is also known as Criminal
Offender Record Information (CORI) registration, that enables victims and family
members to receive notification and services.
• Make referrals to appropriate criminal justice agencies and community-based victim
service providers.
Victim Notifications
The VSU is responsible for providing victim notification for all parole related events, including
notice of parole hearing dates, parole hearing decisions, and parole releases. The VSU is also
responsible for providing victims and CORI registered petitioners with notification related to
public parole hearings conducted for incarcerated individuals sentenced to life in prison, clemency
petitions, and applications for early termination of parole.
In 2023, the VSU sent 17,526 notifications of parole events to registered victims, surviving family
members of homicide victims, and citizen-initiated petitioners. The VSU also worked on 13
medical parole petitions and provided notifications to 23 CORI petitioners. Starting in 2023, VSU
handled 19 termination hearings, providing notification and support surrounding the hearing
process to 30 CORI petitioners. VSU further handled three executive clemency hearings and
assisted nine victims/survivors and family members regarding the process.
25

2023 Annual Statistical Report MPB
Locating Victims for CORI Registration
The VSU is responsible for locating and providing outreach to victims and their families. The VSU
continues to increase its efforts to identify victims of violent crimes who are not CORI Certified
at the time of sentencing. The Unit’s efforts include education and outreach to both District
Attorney Victim Witness Advocates and community-based victim service agencies. The VSU’s
active participation in more than 25 community collaborations and high-risk teams across the state
has increased awareness of victim rights in the parole process and created a seamless network of
services for crime victims. VSU’s goal is to ensure through education, outreach, and cross-agency
collaboration that each agency working with crime victims recognizes and understands post-
conviction victim rights; and that every victim is advised of the importance of the CORI
registration process to access post-conviction victim services. These services include timely
notification, assistance, and referrals to appropriate resources. Through their investigative efforts,
the VSU has successfully located and established 240 new CORI Registrations in 2023.
Victim Services at Parole Hearings
The VSU assists victims, family members, and survivors of homicide victims during Victim
Access Hearings (VAH) and life sentence hearings. During these hearings, victims and family
members are provided the opportunity to attend the parole hearing in person and give oral
testimony. Victim Service Coordinators (VSCs) are experienced professionals who provide
victims and family members with guidance, support, and information throughout each step of the
parole process. There are three types of Victim Access Hearings.
• Type A: Offense resulted in death
• Type B: Offense was either violent or sexual in nature
• County: County sentences in which hearings are held in HOC (excluding Type A)
The following table provides the number of VAH and life sentence hearings held in 2023 in which
the VSU assisted victims or families of victims who attended the hearing, along with the total
number of attendees at these hearings. There were 94 VAH hearings held at the Central Office
including 90 with a reserve or denied disposition.

OFFICE OF THE GENERAL COUNSEL
The Office of the General Counsel represents the Parole Board in all litigation affecting the agency
in the state’s trial courts and represents the agency in labor and employment matters. It further
develops agency regulations and policies, and monitors and drafts parole related legislation. The
primary role of the Board’s General Counsel, and by extension the Office of the General Counsel
as a whole, is to support and represent the Chair and the Board in all legal and policy matters. To
that end, the General Counsel has been appointed a Special Assistant Attorney General for the
purpose of representing the agency in state and federal court.
The Office of the General Counsel evaluates the appropriateness of the provision of counsel prior
to any parole release hearing in response to the request by an incarcerated individual for
accommodation under the ADA. Each request for counsel is evaluated and a referral is made to
the Committee for Public Counsel Services (CPCS) for appointment of counsel. A referral for
counsel may also be made for rescission and revocation hearings.11
Preliminary Revocation Hearings
The hearing examiners within the Office of the General Counsel schedule and conduct preliminary
revocation hearings at all state and county correctional facilities, parole regional offices, and other
designated locations. At preliminary revocation hearings, the hearing examiner determines
whether there exists reasonable grounds to believe that a formerly incarcerated individual has
committed acts that constitute a violation of parole condition(s) or has engaged in a new crime,
and if so, whether there is probable cause to provisionally revoke parole and hold the formerly
incarcerated individual in custody, pending the result of a final revocation hearing. Following a
hearing, the hearing examiner prepares a summary and submits a recommended decision to the
Parole Board.
In 2023, the Parole Board’s hearing examiners conducted 330 preliminary revocation hearings,
compared to the 299 preliminary revocation hearings that were held in 2022.
Executive Clemency
The Office of the General Counsel reviews all executive clemency requests. In Massachusetts, the
power to grant executive clemency is held by the Governor, with the advice and consent of the
Governor’s Council. The Office of the General counsel reviews all petitions for executive
clemency submitted to the Governor for consideration to determine if the request meets the
Governor’s guidelines.12 It then presents petitions to the Parole Board, which acts as the Advisory
11 Individuals appearing for a rescission or a revocation hearing have a right to counsel regardless of any
need for an accommodation.
12 The Governor issued updated Clemency Guidelines in October 2023.

2023 Annual Statistical Report MPB
Board of Pardons (ABP). If a petition does not meet the Governor’s eligibility guidelines, then it
is administratively closed. If a petition meets the guidelines, the ABP votes in the executive session
to determine if the petition merits a hearing. In the event that the ABP conducts a public hearing,
a recommendation is made to the Governor thereafter.
Pardons
A pardon is the forgiveness of the underlying offense, which has the effect of treating the petitioner
as though the offense was never committed. To be granted a pardon, a petitioner should
demonstrate “good citizenship”. In making its decision, the ABP views evidence, including
support for the petitioner in the institution and community, their accomplishments and
achievements, and the nature and extent of any opposition to the petition.
Commutations
Commutation is the lessening of a penalty without forgiveness for the underlying offense. A
commutation of a sentence has the effect of releasing a petitioner from an ongoing sentence of
incarceration. A grant of commutation may also enable an incarcerated individual to appear before
the Parole Board for release consideration at a time earlier than permitted by the court-imposed
sentence.
Executive Clemency Executive Session Votes to Grant or Deny a Hearing
Table 17 captures the ABP’s votes in 2023 in response to pardon and commutation requests. The
Office of the General Counsel processed a total of 28 pardon petitions, which included six
administrative closes and three petitions that were withdrawn. The remaining 19 pardon petitions
were submitted to the ABP. The ABP voted at the executive session to determine whether a hearing
should be granted; four were granted a hearing while 15 were denied (See Table 17). Similarly,
eight commutation petitions were processed, which included one administrative close and two
petitions that were withdrawn. The remaining five petitions were submitted to the ABP. The ABP
voted at the executive session to determine whether a hearing should be granted, and all five were
denied a hearing.

Executive Clemency Hearings
Once the ABP determines a petition warrants a hearing based on the Governor’s guidelines, a
public hearing is held at the Parole Board’s Central Office. Petitioners may provide information
and testimony necessary for the ABP to make a formal recommendation to the Governor.
Table 18 captures pardon and commutation hearings held in 2023. The ABP held seven pardon
hearings, resulting in six favorable recommendations. Likewise, it held one commutation hearing
with a favorable decision. In 2023, Governor Healey granted 13 pardons following a favorable

Requests for Early Termination of Parole
On December 23, 2022, 120 CMR 700.00 was promulgated to establish new rules and procedures
to be followed by the Parole Board in order to grant an early termination of sentence and thus issue
a certificate of early termination of parole supervision. To be eligible for consideration for a
Certificate of Termination of parole under M.G.L. c. 127 § 130A, the formerly incarcerated
individual must meet the following minimum eligibility requirements, and they shall only be
eligible for consideration of termination of parole every 12 months:
13 Out of the 13 pardons granted in 2023 by Governor Healey, the Advisory Board of Pardons made
favorable recommendations on five of them during hearings held in 2023, six during hearings held in
2022, and two during hearings held in 2021.

3. Received no written warnings, parole violation reports, or warrants in the past year, and
has no open court cases
4. In compliance with all other parole supervision requirements.
Formerly incarcerated individuals seeking a Certificate of Termination must submit a completed
Termination Application to the Office of the General Counsel, which reviews the application to
determine whether the formerly incarcerated individual meets the minimum eligibility
requirements. If the application does not meet the requirements, the application is administratively
closed. If the application meets the minimum eligibility requirements, the Office of the General
Counsel submits the application to the Parole Board for review. The Parole Board votes in
executive session and provides a disposition to either deny the application and continue
supervision of the formerly incarcerated individual or grant a hearing to determine whether or not
to approve the application and terminate the sentence. In some cases, it can also terminate the
sentence without a hearing.
In 2023, the Office of the General Counsel processed 53 applications, which included one
application that was administratively closed and one application that was withdrawn. Among the
remaining 51 applications that were deemed eligible for early termination and submitted to the
Board, the Parole Board voted on all of them at the executive session, providing the disposition
captured in Table 19. While 30 applications were denied, and 20 were granted a hearing, only one
was terminated without a hearing.

If an application is granted a hearing at the executive session, the hearing is held at the Parole
Board’s Central Office and is open to the public.
The final determination of whether to terminate the sentence or deny the application is made by a
majority vote of the full Parole Board, which determines whether such termination is in the public
interest.
In 2023, 19 of the applications that were granted a hearing were heard; five were denied while 14
were approved, which granted the formerly incarcerated individuals early termination of their
sentence and hence, their parole supervision.
In total, in 2023, there were 15 formerly incarcerated individuals who were granted early
termination, including the one case terminated without a hearing (captured earlier). In comparison,
in 2022, only one formerly incarcerated individual was approved an early termination of their
sentence.

FIELD SERVICES DIVISION
The FSD is composed of the central office management staff, nine regional parole field offices,
and specialized units namely, the Interstate Compact Unit (ICU), the Warrant and Apprehension
Unit (WAU), and the Training Unit. The division is primarily responsible for supervising and
monitoring all formerly incarcerated individuals who have been released on parole by the Parole
Board and/or via the ICU, as well as those on mandatory or medical release. Supervision duties
include conducting home and work investigations, conducting home and community visits, and
verifying formerly incarcerated individual employment, programming, treatment, etc. The duties
further include ensuring a formerly incarcerated individual is in compliance with general and
special conditions of parole, responding to any violations of Global Positioning Systems (GPS),
administering substance abuse testing, conducting LS/CMI assessments, investigating and
reporting on parole violations, making arrests, and transporting parole violators. Above all, the
FSD plays a key role in assisting with successful reintegration of formerly incarcerated individuals
into the community by building strong partnerships with community service providers and
referring individuals to these service providers for employment, housing, programming, medical,
and rehabilitation services.
Releases to Supervision
Releases resulting from a positive Parole Board vote are discretionary releases and make up the
largest proportion of all releases to parole. In 2019, as a result of the criminal justice reform laws
passed in April 2018, the Parole Board began to supervise formerly incarcerated individuals who
have been issued a parole permit for mandatory release to supervision, as well as medical releases.
A medical release occurs when an incarcerated individual’s petition for medical parole is granted
by the Commissioner of the DOC, pursuant to M.G.L. c. 127, § 119A. A mandatory release to
supervision on the other hand is granted when a state incarcerated individual completes specific
programs as determined by the DOC pursuant to M.G.L. c. 127, § 130B. Completing these
programs earns the incarcerated individual completion credits, which deduct from their maximum
sentence, allowing them to be eligible for mandatory release.
Table 21 breaks out the releases to parole supervision in 2023 by release type. In 2023,
discretionary releases made up 89% of all releases to parole, followed by mandatory releases (at
10%), and medical releases at 1%, which is consistent with 2022.

Table 22 disaggregates the releases in 2023 by commitment type. The term commitment as used
by Parole refers to a court order to confine an individual to a DOC or HOC facility for a sentence
on an offense, or a group of offenses, for which, the individual has been convicted. In cases where
an incarcerated individual serves one commitment type and is transferred to another (i.e., mixed
sentence structure), the initial commitment type will be used for classification. Also, not included
in the definition above are Out of State commitments, which refers to individuals transferred from
another state for supervision in Massachusetts.
Table 22. 2023 Releases to Supervision by Commitment Type.
Commitment Type # Released Percentage
House of Correction 1,091 55%
Department of Correction 791 40%
Out of State 85 4%
Total 1,967 100%
Upon release to parole supervision, most formerly incarcerated individuals serve the remainder of
their sentence (i.e. current commitment) in the community under the supervision of a parole officer
assigned to one of the nine regional offices. In some cases, an incarcerated individual may be
granted parole but will not be released directly to the community. (Some may later get transferred
and ultimately end up being supervised in one of the nine regional offices as well.) Examples
include, but are not limited to, an incarcerated individual who is paroled from their current
commitment to begin another consecutive sentence in a HOC, DOC, another state, or federal
facility; an incarcerated individual who is paroled to a warrant in Massachusetts, another state, or
federal jurisdiction; and an incarcerated individual who is paroled to ICE custody.
Parole releases are counted based on the initial parole of an incarcerated individual’s current
commitment and re-paroles. A re-parole or a re-release is a subsequent discretionary parole on an
incarcerated individual’s current commitment (i.e., revoked, re-committed, and re-paroled).
Releases from a detainer (i.e., warrant for temporary custody) are not included in the number of
re-paroles. Table 23 below summarizes releases to supervision in 2023.

fourth location named There-Is-A-Solution (TIAS) was added in New Bedford. In June 2021, a
fifth location, Rocky Hill Reentry was added in Northampton.
The transitional housing program is funded by the MPS. The program serves formerly incarcerated
individuals, probationers, and discharged incarcerated individuals. Formerly incarcerated
individuals receive free housing for up to six months with case management and referral
services. The Parole Board has been the largest referral source for this program. In 2023, a total of
251 formerly incarcerated individuals were placed in transitional housing across all five locations,
as summarized in Table 27. This is a 21 percent increase from 2022.

In order to support the goal of further reducing the prison population and improving re-entry
outcomes, the Parole Board initiated a contract with the Massachusetts Alliance of Sober Housing
(MASH) in May 2020. The contract enabled the provision of eight weeks of sober housing upon
release of formerly incarcerated individuals, probationers, and discharged incarcerated individuals,
at no cost to the individual. In 2023, a total of 497 formerly incarcerated individuals benefitted
from this initiative, a 12% increase from the 444 formerly incarcerated individuals who benefitted
from the program in 2022.
The availability of both transitional housing and MASH sober housing grants in 2023 enabled the
Agency to provide additional home plan options to formerly incarcerated individuals, thus helping
ensure their release. Approximately 38% of releases in 2023 were supported by the provision of
transitional housing and MASH sober housing programs (748 out of 1,967 releases utilized
housing beds through transitional and MASH sober housing grants).

Formerly Incarcerated Individual Monitoring
The Parole Board monitors formerly incarcerated individuals using tools such as Global
Positioning System (GPS) devices. Monitoring with GPS devices allows the agency to actively
track the whereabouts of formerly incarcerated individuals at any point in time during the
supervision period. GPS data also allow the Parole Board to set exclusion zones that the formerly
incarcerated individual must avoid while in the community. An exclusion zone is the area in or
around a particular address that, if entered by the formerly incarcerated individual, will
immediately alert designated parole staff regarding the individual’s location.
There are four ways by which a formerly incarcerated individual can be mandated to GPS
supervision as a condition of their parole:
1) By Parole Board vote,
2) By Parole Board policy for a sex offense,
17 Starting June of 2019, if an individual’s status has remained whereabouts unknown for at least 30 days,
regional offices transfer these cases to the Warrant and Apprehension Unit.
38

2023 Annual Statistical Report MPB
3) By Parole Board policy for a non-sex offense, but required to register with the Sex Offender
Registry Board (SORB) for a prior sex offense and classified by SORB as a Level 3 or
unclassified sex offender,
4) By a parole supervisor in response to a graduated sanction, as an alternative to
incarceration.
At the end of 2023, there were 491 formerly incarcerated individuals actively on GPS supervision.
Throughout the year, there were 1,281 GPS activations (i.e. GPS was deployed as a part of
supervision) (see Table 28).

Drug and Alcohol Testing
The Parole Board will periodically require urine and/or breath samples from formerly incarcerated
individuals to monitor for illicit drug and alcohol usage. Through appropriate drug testing,
treatment, and sanctions, the Parole Board will be able to monitor an individual’s integration into
the community more effectively, prevent serious criminal behavior through early intervention, and
promote appropriate treatment to assist the individual’s rehabilitation.
Parole officers use portable drug testing kits and breathalyzers, allowing for immediate access to
test results. This type of testing not only provides officers with an effective supervisory tool but
also has a deterrent effect on formerly incarcerated individuals who know if they violate the
conditions of their parole by using alcohol and/or illicit drugs, it will be quickly detected. In
addition to parole officers conducting tests, substance use tests are conducted by authorized
agencies and treatment programs.
During 2023, 11,805 drug and alcohol tests were conducted on formerly incarcerated individuals
supervised in the nine regional offices.18 Drug tests consisted of the following test types: Cocaine
18 This number is comparable to the 11,394 tests conducted in 2022 for approximately 123 thousand
specimens being tested.

Parole Reentry Navigator Program
The Parole Board’s Reentry Navigator Program (formerly known as Substance Abuse Coordinator
Program) is a collaborative initiative between the Parole Board and the Department of Public
Health’s (DPH) Bureau of Substance Addiction Services (BSAS). In 2023, there were eight full-
time Reentry Navigators from licensed DPH service vendors, placed and working at each of
Parole’s regional field offices; region 3 and Region 6 share the same Navigator. However, there
were periods of time in regions 2, 7, 8, and 9 when navigators were in transition and the regional
offices did not have any coverage.
Some of the basic duties of the Navigators include formerly incarcerated individual intake, triage,
and referral functions. They conduct evaluations for potential substance use and
mental/behavioral health disorders, provide treatment referrals and outreach to service providers,
community-based organizations and resources such as support groups, legal services, and
clinical mental health services. They are also responsible for tracking and monitoring the progress
of clients and treatment providers. The Navigators’ services assist formerly incarcerated
individuals in making a successful transition to communities across the state.

2023 Annual Statistical Report MPB
Parole Regional Re-entry Centers
Parole Regional Re-entry Centers (RRC) operate in eight regional areas. Each RRC is housed
within the same site as Parole’s regional field offices. This gives the Navigators close proximity
to the assigned field officer when a case needs to be supervised, reviewed, or sanctioned. Each
RRC is open Monday through Friday, 9:00 am to 5:00 pm. Onsite supervision of the Navigators
is provided jointly by the parole supervisor and the sub-contractor’s Clinical Director.
The Navigator is responsible for meeting and interviewing each formerly incarcerated individual
when they are released on parole, and for completing an “Intake” if it is the formerly incarcerated
individual’s first release on parole. They are responsible for conducting substance abuse
evaluations for every parole release. For those formerly incarcerated individuals with substance
abuse history who need support, the Navigators complete an “enrollment” in the BSAS. Finally,
after 90 days of enrollment or on being discharged from supervision, whichever date is sooner, the
enrolled formerly incarcerated individual is disenrolled. During disenrollment, BSAS makes
referrals to different services.
In 2023, 1,138 formerly incarcerated individuals were enrolled in the BSAS. The table below
further breaks down these enrollments by regional centers. Among those disenrolled from the
BSAS in 2023, they were referred to a variety of services, primarily Outpatient SA Counseling,
and mental health services.

19 There were periods of time in regions 2, 7, 8, and 9 when navigators were in transition and the regional
offices did not have any coverage, which could result in underreporting of the enrollment numbers for
these regions.
20 Region 3 and Region 6 share the same navigator.
21 The enrollment number is underreported since it is based on enrollments between January and May
2023 as the region was without a Reentry Navigator since June of 2023 until a new navigator joined and
received training. Nevertheless, all clients released after May were still getting referral services directly
through Parole Field staff.

Behavioral Health for Justice Involved Individuals (BH-JI)
In September 2019, the Parole Board collaborated with the Executive Office of Health and Human
Services (EOHHS), the Massachusetts Probation Service (MPS), the DOC, Middlesex County
Sheriff’s Office (MSO), and Worcester County Sheriff’s Office (WCSO), along with Open Sky
Community Services,22 and Advocates23 to refer high-risk individuals with acute behavioral health
support needs to an enhanced navigator program referred to as BH-JI. In 2021, EOHHS put out a
request for responses from organizations that would go on to provide BH-JI supports statewide for
justice-involved MassHealth-eligible individuals. The project was piloted in Middlesex and
Worcester counties in 2019 with Advocates, Inc and Open Sky Community Services, and was
expanded statewide on February 1, 2022.
MassHealth also requested permission to launch similar community support for members enrolled
in MassHealth managed care, which became the Community Support Program for Justice
Involvement individuals (CSP-JI). CSP-JI services became effective September 1, 2022 with the
Managed Care Organizations (MCOs), ACPPs, and the State’s behavioral health vendor.
The mission of both BH-JI and CSP-JI is to assist justice-involved population with their mental
health and substance use needs by connecting them to the right health care and community services
program.
Across the entire year, in 2022, combining BH-JI and CPS-JI, there were a total of 1,927 referrals
to the programs from all agencies, and 1,498 participants had enrolled in the programs. Among
them, there were 113 referrals (98 to BH-JI and 15 to CSP-JI) and 65 enrollees (51 to BH-JI and
14 to CSP-JI) from the Parole Board. Furthermore, there were 58 individuals referred by the DOC
who were incarcerated at referral. In 2023, there were 2,771 referrals to both the programs across
all agencies, and 1,987 participants had enrolled in the programs. Among them, there were 76
referrals (33 to BH-JI and 43 to CSP-JI) and 53 enrollees (11 to BH-JI and 42 to CSP-JI) from the
Parole Board. Additionally, there were 130 individuals referred by the DOC who were incarcerated
at referral. It should be noted that while a majority of referrals and enrollees are not formerly
incarcerated individuals, those referred and enrolled at the DOC and HOC will be eligible for
continued services upon release on parole.
Field Services Risk/Needs Assessments
In addition to conducting LS/CMI risk/needs assessments at the correctional institutions in
preparation for parole hearings, field parole officers conduct reassessments using the same
LS/CMI assessment after release of formerly incarcerated individual in the community to apply
effective supervision strategies. Outcomes of reassessments in the field can be used to ensure that
formerly incarcerated individuals are receiving appropriate services in response to their case
management needs.
22 Open Sky Community Services is a behavioral health service provider, headquartered in Worcester,
Massachusetts.
23 Advocates is a behavioral health service provider located in multiple counties within Massachusetts.
42

2023 Annual Statistical Report MPB
Consistent with the previous year, in 2023, most field assessments conducted scored medium risk
(53%), followed by low to very low risk (39%), and less than 9% scored high to very high risk
(see Table 31). This is a stark difference compared to the risk-level distribution seen at the
institutional level earlier in this report with a majority scoring at high risk. The pattern holds true
across different race/ethnic groups as summarized in Table 32, which provides LS/CMI breakdown
by race/ethnicity. This speaks to the lower risk level associated with the population that is deemed
suitable for parole supervision; the risk level might decline further for formerly incarcerated
individuals who remain stable and are successful under supervision when they are reassessed by
the Field staff.

2023 Annual Statistical Report MPB
Graduated Sanctions
The Parole Board’s policy for graduated sanctions is intended to provide consistency,
transparency, fairness, and efficiency throughout the parole violation process. The installation of
graduated sanctions as a case management tool denotes a controlled delegation of authority by the
Parole Board to the officers in the FSD. If a formerly incarcerated individual is willing to work
with his or her parole officer, then the Parole Board will work toward that individual’s continued
success. The Parole Board believes success is not achieved through the individual’s automatic
return to custody in the event of a parole violation. The agency’s primary mission, however, has
been and will remain to ensure public safety.
The guidelines for imposing graduated sanctions match the severity of the violation with the
formerly incarcerated individual’s risk level to determine the appropriate treatment, intervention,
and/or sanction. For example, if a low to medium risk individual has failed to attend substance
abuse classes yet continues to be employed and maintains a healthy lifestyle, then the parole officer
has the discretion to sanction this violation of parole conditions by issuing a warning ticket,
requiring the individual to attend a meeting with the parole officer, or stage an intervention with a
substance abuse counselor at one of the regional field offices. The parole officer has the discretion
to engage the various graduated sanctions within their level of authority as an alternative to
returning the individual to custody for a parole revocation hearing and possible re-commitment to
the original terms of their sentence. If the parole officer wants to impose a sanction that is outside
their level of authority, they have to submit a completed form to their supervisor. The supervisor
may then impose an appropriate graduated sanction within their level of authority but if they decide
the sanction is insufficient, they may pursue a Parole Board level sanction. In this case, the
supervisor will pick a Parole Board level sanction and submit the graduated sanction form to the
Parole Board. The Parole Board members will review the graduated sanction and affirm the
sanction picked by the parole supervisor, reject and enter a different sanction, or request more
information from the supervisor and then process it.
In 2023, there were 1,261 graduated sanctions issued and completed as an alternative to
detainment, in response to 1,773 reported violations. A single graduated sanction can be issued for
multiple violations. Graduated sanctions are primarily used as an alternative to returning the
formerly incarcerated individual to custody for a possible revocation of parole. Figure 11 shows
that the number of reported violations between years 2022 and 2023 did not change much but there
was a 5% decline in the use of graduated sanctions as an alternative to detainment and possible
revocation of parole.
Out of the 1,261 graduated sanctions completed as an alternative to detainment for hearing, 141
(i.e. 11%) were completed by the Board. In comparison, in 2022, out of the 1,333 graduated
sanctions completed as an alternative to detainment, 154 (i.e. 11.6%) were completed by the Board.

The appropriate response in terms of use of sanctions and interventions in response to an alleged
parole violation is determined by the graduated sanctions guidelines grid, which considers the
formerly incarcerated individual’s risk level based on risk/needs assessment (LS/CMI), and the
severity of the violation. The risk distribution of individuals receiving these sanctions in 2023 can
be seen in the chart below. A majority of the graduated sanctions issued in 2023 were for
individuals with a high risk level (at 45%), closely followed by those with medium risk level (at
43%).

As presented in the chart below, the proportion of graduated sanctions imposed on higher risk
individuals (medium to very high) has increased over the past six years (from 86% in 2018 to 94%
in 2023), while the proportion of sanctions imposed on lower risk individuals (low to very low)
has steadily decreased (from 14% in 2018 to 7% in 2023).

Warrants
A warrant for detainer purposes (i.e., 15-day warrant) and an Interstate Compact warrant for
detainer purposes (i.e., 60-day warrant) are referred to as Warrants for Temporary Custody (WTC).
A 15-day detainer is issued when a parole officer has reasonable belief that a formerly incarcerated
individual has lapsed into criminal ways, has associated with criminal company, or has violated
the conditions of his or her parole. The parole officer may then, with the consent of a parole
supervisor or other superior officer, issue a WTC of the individual. A WTC authorizes the
detention of the individual for a maximum period of 15 days or up to 60 days in the case of a
formerly incarcerated individual being supervised by the authorities of another state (e.g. out of
state commitments supervised in MA), pursuant to the terms of the Interstate Compact. The
issuance of a WTC does not interrupt the formerly incarcerated individual’s sentence.
A Warrant for Permanent Custody (WPC) on the other hand, is an order of imprisonment of the
formerly incarcerated individual, which may be issued upon a finding that there exists probable
cause to believe that the individual has engaged in new crime or has violated one or more
conditions of parole. The individual’s supervision status upon issuance of a WPC, and the
underlying sentence, resumes only after service of the warrant.
With an Interstate Compact warrant for detainer purposes (i.e., 60-day warrant) and an Interstate
Compact Warrant for Permanent Custody, the Parole Board is authorized to issue and serve a
46

2023 Annual Statistical Report MPB
warrant to detain formerly incarcerated individuals whom the Parole Board is supervising under
the Interstate Compact.
In 2023, a total of 594 warrants for 15-day detainer were issued. Out of these warrants issued, 573
(i.e. 96%) served custody or were arrested. Among the 573 arrested, 91% were provisionally
revoked, 5% were issued Interstate Compact warrant for 60-day detainer, 3% had their warrant
extinguished, and the remaining 1% received a warning or final warning from the Board. The 21
who were issued a warrant but not arrested, had their provisional revocation hearing held in their
respective regional office locations, and all received a warning or final warning from the Board.
Among the 573 arrested, 521 individuals were provisionally revoked and were issued a WPC for
imprisonment, following which, they will await their final revocation hearing.

Revocations
When a parolee is criminally charged or has displayed severe misconduct (i.e., assaultive/violent
behavior, absconding, violating a restraining order, etc.) or when an appropriate range of sanctions
and interventions have been utilized and have been ineffective, a revocation occurs and the
formerly incarcerated individual is re-committed to the terms of their original sentence, following
a final revocation hearing. It should be noted that upon revocation of parole, individuals do not
necessarily serve the remainder of their commitment in a correctional facility. The Parole Board
reassesses their suitability for re-parole.
Table 34 presents revocations by commitment type, where the final revocation hearing resulted in
a “revocation affirmed” vote. This includes all dispositions including reserves, denied, waivers,
postponements, action pending, and PONAL. It is important to note that individuals whose parole
is revoked may be re-paroled; therefore, revocations will only capture a setback or failure for a
short period of time. In 2023, among all eligible for final revocation hearing (i.e. those
provisionally revoked at the preliminary revocation hearing by the hearing examiner and
25 In these cases, hearings were held in regional field offices.
47

2023 Annual Statistical Report MPB
confirmed as provisionally revoked by the Board), 375 received a disposition of revocation
affirmed, which included 145 who waived their hearing. Of the remaining 230 who had their final
revocation hearing with a revocation affirmed disposition, 51% received a positive vote for re-
parole while 40% were denied re-parole, and the remaining 8% received other dispositions.
Furthermore, out of the 375 revocations, 134 (i.e. 36% of those revoked) were re-paroled26, and
55 of them (i.e. 41% of those re-paroled) were successfully discharged from supervision by April
20, 2024.

Parole violations, which precede revocations, can be of two types: new crime violations and non-
crime or technical violations. Revocations that result from a new criminal charge (i.e., “new
crime”) are typically initiated by law enforcement, and not the formerly incarcerated individual’s
field parole officer. Non-crime or technical violations are violations of general and special
conditions of parole, excluding those that involve new criminal charges. However, non-crime
violations may include acts that involve criminal behavior that did not lead to new charges. Some
revocations may result from both new crime and non-crime violations. For example, a formerly
incarcerated individual who is arrested for assault and battery, drug trafficking, or breaking and
entering may be revoked for violations of parole conditions (i.e. non-crime or technical violation),
in addition to incurring new criminal charges (i.e. new crime violation). Table 37 below breaks
down revocations in 2023 by parole violation type.

A revocation typically results from violation of multiple parole conditions as recorded in the Parole
Violation Report (PVR). In 2023, there were a total of 375 revocations based on 1,168 reported
number of Parole Violation Report (PVR) rules that were violated. This translates to violation of
average of over three rules for each parole revocation. Although there was an increase in the
number of revocations in 2023 compared to 2022 (from 321 to 375), the change should be viewed
in the context of an overall increase in the number of active formerly incarcerated individuals
under supervision across the two years, which went up from 2,715 in 2022 to 2,917 in 202328. The
revocation number for each year also includes formerly incarcerated individuals who were not
under active community supervision in the particular year but were either already detained and
awaiting revocation hearing or were whereabouts unknown (and later revoked) at the beginning of
the year.29
For a more accurate comparison across years, we focus on the outcomes for all the Massachusetts
commitments that were under Massachusetts community supervision in year 2022 and 2023 and
break out the outcomes by the end of each year. Table 38 below captures the breakdown. In both
years, 81% of the Massachusetts commitments that were under community supervision in
Massachusetts were successfully discharged or continued to remain under supervision, and there
was no significant change in the percentage that were revoked (from 10% in 2022 to 11% in
2023).
27 Of those parolees revoked for alleged technical violation (304), a total of 163, or 54% had received at
least one prior graduated sanction before their revocation. The majority of the remaining 141 parole
violators who had not received a prior graduated sanction, incurred violations that included termination
from a residential treatment program, transitional housing, or sober housing (92 cases), or had absconded
from supervision (62 cases); among these 38 had both violations.
28 These numbers include only Massachusetts commitments under Massachusetts community supervision
and exclude Out of State cases under Massachusetts community supervision.
29 The revocation number also includes any Massachusetts commitment supervised in another state if they
are revoked.

Discharges from Supervision
As with releases to parole, discharges from parole are also based on commitments. The counts in
the table below are drawn from the point in time when the commitment was closed. A commitment
can close for a variety of reasons, the most common of which is at the parole discharge date.
However, formerly incarcerated individuals may be discharged for other reasons (e.g., Interstate
Compact Case closed interest, Good Conduct Discharge after sentence completion from
correctional facility, vacated/court release). In addition, individuals can be discharged while under
supervision by another authority. For example, an individual may end a period of supervision while
under the custody of ICE or another state’s warrant. In a majority of cases however, discharge
occurs while the individual is under parole supervision in Massachusetts. Table 39 below displays
the discharges from supervision by commitment type.

In 2019, pursuant to M.G.L. c. 127, § 130C, the Parole Board established a policy and procedure
for issuance of compliance credits to formerly incarcerated individuals for satisfactory conduct.
To be eligible for compliance credits, formerly incarcerated individuals would have to meet the
following criteria:
• An active formerly incarcerated individual released on or after January 13, 2019
• Serving a state sentence
• Released on either discretionary or medical parole
• Supervised in one of the Parole regional offices
• Not be serving a life sentence.
Eligible formerly incarcerated individuals may earn up to 15 compliance credits each month,
equivalent to reduction in Parole Discharge Date by 15 days, leading up to their earliest parole
discharge date based on adherence to their special conditions of parole. The accrued number of
credits deducts from a formerly incarcerated individual’s parole discharge date, ultimately granting
them an earlier discharge from parole supervision.
Table 43 exhibits the number and proportion of formerly incarcerated individuals who earned
compliance credits out of all formerly incarcerated individuals who were eligible, by year of
release to parole supervision, along with the average credits received by release year. 74% of
compliance credit eligible formerly incarcerated individuals released to supervision in 2023 earned
compliance credits, which is slightly higher than the 69% of eligible formerly incarcerated
individuals released in 2022 who earned compliance credits32.

2022 420 288 69% 33
2023 365 269 74% 39
Total 785 557 71% 54
Table 44 presents the number of formerly incarcerated individuals who were discharged early due
to earned compliance credits, broken out by year of discharge from parole supervision. In 2022,
out of all successful discharges from supervision that were eligible for CCs, 88% were discharged
early due to compliance credits; the proportion discharged early due to earned CCs was comparable
at 89% in 2023.33 In both the years, early discharge due to accrual of CCs resulted in average of
over two months of reduced supervision.
32 Number of earned credits for releases in 2022 and 2023 are measured as of March of 2023 and March
of 2024 respectively, for appropriate comparison across years.
33 2022 and 2023 numbers are based on data retrieved as of March of 2022 and March of 2023
respectively.

Interstate Compact Unit
The Massachusetts Parole Board is a member of the Interstate Commission for Adult Offender
Supervision (ICAOS), with Massachusetts Parole Board Chair Tina M. Hurley serving as Compact
Administrator and Attorney Keara Kelley serving as the Deputy Compact Administrator.
Established in 1937 with the purpose of regulating the movement of probationers and parolees
across state lines, the ICAOS is enacted in all 50 states and three U.S. territories. The Interstate
Compact grants member states the authority to track supervised individuals who move across state
lines, in accordance with the ICAOS Mission Statement: “The Interstate Commission for Adult
Offender Supervision will guide the transfer of supervised individuals in a manner that promotes
effective supervision strategies consistent with public safety, accountability, and victims’ rights.”
The Parole Board’s designated Interstate Compact Unit (ICU) lies within the Field Services
Division. The ICU coordinates the interstate transfer of formerly incarcerated individuals entering
or leaving the state and oversees an active caseload of Massachusetts formerly incarcerated
individuals residing out of state under the Interstate Compact. The ICU also supervises all
Massachusetts incarcerated individuals paroled to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE)
detainers and deportation warrants.
At the end of 2023, there were 257 commitments under supervision through the ICU. Formerly
incarcerated individuals’ status through the ICU encompasses a variety of circumstances including
supervision by another state’s paroling authority (149), ICE custody (24), and deportation (84).
Throughout 2023, there were 116 Massachusetts commitments released to the Interstate Compact
to be supervised by other states or transferred to other types of custody. Of these cases:
• 46 Formerly incarcerated individuals were released to be supervised by another state’s
parole agency, and
• 70 formerly incarcerated individuals were released to ICE custody.
In addition, during 2023, there were 85 commitments from other states released to Massachusetts
for parole supervision.
In 2023, the ICU worked collaboratively across the Commonwealth and in conjunction with other
member states to ensure that ICAOS goals were met. In September 2023, Commissioner Hurley
attended the ICAOS Annual Business meeting in Norfolk, Virginia. At this meeting, members
voted on new rule proposals affecting the ICAOS. Compact administrators also participated in
54

2023 Annual Statistical Report MPB
several meetings of the ICAOS East Region, which allowed for collective progress on issues
affecting our geographic region. In November, the Massachusetts State Council met to discuss
compact issues affecting the individuals supervised by the Massachusetts Parole Board and
Massachusetts Probation Service. Discussion topics included the role of the Interstate Compact for
individuals supervised on medical parole or those applying for termination of parole supervision.
Warrant and Apprehension Unit
The Warrant and Apprehension Unit (WAU), which lies within the FSD, assists staff in the
regional parole offices in locating and apprehending formerly incarcerated individuals who have
violated their parole conditions and absconded from supervision. The unit also arranges for the
apprehension of formerly incarcerated individuals who have fled the Commonwealth and monitors
the Criminal Justice Information System (CJIS) for criminal activity among parole violators. The
unit is also responsible for entering, updating, and removing parole violation warrants from the
agency’s database, as well as coordinating all required extraditions.
The primary function of the WAU is to assist regional parole offices in locating and arresting
parole violators and returning them to custody. In addition to conducting these fugitive
investigations, the WAU performs numerous other duties as listed below:
• Provides and coordinates security for all life sentence and VAH hearings at the central
office in Natick, Massachusetts.
• Enters, modifies, and cancels all Parole Board Warrants for Temporary Custody (WTC)
and Warrants for Permanent Custody (WPC) into the National Crime Information Center
(NCIC) database.
• Enters, modifies, and cancels information regarding lost or stolen agency equipment.
• Enters broadcasts regarding fugitives and completing extraditions.
• Monitors Criminal Justice Information Services databases.
• Processes all paroles from Massachusetts state and county facilities to out-of-state warrants
and/or commitments, and supervises this caseload until release from out-of-state custody.
• Supervises a caseload of warrant cases held in custody out-of-state, ensuring extradition at
the appropriate time.
• Maintains a caseload of whereabouts unknown cases, including Interstate Compact cases.
• Serves as the Parole Board’s ‘After-Hour Duty Station’.
Arrests and Transportations to Custody
In 2023, the WAU parole officers participated in 398 arrests. Those arrests included 211 parole
violators (117 of them were with the status of whereabouts unknown at the time of arrest) and 187
arrests in cooperation with interagency task forces and partnerships. The unit was also responsible
for 171 prisoner transports.
55

2023 Annual Statistical Report MPB
Extraditions
The WAU is also responsible for handling the extradition of parole violators being returned to
Massachusetts from other states. The WAU works closely with law enforcement and correctional
facilities across the nation in order to fulfill extraditions. In 2023, the WAU supervised the
extradition of 27 parole violators from around the United States back to Massachusetts. This
involves collaborating with the arresting states and ensuring that all legal extradition procedures
are being followed.
Paroles to Out-of-State Warrants
The WAU processes all paroles from Massachusetts correctional facilities to out-of-state warrants
and/or out-of-state commitments. This includes supervising individuals until their release from
out-of-state custody. 44 individuals were released to out of state warrants in 2023.
Warrant Cases In Custody Out-of-State
The WAU oversees all warrant cases held in custody out-of-state. The WAU supervises these
parole violators; it monitors incarcerated and formerly incarcerated individuals’ progress with the
out-of-state correctional facility, and arranges extradition when the parole violator is made
available. The average caseload of warrant cases in custody out-of-state in 2023 was 24.
Warrant Cases – Whereabouts Unknown
The WAU has responsibility for formerly incarcerated individuals who abscond from parole
supervision and have their status changed to whereabouts unknown when they are transferred to
the WAU from a regional field office. The caseload of warrant cases with status of whereabouts
unknown at the end of 2023 was 94.
Twenty-Four Hour Duty Station
The WAU serves as the agency’s ‘Twenty-Four Hour Duty’ station, responding to all emergency
inquiries made after 5:00 pm on weekdays, as well as on weekends and holidays. All after-hour
calls are received by the Massachusetts State Police Central Dispatch, who then contacts the WAU
for further handling of the situation. The WAU officer on duty contacts the appropriate parole
officer to ensure that each case has been addressed. If the assigned parole officer is unavailable,
then the case is referred to the after-hour duty parole supervisor from a rotating list. The WAU
processed approximately 163 after-hour calls in 2023.
Training Unit
All Field Officers including supervisors completed a minimum of 40 hours of in-service training
in 2023. Training consisted of classroom, online, and practical hands-on application of certain job
duties. In partnership with UMass Chan, Field Officers received trainings on pharmacological
effects of certain street and prescription drugs. Field Officers continue to train and retrain on AED
(Automated External Defibrillator) and on Naloxone (NARCAN) for a continued response to fight
the Opioid overdose crisis. Annual training in use of force de-escalation, firearms, and defensive
56

2023 Annual Statistical Report MPB
tactics was completed. Some officers attended specialized trainings in the areas of wellness, stress
resiliency, and communication with deaf and hard of hearing. All officers completed trainings in
the following topics: trauma informed responses in Law Enforcement, hate crimes, legal updates,
digital technology, and suicide intervention and prevention. Staff also attended the 2023 summit
for emerging adults, and reentry drug court initiatives. No new Parole recruit class was held in
2023.

Parole Board shall issue a mandatory release to supervision parole permit to that prisoner for the
remainder of his or her sentence, as reduced by any good conduct deductions issued by the
Department of Corrections. The Parole Board does not make any decision on the release and
therefore, a request is submitted to set release conditions.
Request for Provisional Rescission: When the Parole Board members set a parole release date,
release on that date is contingent upon continued satisfactory conduct by the incarcerated
individual and the absence of any new and significant adverse information not known to the
parole hearing panel at the time the release decision was made. Where the Parole Board learns of
