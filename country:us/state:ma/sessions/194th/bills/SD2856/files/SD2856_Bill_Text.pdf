I. Introduction
On January 21, 2021, Chapter 337 of the Acts of 2020 was signed into law. This landmark
legislation is intended to enhance the efforts of the Commonwealth’s colleges and universities
to identify, prevent, and respond to campus sexual violence. Entitled An Act Relative to Sexual
Violence on Higher Education Campuses (and commonly referred to as the “2021 Campus Sexual
Assault Law”), the law applies to all institutions of higher education located and authorized to
grant degrees in the Commonwealth. The legislation added two major sections to chapter 6 of
the General Laws: section 168D which requires all institutions to conduct sexual misconduct
climate surveys at least once every four years; and section 168E which imposes specific policy,
procedure and reporting requirements that enhance institutions’ efforts to prevent and respond
to campus sexual misconduct.
The law also includes a reporting requirement, providing that the Department of Higher
Education (“DHE” or “Department”) shall annually report aggregate statewide information on the
“frequency and nature of sexual misconduct”1 at all institutions of higher education located in
the Commonwealth and authorized to grant degrees. Specifically, section 168E(q) of chapter 6
of the General Laws, as amended by the 2021 Campus Sexual Assault Law, provides as follows:
Annually, not later than December 1, each institution shall prepare and submit to the
department of higher education a report that includes: (i) the total number of reports of
sexual misconduct reported to the institution’s Title IX coordinator by a student or
employee of the institution against another student or employee of the institution; (ii) the
number of reports made by a student or employee of the institution against another
student or employee of the institution investigated by a local or state law enforcement
agency, if known; (iii) the number of students and employees found responsible for
violating an institution’s policies prohibiting sexual misconduct; (iv) the number of
students and employees found not responsible for violating an institution’s policies
prohibiting sexual misconduct; and (v) the number of disciplinary actions imposed by the
institution as a result of a finding of responsibility for violating an institution’s policies
prohibiting sexual misconduct. Such incident data shall be reported in the form and
manner established by the department of higher education, in consultation with the
attorney general, and in a manner that complies with state and federal privacy laws. The
department of higher education shall analyze the incident data and shall publish an
annual report containing aggregate statewide information on the frequency and nature
of sexual misconduct at institutions. The department of higher education shall file the
annual report with the attorney general, the clerks of the senate and the house of
representatives and the joint committee on higher education.
1 M.G.L. c. 6, § 168E(a) defines “sexual misconduct” as an incident of sexual violence, dating violence, domestic violence,
gender-based violence, violence based on sexual orientation or gender identity or expression, sexual assault, sexual
harassment or stalking.

In furtherance of the Department’s statutory analysis and reporting responsibilities, the
DHE hereby submits its annual “Incident Data Collection and Annual Report” (Section II) to the
Massachusetts Attorney General, the Clerks of the Senate and House of Representatives, and the
Joint Committee on Higher Education on the “frequency and nature of sexual misconduct” at
campuses across the Commonwealth, as indicated in the incident data collected by the DHE,
consistent with the process discussed within this report. Please note, this report includes the
data reported for both the 2021 and 2022 calendar years, displayed separately in report Sections
II and III, respectively.
In addition to the information provided in this report, a summary of the Department’s
overall implementation process to date for the new law can be found on the DHE Campus Safety
Violence Prevention (CSVP) website2.
II. Incident Data Collection and Annual Report for the 2022
Reporting Period
The law includes a specific reporting requirement (M.G.L. c. 6, § 168E(q)), which directs all
public and private institutions of higher education (“IHEs”) located in the Commonwealth and
authorized to grant degrees to report annually on the prevalence of sexual misconduct incidents
on campus. For the 2022 CSVP Annual Reporting cycle,3 there were 29 public and 82 private
IHEs located in the Commonwealth and authorized to grant degrees. In this cycle, Massachusetts
IHEs employed 132,010 people and enrolled 592,633 students. Public institutions accounted for
34,873 employees and 244,825 students, and private institutions accounted for 97,137
employees and 347,808 students.4
Institutions report these data annually for the prior calendar year, consistent with Clery
Act reporting requirements. This section of the report reflects the 2022 data submission file for
incidents that occurred in calendar year 2021: January 1, 2021 – December 31, 2021.
To streamline the collection of this data, DHE developed an online portal for institutions
to submit these data. The portal also serves as a user-friendly mechanism to provide status
updates and documentation related to Law Enforcement Agencies (LEAs) and community-based
service provider Memorandums of Understanding (MOUs), registration and waiver requests
related to Sexual Assault Crisis Service Centers, and sexual misconduct surveys. The data

4 Total employee and student data presented here from IPEDS were as of November 1, 2021 for employees, and AY21
(July 1, 2021 - June 30, 2021), for students. Eight private IHEs’ data were not available in IPEDS as of the publication of
this report. There are a number of reasons for this including that such institutions were either newly-approved
institutions, do not participate in Title IV federal financial aid programs and are not required to not report data to
IPEDS, or are out-of-state institutions with a limited physical presence in Massachusetts but nevertheless fall under
the 2021 Campus Sexual Assault Law’s definition of “institution.”

collection portal, EDvera, went live in November 2022, and as of the date of this report
submission, 111 IHEs submitted a report.5
The DHE has reviewed all submissions and after conducting any necessary due diligence
in seeking supplementary information or clarifications, pursuant to the law, the DHE has
prepared this report for submission that includes data tables demonstrating aggregate
statewide information on the frequency and nature of sexual misconduct at institutions.
A. Data Tables and Figures
The tables included below provide the data required to be collected, as per M.G.L. c. 6, § 168E(q).

Total reports by all reporting/responding parties 1,698
Table 1 above breaks down the total number of reports of sexual misconduct by the type of
reporting party and the type of responding party.
5 Again, noting that eight (8) private IHEs’ data were not available in IPEDS as of the publication of this report,
therefore accounting for the discrepancy in the number of IHEs in IPEDS as 103 but the number reporting data is 111.
6 M.G.L. c. 6, § 168E(q)(i). For this year’s data collection process (reports from the 2021 calendar year), “anonymous”
reports were not separated out and therefore may not have been reported/accounted for here. The DHE has added
this category back into the collection process for the 2023 submission (collecting data from the 2022 calendar year).

III. Incident Data Collection and Annual Report for the 2023
Reporting Period
For the 2023 CSVP Annual Reporting cycle,10 there were 29 public and 82 private IHEs
located in the Commonwealth and authorized to grant degrees. In this cycle, Massachusetts IHEs
employed 136,205 people and enrolled 587,395 students. Public institutions accounted for
34,923 employees and 233,900 students, and private institutions accounted for 101,282
employees and 353,495 students. 11
Institutions report these data annually for the prior calendar year, consistent with Clery
Act reporting requirements. This section of the report reflects the 2023 data submission file for
incidents that occurred in calendar year 2022: January 1, 2022 – December 31, 2022.
For this reporting period, the data collection portal, EDvera, went live in November 2023,
and as of the date of this report submission, all applicable IHEs (111) submitted a report.12
The DHE has reviewed all submissions and after conducting any necessary due diligence
in seeking supplementary information or clarifications, pursuant to the law, the DHE has
prepared this report for submission that includes data tables demonstrating aggregate
statewide information on the frequency and nature of sexual misconduct at institutions.

AY22 (July 1, 2021 - June 30, 2022), for students. Nine private IHEs’ data were not available in IPEDS as of the
publication of this report. There are a number of reasons for this including that such institutions were either newly-
approved institutions, do not participate in Title IV federal financial aid programs and are not required to not report

B. Analysis of Data Collection Process
In preparation for implementation of this process each year, the Department engages
agency and institutional partners and stakeholders to further optimize the sexual misconduct
incident data collection process. Over the last several years, DHE has made only minimal
changes17 to the data collection process and information collected, as the data gathered and
demonstrated in this report provide the information the law strives to obtain, in a clear and
concise manner.
IV. Conclusion
The 2021 Campus Sexual Assault Law has created the opportunity for the Department
and the Commonwealth’s public and private higher education institutions to make
significant advances in campus safety and violence prevention. Fulfilling the requirements of the
law has led to increased transparency, enhanced collaboration and information sharing – all
critical elements of success in addressing campus sexual misconduct and other forms of
violence. Years 2 & 3 have seen continued progress in creating and maintaining safe and
inclusive campus environments for students, faculty and staff. DHE has further solidified a
baseline reporting process and met the statutory expectations upon which this baseline was
built.
Each year since the inception of the law, the Department and its partners and
stakeholders have continued to enhance and streamline the overall implementation process.
DHE’s vision for Year 4 and beyond is to continue that progress with even more vigor by further
16 M.G.L. c. 6, § 168E(q)(v).
17 This includes included adding back in the “unknown“ party reporting line item, at the request of several
IHEs.

building upon and sharing lessons learned and best practices realized from campuses and other
stakeholders. IHEs will be required to submit their incident data according to these adjustments
through the Year 4 annual reporting process (the 2024 CSVP Annual Report), that will open by
October 1, 2024 and be due by December 1, 2024.
