ABOUT THE OFFICE OF GRANTS AND RESEARCH
The Office of Grants and Research (OGR) is a state agency that is part of the
Executive Office of Public Safety and Security (EOPSS). The agency promotes public
safety and security in Massachusetts communities through the management of grant
funds and research programs focused on crime prevention and intervention, traffic safety,
law enforcement and homeland security initiatives. OGR manages more than $279 million
in state and federal grants that are distributed to state, municipal, education, and nonprofit
agencies across the Commonwealth. It is also home to the Massachusetts Statistical
Analysis Center.
LEGISLATIVE LANGUAGE
Section 131J of Chapter 140 of Massachusetts General Laws (as amended by St.
2004, c. 170, §1 and St. 2018, c. 123, §13) requires the Secretary of Public Safety and
Security to establish minimum safety and quality standards, safe storage requirements,
education and safety training requirements, and law enforcement training on the
appropriate use of electronic control weapons (ECWs), which shall require that any ECW
purchased or used by a law enforcement or public safety official include a mechanism for
tracking the number of times the ECW has been fired. In October 2004, in response to
Chapter 170 of the Acts of 2004, EOPSS promulgated 501 CMR 8.00 et seq., regulations
governing the sale of ECWs in the Commonwealth and the training of law enforcement
personnel on the appropriate use of such weapons. The regulation was updated on
January 6, 2023 to reflect changes to Section 131J of Chapter 140 of the General Laws
and Chapter 253 of the Acts of 2020, An Act Relative to Criminal Justice, Equity, and
Accountability in Law Enforcement in the Commonwealth, the “police reform” law.
5

Section 2 of Chapter 170 of the Acts of 2004, further requires the Secretary of
Public Safety and Security to develop a uniform protocol directing state and municipal law
enforcement officers to collect data pursuant to the number of times the device or weapon
has been fired and the identifying characteristics, including the race and gender, of the
individuals who have been fired upon. The data are reported to EOPSS to be analyzed
and included in an annual report.

2022 REPORT HIGHLIGHTS
• At the end of 2022, there were 285 municipal and 13 non-municipal law enforcement
agencies in Massachusetts with ECWs, totaling 298 ECW agencies. Two agencies
acquired ECWs during 2022, representing a 0.7% increase in the total number of ECW
agencies from 2021.
• There were 1,111 ECW incidents, which is defined as any instance in which an officer
or group of officers issued an ECW warning and/or deployed ECWs. In 2022, 202
agencies (67.8%) reported an ECW incident.
• 32.2% of agencies reported no ECW incidents (96 agencies); 53% (158 agencies)
reported no ECW deployments.
• From 2021 to 2022, the number of ECW incidents increased by 1.9%. The number of
ECW agencies, trained officers, and ECW devices increased by 0.7%, 1.8%, and
25.5%, respectively.
• The ratio of agency-owned ECWs to ECW-trained officers in 2022 was 0.1.
• Of 1,202 ECW contacts, 98.2% were people. The remainder (n = 22) were animals.
Of the 1,180 human contacts, 91.9% were male, 50.4% were White, non-Hispanic,
and the average age was 34.3 years. The term ECW contact refers to an individual
officer’s deployment, warning, or display of an ECW towards a single subject.
• Officer(s) issued at least one ECW warning in 90.3% of the 1,180 human contacts;
of these contacts with warnings (1,066), 54.7% of contacts submitted to the warning
and no deployment was made.
• An ECW was deployed in under half (41.1%) of the 1,180 human contacts; subjects
submitted to deployments 69.1% of the time (335 submissions to 485 deployments).

INTRODUCTION
As required by the Legislature, this report summarizes data provided by
Massachusetts law enforcement agencies with ECWs1 for calendar year 2022. Agencies
with ECWs are required to complete annual reports on information related to: 1) the
number of sworn officers serving the agency; 2) the number of ECW-trained officers
serving the agency; 3) the number of ECWs owned by the agency; 4) the number of
officers carrying ECWs; 5) the number of total ECW-related incidents that occurred during
the reporting period; 6) general details about each incident (e.g., warnings, deployments,
submissions, etc.); and 7) demographic information of the subject involved in the incident.
Terms and definitions referenced in this report are provided in the appendix on page A21.
ECW INCIDENTS AND LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES
During 2022, two new law enforcement agencies began reporting use of ECWs,
raising the cumulative total to 298 ECW agencies in Massachusetts. Figure 1 (pg. 9)
illustrates the growth in municipal ECW reporting agencies from 2005 to 2022. The
greatest concentration of cities and towns that did not have ECWs in 2022 are in the
western region of the state, particularly Berkshire and Franklin counties.
In Massachusetts, there was a total of 1,111 ECW incidents2 reported in 2022.
202 agencies (67.8%) reported at least one ECW incident. The number of incidents
reported by each department ranged from zero (96 agencies) to 83 incidents (one

agency) (Appendix Tables 1-3, pgs. A1-A9). As shown in Figure 2, over three-quarters
(81.5%) of agencies reported five or fewer incidents. 18.5% of agencies reported more
than five incidents, including five agencies reporting 25 or more incidents. Those five
agencies accounted for 23.3% (259) of all ECW incidents in 2022.

CURRENT TRENDS
On the following page, Figure 4 and Table 1 illustrate the annual percentage
change in reported ECW incidents from 2018 to 2022. Overall, the number of ECW
incidents has decreased by 26.5% since 2018. ECW incidents increased by 1.9% from
2021 to 2022, ending the three-year trend of declining annual ECW incidents3.
As shown in Table 1 (pg. 11), the growth in the number of ECW agencies and ECW
trained officers has slowed over the five-year period. The number of sworn officers from
ECW agencies declined for the third year in a row. The number of agency owned ECW
devices rose sharply in 2022 after minimal increase in 2020 and 2021. In 2022, growth in
the number of ECW agencies, ECW trained officers, and agency-owned devices was

Year
During the five-year period from 2018 to 2022, the growth of agency-owned ECW
devices (45.7%) far surpassed that seen in ECW incidents (-26.5%), ECW agencies
(6%), sworn officers (1.4%), and ECW trained officers (12.5%). The ratio of ECW
incidents to ECW trained officers decreased over the last five years, from 0.15 in 2018
to 0.1 in 2022.

ECW CONTACTS
From January 1 through December 31, 2022, ECW agencies recorded 1,202 ECW
contacts.4 Of those contacts, 22 involved animals or fowl, such as dogs or turkeys. The
remaining 1,180 ECW contacts involved people. The vast majority (91.9%) of the 1,180
ECW human contacts involved male subjects (see Appendix Table 4, pg. A10). Over two-
thirds of contacts were with White subjects: Non-Hispanic (50.4%), Hispanic Ethnicity
(12.5%), Unknown Ethnicity (7.0%). Black subjects accounted for 22.6% of total human
contacts: Non-Hispanic (17.3%), Hispanic Ethnicity (1.7%), Unknown Ethnicity (3.6%).
Subjects with unknown race and ethnicity accounted for 1.5% of contacts and subjects of
Other Races5 made up 5.0% of contacts. Of all ECW human contacts, 19.6% involved
subjects of Hispanic Ethnicity.
The average age of contacts was 34.3 years, with nearly three-quarters of
contacts involving subjects between 20 and 44 years of age (74.9%). Subjects in the
two oldest age groups (60 - 64 years and 65+ years) represented the smallest
proportion of ECW contacts (2.5% and 1.4%, respectively).
4 ‘ECW Contact’ refers to an individual officer’s deployment, warning, or display of an ECW
towards a single subject. Multiple ECW contacts can occur during a single ECW incident, (e.g.,
an incident in which two officers each issue a warning and/or deploy an ECW at a subject is
considered two contacts and one incident). This section details ECW contacts between officers
and subjects.
5 ‘Other’ comprises the race categories of American Indian/Alaska Native, Asian, Native
Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander, Two or More Races, and Other (specified).
12

ECW WARNINGS AND SUBMISSIONS
Of the 1,180 ECW contacts with human subjects, 1,066 or 90.3% involved the
officer(s) issuing at least one ECW warning (verbal warning, laser warning, and/or
spark warning)6 in an attempt to gain the subject’s compliance. In contacts that involved
an ECW warning, officers issued a single type of warning in 39.7% of contacts, with a
verbal warning being the most common (390 of 423, 92.2%) (Table 2, pg. 14). The rate
of compliance for contacts with one warning, however, was the lowest for verbal warnings
(33.1%). Excluding spark warnings (n = 1), laser warnings had the highest rate of
compliance (43.8%), though the use of laser warnings only was rare (n = 32).
Over half of ECW contacts involved multiple warnings (60.2%). Of these, the verbal
and laser warning comprised the vast majority (589 of 643, 91.6%) and resulted in a
compliance rate of 46.2%. A combination of verbal and spark warnings had a compliance
rate of 66.7%, followed by a combination of all three ECW warnings with a 29.3%
compliance rate.
A smaller number of contacts (114 or 9.7%) received no warning prior to ECW
deployment. Agencies indicated that sudden actions by the subject (i.e., subjects
becoming combative during handcuffing) required immediate ECW deployment (probe
deployment, 5–second cycle, and/or stun deployment)7 and precluded an opportunity for
7 ECW Deployments:
Probe deployment: the act of firing two small dart-like probes from the ECW, which
attach to the subject. The device then delivers a 5-second electrical cycle, which can be
repeated as needed in order to incapacitate the subject to the point of submission.
5-second cycle: a five second electrical charge resulting from a probe deployment,
which can be repeated as needed.
Stun deployment: the act of bringing the ECW device into direct contact with the
subject’s skin or clothing in order to induce pain to the point of submission. Stuns can be
repeated as needed if the subject does not initially submit.
13

the officer to issue a warning. Additionally, incidents involving two or more officers may
result in one warning but more than one deployment. Thus, both contacts would indicate
a deployment, but only one would show a warning was given.

CONTACT CHARACTERISTICS
Table 3 (pg. 15) presents some demographic data on the ECW human contacts
for which subject characteristics are known. The data show officers’ use of warnings
and/or ECW deployments by subject gender, race, ethnicity, and age. A consistent
pattern is revealed across all of the subject groups: a) in more than half of contacts, the
officer(s) issues an ECW warning with no subsequent ECW deployment; b) in about 36%
of contacts, the officer(s) issued an ECW warning and an ECW deployment; and c) in
fewer than one in 10 contacts, the officer(s) deployed an ECW with no prior ECW warning.
Appendix Tables 4 and 5 (pg. A10 - A11) break down the data slightly differently,
looking at contacts with a warning or contacts with an ECW deployment by subject
14

gender, race/ethnicity, and age. The percentages are similar by gender and differ slightly
by race/ethnicity and age. Those in the Other Race, non- Hispanic Ethnicity category had
the highest proportion of contacts with warnings (100%), though the number of contacts
was low (n = 18). The next highest proportion of contacts with warnings was the Unknown
Race, Hispanic category (95.8%), followed by the Other Race, Hispanic category (95%).
Those in the Black, non-Hispanic Ethnicity category had the highest percentage of
contacts with an ECW deployment (53.8%) followed by the Black, Unknown Ethnicity
category (48.8%) and the White, Unknown Ethnicity category (48.2%).

Appendix Table 5 (pg. A11) shows that subjects in the age categories of Under 18
years and 18 - 19 years received the highest percent of contacts with a warning (95.1%
and 94.6%, respectively). Subjects under 18 years old had the smallest percentage of
contacts with an ECW deployment (26.8%). Subjects between the age of 60 and 64 had
the largest percentage of contacts with an ECW deployment (53.3%).
ECW DEPLOYMENTS
Of the 298 Massachusetts agencies with ECWs in 2022, 53% (158 agencies)
reported zero ECW deployments. The remaining 47% (140 agencies) reported between
one and 86 deployments, totaling 760 weapon (probe and/or stun) deployments. Of the
agencies with a deployment, over half (91 agencies, 65%) reported between one and
three ECW deployments. Figure 5 (pg. 17) displays the number of ECW deployments by
agency, excluding non-municipal agencies.
Appendix Tables 6 – 8 (pgs. A12 - A20) provide information on the type of
deployment by department, revealing a slightly higher overall usage of probe
deployments (386, 50.8%) compared to stun deployments, also known as a ‘drive stun’
(374, 49.2%). The range of probe deployments per department was more widely
dispersed (1 to 51) than stun deployments (1 to 35).
Figure 6 (pg. 17) is a density chart illustrating the number of reported ECW
incidents and deployments by agency. The majority of agencies are concentrated around
low numbers of ECW incidents and deployments (shown in red). In fact, 32.2% of
agencies reported no ECW incidents (96 agencies) and 53% reported no ECW
deployments (158 agencies).

Officers deployed ECWs in under half (41.1%) of the 1,180 human contacts. Table
4 shows that of the 485 incidents where an ECW was deployed, 49.7% involved the use
of only probe deployments (the firing of two small dart-like probes from the ECW, which
attach to the subject and can emit an electrical charge), 40.6% involved the use of only
stun deployments (bringing the ECW device into direct contact with the subject’s skin or
clothing), and 9.7% of the incidents involved a combination of probe and stun
deployments. Overall, subjects submitted to the deployments of an ECW 69.1% of the
time. Subjects submitted to individual stun deployments more often than individual probe
deployments (78.2% and 61.8%, respectively). Combined probe and stun deployments
had a submission rate of 68.1%.

TERMS AND DEFINITIONS
These terms and definitions are provided to law enforcement agencies on the ECW
reporting application where the report is submitted.
Electronic Control Weapon (ECW): A stun gun as defined in M.G.L. c. 140, § 121, or
any portable device or weapon, regardless of whether it passes an electrical shock by
means of a dart or projectile via a wire lead, from which an electrical current, impulse,
wave or beam that is designed to incapacitate temporarily by causing neuromuscular
incapacitation or pain so that an officer can regain and maintain control of the subject.
ECW Agency: A law enforcement agency in Massachusetts with electronic control
weapons.
ECW Contact: Each individual officer’s deployment, warning, or display of an ECW
towards a single subject. (Example: Four officers respond to one call and only one officer
issues a warning and a second officer deploys a weapon on a single subject. This would
be reported as one incident and two contacts.)
ECW Deployment:
Probe Deployment: The act of firing two small, dart-like probes from the ECW
that attach to the subject. The device then delivers a 5-second electrical cycle,
which can be repeated in order to incapacitate the subject to the point of
submission.
5-Second Cycle: A 5-second electrical charge resulting from a probe deployment,
which can be repeated.
Stun Deployment: The act of bringing the ECW device into direct contact with the
subject’s skin or clothing in order to induce pain to the point of submission. Stuns
can be repeated if the subject does not initially submit.
ECW Incident: An event in which an officer (or group of officers) issue a warning and/or
deploy an ECW towards a single subject. The following are the four types of reportable
ECW applications:
ECW Display: The ECW is removed from the holster and displayed in any manner
to the subject to gain a subject’s voluntary compliance without actual use of the
ECW.
ECW Arc Display: The ECW device is activated to demonstrate the device’s
electrical arcing to gain a subject’s voluntary compliance without actual use of the
ECW.
ECW Deployment/Probe Mode (Device Fired): The ECW is fired at the subject
with the intended effect of the two wired probes making separate contact with the
body to complete the electrical circuit causing neuromuscular incapacitation
A21

(NMI) of the subject.
ECW Deployment (Drive Stun): The ECW is activated and applied in direct
contact with the subject’s body causing localized pain and discomfort to that
immediate area of the body. This method will not normally immobilize a subject
unless the drive stun also completes the electrical circuit in conjunction with at
least one wired probe that remains connected between the subject and the ECW.
ECW Warning:
Laser Warning: A visual warning whereby an officer employs the laser function of
the ECW device to indicate that an ECW will be deployed.
Spark Warning: A visual warning whereby an officer employs a spark on a
handheld stun device in order to demonstrate its effectiveness.
Verbal/Visual Warning: Any spoken words or display of the ECW that would
indicate to a subject that an ECW may be used. This warning can include: 1) Any
direct wording to a subject indicating or implying that an ECW will be used.
(Example: Displaying an ECW and shouting “Stop!”), 2) Any indirect wording that
a subject may overhear indicating or implying that an ECW is about to be deployed.
(Example: A warning to other officers that an ECW is about to be deployed by
saying “Taser, Taser, Taser

The Research and Policy Analysis Division (RPAD) is a division within the Office
of Grants and Research (OGR), a state agency that is part of the Massachusetts
Executive Office of Public Safety and Security (EOPSS). The RPAD and its Statistical
Analysis Center use research and evaluation to promote public safety. RPAD works on a
number of projects including electronic control weapons reporting, provider sexual crime
report analysis, the collection of statewide county release data for recidivism, and the
development of criminal justice data standards.
ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
We are grateful for the 298 municipal and non-municipal law enforcement
agencies in Massachusetts that contribute the ECW data used for this report. We
appreciate the ongoing cooperation and support of agency officers, administrators, and
officials who ensure submission of the ECW information despite many competing
priorities.
