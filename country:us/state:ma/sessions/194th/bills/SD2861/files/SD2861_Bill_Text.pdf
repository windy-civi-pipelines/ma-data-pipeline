RE: EA report on plan for phasing out use of hotels and motels
Overview
By law passed by the General Court in 1983, the Emergency Assistance (EA) family shelter program has
provided temporary emergency shelter to eligible homeless families and pregnant women. This one-of-
a-kind program has contributed to Massachusetts having one of the lowest rates of unsheltered family
homelessness in the country. Through its history, the size of the EA system has expanded and contracted
to meet the changing demand for shelter services, driven by a variety of external factors affecting the
economy, housing market, and immigration system. Historically, during periods of acute demand, hotels
and motels have been used to add surge shelter capacity. Before the recent emergency, the use of hotels
in the EA shelter system peaked in 2014, when the system expanded to a caseload of 4,600 families,
over 1,500 of whom were sheltered in hotels across the state.
Beginning in 2022, the Commonwealth saw an unprecedented demand for shelter due to the housing
crisis, failed federal immigration policy and a lack of safeguards to control the expansion of the shelter
system. In response, the Baker Administration began expanding the shelter system across multiple sites,
including hotels and motels. By July 2023, as many as 40 families per day, or 1,000 new families per
month, were seeking EA shelter. In August 2023, Governor Healey declared a state of emergency,
activated the National Guard to support supplemental shelters, and in November 2023, instituted major
policy reforms to end shelter expansion and curb costs. This included, for the first time in the history of
the EA program, setting a maximum capacity for the EA system (7,500 families) and creating a waitlist
and prioritization process for eligible families seeking shelter placement.
In the months that followed, the Executive Office of Housing and Livable Communities (EOHLC)
reduced the number of hotels and motels used for shelter through a process of site consolidation.
Alongside this process, EOHLC brought contracted shelter service providers on site to all hotel shelters
with case management and housing search services for EA families. Less than a year after Governor
Healey instituted the cap, EOHLC managed to reduce the number of hotels and motels used for EA
shelter from 100 to 66.
Governor Healey then announced her intent to phase out the use of hotel shelters by the end of 2025. By
November 2024, the EA shelter system had been further reduced to 57 hotels, which sheltered nearly
half (46%) of the families it served. As of April 30, 2025, the EA shelter system will have 32 remaining
hotels, which shelter approximately 25% of the families served by the system. To close all hotels by the
end of 2025, EA providers, in partnership with EOHLC, will work to:
2

1. Support as many families as possible to exit from hotels into safe and stable housing before each
scheduled closure date;
2. Transfer any families unable to exit shelter prior to closure to appropriate shelter placements
within the EA system; and
3. Provide families and communities ample notice and resources ahead of planned closures.
EOHLC will close hotels across five phases. EOHLC will make efforts to move more quickly in closing
hotels to achieve cost savings, while mitigating disruption to families and communities.
The successful reduction in the number of hotel shelters has coincided with reductions in caseload and
costs across the shelter system due to reforms enacted by Governor Healey. In April 2025, the number of
families in shelter dropped below 5,000 for the first time since July 2023. Since the start of 2025, double
the number of families have exited shelter (approximately 2,500) than have entered shelter
(approximately 1,100). Approximately 85 percent of families seeking shelter are longtime Massachusetts
families.
Hotel Closure Plan
This chart below compares the originally forecasted hotel closure plan with actual hotel ramp-down
progress. As of April 30, 2025, we are ahead of schedule, with 32 hotels utilized for EA shelter. The
green line shows real-time progress based on provider coordination, early closure acceleration, and
success with supporting families to exit from shelter.

Hotel Closure Phases
Closures are currently being implemented across five structured phases:
• Phase 1: 7 closed by February 28, 2024
• Phase 2: 18 closed by April 30, 2025
• Phase 3: 18 hotels to close by June 30, 2025
• Phase 4: 7 hotels to close by August 31, 2025
• Phase 5: 7 hotels to close by December 31, 2025
The following guardrails are in place to ensure a smoother hotel closure process, which have been
communicated to both staff and providers:
• EOHLC will not place new families in hotel sites ahead of a planned hotel site closure, with
option for placement team to make limited exceptions to meet specific family needs.
• EOHLC and EA providers prioritize finding stable housing options for families instead of
transferring them to alternative shelter sites.

Hotel Closure Prioritization Framework
• Prioritize closure of hotels lacking family-oriented spaces or transportation access
• Prioritize closure of higher-cost hotels with higher relative room rates
• Align closures with provider or vendor contract end dates when feasible
• Accelerate closure of any hotels with higher vacancy rates
• Provide families with a clear exit date through written materials, presentations, and case
management
• Support families with robust rehousing and case management prior to site closure
• Collaborate with providers and consider community impacts when setting closure dates
Communication Protocols and Family Support
Communication protocols are structured to ensure all stakeholders are informed and prepared ahead of a
planned hotel shelter closure. This includes families, municipal and legislative partners, EA providers,
community-based organizations, local schools, local boards of health, and other external partners.
EOHLC shares written materials with families to support their transition out of the hotel (see Figure 1).

Figure 1. Family materials shared include flyer, written letter, & exit plan presentation
When updates to closure timelines occur, EOHLC follows a consistent communication flow (see Figure
2) to maintain alignment and transparency. We also ensure that:
• In-person family town hall meetings are scheduled with EOHLC staff and provider case
managers to discuss any updates and next steps.
• Families receive tailored communication materials, including a flyer, formal letter, and
presentation (see Figure 1).
• Individual family meetings are conducted to support planning and transition.
Hotel Closure Notification – Streamlined Communications
Figure 2 illustrates the simplified, four-step communication approach used to guide all hotel closure
efforts. It ensures internal alignment, timely stakeholder notification, and clear, coordinated support for
families throughout the transition process.

Estimated Savings Due to Hotel Closures
Closing hotel shelters by the end of December 2025 is a key component of returning the EA system to
fiscal sustainability. Hotels and motels are the most expensive type of shelter in the EA system. The cost
for hotels includes hotel rooms, food, transportation, and associated shelter services including direct
care, case management, and housing search. The cost for hotels does not include post-shelter exit
stabilization services and exit-related costs. Based on FY25 costs, EOHLC projects ~$410 million in
annualized savings to the Commonwealth when hotels are no longer a part of the EA system portfolio, or
a projected cost savings of ~$34 million/month.
