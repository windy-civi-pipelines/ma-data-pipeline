please submit a plan of correction within 10 working days of receipt of this notice which includes:
1. Specific corrective steps to be taken

SECTION 5: Observations and Recommendations
1. The inmate population was 108 at the time of inspection.
2. The Day Room bathroom and shower area was observed to be poorly maintained resulting in unsanitary
conditions. The EHRS is concerned with the increased risk of disease transmission with the high number of
inmates being exposed to such unsanitary conditions. The EHRS recommends ensuring all bathroom and shower
areas are finished with smooth and easily cleanable surfaces as well as developing a higher frequency shower
cleaning policy.
