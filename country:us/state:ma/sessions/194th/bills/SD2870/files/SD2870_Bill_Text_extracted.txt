beds per home, accommodating a maximum of 36 Veterans per floor.
• Most rooms have single occupancy with private baths, but two rooms on each floor are
larger than a standard room so that they can function as a double, a couple’s room, or a
bariatric room.
The second floor of the facility is specifically designed for dementia (memory)
o
care.
The first floor and basement will provide both resident services and support
o
facilities, including community room, hobby room, chapel, café, store, dental

since its initiation.
• A groundbreaking ceremony occurred in August 2023 with many State and Federal
dignitaries including Governor Healey, Secretary Santiago and Congressman Neal in
attendance.

steel beam installed in November 2024.

ductwork and plumbing—has begun on several levels.
• DCAMM, Payette Architecture, Commodore|Walsh, and the Home representatives have
been meeting regularly with EOTSS (Executive Office of Technical Support Services), to
develop plans for IT infrastructure that will support the Commonwealth’s IT Network but
also integrate the new Electronic Medical Record (EMR) system of the Home.
• The construction is considered approximately 30% complete.
(iii) A summary of the total and major costs of the project as originally estimated and as
currently expended or currently estimated to be expended:
• Project Cost: $405,334,600

$81M in reimbursement in support of this project.
• There is approximately $184M available in VA reimbursement to meet the 65% criteria
for total VA project reimbursement.

project:
