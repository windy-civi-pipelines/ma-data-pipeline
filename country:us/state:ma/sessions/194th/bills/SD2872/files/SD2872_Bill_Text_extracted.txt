6 of 79
116 Security Number or an Individual Taxpayer Identification Number, if but for section 32(m) of
117 the Code, the taxpayer would be eligible to claim the credit. In the case of a taxpayer with a
118 qualifying child for the Earned Income Tax Credit but who is ineligible for a Social Security
119 Number or Individual Taxpayer Identification Number, the DOR shall issue said child a tax
120 identification number.
121 SECTION 14. Said paragraph (1) of said subsection (h) of said section 6 of said chapter
122 62, as so amended, is hereby further amended by inserting, in line 252 after the word “year” the

124 section 32(b) of the Code, above three children, the percent of the federal credit shall increase by
125 5 percentage points per qualifying child.
126 SECTION 15: Said subsection (h) of said section 6 of said chapter 62, as so amended, is
127 hereby further amended by inserting the following paragraph (3): For the purposes of this
128 subsection, an individual who has attained 18 or, if the individual is married, either spouse has
129 attained 18 before the close of the taxable year, shall be deemed to have satisfied all eligibility
130 requirements under subsection (c)(1)(A)(ii)(II) of section 32 of the Code.
131 SECTION 16. Section 6 of said chapter 62, as most recently amended by section 21 of
132 chapter 40 of the acts of 2023, is hereby further amended by striking out subsection (x) and
133 inserting in place thereof the following subsection:-
134 (x) (1) For the purposes of this subsection, "maintains a household'' shall have the same
135 meaning as in section 21 of the Code. With respect to a taxpayer who is a non-resident for part of
136 the taxable year, the credit shall be further limited to the amount of allowable credit multiplied
137 by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of days in the taxable year the person
7 of 79
138 resided in the commonwealth and the denominator of which shall be the number of days in the
139 taxable year. A taxpayer who maintains a household that includes as a member at least 1
140 individual: (i) who qualifies for exemption as a dependent under section 151 of the Code; or (ii)
141 who is a qualifying individual as defined in said section 21 of the Code; or (iii) who (A) is not
142 less than 65 years of age or is disabled and (B) qualifies as a dependent under section 152 of the
143 Code, shall be allowed a credit in an amount equal to $600 for each such dependent or qualifying
144 individual with respect to the taxpayer; provided, however, that if the taxpayer is married at the
145 close of the taxable year, the credit provided in this subsection shall be allowed if: (a) the
146 taxpayer and the taxpayer's spouse file a joint return for the taxable year; or (b) the taxpayer
147 qualifies as a head of household under section 2(b) of the Code. For each taxable year, the
148 commissioner shall increase the amount of the credit for each eligible dependent or qualifying
149 individual as provided by this subsection by an amount equal to such credit multiplied by the
150 cost-of-living adjustment for the calendar year in which such taxable year begins. A person who
151 is a non-resident for the entire taxable year shall not qualify for the credit. If the amount of the
152 credit allowed under this subsection exceeds the taxpayer's tax liability, the commissioner shall
153 treat the excess as an overpayment and shall pay the taxpayer the entire amount of the excess
154 without interest.
155 (2) Upon request by a taxpayer eligible for the Child and Family Tax Credit but ineligible
156 for a Social Security Number or Individual Taxpayer Identification Number, the DOR shall issue
157 said taxpayer a tax identification number to enable the taxpayer to claim the credit.
158 (3) The commissioner may establish a process to allow taxpayers to elect to receive one
159 or more advance payments of the credit under this subsection. The amount of advance payments
160 must be based on the taxpayer and commissioner’s estimate of the amount of credit for which the
8 of 79
161 taxpayer would be eligible in the taxable year beginning in the calendar year in which the
162 payments were made. The commissioner shall not distribute advance payments to a taxpayer
163 who does not elect to receive advance payments. The amount of a taxpayer’s credit under this
164 subsection for the taxable year is reduced by the amount of advance payments received by the
165 taxpayer in the calendar year during which the taxable year began.
166 SECTION 17. In order to ensure the widest possible dissemination of state and federal
167 tax credits that are aimed to reduce poverty, the department shall: (i) include multilingual
168 information by video and text in its website about state and federal tax credits, free tax
169 preparation services, and low-income taxpayer clinics; (ii) provide all employers with a
170 multilingual poster and a notice that sets forth the rights under this chapter; (iii) require that all
171 employers doing business in the commonwealth post information about tax credits in a
172 conspicuous location at the place of employment; (iv) coordinate a notification system by the
173 commonwealth about tax credit to applicants for and recipients of unemployment insurance
174 under chapter 151A, applicants for and recipients of transitional assistance benefits, including
175 food stamps, under chapter 18, and to recipients of subsidized health insurance under chapter
176 118E; and (v) collaborate with labor organizations, chambers of commerce, municipalities,
177 community-based organizations, and taxpayer advocates to disseminate information about tax
178 credits. The multilingual poster and notice requirement in clause (i) shall comply with the
179 requirements for employer’s unemployment notices under clauses (i) and (iii) of subsection (d)
180 of section 62A of chapter 151A.

185 responsibility of the department but has transitioned from the custody, care or responsibility of
186 the department any time between the ages of 18 and 23. Should such an individual at any time
187 return to the custody, care, or responsibility of the department, that individual’s monthly stipend
188 will be put on hold until such time as the individual again transitions from the custody, care or
189 responsibility of the department; provided, however, that no individual is eligible for more than
190 60 total monthly payments of this stipend during the individual’s lifetime.
191 (b) Notwithstanding any general or special law to the contrary, this stipend shall not be

205 department.
206 (e) The department shall take steps to notify eligible former foster care youth of the
207 existence and availability of this cash stipend and shall publish data as to the number of eligible
208 young adults receiving this cash stipend.

1546 EOHHS shall submit to the house and senate committees on ways and means a request for an
1547 additional appropriation to fully fund the grant.
75 of 79
1548 (c) EOHHS shall develop and administer the fund to support community-driven, place-
1549 based strategies aimed at reducing poverty. The purpose of the fund is to (i) reduce poverty and
1550 expand opportunity for people with low incomes, (ii) increase community health, well-being and
1551 safety, (iii) provide “cradle to career” access to high-quality education, training and care, (iv)
1552 connect residents to quality jobs and in-demand occupations, (v) enable family-sustaining
1553 income and access to quality early education and care, affordable housing, and health care,
1554 including reproductive, maternal, behavioral, and mental health care, (vi) provide high-quality
1555 support for people with disabilities, families involved with the child welfare system, and justice-
1556 involved youth and adults, (vii) connect individuals and families to appropriate benefits
1557 programs; and (viii) leverage federal, local and private funding for communities. The fund shall
1558 ensure that a comprehensive approach to reducing poverty, including childhood and
1559 intergenerational poverty, is applied across multiple sectors and systems, and is informed by
1560 data, evidence, research and best practices.
1561 (d) Grantees must be located in eligible communities, which are municipalities, or
1562 geographic regions that have a significant level of residents living in poverty, as determined by
1563 the executive office of health and human services. Eligible grantees shall include community-
1564 based nonprofit organizations, municipalities, or school districts, and proposals must include
1565 partnerships between at least these three entities.
1566 (e) Grants shall be provided in three tracks: (i) partnership development grants, which
1567 shall establish the foundation for proposed place-based strategy through activities that include
1568 convening partners, activating and engaging community leaders, and developing a formal
1569 partnership structure to conduct a shared vision for their community’s success; (ii) plan
1570 development grants, which will use the formal partnership structure to conduct community asset
76 of 79
1571 mapping and needs assessment, and engage in participatory planning processes with community
1572 residents to develop comprehensive action plans to increase economic mobility and significantly
1573 reduce poverty; and (iii) implementation grants, which will launch approved action plans,
1574 leverage additional funding streams, conduct progress monitoring and continuous quality
1575 improvement, and adopt norms and structures for ongoing community leadership and
1576 implementation of the action plan.
1577 (f) EOHHS shall develop a transparent and competitive process for the award of the fund.
1578 The process shall include an annual request for applications, widely disseminated through
1579 appropriate channels in at least the top five spoken languages in the commonwealth, and EOHHS

1581 access to funding opportunities. EOHHS shall develop a transparent and accountable process for
1582 reviewing applications that must include an interdisciplinary panel of reviewers, including

1593 services for special populations such as children and adults with disabilities, the LGBTQ+
77 of 79
1594 community, veterans, elders, and youth aging out of foster care. At least 25% of the panel shall
1595 be composed of people with lived experience of poverty.
1596 Priority shall be given to eligible communities that have experienced long-term economic
1597 distress, have demonstrated a commitment to cross-sector collaboration and partnerships, and
1598 incorporate an equity lens as well as the engagement of people with lived experience in their
1599 proposal.
1600 Finalist applicants may be subject to site visits or interviews to assess readiness and
1601 community involvement.
1602 (g) Grantees shall be required to identify baseline and performance targets aligned with
1603 metrics determined by EOHHS. Performance targets must be aligned with at least the following
1604 general indicators of community well-being: poverty reduction, economic security, improved
1605 education outcomes, increased health outcomes, and safe and thriving communities.
1606 (h) EOHHS shall commission a third-party evaluator to conduct biennial assessments of
1607 the fund’s effectiveness and use the findings to inform future funding allocations and policy
1608 improvements.
1609 (g) The General Court shall appropriate $20 million annually to the fund. EOHHS may
1610 accept and expend federal, state and private funds to supplement the annual appropriation. Funds
1611 from this item may be used to provide administrative support to grantees, including technical
1612 assistance, capacity building, and program evaluation. Grantees shall receive support including
1613 but not limited to training from experts on best practices in identifying inequities, prioritizing
1614 local needs, and making data-driven decisions.
78 of 79
1615 (h) Annually, not later than October 1, EOHHS shall report to the governor, the clerks of
1616 the house of representatives and the senate, and the house and senate committees on ways and
1617 means on the fund’s activities. The report shall include the source and amount of funds received,
1618 the expenditures made from the fund, the anticipated funding obligation for the next fiscal year,
1619 recipients of grant funding, size of awarded grants by recipient, summaries of funded projects,
1620 performance data, challenges, and best practices. The report shall be publicly available online.

6 of 79

116 Security Number or an Individual Taxpayer Identification Number, if but for section 32(m) of
117 the Code, the taxpayer would be eligible to claim the credit. In the case of a taxpayer with a
118 qualifying child for the Earned Income Tax Credit but who is ineligible for a Social Security
119 Number or Individual Taxpayer Identification Number, the DOR shall issue said child a tax
120 identification number.
121 SECTION 14. Said paragraph (1) of said subsection (h) of said section 6 of said chapter
122 62, as so amended, is hereby further amended by inserting, in line 252 after the word “year” the
123 following words: -provided however that for each additional qualifying child, as defined in
124 section 32(b) of the Code, above three children, the percent of the federal credit shall increase by
125 5 percentage points per qualifying child.
126 SECTION 15: Said subsection (h) of said section 6 of said chapter 62, as so amended, is
127 hereby further amended by inserting the following paragraph (3): For the purposes of this
128 subsection, an individual who has attained 18 or, if the individual is married, either spouse has
129 attained 18 before the close of the taxable year, shall be deemed to have satisfied all eligibility
130 requirements under subsection (c)(1)(A)(ii)(II) of section 32 of the Code.
131 SECTION 16. Section 6 of said chapter 62, as most recently amended by section 21 of
132 chapter 40 of the acts of 2023, is hereby further amended by striking out subsection (x) and
133 inserting in place thereof the following subsection:-
134 (x) (1) For the purposes of this subsection, "maintains a household'' shall have the same
135 meaning as in section 21 of the Code. With respect to a taxpayer who is a non-resident for part of
136 the taxable year, the credit shall be further limited to the amount of allowable credit multiplied
137 by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of days in the taxable year the person
7 of 79

138 resided in the commonwealth and the denominator of which shall be the number of days in the
139 taxable year. A taxpayer who maintains a household that includes as a member at least 1
140 individual: (i) who qualifies for exemption as a dependent under section 151 of the Code; or (ii)
141 who is a qualifying individual as defined in said section 21 of the Code; or (iii) who (A) is not
142 less than 65 years of age or is disabled and (B) qualifies as a dependent under section 152 of the
143 Code, shall be allowed a credit in an amount equal to $600 for each such dependent or qualifying
144 individual with respect to the taxpayer; provided, however, that if the taxpayer is married at the
145 close of the taxable year, the credit provided in this subsection shall be allowed if: (a) the
146 taxpayer and the taxpayer's spouse file a joint return for the taxable year; or (b) the taxpayer
147 qualifies as a head of household under section 2(b) of the Code. For each taxable year, the
148 commissioner shall increase the amount of the credit for each eligible dependent or qualifying
149 individual as provided by this subsection by an amount equal to such credit multiplied by the
150 cost-of-living adjustment for the calendar year in which such taxable year begins. A person who
151 is a non-resident for the entire taxable year shall not qualify for the credit. If the amount of the
152 credit allowed under this subsection exceeds the taxpayer's tax liability, the commissioner shall
153 treat the excess as an overpayment and shall pay the taxpayer the entire amount of the excess
154 without interest.
155 (2) Upon request by a taxpayer eligible for the Child and Family Tax Credit but ineligible
156 for a Social Security Number or Individual Taxpayer Identification Number, the DOR shall issue
157 said taxpayer a tax identification number to enable the taxpayer to claim the credit.
158 (3) The commissioner may establish a process to allow taxpayers to elect to receive one
159 or more advance payments of the credit under this subsection. The amount of advance payments
160 must be based on the taxpayer and commissioner’s estimate of the amount of credit for which the
8 of 79

161 taxpayer would be eligible in the taxable year beginning in the calendar year in which the
162 payments were made. The commissioner shall not distribute advance payments to a taxpayer
163 who does not elect to receive advance payments. The amount of a taxpayer’s credit under this
164 subsection for the taxable year is reduced by the amount of advance payments received by the
165 taxpayer in the calendar year during which the taxable year began.
166 SECTION 17. In order to ensure the widest possible dissemination of state and federal
167 tax credits that are aimed to reduce poverty, the department shall: (i) include multilingual
168 information by video and text in its website about state and federal tax credits, free tax
169 preparation services, and low-income taxpayer clinics; (ii) provide all employers with a
170 multilingual poster and a notice that sets forth the rights under this chapter; (iii) require that all
171 employers doing business in the commonwealth post information about tax credits in a
172 conspicuous location at the place of employment; (iv) coordinate a notification system by the
173 commonwealth about tax credit to applicants for and recipients of unemployment insurance
174 under chapter 151A, applicants for and recipients of transitional assistance benefits, including
175 food stamps, under chapter 18, and to recipients of subsidized health insurance under chapter
176 118E; and (v) collaborate with labor organizations, chambers of commerce, municipalities,
177 community-based organizations, and taxpayer advocates to disseminate information about tax
178 credits. The multilingual poster and notice requirement in clause (i) shall comply with the
179 requirements for employer’s unemployment notices under clauses (i) and (iii) of subsection (d)
180 of section 62A of chapter 151A.
181 SECTION 18. Chapter 119 of the General Laws, as appearing in the 2022 Official
182 Edition, is hereby amended by inserting after section 23C the following section:-

185 responsibility of the department but has transitioned from the custody, care or responsibility of
186 the department any time between the ages of 18 and 23. Should such an individual at any time
187 return to the custody, care, or responsibility of the department, that individual’s monthly stipend
188 will be put on hold until such time as the individual again transitions from the custody, care or
189 responsibility of the department; provided, however, that no individual is eligible for more than
190 60 total monthly payments of this stipend during the individual’s lifetime.
191 (b) Notwithstanding any general or special law to the contrary, this stipend shall not be
192 considered income for purposes of determining eligibility for any other benefit provided by the
193 Commonwealth.
194 (c) The department shall inform all eligible foster care youth, in person and by writing,
195 and their counsel as appointed under section 29 of chapter 119, of the availability of this cash
196 stipend within 30 days of the youth attaining the age of 17 years and 6 months. The department
197 shall provide appropriate case management to support eligible youth within the department’s
198 custody, care, or responsibility in applying for this cash stipend and other support needed to
199 assist the youth in making the transition from foster care to a successful adulthood, including
200 setting up a personal bank account where this cash stipend may be deposited, making the youth
201 aware of other state benefits for which the youth may be eligible, and connecting youth to
202 financial literacy education or training.
10 of 79

203 (d) The department shall not terminate or suspend the payment of this cash stipend for
204 any reason other than the return of the individual to the custody, care, or responsibility of the
205 department.
206 (e) The department shall take steps to notify eligible former foster care youth of the
207 existence and availability of this cash stipend and shall publish data as to the number of eligible
208 young adults receiving this cash stipend.

220 of an employee or multiple, similarly situated employees. If the attorney general prevails in such
221 an action, the employee or employees on whose behalf the attorney general brought the civil
222 action shall be awarded treble damages, for any lost wages and other benefits, and the attorney
223 general shall also be awarded the costs of the litigation and reasonable attorneys’ fees.

1546 EOHHS shall submit to the house and senate committees on ways and means a request for an
1547 additional appropriation to fully fund the grant.
75 of 79

1548 (c) EOHHS shall develop and administer the fund to support community-driven, place-
1549 based strategies aimed at reducing poverty. The purpose of the fund is to (i) reduce poverty and
1550 expand opportunity for people with low incomes, (ii) increase community health, well-being and
1551 safety, (iii) provide “cradle to career” access to high-quality education, training and care, (iv)
1552 connect residents to quality jobs and in-demand occupations, (v) enable family-sustaining
1553 income and access to quality early education and care, affordable housing, and health care,

1555 support for people with disabilities, families involved with the child welfare system, and justice-
1556 involved youth and adults, (vii) connect individuals and families to appropriate benefits
1557 programs; and (viii) leverage federal, local and private funding for communities. The fund shall
1558 ensure that a comprehensive approach to reducing poverty, including childhood and
1559 intergenerational poverty, is applied across multiple sectors and systems, and is informed by
1560 data, evidence, research and best practices.
1561 (d) Grantees must be located in eligible communities, which are municipalities, or
1562 geographic regions that have a significant level of residents living in poverty, as determined by
1563 the executive office of health and human services. Eligible grantees shall include community-
1564 based nonprofit organizations, municipalities, or school districts, and proposals must include
1565 partnerships between at least these three entities.
1566 (e) Grants shall be provided in three tracks: (i) partnership development grants, which
1567 shall establish the foundation for proposed place-based strategy through activities that include
1568 convening partners, activating and engaging community leaders, and developing a formal
1569 partnership structure to conduct a shared vision for their community’s success; (ii) plan
1570 development grants, which will use the formal partnership structure to conduct community asset
76 of 79

1571 mapping and needs assessment, and engage in participatory planning processes with community
1572 residents to develop comprehensive action plans to increase economic mobility and significantly
1573 reduce poverty; and (iii) implementation grants, which will launch approved action plans,
1574 leverage additional funding streams, conduct progress monitoring and continuous quality
1575 improvement, and adopt norms and structures for ongoing community leadership and
1576 implementation of the action plan.
1577 (f) EOHHS shall develop a transparent and competitive process for the award of the fund.
1578 The process shall include an annual request for applications, widely disseminated through

77 of 79

1594 community, veterans, elders, and youth aging out of foster care. At least 25% of the panel shall
1595 be composed of people with lived experience of poverty.
1596 Priority shall be given to eligible communities that have experienced long-term economic
1597 distress, have demonstrated a commitment to cross-sector collaboration and partnerships, and
1598 incorporate an equity lens as well as the engagement of people with lived experience in their
1599 proposal.
1600 Finalist applicants may be subject to site visits or interviews to assess readiness and
1601 community involvement.
1602 (g) Grantees shall be required to identify baseline and performance targets aligned with
1603 metrics determined by EOHHS. Performance targets must be aligned with at least the following
1604 general indicators of community well-being: poverty reduction, economic security, improved
1605 education outcomes, increased health outcomes, and safe and thriving communities.
1606 (h) EOHHS shall commission a third-party evaluator to conduct biennial assessments of
1607 the fund’s effectiveness and use the findings to inform future funding allocations and policy
1608 improvements.
1609 (g) The General Court shall appropriate $20 million annually to the fund. EOHHS may
1610 accept and expend federal, state and private funds to supplement the annual appropriation. Funds
1611 from this item may be used to provide administrative support to grantees, including technical
1612 assistance, capacity building, and program evaluation. Grantees shall receive support including
1613 but not limited to training from experts on best practices in identifying inequities, prioritizing
1614 local needs, and making data-driven decisions.
78 of 79

1615 (h) Annually, not later than October 1, EOHHS shall report to the governor, the clerks of
1616 the house of representatives and the senate, and the house and senate committees on ways and
1617 means on the fund’s activities. The report shall include the source and amount of funds received,
1618 the expenditures made from the fund, the anticipated funding obligation for the next fiscal year,
1619 recipients of grant funding, size of awarded grants by recipient, summaries of funded projects,
1620 performance data, challenges, and best practices. The report shall be publicly available online.
