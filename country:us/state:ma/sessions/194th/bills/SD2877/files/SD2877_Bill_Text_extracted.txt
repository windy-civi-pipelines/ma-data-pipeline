provided further, that the department shall submit quarterly reports to the house and senate committees
on ways and means detailing the: (1) number of families who applied for assistance; (2) number of

and (5) number of families falling into each income category.

Applications
Households who applied for assistance 43,420

appears artificially low for this reason as a household may apply and have their application timed out for
missing documentation (for example) but later reapply and be approved.
Households may be approved for assistance more than once, but within the same quarter, this is rare.
Any household who was approved more than once in a quarter is counted more than once.
“Households who applied for assistance” includes all incoming applications. “Households approved for
assistance” and all data in “Financial Assistance Awarded” includes only applications funded by RAFT and
not any applications funded by reallocated federal Emergency Rental Assistance dollars.
