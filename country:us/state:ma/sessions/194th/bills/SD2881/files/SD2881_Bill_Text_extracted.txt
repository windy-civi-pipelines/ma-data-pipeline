Dear Chairs Rodrigues, Michlewitz, Friedman, and Lawn,
In July 2019, MassHealth received the authority to directly negotiate with drug manufacturers for
supplemental rebate agreements through Section 46 of Chapter 41 of the Acts of 2019 (the Fiscal Year
2020 budget), codified in Chapter 118E, Section 12A of the Massachusetts General Laws. This authority
has dramatically increased the pace at which MassHealth can enter into these agreements. As of July 1,
2024, MassHealth has active agreements on supplemental rebate contracts with 27 manufacturers for 72
drugs with a total annual incremental savings of approximately $450M. The 27 manufacturers are listed in
the table below.1
Contracts with seven manufacturers (covering 10 drugs) qualify as value-based payment (VBP)
agreements. These agreements tie rebate amount to outcomes data, including efficacy data and utilization
data, or use alternative payment methodologies. For instance, under certain VBP agreements, if a drug is
ineffective or if extended therapy is required, MassHealth may receive a portion or all of its payment
back. This remains an exciting development, as it allows drug manufacturers to stand behind their
products and be financially responsible for clinical outcomes.
1 As a reminder, there were agreements with 21 manufacturers for 64 drugs in FY23 (reported on October
2023) with a total annual incremental savings of approximately $402M. Compared to the last report, there
has been an increase in the number of contracts, as well as additional savings for existing contracts based
on increased utilization.
The table below details agreements finalized through direct negotiations to date.
