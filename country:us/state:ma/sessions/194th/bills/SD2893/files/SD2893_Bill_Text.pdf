LETTER FROM THE COMMISSIONER
Dear Committee Members:
I am pleased to submit this evaluation report to members of the Legislative Committees on
the SUCCESS program for FY23.
This report details the progress made in implementing the program, including the criteria
used to distribute funds, the approval process for campus use of funds, and the breakout of
services offered and spending activity by campus. Also detailed here are the target student
populations and actual participant demographics for those served in the program’s first two
years. Campus programs were scaled up in fiscal years 2021 and 2022, and the first full
implementation year was FY2023. During that time, the number of students served by
SUCCESS nearly doubled, from 4,415 students in fall 2021 to an estimated 8,657 students in
fall 2023.
An evaluation section of the report details the metrics used to evaluate SUCCESS, and we
look forward to sharing outcomes in future reports.
On behalf of the Department, the community colleges, and the thousands of students
benefitting from SUCCESS, thank you for your support for this program. Questions about this
report may be directed to Alex Demou, the Department of Higher Education’s Director of
Legislative and Trustee Relations at ademou@dhe.mass.edu.
Sincerely,
Noe Ortega
Commissioner of Higher Education

PROGRAM OVERVIEW
SUCCESS was created in fiscal year (FY) 2021 specifically for Massachusetts public
community colleges to invest in wraparound supports and services using models proven to
strengthen outcomes for students facing systemic barriers. Supports and services are those,
such as individualized academic advising, coaching, and mentoring, proven from federal
TRIO and similar programs to demonstrably improve student outcomes. SUCCESS is
currently focused on serving matriculated, degree and/or certificate-seeking students.
SUCCESS dollars are not meant for experimenting; they fund proven practices that support
students who have been historically underserved by higher education. Campuses were asked
to identify existing successful practices to grow or adopt. Informed by proven programs like
TRIO and CUNY ASAP, each SUCCESS program is somewhat different, depending on the
needs of each college’s students. What all SUCCESS programs have in common is funding
to hire dedicated staff to provide the extra support that underserved students often need
(e.g., SUCCESS advisors, coaches, peer mentors). As outlined in the SUCCESS Fund
Coordinating Committee Charter, each college’s SUCCESS Fund project is expected to do
the following:
i. Expand/scale up existing student support services that are proven effective.
ii. Serve a specific cohort of students.
iii. Show significant, demonstrable student success outcome improvement (e.g.,
retention, graduation, transfer) in the targeted cohort population.
SUCCESS is a highly collaborative effort with oversight and participation currently from
the following cross-sectional teams:

4
• SUCCESS Leadership Team: Meets monthly and includes representatives from
the Massachusetts Department of Higher Education (DHE), Massachusetts
Association of Community Colleges (MACC), and college leadership. Provides
overall stewardship of the initiative.
• SUCCESS Coordinating Committee: Meets monthly and includes
representation from the DHE and MACC, and all SUCCESS directors with a
focus on identifying lessons learned and supporting best practices as well as
tracking program activities and outcomes.
• SUCCESS Program Administrators: Meets monthly and includes
representatives from MACC and SUCCESS program staff from all 15
community colleges to provide an opportunity for cross-communication and
learning about SUCCESS day-to-day operations.
• SUCCESS Data Professionals Forum (DPF): Meets quarterly and includes
representation from the DHE, MACC, IR/IE units, and college SUCCESS
program staff. The purpose of the DPF is to strengthen the data and
assessment processes tied to the initiative by 1) facilitating communication on
technical aspects of working with SUCCESS data (e.g., HEIRS data dictionary
field definitions and file submission protocols); 2) forming an opportunity for
individuals with focused responsibility for SUCCESS data-related work at each
college to weigh in on pertinent issues; 3) creating a space to advance common
standards for and highlight institutional research and assessment work on
SUCCESS that is taking place at each of the colleges (e.g., analysis of data on
college-specific outcomes for SUCCESS); and 4) fostering a support network
for discussion of data-related challenges and sharing of best practices and
proven strategies.

TARGET POPULATIONS
The legislation that provides the funding for SUCCESS places a special emphasis on
supporting minoritized students, economically disadvantaged students, first-generation
college students, students with disabilities, and LGBTQIA+ students.
Community Colleges engage those students in a variety of ways. Supports and services are
those such as individualized academic advising, coaching, and mentoring, proven from
federal TRIO and similar programs to demonstrably improve student outcomes. SUCCESS
programs serve both part-time and full-time degree and/or certificate-seeking students.
Campus programs and the specific students served may vary based on existing programs
already in place, and which students are in critical need of additional services and supports.

1 Enrollment status: Follows IPEDS convention for 12-month reporting and is based on
attendance status in the “first full term enrolled (i.e., typically the fall or spring terms for
academic reporters), even if that status changed during the 12-month period.” IPEDS defines
a full-time undergraduate student as one “enrolled for 12 or more semester credits, or 12 or
more quarter credits, or 24 or more clock hours a week each term.”
2 AI/AN and NHPI = American Indian or Alaska Native and Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific
Islander.
There are four additional types of demographic groups that the legislation spotlights.
However, due to the specific student populations programs serve and/or student privacy
protections, data are not collected and reported at the student level for all campuses. This
data shows that SUCCESS served a minimum of the number of students listed in each
category of Table 3.

SERVICES
All colleges offered coaching, student planning, and academic support workshops in FY23
and 80% or more offered case management; academic, transfer, and career advising;
mentoring; community events; and financial counseling. Due primarily to some variation in
program models across colleges, not every service is offered by every program.

ALLOCATION AND DISTRIBUTION OF FUNDING TO
CAMPUSES
The criteria and formula used to distribute funds to the colleges, developed in consultation
with the Massachusetts Association of Community College, as per the legislative
requirement:
• Recognizes that each of the 15 community colleges in Massachusetts serves a
large proportion of students in need of additional support services and therefore
should receive some level of funding.
• Reflects the statewide community college funding formula, which provides a
common “base” funding level for all colleges, with additional funding based on
institutional "equity enrollment" (i.e. % of Pell, African American, and Latinx
students).
• Builds off the established “base” funding level from FY22 with increases across
most of the colleges to serve additional students (at $1500 per student) and meet
program needs.
Note that for FY23 the full $14 million allocation went to the colleges. A portion of MACC’s
FY22 rollover funded its operating costs for SUCCESS in FY23, with the remaining being
redistributed back to the colleges as additional funds (not shown in table below) for
SUCCESS services.

The SUCCESS Fiscal Year Funding Checklist outlines the set of policies for receiving and managing
funds, including clarification of related reporting requirements for the initiative. For example, it
stresses that “SUCCESS initiatives must serve matriculated, certificate and/or degree-seeking
students who meet one or more of the student cohorts named in the enabling legislative language
(i.e., students whom our institutions have underserved including, but not limited to, first-generation,
minoritized, economically disadvantaged, LGBTQIA+, and students with disabilities)” as stated in
chapter 28 of the Acts of 2023, line item 7100-4002. Given the initiative’s focus on providing
wraparound supports to certificate and/or degree-seeking students, SUCCESS funds cannot be used
to provide financial support for direct expenses (e.g. tuition and fees, book vouchers, etc.) or to serve
dual enrollment students. SUCCESS funds may be used to fund summer bridge and first-year
experience and orientation programs in order to prepare incoming SUCCESS students to matriculate
and be set up for college success. The enabling legislation specifically notes, “eligible wraparound
support activities shall include, but not be limited to, peer mentors, academic skills workshops, field
trips to 4-year schools and targeted academic, career, transfer and scholarship advising; [and] …for
programs or activities during the summer months…” Colleges are expected to submit detailed annual
budgets tied to their program activities for approval. Quarterly expenditure reports, which are
reviewed by the Leadership Team to determine whether programs are on track, are also required.

CAMPUS SPENDING ACTIVITY
Table 6: FY23 Program Expenditures
Overall, expenditures fell within the spending parameters for FY23 that were agreed upon by
the colleges and the SUCCESS leadership team. The guiding parameters were 80%
personnel, 12% non-personnel, and 8% indirect. This was a shift from the prior fiscal year
where the parameters for personnel and non-personnel were 65% and 27%, respectively.
This shift did lead to some issues for colleges as they continue to grapple with pandemic-era
hiring challenges.
Expense Category $ %
Personnel $9,389,231 80
Administrative & Indirect Costs 1,348,847 11
Technology & Equipment 489,789 4
Professional/Operational Services & 295,508 3
Payments
Facility/Operation/Education Expenses 221,299 2
Total $11,744,674 100
Percentages may not sum to 100% due to rounding. Expenditures reflect spending against
FY23 funds and FY22 carryover funds. Summer 2022 spending was reported for FY22 and is
not reflected here.
Table 7: FY23 Staffing
The colleges budgeted for nearly 450 positions in total and 84% of positions were filled as of
the fiscal year end. Campuses are expected to use the majority of their SUCCESS funds to
build capacity by hiring new people. Administratively heavy staffing structures are to be
avoided. Focus is on hiring and retaining positions that are directly serving SUCCESS
student cohorts and proven to have the greatest impact on persistence, retention, and
completion.
Full-time Part-time Total Headcount Total FTE % Peer of Total FTE
Headcount Headcount
142 237 379 221.0 30%
(196 peer)
Note: Peer refers to students employed as mentors, tutors, and coaches

12
Campuses are asked to be mindful of the proportion of the employees they hire as student workers
and keep their percentage of peer staff of the total FTE under 50%. Given the higher success rates of
SUCCESS programs at community colleges with a peer staffing structure, those with no peer staffing
positions are encouraged to incorporate aspects of this model.
Student employees should be in positions that provide direct academic support services (e.g., peer
mentors, supplemental instruction leaders) to SUCCESS-cohorted students. There should also be
sufficient non-peer staff oversight by a full-time supervisory staff member. Despite these challenges,
the colleges have worked hard during FY24 to shift focus as needed and are largely projected to
spend down the entirety of their allocations.

13
EVALUATION PLAN
Campuses are expected to provide student-record level data on program participation
through HEIRS using an established data dictionary framework. In addition, colleges submit a
supporting narrative on their prior year annual operations and provide preliminary enrollment
figures for their current program year. Finally, data colleges submit via an HEIRS SUCCESS
Fund Comparison Group collection is used to develop a matched comparison peer group for
evaluation purposes.
Gathered data and evaluation results are shared in a comprehensive annual report each
spring. Program administrators, the SUCCESS Leadership Team, and representatives from
MACC and DHE review results each year to determine if adjustments are needed to improve
the effectiveness of the initiative. The evaluation of SUCCESS is guided by a logic model that
documents assumptions, activities, outcomes, and anticipated long-term impacts for the
initiative. A 10-year outcomes plan is derived from the logic model. It tracks when and for
whom measures of success, including the following, are examined:
• Fall-to-fall retention rates
• Credit/course completion
• Three-year graduation rates
• Student sense of belonging
• Six-year success rates
• Employment outcomes (future addition)
