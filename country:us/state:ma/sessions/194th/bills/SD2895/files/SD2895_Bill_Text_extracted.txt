Section 1:
March 12, 2025
The Honorable Aaron Michlewitz
Chair, House Committee on Ways and Means
State House, Room 243
Boston, MA 02133
The Honorable Michael Rodrigues
Chair, Senate Committee on Ways and Means
State House, Room 212
Boston, MA 02133
Dear Chair Michlewitz and Chair Rodrigues:
to you a report of the methodology used to distribute funds as appropriated by the Legislature
through the Hunger Free Campus Pilot Program at the Commonwealth’s state universities,
community colleges, University of Massachusetts undergraduate campuses, and independent
minority serving institutions.
The Department of Higher Education is committed to increasing the retention and completion
of underrepresented student populations, particularly students of color, those from low-
income households, and/or first-generation students. These FY25 grant awards focus on
maximizing student enrollment in federal nutrition benefit programs, promoting on-campus
grocers that accept nutrition benefit program benefits, increasing access to available meal cards
and meal swipe options where feasible, maximizing student access to on-campus or area food
pantries in collaboration with regional food banks, and supporting other campus-designed
projects to address college student food insecurity that are developed through task forces that
include students with lived experience in food insecurity.
I believe that the grants made through this program will advance the work of the Department
to help promote success and completion for our state’s students with the most needs. If you
have any questions about the Hunger Free Campus Pilot Program grant, please feel free to
contact Alex Demou, Director of Legislative and Trustee Relations for the Department of Higher
Education, at ademou@dhe.mass.edu.
Sincerely,
Noe Ortega, PhD
Commissioner, Department of Higher Education

RFP Process:
The Department of Higher Education issued a request for proposals, which was posted on
COMMBUYS, on October 22, 2024. The agency used a funding formula based on the number
of Pell-eligible students enrolled at each institution to determine the maximum budget each
institution could request; colleges and universities with a greater percentage of Pell-eligible
students receive a larger relative proportion of the pot.
Institutions had until November 6, 2024, to respond to the bid. Each response is reviewed to
ensure that proposed budgets are aligned with the intent of the Hunger Free Campus Pilot
Program line item. Subject to the receipt, review, and approval of proposals pursuant to the
RFP process, the DHE anticipates issuing 31 awards across the 15 community colleges, nine
state universities, four University of Massachusetts undergraduate campuses, and three
minority serving institutions. Institutions were estimated to receive the ISA in December.
