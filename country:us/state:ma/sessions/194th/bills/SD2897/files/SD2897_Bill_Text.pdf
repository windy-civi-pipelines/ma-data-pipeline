LETTER FROM THE COMMISSIONER
Dear Honorable Members of the House and Senate Committees on Ways and Means and the Joint
Committee on Higher Education:
I am pleased to submit this legislative report on the MassEducate program.
Pursuant to the line-item language, this report details the distribution of MassEducate funding to our
15 community colleges, as well as the metrics that will be employed to measure the program’s success
in advancing the goal of making free community college education available to all Massachusetts
residents, the rationale for each metric, and the baseline and fall 2024 data for each metric. It
concludes with an overview of other metrics and assessments that may be used going forward. As
required by the FY25 GAA, this report has been developed in consultation with the Massachusetts
Association of Community Colleges.
As part of our ongoing assessment of the program, we analyzed enrollment data and MassEducate
participation data collected at the end of fall 2024. To date, the data shows an overall increase in
enrollment at Massachusetts community colleges during the fall 2024 semester. Such an increase, we
believe, is sustained by the combination of MassEducate and MassReconnect that, together, provide
the funding for the free community college initiative in Massachusetts.
I join our Massachusetts community college sector and the thousands of students who benefit from
MassEducate in thanking you for the support for the program. Questions about this report may be
directed to Alex Demou, Director of Constituent and Legislative Affairs at ademou@dhe.mass.edu.
Sincerely,
Noe Ortega
Commissioner of Higher Education

PROGRAM OVERVIEW
The MassEducate program furthers the Commonwealth’s aim to offer a free
community college education to every resident who wishes to obtain an
associate degree or certificate.
Currently in its first year, the MassEducate program supplements the previously implemented
MassReconnect program. While MassReconnect specifically targets students who are age 25 and
older, MassEducate makes the offer of free community college available to all ages and primarily
serves the population under age 25. In Fall 2024, community colleges enrolled 35,505 students under
age 25, an increase of +6.6% over the prior fall. Together with the 31,206 students MassReconnect
recipients, age 25 or over , which is +26.8% more than Fall 2023 and +42.0% more than fall 2022,
there is clearly strong demand for the Commonwealth’s promise of free community college.
As a “last dollar” financial aid program, MassEducate covers any remaining financial need for students
of all ages who enroll in community colleges without having earned a bachelor’s degree. After the
application of other federal and state aid for which each student qualifies, MassEducate funding
ensures that tuition and mandatory fees are fully covered, and it provides an allowance up to $1,200
per year for books, supplies, and other approved costs to students who meet an income requirement.
To be eligible for a MassEducate grant, students must:
• have physically resided in Massachusetts for at least one year, as of the start of the enrolled
term, with an intent to remain in Massachusetts consistent with Board of Higher Education
(BHE) policy;
• enroll, as a matriculated student, on a full-time or part-time basis (minimum of 6 credits per
term, or the equivalent) in an eligible institution and undergraduate program of study leading
to a certificate or associate degree;
• be a U.S. Citizen, lawful permanent resident, or non-citizen eligible under Title IV regulations;
or have an approved eligibility status designated by the BHE pursuant to the Massachusetts
Tuition Equity Law;
• complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) or the Massachusetts
Application for State Financial Aid (MASFA) as applicable for eligible students under the
Massachusetts Tuition Equity Law annually;
• comply with financial aid verification requirements;
• not be in default on any federal or state student loans for attendance at any institution, and
not owe a refund for any previous state financial aid program;
• not have earned a bachelor’s degree or the equivalent (a student who has previously earned
an associate degree may receive financial assistance to complete up to one additional
associate degree under the MassEducate program); and

4
• meet Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) according to the institution’s requirements and
federal standards.
Awards are made directly by the community colleges at the point of enrollment throughout the
academic year. The Massachusetts Department of Higher Education has collaborated with the
Massachusetts Association of Community Colleges and the 15 community colleges to put in place
MassEducate guidelines and establish an allocation model to distribute the program’s appropriation
among the campuses, as well as the collection of data to track enrollment and spend rates during
enrolled terms.
Funding Distribution by Institution
In Fall 2024, $33,199,608 was allocated to the community colleges for an initial distribution using a
formula based on projected enrollment and unmet financial need. A second distribution of funds will
be allocated in spring 2025. This allocation will use initial projection data supplemented with a mid-
year collection of MassEducate participant data to estimate demand for MassEducate for spring 2025.

METRIC 1: ENROLLMENT OF STUDENTS UNDER 25
& NUMBER OF GRANT RECIPIENTS
MassEducate is a new, “last dollar” financial aid program that covers remaining tuition and fees for
community college students without prior bachelor’s degrees, after applying other federal and state
aid, and provides a books and supplies stipend for students meeting an income requirement. It
complements MassReconnect, launched in Fall 2023, which provides similar benefits exclusively to
students age 25 and older. Together, these programs not only provide financial assistance to eligible
students, but they also encourage all Massachusetts residents without prior degrees to enroll or re-
enroll in college, including some who will ultimately find that their costs are already fully covered by
Pell Grants and/or other aid, without requiring a MassEducate or MassReconnect grant. Metrics for
both programs focus on their respective target populations, regardless of whether students received
program grants, while also tracking grant recipients. Since MassReconnect serves students age 25 and
older, the vast majority (92.3%) of MassEducate participants are under 25, making this group the
primary focus of MassEducate metrics.
This metric tracks enrollment of students under age 25 by student type (various types of new students,
as well as continuing).
Metric
Enrollment of students under age 25 in community colleges and number of MassEducate grant
recipients under age 25, overall and among new student types.
Fall 2024 Summary
• From Fall 2023 to Fall 2024, overall enrollment of students under age 25 increased +6.6% (+2,213).
• Among new students (new first-time, new transfer, and readmitted / reactivated students) under
age 25, enrollment increased +14.6% (+1,950).
• First-time freshman enrollment among students under age 25 increased +13.2% (+1,247). First-
time freshmen are students who are enrolling in college for the first time ever.
• New transfer enrollment among students under age 25 increased +20.2% (+520). New transfers
are students who have previously attended college elsewhere.
• Readmitted / reactivated enrollment among students under age 25 increased +13.5% (+1,535).
Readmitted or reactivated students were previously degree-seeking students at the same
institution and have reapplied after a lengthy period of non-enrollment, as defined by the
institution’s policies.
• Comparing the population of 10,116 MassEducate grant recipients and the overall population of
students under age 25, the grant recipients were more likely than the overall population to be

6
first-time freshmen (35.2% and 30.1% respectively), transfers (9.5% and 8.7% respectively), or
readmitted/reactivated students (5.2% and 4.3% respectively).

METRIC 2: RACE/ETHNICITY OF STUDENTS UNDER
25 & GRANT RECIPIENTS
MassEducate benefits all Massachusetts residents without bachelor’s degrees with the opportunity for
an affordable, accessible college education. This metric, like all others, looks at the impact that the
message of free community college is having on enrollment of subgroups of students under age 25
(by race/ethnicity in this case), as well as the distribution of the direct aid by subgroup.
Metric
Enrollment of students under age 25 in community colleges and number of MassEducate grant
recipients under age 25, disaggregated by race/ethnicity.
Fall 2024 Summary
• From Fall 2023 to Fall 2024, there was enrollment growth among every racial/ethnic group in the
overall population of adults under age 25, including a +6.2% increase (+304) in Black or African
American students, +11.6% increase (+1,059) in Hispanic or Latino students, and a +1.3% increase
(+185) in White students.
• Among new students (new first-time, new transfer, and readmitted / reactivated students) under
age 25, there was also enrollment growth within every racial/ethnic group, including +11.7%
(+234) for Black or African American students, +18.2% (+734) for Hispanic or Latino students, and
+11.6% (+613) for White students.
• Comparing the population of MassEducate grant recipients and the overall population of students
under age 25 (students of known race only), the racial/ethnic diversity is comparable, but the grant
recipients were more likely than the overall population to be White (51.1% and 43.1% respectively),
less likely to be Black or African American (11.4% and 15.8% respectively) or Hispanic or Latino
(28.0% and 30.9% respectively).

METRIC 3: GENDER OF STUDENTS UNDER 25 &
GRANT RECIPIENTS
MassEducate benefits all Massachusetts residents without bachelor’s degrees with the opportunity for
an affordable, accessible college education. This metric, like all others, looks at the impact that the
message of free community college is having on enrollment of subgroups of students under age 25
(by gender in this case), as well as the distribution of the direct aid by subgroup.
Metric
Enrollment of students under age 25 in community colleges and number of MassEducate grant
recipients under age 25, disaggregated by gender.
Fall 2024 Summary
• From Fall 2023 to Fall 2024, overall enrollment of male adults under age 25 increased +3.2%
(+457) and of female adults under age 25 increased +9.2% (+1,712).
• Among new students (new first-time, new transfer, and readmitted / reactivated students) under
age 25, male enrollment increased +9.1% (+524) and female enrollment increased +18.8%
(+1,408).
• Comparing the population of MassEducate grant recipients and the overall population of students
under age 25, both were predominantly female, but the grant recipients were slightly more likely
to be male than the overall population (43.7% and 42.0% respectively).

fields and variables, expects to begin reporting it publicly after normalizing its use.

12
METRIC 4: FAFSA OR MASFA COMPLETION RATE
AMONG STUDENTS UNDER 25
Of all MassEducate grant criteria, the requirement to complete the Free Application for Federal
Student Aid (FAFSA) or the new Massachusetts Application for State Financial Aid (MASFA) likely
presents the greatest barriers for students, as these forms are perceived as complex and stressful to
complete, particularly for families who are new to the college and financial aid application process. A
2023 paper from Brookings states:
The FAFSA has historically been a very difficult form to navigate. The process can be
especially challenging for low-income students, who tend to have fewer academic
supports and whose parents are less likely to have been through the college
application process. Financial challenges and anxieties associated with poverty can
further strain families’ ability to navigate complex processes.
Through MassEducate, any Massachusetts resident without a prior bachelor’s degree who
enrolls at a community college for six or more credits per term is guaranteed aid to cover
tuition and fees. Additionally, students at or below 125% of the state median income receive
an allowance for books and supplies. This metric tells us what percentage of students who
meet all other criteria for MassEducate have checked the final box of completing the FAFSA or
MASFA, claiming all aid available to them, up to and including a MassEducate grant if needed.
The Department of Higher Education is working jointly with the Department of Elementary
Secondary Education to improve FAFSA completion rates. While there is more work to be
done, the data below indicate that the rates are improving year-over-year.
Metric
Percentage of community college students under age 25 who completed the Free Application for
Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) or Massachusetts Application for State Financial Aid (MASFA), along with
meeting all other primary MassEducate grant criteria (Massachusetts residency, no prior bachelor’s
degree, enrolled for six or more credits per term).
Note: With the very recent implementation of MASFA in January 2024, no completion data has yet been
published, but it will be provided in future reports.
Fall 2024 Summary
• Among all students under age 25 in Fall 2024 who met MassEducate’s residency, credit & prior
education requirements, FAFSA completion was 80.9%, an increase of +6.8 percentage points over
Fall 2023.
• Among new students under age 25 who met MassEducate’s residency, credit & prior education
requirements, FAFSA completion was 85.5%, an increase of +5.2 percentage points over Fall 2023.
• Within the all-student subpopulation:

13
• There were increases in FAFSA completion rates among every racial/ethnic group within this
population except Black or African American students (-0.7 percentage points). White students
had the largest increase of +13.8 percentage points, followed by Asian or Pacific Islander
students at +5.3 percentage points, and Hispanic or Latino students at +0.9 percentage points.
FAFSA completion rates among Asian or Pacific Islander students within this population were
lower than the overall rate, at 77.5%, and rates among Hispanic or Latino and White students
were above the overall average at 83.7% and 81.0% respectively. Rates among Black or African
American students were near the overall average at 80.4%.
• There were also increases in these rates among every gender group, including an increase of
+8.7 percentage points for male students and +5.3 percentage points for female students. The
78.0% rate for male students still trails the overall rate.
• Within the new student subpopulation:
• There were increases in FAFSA completion rates among some of the racial/ethnic groups within
this population, with White students having the largest increase of +11.7 percentage points,
Asian or Pacific Islander students at +4.1 percentage points, and Black or African American
students at +0.5 percentage points. FAFSA completion rates for Hispanic or Latino students
decreased slightly by -0.3 percentage points. FAFSA completion rates among Asian or Pacific
Islander and Black or African American students within this population were lower than the
overall rate, at 81.7% and 84.8% respectively.
• There were also increases in these rates among every gender group, including an increase of
+7.7 percentage points for male students and +3.4 percentage points for female students. The
83.8% rate for male students still trails the overall rate.
• While these improvements in FAFSA completion rates among some of the target populations are
impressive, according to this analysis, there were 5,214 enrolled students who otherwise qualified
for MassEducate but did not complete FAFSA. These included 879 Black or African American
students, 1,479 Hispanic or Latino students, and 2,286 White students or, by gender, 2,816 female
students and 2,754 male students. Additional emphasis on FAFSA completion efforts may improve
the rates and equitable access to this program.

METRIC 5: RETENTION OF STUDENTS UNDER 25 &
GRANT RECIPIENTS
Of note, MassEducate functions as an access tool rather than a completion tool. The legislature has
funded the SUCCESS program at community colleges to help support student retention and
completion. Nonetheless, as required in the line item, this report includes as a key metric the
percentage of enrolled students who return for a second year at their initial institution.
Metric
Percentage of students enrolling in community colleges in the Fall term who return in the subsequent
year at their initial institution, for the overall population of students under age 25 enrolled for six or
more credits and for students under age 25 receiving MassEducate grants.
Fall 2024 Summary
• We will not be able to report on retention of the Fall 2024 cohort until early 2026, after the fall
2025 semester.
Baseline Data
Note: Cohort indicates the starting term for the retention analysis. The number of students in the cohort is

PLANNING FOR ADDITIONAL METRICS &
ASSESSMENT
• Other Barriers to Enrollment: The metrics outlined in this document only examine the enrolled
population. Metrics that measure barriers leading up to enrollment are difficult to define. Going
forward, we expect to engage in qualitative analysis to gain a better understanding of why
potential participants are not applying or enrolling, with a particular emphasis on ensuring the
program is accessed equitably by different subgroups.
• Longer-Term Metrics: After more time has elapsed, we will be able to report on enrollment in the
full fiscal year, as well as longer-term success metrics.

APPENDIX: PROFILE OF MASSEDUCATE GRANT
RECIPIENTS OVER AGE 25
MassReconnect specifically targets students age 25 or over, whereas MassEducate grants may serve
students of any age. However, the vast majority of MassEducate grant recipients in Fall 2024 were
under the age of 25, as only 7.7% of MassEducate grant recipients were age 25 or over. This appendix
explores this small subpopulation.
Fall 2024 Summary
• Comparing the population of MassEducate grant recipients age 25 and over and the MassEducate
grant recipient population under 25 (students of known race only), the racial/ethnic diversity is
comparable, but the grant recipients age 25 and over were more likely than the under 25 grant
population to be Black or African American (17.4% and 11.1% respectively) and less likely to be
Hispanic or Latino (24.5% and 27.7% respectively).
• The MassEducate grant recipients age 25 and over were more likely to be female. Nearly three
quarters of MassEducate grant recipients age 25 and over were female compared to the under 25
grant recipients (73.3% and 56.2% respectively).
