List of Certified Community Development Corporations (CDCs) in the Commonwealth
Chapter 240 of the Acts of 2010 updated the CDC law (M.G.L. Chapter 40H) by creating a new
definition for the term Community Development Corporation and establishing for the first time a
certification process for CDCs.
Three key elements are included in the new definition of a CDC:
a. [the CDC] focuses a substantial majority of the corporation’s efforts on serving 1 or more
specific neighborhoods or municipalities, a region of the commonwealth or a constituency
that is economically disadvantaged.
b. [the CDC] has as [its] purpose to engage local residents and businesses to work together to
undertake community development programs, projects and activities which develop and
improve urban, rural and suburban communities in sustainable ways that create and expand
economic opportunities for low and moderate income people.
c. [the CDC] demonstrates to the department of housing and community development that the
corporation’s constituency, including low and moderate income people, is meaningfully
represented on the board of directors of the corporation; provided, however, that in making
this determination, the department shall consider the following criteria:
1. the percentage, if any, of the board that is elected by the general membership;
2. the percentage of the board members that are residents of the service area;
3. the percentage of board members that are people of low or moderate income;

4. the racial and ethnic composition of the board in comparison to the racial and ethnic
composition of the community being served;
5. other mechanisms, including committees, membership meetings, that the organization
uses to ensure that their constituency has a meaningful role in the governance and
direction of the organization; and
6. other criteria as determined by the department.
In addition, Chapter 40H, Section 2A(a), requires that:
The director of housing and community development shall establish and maintain a list of
organizations that have been certified as CDCs consistent with this chapter and develop a
process for certifying those organizations; provided, however, that the organizations shall be
recertified at least once every 4 years. The process shall include an analysis of the
organization’s governance and a determination of whether the organization’s constituency,
including low- and moderate-income persons, is meaningfully represented on the board of
directors of the organization. In making such determination, the director shall consider the
following criteria:
i. the percentage, if any, of the board that is elected by the general membership;
ii. the percentage of the board members who are residents of the service area;
iii. the percentage of board members that are persons of low or moderate income;
iv. the racial and ethnic composition of the board in comparison to the racial and ethnic
composition of the community that the organization serves;
v. other mechanisms, including committees, membership meetings and others that the
organization uses to ensure that the organization’s constituency has a meaningful role in
the governance and direction of the organization; and
vi. other criteria as determined by the director of housing and community development.
As of the date of this report, the following sixty four (64) organizations are currently certified as
Community Development Corporations (CDC). In addition, the two (2) Community Support
Organizations^ (CSO) and the Community Partnership Fund* (CPF) are included on this list:

Recently our CDCs were asked to provide some information on the successes brought about
because of CITC. Some highlights follow:
Coalition for a Better Acre – Opened 555 Merrimack Street, providing 27 units of affordable,
supported housing for individuals in long-term recovery, with addiction services provided by
Riverbend, Inc. (formerly Lowell House). One unique feature of this development is the ability
to create a rental assistance fund, to help cover rental fees for residents who must re-enter
residential treatment and assure housing continuity.
Urban Edge – Completed the rehabilitation of 78 units of housing and made significant progress
on the creation of 120 new units. The community engagement team is providing residents with
computer training for seniors, parenting classes to reduce stress, and reading enrichment for
preschoolers.
Asian CDC – Is developing 292 new affordable homes in Boston Chinatown and in Malden.
One of the developments located in Chinatown will feature a new Boston Public Library
Chinatown branch, which is a significant milestone for the neighborhood. Chinatown is the only
Boston neighborhood without a permanent library branch since the original building was
demolished in the 1960s due to highway construction.
Housing Nantucket – Was able to make critical renovations and maintenance improvements
across their 39 rental properties, ensuring quality living conditions for their tenants. They also
installed solar panels to help reduce energy costs for tenants and conducted homebuyer education
programs to empower prospective homeowners. The Wiggles Way project, a 22-unit mixed-
income rental initiative, is nearing completion. At 66 Pochick Street, their innovative “house
recycling” project involved relocating a one-bedroom cottage and expanding its capacity by
adding a bedroom in a newly constructed full basement.
Homeowner’s Rehab Inc. – Purchased three parcels of land that will create 110 units of
affordable housing over the next four years. They have also substantially expanded the HRI’s
resident programs and services.
Just A Start – moved into their new building, the Economic Mobility Hub at Rindge
Commons. Rindge Commons is located in North Cambridge near Alewife MBTA Station. It
includes a state-of-the-art workforce training center for their youth and adult programs, 24
affordable apartments, 4 classrooms for Cambridge’s universal pre-k program, and space for all
of Just A Start’s housing and financial opportunity programs. The building and its services are
immediately accessible to over 1,000 low- to moderate-income families within a half-mile radius
and will also allow them to double their adult workforce programs.
Chinatown Community Land Trust – acquired a new four-unit property and implemented lead
and asbestos abatement, building envelope improvements, and installation of air source heat

pumps. They also have pursued a planning effort focused on preserving Boston Chinatown as a
both a historic and cultural center.
Franklin County Community Development Corporation – offset costs for people using our
Western MA Food Processing Center (WMFPC). The Center, a food-business incubator, helps
clients co-pack products such as sauces, jams, and beverages. They work with many low-to-
moderate income early-stage entrepreneurs. These business owners need to comply with rigorous
federal food safety laws and other regulations to bring their products to market. They provide
wrap-around business assistance for them to help them succeed.
Housing Corporation of Arlington – Advanced their 43-unit Passive House affordable housing
development which will be built on the site of a former vacant auto body shop and complete
Arlington's first affordable, solar powered Accessory Dwelling Unit, in a partnership with start-
up Reframe Systems. They were also able to initiate a Tenant Council among their 151 units to
enable a more formal path for tenant voice in HCA. The Tenant Council is now advancing some
agenda items and working to build community among tenants. They have also been able to
sustain social services in response to families needing housing help and other assistance for
household stability; a need which has grown significantly since the pandemic.
Wellspring Cooperative – established of a community kitchen in Holyoke, the Gran Cocina,
which serves as an incubator for new food businesses.
Waterfront Historic Area League (WHALE) – has been advancing the Hillman Firehouse
project, a restoration of a vacant and blighted former firehouse and civil defense headquarters
was redesigned and is now out to bid, with a construction schedule set to start before the end of
the year. CITC credits have supported WHALE's operations as the project was brought back
online and involved a tremendous amount of oversight and collaboration.
Allston Bright CDC – Homeownership & Counseling program grew greatly in 2024 and started
offering two new homeownership workshops; Homebuying 102: Downpayment Assistance, and
Homebuying 202: Condo Purchase and Ownership. In 2024 alone, over 150 individuals have
completed one of these workshops. Their Real Estate Development program expanded greatly
during the year. Currently, one project is in active construction, three are in predevelopment, and
one project completed construction in November. These projects will make an impact on over
160 units of housing which are home to over 200 low-income residents.
Community Economic Development Center – has been making progress on their first real
estate development project: the adaptive reuse of the historic Capitol Theater, which will be
transformed into the Capitol Resilience Hub.
Worcester Common Ground – had the groundbreaking held on Sept. 12 for three condos at 116
Piedmont. This will result in affordable units priced between $200,000–$240,000, available for
families earning ≤80% of AMI. It also includes an accessible ground-floor unit to ensure
inclusivity.
Hilltown CDC – Renovated the old high school in Chester that now has 15 subsidized
affordable housing units as well as the town library and town museum. They were able to
expand their small business assistance program to support more local farmers and were able to

move more local product through their non-profit grocery store and local delivery service
purchasing more local produce from Hilltown farms.
Community Teamwork – Summer Street Housing opened in the spring of 2024. The nearly
two-year project included the purchase and extensive renovation of a former rooming house in an
area of Lowell near a park known for homeless encampments. Each of the new 19 efficiency
apartments contains its own bathroom and kitchenette. The residents benefit from a permanent
supportive housing model which includes addressing the residents’ broader needs such as access
to food, transportation, and healthcare. In addition, we provide support and stabilization
including, but not limited to access to employment, educational opportunities, financial literacy,
help accessing state benefits, and legal support.
As part of the program, Certified CDCs have to submit an annual GOALs survey to MACDC
outlining how CITC has helped them over the course of the recent year and they create a report
with this information to show the success of the program. EOHLC works with MACDC to
develop and refine questions in the CITC portion of this survey. Please see some data from the
2023 report below, as well as some links to the CITC Dashboard and Impact Report
▪ 1,610 Leaders engaged
