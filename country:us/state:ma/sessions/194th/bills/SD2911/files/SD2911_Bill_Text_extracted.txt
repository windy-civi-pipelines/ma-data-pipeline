I. INTRODUCTION
State Fiscal Year 2024 (SFY24) accomplishments include reducing greenhouse gas emissions,
increasing climate resilience, framing environmental justice in the agency’s work, and considering
cumulative environmental impacts in permitting activities. Commissioner Bonnie Heiple has led the
agency to the milestones described below, guiding the agency in managing federal grant funds ,
adapting and improving the agency’s information services, and adjusting the MassDEP workforce as
the agency continues to experience retirements and other staffing changes. Highlights of the
agency’s accomplishments are described below.
MassDEP’s permit application fees totaled $18.5 million in SFY24. Additionally, MassDEP collected
$10.2 million in Annual Compliance Fees, $4.0 million in Chapter 21E Annual Compliance Fees and
$1.8 million in Wetlands Notices of Intent Fees. MassDEP’s appropriation in SFY24 from the
General Fund was $84,357,040.
Environmental enforcement activities in SF24 included 5,422 Compliance Inspections, 2,006
Lower-Level Enforcement actions and 508 Higher Level Enforcement actions. Penalties assessed
this year totaled $1.7 million and the agency collected $1.1 million in penalty payments. Additional
details on fee revenue and MassDEP’s compliance and enforcement activities are included in

II. HIGHLIGHTS OF MASSDEP ACCOMPLISHMENTS: SFY24
Equity and Environmental Justice
MassDEP continued to prioritize environmental justice (EJ) and equity and renewed its ongoing
commitment to a diverse and inclusive staff and workplace culture within the agency. The MassDEP
Office of Environmental Justice works across the state to ensure that the agency provides
meaningful public involvement and community engagement opportunities for agency processes
and decision-making activities. EEA supports these activities through its Office of Human Resources
and Office of Environmental Justice and Equity. Internally, hiring, recruitment, and promotion
efforts intentionally guide decision-making towards meeting our diversity goals and hiring and
retaining talented and diverse staff that reflect the diversity of the people of the Commonwealth
that we serve. Externally, the agency is committed to ensuring opportunities for engagement and an
equitable distribution of environmental benefits and burdens. Certain SF24 accomplishments in
equity and EJ are listed below.

• Requiring Cumulative Impact Analysis for Air Permitting. In 2021, An Act creating a
next generation roadmap for Massachusetts climate policy (Chapter 8 of the Acts of 2021)
was signed into law. It established requirements for emissions reductions from a 1990
baseline: reducing GHG emissions by 50% by 2030, 75% by 2040 and achieving net-zero
status by 2050. The Act also directed MassDEP to evaluate and seek public comment on
incorporating cumulative impact analyses into air permitting. It further directed MassDEP
to propose regulations to include cumulative impact analyses for certain air quality permits.
The agency conducted an extensive stakeholder process to guide this work and published
final rules that establish a cumulative impact analysis approach for certain air permits. The
supporting tools for permit applicants provide localized demographic and environmental
burden information and the regulations require advance engagement with affected
communities. The innovative permitting steps will ensure deliberate consideration of local
input and the historic impact of
existing environmental burdens near
proposed air permits. More

• Developed more than 50 Public Involvement Plans or Fact Sheets during permitting
processes. These documents provide opportunities for the public to receive information and
engage about proposed projects seeking state permits.
• Finalized the MassDEP EJ Strategy, which is now part of EEA’s comprehensive EJ Strategy.
The Strategy includes metrics for measuring effective community outreach, public
involvement, and engagement.
• Began tracking reported metrics that impact environmental justice populations in
anticipation of the finalization of the EJ Strategy.
• Continued to use the agency’s enforcement guidance on calculating penalties when
violations affect an EJ population. The guidance provides for upward penalty adjustments
based on the public interest factor in calculating administrative penalty amounts when
violations occur within or otherwise affect an EJ population.
• Maintained an internal EJ Resources intranet page for agency staff with resources for
identifying EJ populations, providing language access tools, and contacts for community
engagement and public involvement resources. The Office also manages language access
requests for translation and interpretation services. The intranet page also includes
recordings of EJ training accessible to all staff.
• Continued to offer agency wide paid internship positions that enable a more diverse
range of applicants to contribute to the work of the agency and gain experience working for
an environmental regulatory agency.
• Attended job fairs and established other outreach recruitment events and methods to
reach potential candidates and diversify the agency applicant pools. The agency has also
established a social media profile on LinkedIn to attract and reach interested potential
employees.
• Senior managers met regularly to discuss EJ and equity and diversity issues. The
internal Advisory Committee on Equity and Diversity (ACED) also met regularly. With 13
members from a variety of positions and offices across the agency, ACED provides
recommendations to the Commissioner and senior staff to improve our internal and
external processes and structures and identify future areas where we should focus our
attention as it pertains to EJ, diversity, equity, and inclusion.
Climate Initiatives
The Healey-Driscoll Administration is prioritizing finding solutions to mitigate the impacts of
climate change. Meeting climate challenges in every area of government will require creativity and
increased coordination by agencies and within MassDEP. Throughout SFY24, EEA and MassDEP
advanced work to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions and developed local resiliency measures to
adapt to changed precipitation patterns, more frequent severe weather events, and prevent damage
to the natural and built environment. MassDEP is committed to respond with urgency to this
transformative environmental and public health challenge. Some of the agency’s climate related

state. Highlights of MassDEP’s climate work in SFY24 are noted below.
Working towards a Clean Heat Standard
The Clean Energy and Climate Plan calls for MassDEP to develop a Clean Heat Standard to reduce
greenhouse gas emissions from the heating sector. MassDEP participated on EEA’s Clean Heat
Commission to inform the design of such a program. The Commission released its final report in
2022, available here: https://www.mass.gov/doc/massachusetts-commission-on-clean-heat-final-
report-november-30-2022/download. A draft framework for a Clean Heat Standard was published
by MassDEP in fall 2023 that built on the agency’s stakeholder process to solicit input on the
program design. Proposed reporting regulations for heating fuels that would support a Clean Heat
Standard were shared for public comment, and the agency anticipates issuing final regulations for
public comment in SFY25. The reporting regulation will help inform the development of the Clean
Heat Standard. More information on the Clean Heat Standard Program development can be found
here: https://www.mass.gov/info-details/clean-heat-standard-program-development.
Expanding Air Quality monitoring sensors and data
MassDEP expanded air quality monitoring in environmental justice areas and continued to enhance
its air monitoring and community-based air sensor efforts in environmental justice areas. The
agency added four ultrafine particle (UFP) monitors at its monitoring stations in Boston (Von
Hillern Street), Chelmsford, Boston-Chinatown, and Springfield to enhance particle pollution
monitoring in or near urban EJ population areas near high traffic roadways. MassDEP awarded 213
fine particulate matter (PM2.5) air quality sensors to 27 municipalities and community-based
organizations. The new sensors, which are funded by the Massachusetts Office of Environmental
Justice and Equity, will be deployed across the state with a majority installed in Environmental
Justice areas. The newest monitoring stations, with PM2.5 and black carbon monitor capability, are
located in EJ populations - Saugus and Framingham. The monitor in Framingham became
operational on January 1, 2025 and the agency anticipates installation of the Saugus monitor in
spring 2025.

• Support for Electric Vehicles and Charging Stations. MassDEP administers a grant
program to increase deployment of electric vehicles called the Massachusetts Electric
Vehicle Incentive Program (MassEVIP). This program has been funded through the
Volkswagen emissions settlement and other sources. MassDEP allocated the maximum
allowable amount (15%) of the Volkswagen funds to light-duty electric vehicle
charging equipment. In SFY24 the agency distributed $5,334,871 from the settlement fund.
• ResilientMass Plan. MassDEP continued to advance initiatives directed by EEA and
Executive Office of Public Safety as part of the ResilientMass Plan (formerly known as the
State Hazard Mitigation and Climate Adaptation Plan). The updated ResilientMass Plan
released in the fall 2023 includes important resiliency initiatives led by MassDEP. Actions
include developing a statewide hydraulic tool for designing stream crossings, providing
municipal technical GIS mapping assistance for water utilities, developing a clean heat
standard for heating fuels, and updating wetlands erosion control and restoration guidance.
See the action tracker for these projects here: ResilientMass Action Tracker
• No Net Loss of Carbon. As a commitment under the Massachusetts Clean Energy and
Climate Plan for 2025 and 2030 (2022), EEA and MassDEP conducted the No Net Loss of
Carbon in Wetlands Project to evaluate the carbon sequestration function of wetlands and
develop strategies to achieve the goal of No Net Loss of Carbon in Wetlands in
Massachusetts. MassDEP is evaluating the report’s findings and will recommend policy and
regulatory strategies for improved protection of wetlands and mitigation for wetland
carbon impacts.
• Gap Energy Grants. MassDEP’s Clean Energy Results Program continued to oversee
deployment of $8.1 million provided through 62 Gap Energy Grants to wastewater and
drinking water systems, nonprofit organizations and small businesses providing affordable
multifamily housing, and food distribution or production facilities. The grants help “fill the
financial gap” to enable energy efficiency and clean energy generation projects to move
forward. The grants improve emergency response capacity, resilience in extreme weather,
and energy and greenhouse gas emissions reductions.
• Guidance for Resilient Wetlands Restoration. MassDEP convened interagency and
stakeholder work groups to evaluate salt marsh restoration approaches and to clarify
permitting processes under the Wetlands Protection Act and related permit requirements
(e.g., 401, Chapter 91). With input from those partners, MassDEP developed final guidance
on runnels, ditch remediation, and marsh islands. Draft guidance on sediment augmentation
methods (i.e., Thin-Layer-Placement and Passive Sediment Augmentation) is expected to be
completed in SFY25. MassDEP is preparing proposed revisions to its wetlands regulations
that facilitate the use of these practices for wetlands restoration, encourage control of
invasive species, and promote restoration of retired or abandoned cranberry bogs.
MassDEP, with EEA, is preparing to a stakeholder process to help streamline the permitting
process while maintaining necessary wetlands resource protections.
• Statewide Hydraulic Model for Climate Resilient Stream Crossings. Many of the 25,000-
plus roadway crossing structures (small bridges and culverts) that convey rivers and
MassDEP SFY24
Fees Report

streams under roads in Massachusetts are undersized. This results in substantial impacts to
fish and wildlife movement and habitat. Undersized structures also lack the capacity to
withstand floods, especially given the increasing intensity and frequency of flooding.
MassDEP is developing a Statewide Hydraulic Model that will assist municipalities and
other owners of crossing structures by facilitating permitting and design of stream
crossings that are resilient for flood flows and that better meet wetlands stream crossing
standards for aquatic organism passage. This multi-year project is one of the ResilientMass
Plan action projects that MassDEP is leading.
Multi-Media Challenge - PFAS
Per– and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are chemicals that have been used in a wide variety of
consumer products over many years and, because of their chemical structure, do not readily break
down in the environment. Increasing concerns about the effects of PFAS on public health and the
environment continue to spur action at the federal and state levels and prompt research aimed at
better understanding the effects of these substances. Addressing PFAS in Massachusetts continues
to be a major focus for MassDEP.
MassDEP monitored new research and actions by the United States Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA) in implementing its PFAS Strategic Roadmap, as well as proposed legislation and
other developments in other states. Our understanding of PFAS’ effects on human health and the
environment continue to advance rapidly into areas beyond drinking water. MassDEP has worked
to evaluate and take steps to develop multimedia responses for PFAS in wastewater, biosolids and
landfill leachate. Sites identified as contaminated with PFAS under the Chapter 21E program are
being managed to remediate soil and groundwater contamination. MassDEP continues to follow the
developing science, including investigation and monitoring techniques, and proposed standards at
the federal level. MassDEP will continue to design programmatic strategies for Massachusetts to
protect human health and the environment such as those identified below.
Drinking Water Protection and PFAS
• In SFY24, the MassDEP Office of Research and Standards reviewed new research and
information as part of the agency’s work to complete the three-year review of the 2020
Massachusetts drinking water regulations that created PFAS maximum contaminant levels
(MCLs). The “triennial review” was informed by EPA’s release of its federal MCL for six PFAS
in April 2024. Reviewing the state of the science for the Massachusetts MCLs and potential
updates to Massachusetts drinking water regulations.
• MassDEP continues to assist public water systems (PWSs) in monitoring and
implementation of the Massachusetts drinking water standards for six PFAS compounds.
PFAS testing results from PWSs are available to the public on the web in the EEA data
portal.
MassDEP SFY24
Fees Report

• MassDEP’s Drinking Water Program worked with 175 PWSs with PFAS testing results that
exceeded the Massachusetts drinking water standards. MassDEP staff conducted
compliance assistance, issued enforcement documents, reviewed long term corrective
action plans, and issued permits for construction of treatment plants, new water mains and
removal of wells from service to address PFAS contamination.
• Over the past four years, 71 new or modified treatment facilities have been constructed to
remove PFAS from drinking water. More information about PFAS in Massachusetts drinking
water can be found in the story map on the MassDEP webpage, available at
https://www.mass.gov/info-details/per-and-polyfluoroalkyl-substances-pfas#pfas-
detected-in-drinking-water-supplies-in-massachusetts
• The MassDEP Drinking Water Program continues to work with PWSs to anticipate the
system requirements and follow the new EPA drinking water standards for PFAS. MassDEP
secured a $38 million grant for Federal FYs 2022 and 2023 and a $19 million grant for FFY
2024 from the EPA through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to address emerging
contaminants in public drinking water in small and disadvantaged communities. MassDEP
is distributing grants to public water suppliers and developing initiatives to improve their
capacities to address emerging contaminants.
PFAS Site Identification, Assessment and Remediation
• MassDEP’s Bureau of Waste Site Cleanup focused on the identification, assessment, and
remediation of known sites with PFAS contamination under the Massachusetts Contingency
Plan (MCP). Its work included identifying—through review of assessment results and
expanded investigations—likely sources of PFAS impacting drinking water resources and
directing responsible parties to undertake response actions to further assess and remediate
these sites.
• The Bureau of Waste Site Cleanup reviewed and approved actions to address sudden
releases of PFAS (e.g., following the use of PFAS-containing aqueous film forming foam for
fire suppression) and assessment and remedial plans to address PFAS at state and federal
sites.
• A total of 176 PFAS sites have been identified in Massachusetts as of September 2024. Fifty-
three of these are associated with public water sources and 49 are located in an
Environmental Justice area.

• In cases where responsible parties have yet to be identified or were unwilling or unable to
conduct necessary actions, the Bureau of Waste Site Cleanup engaged contractors to
mitigate Imminent Hazard levels of PFAS in private wells by installing treatment systems
and providing bottled water in the interim.
Support for PFAS Treatment through the State Revolving Loan Fund
• The MassDEP State Revolving Loan Fund Program (SRF) and the Clean Water Trust
continued to assist Public Water Suppliers addressing PFAS contamination. The SRF offered
zero percent interest loans for construction projects to remove PFAS from drinking water,
including the construction of treatment facilities and new water mains. Approximately $342
million in loans and loan commitments have been issued. More information is available at
https://www.mass.gov/info-details/zero-interest-pfas-mitigation-loans.
PFAS in Wastewater and Biosolids
• MassDEP has required PFAS sampling and analysis of wastewater and biosolids through
permit modifications. Data reported in accordance with MassDEP surface water discharge
permits and biosolids or residuals approvals are required to be uploaded to an online data
portal that is available to the public at
https://eeaonline.eea.state.ma.us/portal#!/search/npdes.
• MassDEP is evaluating options for the management of wastewater residuals that contain
PFAS. A data gathering exercise to learn the “state of the state” for Massachusetts sludge,
where it goes, and how it is managed (Part 1 of a comprehensive study) was conducted in
SFY24. This study is the foundation for Part 2, being conducted in SFY25, in which
additional analyses of biosolids management in Massachusetts will be performed including
MassDEP SFY24
Fees Report

impacts of PFAS on sludge disposal options, and policy and regulatory recommendations for
MassDEP to consider.
Sampling Surface Waters for PFAS
• In collaboration with the United States Geological Survey (USGS), MassDEP initiated a
second study of PFAS concentrations in rivers at nine locations. Sampling was conducted
upstream and downstream of wastewater treatment plants, as well as samples of influent,
effluent and biosolids at these facilities. MassDEP also initiated a third study collaborating
with USGS of PFAS concentrations in sewer collection systems at six locations. This work
began in SFY24 and will continue in SFY25.
Solid Waste – Sampling for PFAS at Landfills
• MassDEP’s Bureau of Air and Waste (BAW) responded to issues related to PFAS
contamination from landfills. As MassDEP identifies or becomes aware of drinking water
contamination, BAW works collaboratively with the Bureau of Water Resources to identify
potential sources of contamination, including landfills that may be in proximity to a
drinking water source. If a landfill is determined to be a possible source of PFAS, monitoring
well testing is conducted. If the source of PFAS is confirmed, remediation activities are
pursued. BAW anticipates that additional landfills will be identified for investigation as
potential contributors of PFAS contamination as more public and private residential well
water testing is conducted.
• BAW initiated a proactive effort to assess potential landfill contamination of drinking water
sources at a number of landfills. Sampling at selected prioritized landfills began in SFY24
and is ongoing.
Collection and Destruction of Firefighting Foam Containing PFAS
• MassDEP has managed collection and destruction of legacy PFAS-containing fire-fighting
foams through its “Take Back” program since 2018. With an additional $250,000 in funding
from the legislature, the program was extended to ensure that PFAS containing foam is not
released to the environment.
• Through June 2024, more than 400,000 pounds (or over 47,000 gallons) of foam have been
collected from 157 fire departments and facilities across the Commonwealth. MassDEP
intends to continue the Take Back Program in SFY25 and to undertake efforts to assure
continued awareness of its availability.
Laboratory PFAS Support, Research, and Risk Communication
• MassDEP’s Laboratory Certification Program continued to offer certification to interested
laboratories to test drinking water for PFAS and to support public water suppliers.
• MassDEP’s Wall Experiment Station, Division of Environmental Laboratory Sciences and the
Office of Research and Standards worked to expand the agency’s analytical capacity for
PFAS in multiple media through analytical equipment upgrades, increasing staff capabilities
and operationalizing additional PFAS methods.
MassDEP SFY24
Fees Report

• The Office of Research and Standards, the Drinking Water Program, and MassDEP’s
Regional Offices have provided extensive risk communication assistance to municipalities,
Boards of Health, public water systems and the public regarding PFAS detections and
exceedances of the Massachusetts drinking water standards. Assistance has included web-
based information, assessment and communication of risks posed by PFAS detections in
private water supplies and smaller public supplies, participation in public meetings and
hearings and assistance in preparing public notices.
Recommendations of the Interagency PFAS Task Force; Monitoring Legislation
• A legislatively established Interagency PFAS Task Force released its Final Report in April
2022 after nine public hearings and testimony from a variety of stakeholders and experts.
The Final Report included several recommendations related to MassDEP programs,
including increased funding for PFAS detection and remediation, funding for treatment of
PFAS in drinking water, expanding the scope of regulatory control to additional substances,
and encouraging private well testing and remediation.
• Since the Report’s release a variety of bills have been filed related to PFAS, and MassDEP
continues to monitor legislative developments that would implement the recommendations
from the Task Force. The report and more information on the Task Force can be found here:
https://www.malegislature.gov/Commissions/Detail/556/Documents.
More information on MassDEP’s PFAS work can be found here: https://www.mass.gov/info-

Recycling and Solid Waste
In SFY24, MassDEP continued to implement the 2030 Solid Waste Master Plan – Working Together
Toward Zero Waste. New, ambitious state-level waste reduction goals that align with our carbon
emission reduction programs, invest in innovation, and enhance ongoing engagement with
communities across the Commonwealth were established in the Plan as well as regulation. Key
disposal and recycling goals include:
• Reduce disposal statewide by 30 percent by 2030 (from 5.7 million tons in 2018 to 4 million
tons); and
• Achieve a 90 percent reduction in disposal by 2050 (from 5.7 million tons to 570,000 tons).
The Solid Waste Master Plan and accompanying regulatory changes expanded landfill disposal
waste bans for certain materials, setting a lower threshold for landfill disposal of organic materials
and establishing new bans on disposal of mattresses and textiles. In the first year of
implementation, from 2022 to 2023, these new waste bans and supporting programs resulted in
more than doubling mattress recycling from 170,000 to 400,000 mattresses, increased recovery of
MassDEP SFY24
Fees Report
12
food materials by 6 percent, and increased recovery of textiles by 7 percent. Further progress is
expected in continuing years of implementation as education and funding efforts grow.
The Solid Waste Master Plan also includes initiatives to strengthen engagement with and support of
environmental justice communities, including:
• increasing engagement with environmental justice populations in all phases of MassDEP’s
regulatory process;
• improving recycling grant evaluation criteria to recognize environmental justice
community issues;
• promoting small-scale composting assistance to enable composting at community gardens
in environmental justice areas;
• and promoting and encouraging the use of electric and hybrid trash and recycling collection
vehicles in environmental justice communities.
MassDEP continues to focus on helping municipalities confront limited landfill capacity and a
recycling market that has changed significantly in recent years, through a variety of technical and
financial assistance programs. Supporting these programs, as well as expanding recycling capacity
and reducing contamination of materials to be recycled, is intended to drive innovation in these
areas to move the Commonwealth toward a zero-waste future.
The Solid Waste Master Plan announced increased recycling business development grants and a
new recycling research and development grant program to drive innovation in recycling and waste
reduction. In SFY24 MassDEP awarded $5,186,340 million in grants, technical assistance and
education services to municipalities to advance recycling (Sustainable Materials Recovery
Program) and $1,078,000 million in technical assistance and grants to advance business recycling
and support/expand the recycling industry (Recycling Business Development Grants) in
Massachusetts.
Additional information on the Plan is on the MassDEP website here:
https://www.mass.gov/guides/solid-waste-master-plan
Addressing Nitrogen Pollution and Improving Water Quality
In July 2023, MassDEP promulgated revisions to the “Title 5” Regulations at 310 CMR 15.000 to
designate Natural Resource Areas (coastal embayments) that are impaired by nitrogen pollution as
Nitrogen Sensitive Areas. MassDEP also promulgated a complementary set of new regulations
establishing a Watershed Permitting Program at 314 CMR 21.00. The revisions in both programs
represent an innovative and needed step forward to control nitrogen pollution and improve water
quality. MassDEP worked closely with Cape Cod municipalities and other governmental entities as
they developed applications for watershed permits to reduce nitrogen pollution in their
MassDEP SFY24

13
watersheds. Thirteen Cape Cod municipalities have filed one or more of the following: (1) a Notice
of Intent that they intend to file a Watershed Permit Application; (2) a Watershed Permit
Application, or (3) a Request for a De Minimis Load Exemption. MassDEP supported this initiative
with $600,000 in grants in SFY24 and will increase that support in SFY25 to $825,000.
Bipartisan Infrastructure Law Investment in Massachusetts
Approximately $935 million dollars is expected to be available to invest in our communities from
the federal government through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL) over a period of five years
(2022-2026). The funding is primarily directed through the State Revolving Loan Fund (SRF)
Program and will supplement the annual EPA capitalization grants that fund the SRF programs. The
2024 SRF Intended Use Plans reflect this additional funding and are available online here: 2024
Final SRF Intended Use Plans | Mass.gov. Massachusetts offered over $1.4 billion to finance 168
water infrastructure projects across the Commonwealth in calendar year 2024. The map below
shows the SRF 2024 Intended Use Plan distribution of SRF funding ($939 million for Clean Water
SRF projects and $506 million for Drinking Water SRF projects).

MassDEP’s website at https://www.mass.gov/state-revolving-fund-srf-loan-program.
Long Island Sound Grant
In September 2022, MassDEP was awarded a $10.5M grant from the U.S. EPA for Long Island Sound
Watershed Nutrient Reduction, available from Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL) funds. The
objective of this project is to support nitrogen reduction to Massachusetts waterbodies that are in
the Long Island Sound watershed through nitrogen reduction upgrades to wastewater treatment
facilities in Massachusetts municipalities with environmental justice populations. These funds were
payable over 3 years. In SFY23 MassDEP distributed $8.47 million to support nitrogen reduction
projects at two wastewater treatment plants. In SFY23 MassDEP also began a workplan to expend
the final $2 million from the initial award. In SFY24 MassDEP’s workplan was submitted requesting
a total of $12 million of additional funding for eligible publicly owned treatment works seeking
financial assistance for denitrification upgrades. The Management Committee awarded MassDEP
$10.6 million to be allocated over FFY25 and FFY26 distributed in a manner determined by
MassDEP. MassDEP elected to utilize $2.5 million for FFY25 in readily applicable projects and $8.1
million for FFY26 within a workplan yet to be developed.
Remediating Lead in School Drinking Water
The MassDEP Water-Smart Program (formerly the Expanded Assistance Program) provides
technical assistance to public and private schools and childcare facilities to establish a lead in
drinking water monitoring program. In SFY24, MassDEP received EPA funding of $1,890,000 to
support education and outreach for this program. MassDEP’s technical assistance helps schools and
facilities develop a site-specific sampling plan, provides lab analysis of samples taken at taps and
water fountains used for drinking and cooking, assists with the identification of fixtures with lead
concentrations over the laboratory analytical testing limit of 1 part per billion (ppb), and
recommends possible remedial actions. The Program operates in conjunction with the University of
Massachusetts-Amherst’s Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering and with the support
of partners, including the state’s Department of Public Health, Department of Elementary and
Secondary Education, Department of Early Education and Care, and the Massachusetts Water
Resources Authority.
After facilities receive their sampling results, they are encouraged to take remedial actions at any
location with levels of lead above the lab testing limit and to communicate the results and short-
term action plans to parents and staff. Facilities communicate this information through emails,
automated informational calls, letters, website postings, printed postings, newspaper articles, and
meetings. Actions taken to address lead levels include removing and replacing fixtures, using
MassDEP SFY24

signage to indicate fixtures that are not intended to be used for drinking water, and implementing
water line flushing programs.
In SFY24, the Water-Smart Program:
• Tested 3,386 outlets in 84 schools and 2,731 outlets in 273 childcare facilities;
• Tested 28 private schools through funding from the Clean Water Trust to support testing of
private schools;
• Worked with 6 public water systems to test 69 schools and childcare facilities through a
pilot program to increase participation and assist systems in meeting upcoming federal
requirements on lead testing;
• Sent filtered water pitchers to 124 participating childcare facilities;
• Expanded our agency’s outreach efforts, including:
o Increasing social media posts,
o Sending physical postcard mailers, and
o Coordinating with partner organizations,
• Rebranded from the Expanded Assistance Program to the Water-Smart Program; and
• Conducted Spanish language meetings with small groups of childcare providers.
Complementing the Water-Smart Program, the Clean Water Trust operates its School Water
Improvement Grant (SWIG) program. SWIG covers the cost of water bottle filling stations to
address detections of lead in drinking water at eligible schools and childcare facilities using $5
million allocated by the Trust and nearly $3 million awarded through a U.S. EPA grant. In SFY24,
SWIG provided grants totaling $156,000 for the purchase of 52 bottle filling stations in 24 school
districts.

Developing a Modern Information Technology System
MassDEP’s information technology system is part of EEA’s enterprise-wide framework for
information management. The agency vision includes the Energy and Environmental Information
and Public Access System (EIPAS) a multi-year integrated, shared service platform intended to
modernize existing systems and to add new functionality based on MassDEP’s evolving data needs.
Modernized applications enable MassDEP to improve transparency and better serve the public
through shared data and online tools. The agency continues to build upon its successes, having
added the citizen data portal and providing a secretariat-wide and agency-wide paperless online
permitting platform. MassDEP is continuing to add functionality to its systems and completed
updates to our integrated compliance and enforcement platform that supports many of our agency
programs.

V. Summary of the significant improvements in permitting and
compliance programs
MassDEP’s online system (Accela) is available for nearly all agency permits, enabling online
application submittals. A few permits still are managed with outdated technological systems which
MassDEP is planning to replace, pending funding availability
MassDEP is in the process of designing a permitting webpage and re-establishing a Permitting
Assistance and Management Office. This effort is one of the actions stemming from our Permitting
Evaluation done in collaboration with the Lieutenant Governor’s Office.
Online permit application and processing provides multiple benefits:
• The online system checks to ensure minimum requirements are met, thereby improving
administrative completeness of submittals, and timely issuance.
• Permits can be paid online, resulting in immediate start dates of permit timelines.
• “Online portals” enable the applicant and regulated entities to view the permit application
Search EEA Projects (mass.gov) and search all permit decisions online . EEA Data Portal
(state.ma.us).
• MassDEP’s webpage provides guidance on MassDEP permitting, including a
MassDEP Guide for Online Permitting (MassDEP Guide for Online Permitting |
Mass.gov) which includes information regarding the agency’s “money back”
guarantee. MassDEP offers this guarantee: A timely decision or you are eligible for a
refund. The agency has permit category-specific timelines for acting on the
applications it receives for permits, licenses, plan approvals, registrations,
determinations and other approvals.

• Requiring Cumulative Impact Analysis for Air Permitting. In 2021, An Act creating a
next generation roadmap for Massachusetts climate policy (Chapter 8 of the Acts of 2021)
was signed into law. It established requirements for emissions reductions from a 1990
baseline: reducing GHG emissions by 50% by 2030, 75% by 2040 and achieving net-zero
status by 2050. The Act also directed MassDEP to evaluate and seek public comment on
incorporating cumulative impact analyses into air permitting. It further directed MassDEP
to propose regulations to include cumulative impact analyses for certain air quality permits.
The agency conducted an extensive stakeholder process to guide this work and published
final rules that establish a cumulative impact analysis approach for certain air permits. The
supporting tools for permit applicants provide localized demographic and environmental
burden information and the regulations require advance engagement with affected
communities. The innovative permitting steps will ensure deliberate consideration of local
input and the historic impact of
existing environmental burdens near
proposed air permits. More

• Developed more than 50 Public Involvement Plans or Fact Sheets during permitting
processes. These documents provide opportunities for the public to receive information and
engage about proposed projects seeking state permits.
• Finalized the MassDEP EJ Strategy, which is now part of EEA’s comprehensive EJ Strategy.
The Strategy includes metrics for measuring effective community outreach, public
involvement, and engagement.
• Began tracking reported metrics that impact environmental justice populations in
anticipation of the finalization of the EJ Strategy.
• Continued to use the agency’s enforcement guidance on calculating penalties when
violations affect an EJ population. The guidance provides for upward penalty adjustments
based on the public interest factor in calculating administrative penalty amounts when
violations occur within or otherwise affect an EJ population.
• Maintained an internal EJ Resources intranet page for agency staff with resources for
identifying EJ populations, providing language access tools, and contacts for community
engagement and public involvement resources. The Office also manages language access
requests for translation and interpretation services. The intranet page also includes
recordings of EJ training accessible to all staff.
• Continued to offer agency wide paid internship positions that enable a more diverse
range of applicants to contribute to the work of the agency and gain experience working for
an environmental regulatory agency.
• Attended job fairs and established other outreach recruitment events and methods to
reach potential candidates and diversify the agency applicant pools. The agency has also
established a social media profile on LinkedIn to attract and reach interested potential
employees.
• Senior managers met regularly to discuss EJ and equity and diversity issues. The
internal Advisory Committee on Equity and Diversity (ACED) also met regularly. With 13
members from a variety of positions and offices across the agency, ACED provides
recommendations to the Commissioner and senior staff to improve our internal and
external processes and structures and identify future areas where we should focus our
attention as it pertains to EJ, diversity, equity, and inclusion.
Climate Initiatives
The Healey-Driscoll Administration is prioritizing finding solutions to mitigate the impacts of
climate change. Meeting climate challenges in every area of government will require creativity and
increased coordination by agencies and within MassDEP. Throughout SFY24, EEA and MassDEP
advanced work to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions and developed local resiliency measures to
adapt to changed precipitation patterns, more frequent severe weather events, and prevent damage
to the natural and built environment. MassDEP is committed to respond with urgency to this
transformative environmental and public health challenge. Some of the agency’s climate related

state. Highlights of MassDEP’s climate work in SFY24 are noted below.
Working towards a Clean Heat Standard
The Clean Energy and Climate Plan calls for MassDEP to develop a Clean Heat Standard to reduce
greenhouse gas emissions from the heating sector. MassDEP participated on EEA’s Clean Heat
Commission to inform the design of such a program. The Commission released its final report in
2022, available here: https://www.mass.gov/doc/massachusetts-commission-on-clean-heat-final-
report-november-30-2022/download. A draft framework for a Clean Heat Standard was published
by MassDEP in fall 2023 that built on the agency’s stakeholder process to solicit input on the
program design. Proposed reporting regulations for heating fuels that would support a Clean Heat
Standard were shared for public comment, and the agency anticipates issuing final regulations for
public comment in SFY25. The reporting regulation will help inform the development of the Clean
Heat Standard. More information on the Clean Heat Standard Program development can be found
here: https://www.mass.gov/info-details/clean-heat-standard-program-development.
Expanding Air Quality monitoring sensors and data
MassDEP expanded air quality monitoring in environmental justice areas and continued to enhance
its air monitoring and community-based air sensor efforts in environmental justice areas. The
agency added four ultrafine particle (UFP) monitors at its monitoring stations in Boston (Von
Hillern Street), Chelmsford, Boston-Chinatown, and Springfield to enhance particle pollution
monitoring in or near urban EJ population areas near high traffic roadways. MassDEP awarded 213
fine particulate matter (PM2.5) air quality sensors to 27 municipalities and community-based
organizations. The new sensors, which are funded by the Massachusetts Office of Environmental
Justice and Equity, will be deployed across the state with a majority installed in Environmental
Justice areas. The newest monitoring stations, with PM2.5 and black carbon monitor capability, are
located in EJ populations - Saugus and Framingham. The monitor in Framingham became
operational on January 1, 2025 and the agency anticipates installation of the Saugus monitor in
spring 2025.

• Support for Electric Vehicles and Charging Stations. MassDEP administers a grant
program to increase deployment of electric vehicles called the Massachusetts Electric
Vehicle Incentive Program (MassEVIP). This program has been funded through the
Volkswagen emissions settlement and other sources. MassDEP allocated the maximum
allowable amount (15%) of the Volkswagen funds to light-duty electric vehicle
charging equipment. In SFY24 the agency distributed $5,334,871 from the settlement fund.
• ResilientMass Plan. MassDEP continued to advance initiatives directed by EEA and
Executive Office of Public Safety as part of the ResilientMass Plan (formerly known as the
State Hazard Mitigation and Climate Adaptation Plan). The updated ResilientMass Plan
released in the fall 2023 includes important resiliency initiatives led by MassDEP. Actions
include developing a statewide hydraulic tool for designing stream crossings, providing
municipal technical GIS mapping assistance for water utilities, developing a clean heat
standard for heating fuels, and updating wetlands erosion control and restoration guidance.
See the action tracker for these projects here: ResilientMass Action Tracker
• No Net Loss of Carbon. As a commitment under the Massachusetts Clean Energy and
Climate Plan for 2025 and 2030 (2022), EEA and MassDEP conducted the No Net Loss of
Carbon in Wetlands Project to evaluate the carbon sequestration function of wetlands and
develop strategies to achieve the goal of No Net Loss of Carbon in Wetlands in
Massachusetts. MassDEP is evaluating the report’s findings and will recommend policy and
regulatory strategies for improved protection of wetlands and mitigation for wetland
carbon impacts.
• Gap Energy Grants. MassDEP’s Clean Energy Results Program continued to oversee
deployment of $8.1 million provided through 62 Gap Energy Grants to wastewater and
drinking water systems, nonprofit organizations and small businesses providing affordable
multifamily housing, and food distribution or production facilities. The grants help “fill the
financial gap” to enable energy efficiency and clean energy generation projects to move
forward. The grants improve emergency response capacity, resilience in extreme weather,
and energy and greenhouse gas emissions reductions.
• Guidance for Resilient Wetlands Restoration. MassDEP convened interagency and
stakeholder work groups to evaluate salt marsh restoration approaches and to clarify
permitting processes under the Wetlands Protection Act and related permit requirements
(e.g., 401, Chapter 91). With input from those partners, MassDEP developed final guidance
on runnels, ditch remediation, and marsh islands. Draft guidance on sediment augmentation
methods (i.e., Thin-Layer-Placement and Passive Sediment Augmentation) is expected to be
completed in SFY25. MassDEP is preparing proposed revisions to its wetlands regulations
that facilitate the use of these practices for wetlands restoration, encourage control of
invasive species, and promote restoration of retired or abandoned cranberry bogs.
MassDEP, with EEA, is preparing to a stakeholder process to help streamline the permitting
process while maintaining necessary wetlands resource protections.
• Statewide Hydraulic Model for Climate Resilient Stream Crossings. Many of the 25,000-
plus roadway crossing structures (small bridges and culverts) that convey rivers and
MassDEP SFY24
Fees Report

streams under roads in Massachusetts are undersized. This results in substantial impacts to
fish and wildlife movement and habitat. Undersized structures also lack the capacity to
withstand floods, especially given the increasing intensity and frequency of flooding.
MassDEP is developing a Statewide Hydraulic Model that will assist municipalities and
other owners of crossing structures by facilitating permitting and design of stream
crossings that are resilient for flood flows and that better meet wetlands stream crossing
standards for aquatic organism passage. This multi-year project is one of the ResilientMass
Plan action projects that MassDEP is leading.
Multi-Media Challenge - PFAS
Per– and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are chemicals that have been used in a wide variety of
consumer products over many years and, because of their chemical structure, do not readily break
down in the environment. Increasing concerns about the effects of PFAS on public health and the
environment continue to spur action at the federal and state levels and prompt research aimed at
better understanding the effects of these substances. Addressing PFAS in Massachusetts continues
to be a major focus for MassDEP.
MassDEP monitored new research and actions by the United States Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA) in implementing its PFAS Strategic Roadmap, as well as proposed legislation and
other developments in other states. Our understanding of PFAS’ effects on human health and the
environment continue to advance rapidly into areas beyond drinking water. MassDEP has worked
to evaluate and take steps to develop multimedia responses for PFAS in wastewater, biosolids and
landfill leachate. Sites identified as contaminated with PFAS under the Chapter 21E program are
being managed to remediate soil and groundwater contamination. MassDEP continues to follow the
developing science, including investigation and monitoring techniques, and proposed standards at
the federal level. MassDEP will continue to design programmatic strategies for Massachusetts to
protect human health and the environment such as those identified below.
Drinking Water Protection and PFAS
• In SFY24, the MassDEP Office of Research and Standards reviewed new research and
information as part of the agency’s work to complete the three-year review of the 2020
Massachusetts drinking water regulations that created PFAS maximum contaminant levels
(MCLs). The “triennial review” was informed by EPA’s release of its federal MCL for six PFAS
in April 2024. Reviewing the state of the science for the Massachusetts MCLs and potential
updates to Massachusetts drinking water regulations.
• MassDEP continues to assist public water systems (PWSs) in monitoring and
implementation of the Massachusetts drinking water standards for six PFAS compounds.
PFAS testing results from PWSs are available to the public on the web in the EEA data
portal.
MassDEP SFY24
Fees Report

• MassDEP’s Drinking Water Program worked with 175 PWSs with PFAS testing results that
exceeded the Massachusetts drinking water standards. MassDEP staff conducted
compliance assistance, issued enforcement documents, reviewed long term corrective
action plans, and issued permits for construction of treatment plants, new water mains and
removal of wells from service to address PFAS contamination.
• Over the past four years, 71 new or modified treatment facilities have been constructed to
remove PFAS from drinking water. More information about PFAS in Massachusetts drinking
water can be found in the story map on the MassDEP webpage, available at
https://www.mass.gov/info-details/per-and-polyfluoroalkyl-substances-pfas#pfas-
detected-in-drinking-water-supplies-in-massachusetts
• The MassDEP Drinking Water Program continues to work with PWSs to anticipate the
system requirements and follow the new EPA drinking water standards for PFAS. MassDEP
secured a $38 million grant for Federal FYs 2022 and 2023 and a $19 million grant for FFY
2024 from the EPA through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to address emerging
contaminants in public drinking water in small and disadvantaged communities. MassDEP
is distributing grants to public water suppliers and developing initiatives to improve their
capacities to address emerging contaminants.
PFAS Site Identification, Assessment and Remediation
• MassDEP’s Bureau of Waste Site Cleanup focused on the identification, assessment, and
remediation of known sites with PFAS contamination under the Massachusetts Contingency
Plan (MCP). Its work included identifying—through review of assessment results and
expanded investigations—likely sources of PFAS impacting drinking water resources and
directing responsible parties to undertake response actions to further assess and remediate
these sites.
• The Bureau of Waste Site Cleanup reviewed and approved actions to address sudden
releases of PFAS (e.g., following the use of PFAS-containing aqueous film forming foam for
fire suppression) and assessment and remedial plans to address PFAS at state and federal
sites.
• A total of 176 PFAS sites have been identified in Massachusetts as of September 2024. Fifty-
three of these are associated with public water sources and 49 are located in an
Environmental Justice area.
MassDEP SFY24

• In cases where responsible parties have yet to be identified or were unwilling or unable to
conduct necessary actions, the Bureau of Waste Site Cleanup engaged contractors to
mitigate Imminent Hazard levels of PFAS in private wells by installing treatment systems
and providing bottled water in the interim.
Support for PFAS Treatment through the State Revolving Loan Fund
• The MassDEP State Revolving Loan Fund Program (SRF) and the Clean Water Trust
continued to assist Public Water Suppliers addressing PFAS contamination. The SRF offered
zero percent interest loans for construction projects to remove PFAS from drinking water,
including the construction of treatment facilities and new water mains. Approximately $342
million in loans and loan commitments have been issued. More information is available at
https://www.mass.gov/info-details/zero-interest-pfas-mitigation-loans.
PFAS in Wastewater and Biosolids
• MassDEP has required PFAS sampling and analysis of wastewater and biosolids through
permit modifications. Data reported in accordance with MassDEP surface water discharge
permits and biosolids or residuals approvals are required to be uploaded to an online data
portal that is available to the public at
https://eeaonline.eea.state.ma.us/portal#!/search/npdes.
• MassDEP is evaluating options for the management of wastewater residuals that contain
PFAS. A data gathering exercise to learn the “state of the state” for Massachusetts sludge,
where it goes, and how it is managed (Part 1 of a comprehensive study) was conducted in
SFY24. This study is the foundation for Part 2, being conducted in SFY25, in which
additional analyses of biosolids management in Massachusetts will be performed including
MassDEP SFY24
Fees Report

impacts of PFAS on sludge disposal options, and policy and regulatory recommendations for
MassDEP to consider.
Sampling Surface Waters for PFAS
• In collaboration with the United States Geological Survey (USGS), MassDEP initiated a
second study of PFAS concentrations in rivers at nine locations. Sampling was conducted
upstream and downstream of wastewater treatment plants, as well as samples of influent,
effluent and biosolids at these facilities. MassDEP also initiated a third study collaborating
with USGS of PFAS concentrations in sewer collection systems at six locations. This work
began in SFY24 and will continue in SFY25.
Solid Waste – Sampling for PFAS at Landfills
• MassDEP’s Bureau of Air and Waste (BAW) responded to issues related to PFAS
contamination from landfills. As MassDEP identifies or becomes aware of drinking water
contamination, BAW works collaboratively with the Bureau of Water Resources to identify
potential sources of contamination, including landfills that may be in proximity to a
drinking water source. If a landfill is determined to be a possible source of PFAS, monitoring
well testing is conducted. If the source of PFAS is confirmed, remediation activities are
pursued. BAW anticipates that additional landfills will be identified for investigation as
potential contributors of PFAS contamination as more public and private residential well
water testing is conducted.
• BAW initiated a proactive effort to assess potential landfill contamination of drinking water
sources at a number of landfills. Sampling at selected prioritized landfills began in SFY24
and is ongoing.
Collection and Destruction of Firefighting Foam Containing PFAS
• MassDEP has managed collection and destruction of legacy PFAS-containing fire-fighting
foams through its “Take Back” program since 2018. With an additional $250,000 in funding
from the legislature, the program was extended to ensure that PFAS containing foam is not
released to the environment.
• Through June 2024, more than 400,000 pounds (or over 47,000 gallons) of foam have been
collected from 157 fire departments and facilities across the Commonwealth. MassDEP
intends to continue the Take Back Program in SFY25 and to undertake efforts to assure
continued awareness of its availability.
Laboratory PFAS Support, Research, and Risk Communication
• MassDEP’s Laboratory Certification Program continued to offer certification to interested
laboratories to test drinking water for PFAS and to support public water suppliers.
• MassDEP’s Wall Experiment Station, Division of Environmental Laboratory Sciences and the
Office of Research and Standards worked to expand the agency’s analytical capacity for
PFAS in multiple media through analytical equipment upgrades, increasing staff capabilities
and operationalizing additional PFAS methods.

• The Office of Research and Standards, the Drinking Water Program, and MassDEP’s
Regional Offices have provided extensive risk communication assistance to municipalities,
Boards of Health, public water systems and the public regarding PFAS detections and
exceedances of the Massachusetts drinking water standards. Assistance has included web-
based information, assessment and communication of risks posed by PFAS detections in
private water supplies and smaller public supplies, participation in public meetings and
hearings and assistance in preparing public notices.
Recommendations of the Interagency PFAS Task Force; Monitoring Legislation
• A legislatively established Interagency PFAS Task Force released its Final Report in April
2022 after nine public hearings and testimony from a variety of stakeholders and experts.
The Final Report included several recommendations related to MassDEP programs,
including increased funding for PFAS detection and remediation, funding for treatment of
PFAS in drinking water, expanding the scope of regulatory control to additional substances,
and encouraging private well testing and remediation.
• Since the Report’s release a variety of bills have been filed related to PFAS, and MassDEP
continues to monitor legislative developments that would implement the recommendations
from the Task Force. The report and more information on the Task Force can be found here:
https://www.malegislature.gov/Commissions/Detail/556/Documents.

Recycling and Solid Waste
In SFY24, MassDEP continued to implement the 2030 Solid Waste Master Plan – Working Together
Toward Zero Waste. New, ambitious state-level waste reduction goals that align with our carbon
emission reduction programs, invest in innovation, and enhance ongoing engagement with
communities across the Commonwealth were established in the Plan as well as regulation. Key
disposal and recycling goals include:
• Reduce disposal statewide by 30 percent by 2030 (from 5.7 million tons in 2018 to 4 million
tons); and
• Achieve a 90 percent reduction in disposal by 2050 (from 5.7 million tons to 570,000 tons).
The Solid Waste Master Plan and accompanying regulatory changes expanded landfill disposal
waste bans for certain materials, setting a lower threshold for landfill disposal of organic materials
and establishing new bans on disposal of mattresses and textiles. In the first year of
implementation, from 2022 to 2023, these new waste bans and supporting programs resulted in
more than doubling mattress recycling from 170,000 to 400,000 mattresses, increased recovery of
MassDEP SFY24
Fees Report
12

food materials by 6 percent, and increased recovery of textiles by 7 percent. Further progress is
expected in continuing years of implementation as education and funding efforts grow.
The Solid Waste Master Plan also includes initiatives to strengthen engagement with and support of
environmental justice communities, including:
• increasing engagement with environmental justice populations in all phases of MassDEP’s
regulatory process;
• improving recycling grant evaluation criteria to recognize environmental justice
community issues;
• promoting small-scale composting assistance to enable composting at community gardens
in environmental justice areas;
• and promoting and encouraging the use of electric and hybrid trash and recycling collection
vehicles in environmental justice communities.
MassDEP continues to focus on helping municipalities confront limited landfill capacity and a
recycling market that has changed significantly in recent years, through a variety of technical and
financial assistance programs. Supporting these programs, as well as expanding recycling capacity
and reducing contamination of materials to be recycled, is intended to drive innovation in these
areas to move the Commonwealth toward a zero-waste future.
The Solid Waste Master Plan announced increased recycling business development grants and a
new recycling research and development grant program to drive innovation in recycling and waste
reduction. In SFY24 MassDEP awarded $5,186,340 million in grants, technical assistance and
education services to municipalities to advance recycling (Sustainable Materials Recovery
Program) and $1,078,000 million in technical assistance and grants to advance business recycling
and support/expand the recycling industry (Recycling Business Development Grants) in
Massachusetts.

Addressing Nitrogen Pollution and Improving Water Quality
In July 2023, MassDEP promulgated revisions to the “Title 5” Regulations at 310 CMR 15.000 to
designate Natural Resource Areas (coastal embayments) that are impaired by nitrogen pollution as
Nitrogen Sensitive Areas. MassDEP also promulgated a complementary set of new regulations
establishing a Watershed Permitting Program at 314 CMR 21.00. The revisions in both programs
represent an innovative and needed step forward to control nitrogen pollution and improve water
quality. MassDEP worked closely with Cape Cod municipalities and other governmental entities as
they developed applications for watershed permits to reduce nitrogen pollution in their
MassDEP SFY24
Fees Report
13

watersheds. Thirteen Cape Cod municipalities have filed one or more of the following: (1) a Notice
of Intent that they intend to file a Watershed Permit Application; (2) a Watershed Permit
Application, or (3) a Request for a De Minimis Load Exemption. MassDEP supported this initiative
with $600,000 in grants in SFY24 and will increase that support in SFY25 to $825,000.
Bipartisan Infrastructure Law Investment in Massachusetts
Approximately $935 million dollars is expected to be available to invest in our communities from
the federal government through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL) over a period of five years
(2022-2026). The funding is primarily directed through the State Revolving Loan Fund (SRF)
Program and will supplement the annual EPA capitalization grants that fund the SRF programs. The
2024 SRF Intended Use Plans reflect this additional funding and are available online here: 2024
Final SRF Intended Use Plans | Mass.gov. Massachusetts offered over $1.4 billion to finance 168
water infrastructure projects across the Commonwealth in calendar year 2024. The map below
shows the SRF 2024 Intended Use Plan distribution of SRF funding ($939 million for Clean Water
SRF projects and $506 million for Drinking Water SRF projects).

The SRF project solicitation opens in May of each year. Information on how to apply can be found in
MassDEP’s website at https://www.mass.gov/state-revolving-fund-srf-loan-program.
Long Island Sound Grant
In September 2022, MassDEP was awarded a $10.5M grant from the U.S. EPA for Long Island Sound
Watershed Nutrient Reduction, available from Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL) funds. The
objective of this project is to support nitrogen reduction to Massachusetts waterbodies that are in
the Long Island Sound watershed through nitrogen reduction upgrades to wastewater treatment
facilities in Massachusetts municipalities with environmental justice populations. These funds were
payable over 3 years. In SFY23 MassDEP distributed $8.47 million to support nitrogen reduction
projects at two wastewater treatment plants. In SFY23 MassDEP also began a workplan to expend
the final $2 million from the initial award. In SFY24 MassDEP’s workplan was submitted requesting
a total of $12 million of additional funding for eligible publicly owned treatment works seeking
financial assistance for denitrification upgrades. The Management Committee awarded MassDEP
$10.6 million to be allocated over FFY25 and FFY26 distributed in a manner determined by
MassDEP. MassDEP elected to utilize $2.5 million for FFY25 in readily applicable projects and $8.1
million for FFY26 within a workplan yet to be developed.
Remediating Lead in School Drinking Water
The MassDEP Water-Smart Program (formerly the Expanded Assistance Program) provides
technical assistance to public and private schools and childcare facilities to establish a lead in
drinking water monitoring program. In SFY24, MassDEP received EPA funding of $1,890,000 to
support education and outreach for this program. MassDEP’s technical assistance helps schools and
facilities develop a site-specific sampling plan, provides lab analysis of samples taken at taps and
water fountains used for drinking and cooking, assists with the identification of fixtures with lead
concentrations over the laboratory analytical testing limit of 1 part per billion (ppb), and
recommends possible remedial actions. The Program operates in conjunction with the University of
Massachusetts-Amherst’s Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering and with the support
of partners, including the state’s Department of Public Health, Department of Elementary and
Secondary Education, Department of Early Education and Care, and the Massachusetts Water
Resources Authority.
After facilities receive their sampling results, they are encouraged to take remedial actions at any
location with levels of lead above the lab testing limit and to communicate the results and short-
term action plans to parents and staff. Facilities communicate this information through emails,
automated informational calls, letters, website postings, printed postings, newspaper articles, and
meetings. Actions taken to address lead levels include removing and replacing fixtures, using
MassDEP SFY24

signage to indicate fixtures that are not intended to be used for drinking water, and implementing
water line flushing programs.
In SFY24, the Water-Smart Program:
• Tested 3,386 outlets in 84 schools and 2,731 outlets in 273 childcare facilities;
• Tested 28 private schools through funding from the Clean Water Trust to support testing of
private schools;
• Worked with 6 public water systems to test 69 schools and childcare facilities through a
pilot program to increase participation and assist systems in meeting upcoming federal
requirements on lead testing;
• Sent filtered water pitchers to 124 participating childcare facilities;
• Expanded our agency’s outreach efforts, including:
o Increasing social media posts,
o Sending physical postcard mailers, and
o Coordinating with partner organizations,
• Rebranded from the Expanded Assistance Program to the Water-Smart Program; and
• Conducted Spanish language meetings with small groups of childcare providers.
Complementing the Water-Smart Program, the Clean Water Trust operates its School Water
Improvement Grant (SWIG) program. SWIG covers the cost of water bottle filling stations to
address detections of lead in drinking water at eligible schools and childcare facilities using $5
million allocated by the Trust and nearly $3 million awarded through a U.S. EPA grant. In SFY24,
SWIG provided grants totaling $156,000 for the purchase of 52 bottle filling stations in 24 school
districts.
More information on the Water-Smart Program is available here:
https://www.mass.gov/assistance-program-for-lead-in-school-drinking-water. More information

Developing a Modern Information Technology System
MassDEP’s information technology system is part of EEA’s enterprise-wide framework for
information management. The agency vision includes the Energy and Environmental Information
and Public Access System (EIPAS) a multi-year integrated, shared service platform intended to
modernize existing systems and to add new functionality based on MassDEP’s evolving data needs.
Modernized applications enable MassDEP to improve transparency and better serve the public
through shared data and online tools. The agency continues to build upon its successes, having
added the citizen data portal and providing a secretariat-wide and agency-wide paperless online
permitting platform. MassDEP is continuing to add functionality to its systems and completed
updates to our integrated compliance and enforcement platform that supports many of our agency
programs.

V. Summary of the significant improvements in permitting and
compliance programs
MassDEP’s online system (Accela) is available for nearly all agency permits, enabling online
application submittals. A few permits still are managed with outdated technological systems which
MassDEP is planning to replace, pending funding availability
MassDEP is in the process of designing a permitting webpage and re-establishing a Permitting
Assistance and Management Office. This effort is one of the actions stemming from our Permitting
Evaluation done in collaboration with the Lieutenant Governor’s Office.
Online permit application and processing provides multiple benefits:
• The online system checks to ensure minimum requirements are met, thereby improving
administrative completeness of submittals, and timely issuance.
• Permits can be paid online, resulting in immediate start dates of permit timelines.
• “Online portals” enable the applicant and regulated entities to view the permit application
Search EEA Projects (mass.gov) and search all permit decisions online . EEA Data Portal
(state.ma.us).
• MassDEP’s webpage provides guidance on MassDEP permitting, including a
MassDEP Guide for Online Permitting (MassDEP Guide for Online Permitting |
Mass.gov) which includes information regarding the agency’s “money back”
guarantee. MassDEP offers this guarantee: A timely decision or you are eligible for a
refund. The agency has permit category-specific timelines for acting on the
applications it receives for permits, licenses, plan approvals, registrations,
determinations and other approvals.
