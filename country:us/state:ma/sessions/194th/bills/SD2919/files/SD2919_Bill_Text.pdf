451-25(1)-Bristol-N. Dartmouth-Modular Building-Report 3-17-25 Page 5 of 6

Section 3: Areas EHRS did not inspect
EHRS inspected all areas of the facility.
SECTION 4: Plan of Correction
This facility does not comply with the Department’s Regulations cited above. In accordance with 105 CMR 451.404, please
submit a plan of correction within 10 working days of receipt of this notice. The Plan of Correction must include:
1. Specific corrective steps to be taken
2. A timetable for the corrective actions for larger projects
3. The date by which correction will be achieved
4. Any interim measures being implemented to ensure the health and safety of incarcerated individuals and facility
staff
5. The plan should be signed by the Superintendent or Administrator and submitted to my attention, at the address
listed above.
SECTION 4: Observations and Recommendations
1. The inmate population was 190 at the time of inspection.
2. During the inspection, EHRS found many shower identification tags damaged or painted over making them difficult
or impossible to read. EHRS recommended implementing a numbering system for all toilet and shower stalls to
allow EHRS and Correctional staff to better recognize where issues exist.
3. Throughout the facility, bathrooms and shower areas were observed to be poorly maintained resulting in
unsanitary conditions. EHRS is concerned with the increased risk of disease transmission with the high number of
inmates being exposed to such unsanitary conditions. EHRS recommend ensuring all bathroom and shower areas
are finished with smooth and easily cleanable surfaces as well as developing a higher frequency shower cleaning
policy.
To review the specific regulatory requirements please visit our website at www.mass.gov/dph/dcs and click on

food standards, you can download the merged food code, which can be found here.
An inspection may also include observations of other conditions which could constitute a threat to the health or safety of
inmates or employees, including but not limited to the standards set forth by the Department as follows, and report on
such pursuant to 451.402(B). You can use these links below to review these standards:
• 105 CMR 205.000: Minimum Standards Governing Medical Records and Conduct of Physical Examinations in
Correctional Facilities

SECTION 2: Areas Found to be in Compliance
EHRS inspected 19 additional areas of the facility which were found to be in compliance.
Section 3: Areas EHRS did not inspect
EHRS inspected all areas of the facility.
SECTION 4: Plan of Correction
This facility does not comply with the Department’s Regulations cited above. In accordance with 105 CMR 451.404, please
submit a plan of correction within 10 working days of receipt of this notice. The Plan of Correction must include:
1. Specific corrective steps to be taken
2. A timetable for the corrective actions for larger projects
3. The date by which correction will be achieved
4. Any interim measures being implemented to ensure the health and safety of incarcerated individuals and facility
staff
5. The plan should be signed by the Superintendent or Administrator and submitted to my attention, at the address
listed above.
SECTION 4: Observations and Recommendations
1. The inmate population was 190 at the time of inspection.
2. During the inspection, EHRS found many shower identification tags damaged or painted over making them difficult
or impossible to read. EHRS recommended implementing a numbering system for all toilet and shower stalls to
allow EHRS and Correctional staff to better recognize where issues exist.
3. Throughout the facility, bathrooms and shower areas were observed to be poorly maintained resulting in
unsanitary conditions. EHRS is concerned with the increased risk of disease transmission with the high number of
inmates being exposed to such unsanitary conditions. EHRS recommend ensuring all bathroom and shower areas
are finished with smooth and easily cleanable surfaces as well as developing a higher frequency shower cleaning
policy.
