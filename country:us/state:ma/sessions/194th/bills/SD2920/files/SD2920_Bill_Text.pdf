SECTION 2: Areas Found to be in Compliance
EHRS inspected 153 additional areas of the facility which were found to be in compliance.
Section 3: Areas EHRS did not inspect
EHRS did not inspect 8 areas of the facility because they were either in use, locked, or under construction.
1. EC Unit Shower – 2nd Floor Unable to Inspect – In Use
2. EC Unit Showers – 1st Floor Unable to Inspect Shower # 1 – In Use
3. ED Unit Unable to Inspect – Under Construction
4. EB Unit – Female Unable to Inspect – Under Construction
5. GA Unit Unable to Inspect – Closed
6. GB Unit Unable to Inspect – Closed
7. GC Unit – Former Gym Medical Room Unable to Inspect – Locked
8. K9 Unit Unable to Inspect – Locked
SECTION 4: Plan of Correction
This facility does not comply with the Department’s Regulations cited above. In accordance with 105 CMR 451.404,
please submit a plan of correction within 10 working days of receipt of this notice. The Plan of Correction must include:
1. Specific corrective steps to be taken
2. A timetable for the corrective actions for larger projects
3. The date by which correction will be achieved
4. Any interim measures being implemented to ensure the health and safety of incarcerated individuals and facility
staff
5. The plan should be signed by the Superintendent or Administrator and submitted to my attention, at the address
listed above.
SECTION 5: Observations and Recommendations
1. The inmate population was 288 at the time of inspection.
2. During the inspection, EHRS found many shower identification tags damaged or painted over making them
difficult or impossible to read. EHRS recommended implementing a numbering system to all toilet and shower
stalls to allow EHRS and Correctional staff to better recognize where issues exist.
3. Throughout the facility, bathrooms and shower areas were observed to be poorly maintained resulting in
unsanitary conditions. EHRS is concerned with the increased risk of disease transmission with the high number
of inmates being exposed to such unsanitary conditions. EHRS recommend ensuring all bathroom and shower
areas are finished with smooth and easily cleanable surfaces as well as developing a higher frequency shower
cleaning policy.
4. Unit GA and GB are both closed until further notice for security reasons. EHRS was informed that these units will
undergo extensive renovations before being re-opened. EHRS asks to be kept apprised of any plans to re-open
these units.
