Supplier Diversity Office
Comprehensive Annual Report
Fiscal Year 2024

To: Governor Healey, Lieutenant Governor Driscoll, Members of the General Court, Cabinet Secretaries,
Agency Heads, Secretariat and Agency Supplier Diversity Officers
From: Bonnie Borch-Rote, Executive Director, Supplier Diversity Office
________________________________________________________________________________________
As the new Executive Director of the Supplier Diversity Office (SDO), I am honored to present our
Comprehensive Annual Report for Fiscal Year 2024 (FY2024). The SDO’s mission is to promote diversity in state
contracting and increase opportunities for underrepresented businesses.
Consistent with the directives in MGL c. 7, § 61 and Executive Order 599, the SDO provides certification,
programs, training services, and access to business opportunities and resources for Minority (MBE), Women
(WBE), Veteran (VBE), Service-Disabled Veteran (SDVOBE), Disability (DOBE), and Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and
Transgender (LGBTBE)-owned businesses, as well as small Massachusetts businesses. The SDO also
collaborates with procurement officials and resource organizations to further its mission.
The accompanying report details the Commonwealth’s diverse and small business programs, including the
Certification, Supplier Diversity (SDP), Small Business Purchasing (SBPP), Affirmative Marketing (AMP and
MCAMP), and Individuals with Disabilities programs.
In addition to Executive Branch agency results, this report includes narrative descriptions of supplier diversity
programs and/or results from 18 Commonwealth quasi-public/non-executive organizations and seven
constitutional/quasi-public/non-executive organizations participating in quantitative sections of this report.
Here are some of the spending highlights from the attached FY2024 Annual Report:
• Growth in total diverse spending. The Commonwealth spent approximately $3.78 billion with diverse and
small businesses (a 11.88% increase over FY2023), which includes:
o Discretionary (or program) spending by Commonwealth agencies through SDP, SBPP, and
DCAMM’s AMP programs of approximately $2.58 billion (a 20.32% increase over FY2023)
o Nondiscretionary (or non-program) spending of approximately $1.19 billion (a 2.86% decrease
from FY2023).
In addition, this report documents more than $51.36 million in spending on state-funded municipal
construction projects overseen by the SDO’s Municipal Construction Affirmative Marketing Program
(MCAMP) and more than $200 million in spending by quasi-public organizations who submitted program
narratives. The combined impact of all these efforts is approximately $4 billion in Commonwealth public
spending with diverse and small businesses.
• Growth in spending by category. In FY2024, discretionary SDP spending grew in all SDO categories when
compared to FY2023.
2

• Existing Benchmark performance. SDP Program participants exceeded spending benchmarks for MBE,
WBE, and SBPP by 1.23%, 60.52%, and 51.16%, respectively. The Commonwealth continued its efforts to
meet its ambitious veteran-owned business benchmark. While eleven participating offices did meet the
veteran spending benchmark, the Commonwealth as a whole did not meet it. However, VBE spending
with participating offices did increase overall by .4%.
• New Benchmark performance. In addition to the long-standing benchmarks for MBE, WBE, SBPP, and
VBE, FY2024 saw the establishment of benchmarks for DOBE and LGBTBE, set at $18 million (or .3%) each.
Executive Branch agencies met the DOBE benchmark, exceeding it by more than $8 million. While
spending with LGBTBEs did grow by 56.39% over FY2023, the new benchmark was not met. Twelve
participating offices, including the Office of the Governor, met the LGBTBE spending benchmark
individually, contributing to the overall growth in spend with LGBTBE firms.
• Spending by race/ethnicity. Overall, MBE spending grew from FY2023 to FY2024 by $33.13 million, $15.53
million from an increase in direct spending and $17.61 million from growth in business partnership
spending.
Other highlights include:
• Number of certified and recognized businesses. Overall, the SDO added 214 new diverse businesses to
its directory (a 4% increase over FY2023).
• Training internal and external stakeholders. The SDO’s training program continued to develop and deliver
sessions to diverse and small bidders, prime contractors, executive agencies, and other public purchasers.
It participated in pre-bid conferences, contractor onboardings, and contract kick-off sessions for buyers.
• Increased compliance efforts. The SDO continued to expand its compliance efforts to ensure the integrity
of diverse and small business programs. The Spending Compliance Verification program engaged 1,188
unique certified diverse businesses to verify 1,741 reporting line items submitted by prime contractors.
The program verified spend exceeding $404 million in reported spending, a 24% increase compared to
FY2023.
• Continuation of the “SDO Means Business” campaign and Cross Functional Team. The Cross Functional
Team (CFT) continued to implement a focused, intentional approach to promoting opportunities for
diverse and small businesses. In FY2024, their efforts resulted in a 45% increase in SDO certified and/or
SBPP participant vendors on the statewide and departmental contracts promoted by the CFT.
• Expanded outreach. The SDO Programs and Engagement Team conducted more than 250 one-on-one
technical assistance sessions with diverse and small business owners. In addition, SDO staff attended
and/or presented at more than 150 events geared toward assisting small and diverse businesses,
agencies, and other interested parties.
My team and I look forward to building upon the legacy, innovation, and leadership the SDO has provided as
we continue to promote diversity, equity, and inclusion in the Commonwealth’s public procurement and
contracting processes.

Introduction
This report and the summary of accomplishments included in the transmittal letter provide an overview of the
FY2024 activities and accomplishments of the Supplier Diversity Office (SDO). Together, they present
comprehensive information on diverse and small business spending across the wide range of Commonwealth
departments and quasi-public organizations and their programs.
SDO Overview
The Commonwealth of Massachusetts spends billions of dollars each year on goods, services, and construction.
The role of the SDO is to certify, provide resources for, and support diverse and small businesses in competing
for contracts being bid across the Commonwealth. The state’s diversity programs include firms certified as
Minority1 (MBE), Women (WBE), Veteran (VBE), Service-Disabled Veteran (SDVOBE), Disability (DOBE), and
Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender (LGBTBE)-Owned Business Enterprises.2 The SDO works to build a more
inclusive supplier base for the Commonwealth through the following programs:
• State Certification Program
• Supplier Diversity Program (SDP)
• Small Business Purchasing Program (SBPP)
• Commonwealth and Municipal Construction Affirmative Marketing Programs (MCAMP)
• Individuals with Disabilities in State Procurement and Contracting Program
1 The term Minority Business Enterprise or MBE is defined in statute as a business that is owned by a racially or ethnically diverse
individual. While the terms Minority and MBE are meant to define an ethnically or racially diverse individual or business respectively,
they are not meant to denote a smaller or lesser status of the individuals or businesses included in this definition.
2 The SDO’s State Certification Unit reviews applications for certification as MBE, WBE, VBE, Portuguese-Owned Business Enterprises
(PBE), and combinations thereof, as well as Minority (M/NPO), Women (W/NPO), and Veteran (V/NPO) Nonprofit Organizations. The
SDO also accepts certifications issued by recognized third-party certifying organizations for MBE, WBE, VBE, SDVOBE, DOBE, and
LGBTBE business enterprises. While the SDO does certify PBEs, there are limited opportunities for PBEs to participate in the state’s
diversity programs as described in 425 CMR 2.02.

SDO Organizational Development
SDO Mission Statement
The mission of the SDO is to promote diversity, equity, and inclusion in state contracting by:
1. Certifying diverse businesses (minority, women, veteran, service-disabled veteran, disability, and LGBT-
owned) and small Massachusetts-based businesses;
2. Connecting these companies with business opportunities and resources that enhance their marketability
when bidding on public contracts; and
3. Collaborating with Executive Agencies and public organizations to:
a. Identify and remove barriers for diverse and small businesses; and
b. Increase diverse and small business spending.
SDO Commitment to Staff Diversity
In support of the Governor’s goal of making state government representative of the constituents we serve and
making it a great place to work for all its employees, the SDO:
• Continued its commitment to its Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Vision Statement, issued in FY2023:
Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) are critical to our organization and to the success of the diverse and
small businesses that we represent. In fact, Diversity is in our name and it is what unites us! Ultimately,
we believe we can only achieve our vision, mission, and goals with a demonstrated commitment, through
words and actions, to DEI. We continuously seek to deepen our understanding of and perspective on the
barriers and challenges facing those we serve, many of which are rooted in long-standing patterns of
social inequities, exclusions, and divisions. Equally important, when we recruit, hire, and retain diverse
talent that reflects the diverse businesses that we serve and when we foster an environment where the
unique skills, capabilities, viewpoints, and dissenting opinions of all employees are valued, we enhance
belonging, empathy, creativity, and ultimately innovation.
• Continued to prioritize the recruitment, hiring, and retention of diverse candidates to ensure its staff
reflect the diverse businesses the SDO serves; and
• Continued to be one of the most diverse agencies in state government with the following representation
in FY2024:
o 75.5% Women
o 49.1% Persons of Color
o 6.1% Veterans and
o 12.3% Individuals with Disabilities

SDO Innovation
One of the keys to the SDO’s success has been our focus on promoting innovation in everything we do. Below
are some examples of innovative measures implemented by the SDO in FY2024.
New LGBT and DOBE Benchmarks
In June of 2023, the Healey-Driscoll Administration announced the launch of two new supplier diversity
benchmarks. Specifically, an overall benchmark of $18 million (or .3%) was set for each of the SDO’s newest
diverse business categories, DOBE and LGBTBE. FY2024 was thus the first time spend with these businesses was
measured against set benchmark goals since they were introduced into the SDO’s programming in FY2016.
Overall, the Commonwealth saw discretionary spend increase in both categories (18.26% for DOBEs and 56.39%
for LGBTBEs). However, only the DOBE benchmark goal was met in FY2024. The SDO will continue our work to
increase opportunities for these businesses and support the achievement of the LGBTBE spending benchmark.
SDO IT Infrastructure Innovations and Growth
The Supplier Diversity Hub
The future of fairness and equity in state contracting became more accessible in FY2023 with the launch of the
SDO’s Supplier Diversity Hub (“Hub”). The Hub is designed to connect diverse and small businesses to prime
contractors and Commonwealth agencies and cities and towns. In FY2024, Executive Agencies were able to use
the Hub for their departmental contract vendors’ SDP reporting.
To promote this new way of reporting SDP spending, SDO Buyer Engagement, Training, and Policy team
members and SDO Compliance team members met with Executive Agencies regarding Hub adoption. The SDO
Training team conducted 10 buyer training sessions and nine contractor training sessions, resulting in a
combined total of 117 trained users. Soon, the Hub will eliminate the use of cumbersome spreadsheet reports.
The SDO will continue efforts to increase Hub usage and will continue to report on Hub implementation.
Certrak, the SDO’s Certification Tracking System
In FY2024, the SDO completed several projects to enhance our Certrak system and corresponding Directory of
Certified Businesses, including:
• Moving the SBPP registration from the Operational Services Division’s (OSD) COMMBUYS system to
the SDO’s Certrak system. This change allows the SDO to process all its small and diverse business
certifications through one system, reducing the administrative burden on businesses who apply for
both diverse certification as well as SBPP designation. Through an automatic interface, all SDO-
certified businesses who are also registered in COMMBUYS have their SDO categories displayed
within their COMMBUYS vendor profiles.3
• Working with the Division of Capital Asset Management and Maintenance (DCAMM) to
automatically tag DCAMM certified businesses in the SDO’s system. Because of this new interface,
SDO’s Directory of Certified Businesses now identifies whether an SDO certified firm is also certified
3 Since the master directory of SBPP businesses is now contained in Certrak with an interface to COMMBUYS-registered
businesses as applicable, this report will use “Small Businesses” to indicate SBPP member businesses. Previous SDO
Annual Reports used the terminology “COMMBUYS-Verified Small Businesses.”
9

with DCAMM’s Contractor Certification Program. Procurement officials and construction prime
contractors can utilize the SDO’s Directory to identify MBE and WBE DCAMM-certified vendors
without always having to check multiple directories.
• Making race and ethnicity information about SDO-certified businesses publicly accessible as of July
1, 2025. Vendors have the option to not have their information released.
Diverse and Small Business Advisory Board
Pursuant to Executive Order 599, the SDO appointed members to the first SDO Diverse and Small Business
Advisory Board, a voluntary board that provides guidance and advice to the SDO in fulfilling its mission to
promote equity and fairness in state contracting. The Board reflects the demographic and geographic diversity
of the Commonwealth and includes small and diverse business owners as well as representatives from
organizations that serve the SDO’s categories of small and diverse businesses. As of the publication of this
Annual Report, the Board members are:
Organization Representative
• Black Economic Council of Massachusetts (BECMA) Nicole Obi, President & CEO
• We Are ALX Eneida Román, President & CEO
• Asian Business Empowerment Council (ABEC) Qingjian (Q.J.) Shi, Director
• Center for Women & Enterprise New England Gaby King Morse, President & CEO
• Veterans Business Outreach Center Program for Ray Milano, Director
the U.S. Small Business Administration
• Collettey's Cookies Collette Divitto, CEO and COO
• MA LGBT Chamber of Commerce Keith Wang, Board of Directors
• M&A Supplier Diversity Consultants, LLC Maria Gonzalez, Founder & Managing Partner
• BDC Community Capital Corp Karim Hill, President and CEO
• Coalition for an Equitable Economy Tracye Whitfield, Executive Director
• Berkshire Black Economic Council A.J. Enchill, President and Executive Director
• ChopValue Boston Elaine Chow, Founder
• Greater New England Minority Supplier Joanne Wang, Director of Corporate Services
Development Council
• Mashpee Wampanoag Tribe Karen Edwards Siegel, Tribal Enrollment
• Western Mass Economic Development Council Xiomara Albán DeLobato, Vice President and
Chief of Staff
Meeting as a full Board Quarterly, and regularly in subcommittee meetings, the Board continues to be a valuable
resource for the SDO in furtherance of our mission to support small and diverse businesses. The SDO thanks all
our Board members for their continued service.

State Certification Program
One of the SDO’s primary services is to certify diverse and small businesses for participation in Massachusetts
statewide and departmental procurements for goods and services, as well as departmental and municipal non-
federally funded construction procurements.4 Each week, new businesses are certified, some businesses are
decertified, and some businesses withdraw their applications. Therefore, the exact number of certified
businesses fluctuates.
In FY2024, the total number of certified diverse firms available to do business with the Commonwealth and its
prime contractors increased to 5,883 (a 4% increase over FY2023). These numbers are represented in the
Diverse Businesses in the SDO Directory table below.

TOTAL5 4,520 5,669 5,883 4%
SDO State Certification
The SDO’s State Certification Unit accepts applications, conducts investigations and site visits, and issues SDO
certifications for MBE, WBE, VBE, PBE, and combinations thereof, as well as Minority (M/NPO), Women
(W/NPO), and Veteran Nonprofit Organizations (V/NPO).6 At the end of FY2024, there was a total of 3,939 SDO-
certified businesses (3,768 for-profit and 171 non-profit firms), some of which were certified as both minority-
and women-owned/controlled (M/WBE and M/W/NPO). The total number of businesses that were certified by
the SDO’s state certification program increased by 4% compared to FY2023.
4 The SDO’s supplier diversity certification is distinct from DCAMM certification for prime, small prime, and filed sub-bidders. The latter
is focused on construction-related criteria, such as years in business, completed projects, project value, and project evaluation. The
SDO’s diverse and small business certification is also distinct from the federal Disadvantaged Business Enterprise (DBE) certification
conducted by the Massachusetts Department of Transportation (MassDOT) for participation in the federal Unified Certification
Program (UCP), which was established for all recipients and individuals seeking to do business with transportation agencies as DBEs.
5 This line accounts for vendors that fall into more than one certification category and is not a sum of the lines above it.
6 The SDO issues Minority, Women and Veteran Nonprofit Organization (M/NPO, W/NPO and V/NPO) certifications to tax-exempt non-
profit organizations that meet the following requirements: (1) at least 51% of the organization's Board of Directors and Voting
Membership must be women, members of a minority group and/or veterans; (2) the same Board of Directors and Voting Membership
must control the NPO's daily and long-term operations; (3) the organization must be regularly and actively engaged in business activity;
and (4) the organization cannot be dependent upon or influenced by another non-eligible person or organization.

In FY2024, the number of certified for-profit MBEs increased in most ethnicity categories, except for the
Portuguese category, which decreased by 4%.8 The number of PBEs decreased because of a change in the SDO’s
regulations which allowed Brazilian-owned businesses to become certified as MBEs.

Third-Party Certification Recognition
In addition to offering its own certification services, the SDO recognizes and accepts certifications issued by
third-party partner organizations, namely MBE and WBE certifications issued by the City of Boston, MBE
certifications issued by the Greater New England Supplier Development Council (GNEMSDC), WBE certifications
issued by the Center for Women and Enterprise (New England WBENC), VBE and SDVOBE certifications issued
by the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA)9 and the National Veteran-Owned Business Association
(NaVOBA),10 SDVOBE and DOBE certifications issued by Disability:IN, and LGBTBE certifications issued by the
National LGBT Chamber of Commerce (NGLCC).
7 This line accounts for vendors that fall into more than one certification category and is not a sum of the lines above it.
8 Only for-profit businesses are categorized by ethnicity. Non-profit organizations are certified based on the composition of their board
of directors and the composition of their voting body (if different) and, as a result, cannot be categorized by ethnicity.
9 SBA Small VBE and SDVOBE Certification (VetCert) replaced the certification of VBEs and SDVOBEs conducted by VetBiz/U.S.
Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) on January 1, 2023.
10 The SDO entered into a Memorandum of Understanding with NaVOBA on December 18, 2023, to accept NaVOBA VBE and SDVOBE
certifications.

• New applications. The SDO reviewed a total of 607 new applications for state MBE, WBE, and VBE
certifications (26% more than in the prior fiscal year), including non-profit applications.
• Certification renewals & administrative reviews. The SDO maintained the accuracy of existing
certifications by conducting 1,049 certification renewals and 90 administrative reviews.13
11 This line accounts for vendors that fall into more than one certification category and is not a sum of the lines above it.
12 Certification Renewals were lower in FY2022 and FY2023 as a result of: (1) the number of businesses to be renewed each year varies
since implementing a 3-year certification term; and (2) the SDO decertified certain businesses that went out of business during the
pandemic and were not responsive to the SDO’s multiple attempts to renew their certification.
13 Administrative reviews are performed when a certified company changes its business structure, name, scope of products/services
offered, or if other material changes take place.

Overview of Diverse and Small Business Spending
In FY2024, the Commonwealth spent approximately $3.78 billion with diverse and small businesses, an 11.88%
increase when compared to the previous year. Participating departments and organizations expended funds in
two areas:
• Discretionary (program) spending, which represented 68% of diverse and small business spending and
included the SDO’s Supplier Diversity Program (SDP), Small Business Purchasing Program (SBPP), and
DCAMM’s Affirmative Marketing Program (AMP) for Commonwealth Agencies; and
• Non-discretionary (non-program) spending, which accounted for 32% of departments’ diverse and small
business expenditures.
The following sections measure the combined achievements of all supplier diversity programs that exist in
participating organizations through the lens benchmarks organized by business category – MBE, WBE, Veterans,
SBPP, Disability and LGBTBE.14
Discretionary Spending with Diverse and Small Businesses
The SDO’s programs focus on discretionary spending for goods, services, construction, and design, which result
from competitively procured contracts.15 The SDO’s programs use policy, benchmark-setting, coordination,
training, compliance, and recognition of excellence to ensure the participation of diverse and small businesses
in these areas of procurement. In FY2024, organizations participating in the Supplier Diversity, Small Business
Purchasing, and DCAMM’s Affirmative Marketing programs increased diversity spending by approximately 20%
to more than $2.6 billion.16

Disparity Study. View DCAMM’s Annual Affirmative Marketing Report which contains design and construction awards, spending and
MBE/WBE participation for the fiscal year.
15 Consistent with previous SDO annual reports, this analysis includes combined achievements of all supplier diversity programs that
exist in participating organizations and use SDO-certified businesses. While the SDP and SBPP address goods and services, MGL c. 7C, §
6 and MGL c. 7, § 61 charge DCAMM and the SDO with establishing MBE and WBE participation goals for capital facility projects under
DCAMM’s control and state-assisted municipal building projects under SDO’s oversight. This report includes spending data for
DCAMM’s construction projects. Final information on DCAMM’s Affirmative Marketing Program efforts is published as a separate
report issued by DCAMM’s Office of Access and Opportunity. Commonwealth departments, including MassDOT, manage their own
supplier diversity or affirmative marketing programs addressing construction, relying on the SDO’s certification services and setting
their own supplier diversity goals or using those project specific goals established by the SDO and DCAMM.
16 The SDO’s Municipal Construction Affirmative Marketing Programs (MCAMP) establishes project specific MBE and WBE participation
goals for state-funded municipal construction contracts. Since the purchasing entities participating in the program are municipal, the
program results in this report are presented separately.

In FY2024, spending benchmarks were met or surpassed, except in the Veteran (VBE/SDVOBE) and LGBTBE
business categories, both of which represent challenging program goals. Despite not meeting every benchmark
goal, discretionary spending grew in all business categories in FY2024 when compared to FY2023.

Number of Diverse and Small Businesses Receiving Discretionary Payments
The SDO tracks the number of diverse and small businesses with which the Commonwealth conducted business
directly as well as the number of diverse businesses which Commonwealth contractors reported as their
Supplier Diversity Program (SDP) Partners, which resulted in indirect spending.18 In FY2024, the number of
diverse and small companies the Commonwealth paid directly declined by 29, or 3.24%. However, the number
of Commonwealth contractors’ diverse partners increased by 166, or 13.38%, compared to FY2023. This shows
the value of SDO’s SDP partner program.

Non-Discretionary Spending with Diverse and Small Businesses
The Commonwealth makes pension and insurance-related expenditures, awards grants and subsidies, manages
entitlement programs, and maintains loans and special payments, which are considered non-discretionary
spending. While the Commonwealth’s supplier diversity programs do not apply to these non-discretionary areas
of spending, diverse and small businesses are part of that marketplace, so the SDO also tracks this spending.
In FY2024, combined non-discretionary direct expenditures totaled more than $1.1 billion, representing a 2.86%
decrease when compared to the prior fiscal year. While most of this spending is the Commonwealth’s direct
expenditures, indirect spending in this category was also reported by the Group Insurance Commission (GIC),
which voluntarily includes supplier diversity provisions in non-discretionary contracts.
The SDO does not set policies for direct non-discretionary spending, but it continues to promote such

opportunities to our diverse and small businesses, tracks such spending and, whenever possible, advocates for
vendors doing business in this category to become certified and establish supplier diversity partnerships. In
FY2024, spending in some categories (Women, small businesses, Disability-owned and LGBT) increased while it
decreased in others (Minority and Veteran) based on the Commonwealth’s non-discretionary needs.

more than $400 million, or 11.88%. Significant growth took place in spending with women-, disability-, and
LGBT-owned businesses, 21.5%, 23.5%, and 58.7% respectively. Spending with Small Businesses also increased
by 15.5%. At the same time, total MBE spending decreased by approximately 2% due to a decrease in non-
discretionary spending that exceeded the growth in discretionary MBE expenditures. Veteran business spending
decreased by approximately 0.29% for the same reason.

Supplier Diversity Program (SDP)
The SDP is established through MGL c. 7, § 58 and § 61 and Executive Order 599 to promote equity of
opportunity in the state procurement and contracting process. The SDP applies to all executive department
procurements for goods and services with annual values exceeding $250,000. The program institutes policies to
encourage participating organizations and their contractors to use SDO-certified MBEs, WBEs, VBEs, SDVOBEs,
DOBEs, and LGBTBEs in their contracts for goods and services.
In consultation with the Governor’s Office for Access and Opportunity, the SDO sets annual benchmark goals
for specific certification categories. These goals are expressed as a percentage of each participating
organization’s discretionary budget. In FY2024, the SDP spending benchmarks were set as follows:
FY2023 Supplier Diversity Program Benchmarks
Benchmark (% of
Business Category
Discretionary Budget)
Minority Business Enterprises (MBE) 8%
Women Business Enterprises (WBE) 14%
Veteran Business Enterprises (VBE/SDVOBE) 3%
Disability Business Enterprises (DOBE/SDVOBE) 0.3%
LGBT-Owned Business Enterprises (LGBTBE) 0.3%
Currently, over 70 organizations participate in the SDP, falling into one of three groups:
• Executive branch departments in all secretariats
• Non-executive departments and constitutional offices (such as the Office of the Governor, the
Massachusetts Gaming Commission, the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination, and the
Disabled Persons Protection Commission)
• Quasi-public entities (such as the Massachusetts Convention Center Authority, the Massachusetts
Housing Finance Agency, and the Cannabis Control Commission)
Only executive departments are required to participate in the SDO’s procurement programs, which include the
SDP and the SBPP. Through the SDO’s continued collaboration and outreach, many non-executive departments,
constitutional offices, and quasi-public organizations voluntarily participate in this annual report. For quasi-
public organizations, the degree of adherence to the SDO’s program rules and participation in this report varies:
• Seven non-executive, constitutional, or quasi-public organizations participate in SDO's programs with
goal-setting, tracking, and reporting consistent with procedures used by executive branch
departments:
- Office of the Governor
- Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination
- Disabled Persons Protection Commission
- Massachusetts Convention Center Authority (MCCA)
- Massachusetts Gaming Commission (MGC)
- MassHousing
- Cannabis Control Commission
18

• 18 quasi-public organizations submit narrative program reports. These are included at the end of the
quantitative sections of the report.
Participating organizations may use two types of spending to achieve program spending goals:
• Direct spending with MBE, WBE, VBE, SDVOBE, DOBE, and LGBTBE prime contractors
• Indirect spending resulting from business partnerships between the organizations’ contractors and
MBE, WBE, VBE, SDVOBE, DOBE, or LGBTBE vendors used in the contractors’ operations. This includes
subcontracting, as well as other types of business-to-business relationships.
Indirect spending can be further subdivided into the following types:22
• Subcontracting, defined as a partnership in which the SDP partner is involved in the provision of
products and/or services to the Commonwealth. Such relationships typically involve a formal written
agreement between the SDP partner and the prime contractor.
• Ancillary Products and Services, a business relationship in which the SDP partner provides the prime
contractor products or services that are not directly related to the prime contractor’s contract with the
Commonwealth (such as maintenance or office supply services). In most cases, this type of partnership
is related to the prime contractor’s general business operations and may involve a formal written
agreement with the SDP partner. In some cases, products and/or services provided by the SDP partner
may contribute to both subcontracting (when used by the Commonwealth) and ancillary (when used by
other customers) spending.
The SDO obtains information about direct spending with certified contractors from the Commonwealth
Information Warehouse (CIW), a repository of the Commonwealth’s financial transactions. Indirect spending is
reported to agencies by their contractors and then compiled and submitted to the SDO. Quasi-public
organizations monitor supplier diversity spending internally and submit their direct and indirect expenditure
information to the SDO for analysis and publication.
22 In previous years, indirect spending also included partner and growth development, defined as a type of partnership where a
Commonwealth prime contractor provides education, training, mentoring, resource sharing, joint activities, and general assistance to
diverse businesses, which results in increasing their capacity in a specific industry and/or increases the pool of qualified diverse
businesses. The SDO issued a policy effective January 1, 2021, stating that “…Bidders and contractors will no longer be allowed to
propose or implement Partner Growth and Development partnerships as a form of indirect spending which counts towards SDP
spending goals. Existing Partner Growth and Development relationships shall be allowed to continue for the duration of their
respective contracts. While valid for the purposes of contract compliance for existing contracts, this type of spending may not be
included in spending reports submitted by departments to the SDO and will not contribute to meeting departmental SDP spending
goals…”

Minority-Owned Business Enterprise (MBE) Spending
The 8% benchmark for MBE spending was exceeded by 1.23% in FY2024, meaning program participants spent

Total spending with veteran businesses increased by 0.4%, from $46.9 million in FY2023 to $47.0 million in
FY2024. Due to the relatively small number of veteran-owned businesses doing business with the
Commonwealth, spending with veteran-owned businesses continues to fluctuate based on spending with
individual businesses and with large purchases, non-recurring purchases, and project commencements and
completions. The SDO continues to conduct outreach, education, and training aimed at increasing the number
of veteran-owned companies doing business with the Commonwealth.

secretariats and two non-executive agencies met this benchmark in FY2024. The Commonwealth spent more
than $9 million with LGBT-owned businesses, achieving more than 40% of the $18 million goal.

Small Business Purchasing Program (SBPP)
The Small Business Purchasing Program (SBPP)25 was established in 2010 through Executive Order 523 and
reaffirmed in 2021 and 2022 through MGL c. 7, §§ 58 and 61 and Executive Order 599 to direct state spending
for non-construction goods and services to participating Massachusetts small businesses. This program applies
to executive departmental procurements and requests for quotes with annual values equal to or less than
$250,000.26
Small Business Registration
In FY2024, the SBPP registration process was moved from the OSD’s COMMBUYS system to the SDO’s Certrak
system. Program eligibility requirements remained unchanged. The program experienced a 10% increase in the
number of verified businesses compared to FY2023.

MBE Spending by Race and Ethnicity
In the process of certifying MBEs, the SDO collects information on the race and ethnicity of the owner(s) to
establish the business’s certification eligibility. Similarly, the SDO collects data on race and ethnicity of boards
and voting bodies of M/NPOs. The Commonwealth’s supplier diversity policies treat all MBEs and M/NPOs as
one group and do not utilize individual business owner race and ethnicity information for procurement decision-
making.
The SDO provides the following aggregated information on the Commonwealth’s direct and indirect spending
by race and ethnicity:

In FY2024, overall MBE spending grew $33 million over the previous year, $15.5 million of which was from an
increase in direct spending and $17.6 million resulted from growth in business partnership spending. Spending
with African American-owned businesses increased by 31.7%, or $26.8 million. Additionally, spending with
Hispanic/Latino and Indigenous Person businesses increased by 3.06% and 632% respectively. At the same time,
spending with Asian American (Pacific), Asian American (Subcontinent), and Cape Verdean businesses declined
by 4.57%, 17.3%, and 4.49% respectively. The share of African-American businesses in the Commonwealth’s for-
profit MBE spending grew from 25.7% to 33.9%.
Indirect Spending by Type (Subcontracting and Ancillary Products and Services)
The SDO’s programs recognize two types of indirect (also referred to as Tier 2) spending: Subcontracting and
Ancillary Products and Services. While the SDO reviews the business relationship information reported by
contractors, it is the Commonwealth contractor’s responsibility to accurately classify the nature of the business
relationship with their supplier diversity partners.

In FY2024, Commonwealth contractors spent nearly $679 million with diverse business partners, an increase of
approximately 54% over FY2023. Subcontracting relationships accounted for 64.4%, and ancillary products and
services represented approximately 35.6% of this spending. Indirect spending increased in all categories except
the veteran business category.

Affirmative Marketing Programs (AMP)
The Commonwealth’s Affirmative Marketing Program (AMP) was established pursuant to M.G.L. Chapter 7C, §
6 and M.G.L. Chapter 7, § 61 for the purpose of ensuring Minority (MBE) and Women (WBE) participation in
state building (vertical) construction projects and state-funded (municipal) construction projects.28 Below are
the FY2024 results from both DCAMM’s Affirmative Marketing Program (AMP) and the SDO’s Municipal
Construction Affirmative Marketing Program (MCAMP). There was a reduction in total overall spending for both
programs when compared to FY2023. In FY2024, the combined spending with MBEs and WBEs from the AMP
and MCAMP was as follows:

Total AMP Spending $840,220,773 $38,154,558 $70,116,296 $108,270,854
DCAMM’s Affirmative Marketing Program for Design and Construction (AMP)
The MBE/WBE program, also known as DCAMM’s Affirmative Marketing Program (AMP), is established under
M.G.L. Chapter 7C, §6 and addressed in various Executive Orders and Administrative Bulletins. Chapter 7C, §6
and Chapter 149, §44A(2)(G), along with A&F Administrative Bulletins 14 and 17A, establish reporting
requirements and workforce participation benchmarks on state construction contracts. In addition, Executive
Order 599 establishes tracking and reporting of Veteran Business Enterprises (VBE) and Service-Disabled
Veteran Owned Business Enterprise (SDVOBE) contract expenditure.
The Division of Capital Asset Management and Maintenance (DCAMM) publishes its own annual report
summarizing their performance under the Commonwealth’s Affirmative Marketing Program (AMP). This is the
MBE and WBE business participation program for DCAMM’s Design and Construction projects. DCAMM’s AMP
report also includes additional utilization data for minority and women workforce on DCAMM construction and
design projects.
DCAMM establishes overall annual agency MBE/WBE program goals across all DCAMM’s design and
construction spending and sets project-specific goals for each individual project based on the availability of
MBEs and WBEs within the statewide construction industry. Availability is determined by DCAMM’s most recent
Disparity Study. Among other things, the disparity study determined the availability of MBE/WBE firms and the
extent to which the design and construction marketplace has limited opportunities for these firms.
28 The SDO is also directed by MGL c. 7, §61 (j) and (k) to encourage and facilitate participation by service-disabled veteran-owned
businesses and veteran-owned businesses on public construction and design projects, including the establishment of goals for their
participation in all areas of state procurement contracting, including public construction, design services and commodities and service.
As noted in the transmittal letter of this report, the SDO released new MCAMP guidelines in November 2023 mandating a 3% Veteran
goal on state-funded municipal construction projects. While not technically part of DCAMM’s AMP Program, DCAMM includes a 3%
VBE/SDVOBE benchmark in design and construction projects and includes reporting on payments to VBEs and SDVOBEs as prime
contractors only as part of this annual report.
34

For projects advertised prior to July 1, 2020, MBE and WBE business participation is reported separately and
referred to collectively as “Legacy Projects.” DCAMM’s overall annual program goals in place for projects
advertised prior to July 1, 2020, were 10.4% combined MBE and WBE participation for construction payments
and 17.9% combined MBE and WBE for design payments.
For projects advertised on or after July 1st, 2020, DCAMM sets separate customized MBE and WBE business
participation goals for each project. These projects are collectively labeled “AMP 2020” under our annual report.
These goals are based on project–specific factors such as size, scope, subcontracting opportunities, and others.
To gauge performance, we measure results primarily against portfolio-wide availability-based targets derived
from the most recent DCAMM Disparity Study. These availability-based goals track more closely with the
approach used to determine specific goals for each project.
Three payment summary tables are included below--the first table presents results of AMP 2020 projects--
referencing our primary availability-based goals. The second table presents payment data for Legacy projects
with combined MBE and WBE goals. These tables are part of results and supporting backup data included in
DCAMM’s annual report. The third table below summarizes results for DCAMM’s Service Disabled and Veteran-
owned Businesses (VBE) participation program, which is separate from DCAMM’s AMP program. We summarize
payments made to VBE design and construction firms in our annual report. These are evaluated against
established benchmarks of 3% of total construction payments, and 3% of total design payments.

Municipal Construction Affirmative Marketing Programs (MCAMP)
The Municipal Construction Affirmative Marketing Program (MCAMP) was established for the purpose of
ensuring the fair participation of minority-owned and women-owned businesses on state-assisted building
projects. The SDO, in consultation with DCAMM, is charged with establishing MBE and WBE participation goals
for state-funded municipal construction contracts.
The mission of MCAMP (formerly known as the Construction Reform Program) is to educate, monitor, and assist
municipalities in the attainment and enforcement of MBE/WBE participation goals for the design and
construction phases of municipal projects.
Prior to FY2021, MCAMP combined the MBE and WBE goals to provide designers and contractors with flexibility
in using SDO-certified MBE and/or WBE contractors on state-assisted vertical construction projects. The
combined MBE and WBE goal percentage was 17.9% for design and 10.4% for Construction.
29 The $406 million construction contract to replace the Holyoke Veterans’ Home has been awarded to a joint venture
with the VBE-certified Commodore Builders holding a 50% ownership stake. $53.1 million was paid in total to this joint
venture during FY2024. Under the provisions of the contract, credit for VBE payments to Commodore is limited to the
scope of work actually performed by the firm and are included in the sub payments total. $2.24 million of the 2.78 million
total VBE construction sub payments (more than 80%) reflect payments to Commodore for these self-performed services.
30 There were no payments reported to VBE prime design firms in FY2024.
36

Effective July 1, 2020, in its construction project goal setting, MCAMP utilized the general annual MBE and WBE
aspirational goals based upon data from the DCAMM disparity study. The following general annual goals were
used in FY2021 - FY2022:
• Design - MBE 6.6% and WBE 15%
• Construction - MBE 4.2% and WBE 8.8%
Some projects started during FY2021 – FY2022 will continue to be measured against these goals.
Effective July 1, 2022, based on the results of the DCAMM disparity study, MCAMP started to use the DCAMM
project-specific MBE and WBE goals which are set for individual state-funded vertical construction projects
monitored by MCAMP. This ensures more realistic MBE and WBE goals for individual projects based on
construction trades and geographic availability.
In FY2024, the SDO released guidelines mandating a three percent Veteran goal on state-funded municipal
construction projects. Future SDO Annual Reports will contain more information regarding veteran business
participation on state-funded municipal projects as they are incorporated within the new guidelines.
Massachusetts School Building Authority (MSBA) Spending
The Massachusetts School Building Authority (MSBA) funds nearly all projects that fall under MCAMP. As a
result, the SDO tracks their projects and serves as a resource for promoting these projects and on policy and
process related to the implementation of MCAMP by municipalities. However, individual municipal recipients
of MSBA funds make the final decisions regarding project MBE/WBE utilization goals for school construction
projects. The chart below compares FY2021, FY2022, FY2023 and FY2024 MBE and WBE spending on MSBA
projects based on notices to proceed issued each year.

31 $45,730,728 of this $73,005,302 in FY2022 total MBE spending was from payments made to a prime contractor, who was also a
certified MBE. Removing the payments to this prime MBE contractor in FY2022 spending would result in payments to MBE
subcontractors to be $27,274,574.
37

The MBE construction participation level in FY2024 was 3.8%, which while still below the 4.2% aspirational goal,
is an improvement from FY2023. The WBE construction participation level was 8.3%, which fell below the 8.8%
aspirational goal.

Individuals with Disabilities in State Procurement and Contracting Program
Pursuant to Section 4 of Chapter 219 of the Acts of 2016, Section 88 of Chapter 154 of the Acts of 2018, and
MGL c. 7, § 61, the SDO, in collaboration with the Massachusetts Office on Disability (MOD), established the
SDO Individuals with Disabilities Program with the following goals, which are updated every two years. The
following are updates on goals from FY2022/FY2023:
Goal #1: Expand inclusion of Disability-Owned Business Enterprises (DOBE) and Service-Disabled Veteran-
Owned Business Enterprises (SDVOBE).
In FY2024:
• The SDO continued its partnership with Disability:IN, Work Without Limits, MassAbility (formerly the
Massachusetts Rehabilitation Commission), Easter Seals, Boston Center for Independent Living, the
Disability Policy Consortium, the Employment Advocacy Committee, and the Veterans Business
Outreach Center (VBOC) to promote SDO programs to disability-owned businesses.
• The SDO established new collaborative relationships with the Massachusetts Commission on the Status
of Persons with Disabilities, MassHire, and the Massachusetts Department of Developmental Services
(DDS) Employment Initiatives Team to provide resources for businesses looking to interview and hire
individuals with disabilities.
• The SDO grew the total number of certified DOBEs recognized by the SDO from 113 to 138, a 22%
increase. The total number of disability-owned businesses, a combination of DOBEs and SDVOBEs,
also grew in FY2024 from 355 to 376, a 6% increase.32
• The SDO promoted SDO certification to business owners throughout the Commonwealth, resulting in
the new, first-time certification of 40 SDVOBEs and 35 DOBEs.

Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Business Enterprise (SDVOBE) 131 176 223 242 238
Total 173 230 308 355 376
Goal #2: Transform and expand the SDO Individuals with Disabilities Pilot Program into an Ongoing Program.
The transformation of the pilot program in FY2024 started with the SDO hiring a dedicated coordinator for the
Individuals with Disabilities Program in October 2023. Alongside the Programs & Engagement Director and team,
the coordinator has worked to build upon the pilot in FY2024 by drafting the new ongoing program policy in
collaboration with the MOD, who originally worked with the SDO in 2016 to establish the pilot. The underlying
goal of the ongoing program is to expand program participation by adding provisions to more statewide
contracts. The SDO will continue to develop the program following additional feedback on the new policy from
the Operational Services Division (OSD) and the Executive Office for Administration and Finance (A&F).
32 The SDO accepts DOBE certifications from Disability:IN and SDVOBE certifications from the SBA’s Small Business Certification
(VetCert) center (which replaced certifications conducted by VetBiz/U.S. Department of Veteran s Affairs (VA) on January 1, 2023) and
NaVOBA, who SDO executed an MOU with on December 18, 2023.
39

As the ongoing program was being developed, the SDO continued to maintain the Pilot Program with two
statewide contracts and one departmental contract. One statewide contract renewed in May 2024 and did not
include provisions for the Individuals with Disabilities Pilot Program, but data was still submitted by vendors for
the months that applied to the previous contract term.
A total of 38 contractors, ranging from large national and international companies to small local businesses,
maintained their participation in the Pilot Program during FY2024. Disability employment statistics were
available from 17 contractors, many of whom reported initiatives to interview and hire individuals with
disabilities. From specialized recruitment of disabled veterans to utilizing the services of organizations like
MassHire, Easter Seals, and MassAbility, almost half of the vendors demonstrated a concerted effort to hire
individuals with disabilities as they participate in their respective state contracts.
In their annual report updates, more than half of the responding businesses said they maintain a voluntary and
confidential self-identification process for job applicants and employees with disabilities. However, most
contractors lacked formal policies in place to recruit, hire, retain, and/or promote persons with disabilities, and
many were without documented procedures for requesting reasonable accommodations. The data reflects the
need for more information and facilitated connection to state and local resources that help business owners
navigate these processes.
As the SDO continues to transform the pilot into an ongoing program, a new targeted approach to support
business owners’ access to information will aim to increase the number of individuals with disabilities working
on statewide contracts.
Goal #3: Further develop the program webpage with resources and tools for employers and individuals with
disabilities seeking employment.
In FY2024, the Program Coordinator worked with many state and local resource providers that have been added
to the Central Repository of Resources for Individuals with Disabilities, which will soon be published on the SDO
website. Additionally, the SDO has kept open its solicitation to seek non-profit sector resources available for
Commonwealth employers and individuals with disabilities. The SDO remains committed to being fully informed
on current programs and services which promote the hiring of individuals with disabilities and sharing that
information with all stakeholders.
FY2024/2025 Goals for the Individuals with Disabilities in State Contracting Program
Moving forward, the SDO established three new goals for FY2024/2025:
Goal #1: Expand inclusion of Disability-Owned Business Enterprises (DOBE) and Service-Disabled Veteran-
Owned Business Enterprises (SDVOBE).
The SDO will maintain progress in the growth of the Individuals with Disabilities Pilot Program through increased
outreach and engagement with DOBEs and SDVOBEs. The success of this work will be reflected in the expansion
of the number of certified DOBEs and SDVOBEs recognized by the SDO.
Goal #2: Finalize the transformation of the Individuals with Disabilities Pilot Program to a Full Program.
In early FY2024, the SDO hired a dedicated Program Coordinator to manage the Individuals with Disabilities
Program. The SDO will fully transition the pilot to an independent program, separate from the Construction
Program, following the publication of program guidelines.
40

FY2024/2025 goals for this expansion are interconnected. As the pilot grows and expands to its own program
with clear guidelines, the SDO expects to see continued growth of the number of certified DOBEs and SDVOBEs
recognized by the department as well as the expansion of contracts including employment provisions for the
recruitment, hiring, promotion, and retention of individuals with disabilities.
Goal #3: Publish updated program resources and guidance for vendors and Commonwealth departments and
agencies.
In response to the feedback from DOBE/SDVOBE vendors, program partners, and contractors on the statewide
contract participating in the Individuals with Disabilities Pilot Program, the SDO will publish additional updates
to our Individuals with Disabilities Program webpage. The revisions will include information on a wider range of
business resources, as well as information on our certification partners like Disability:IN and NaVOBA.
41

Program Outreach and Engagement
In FY2024, the SDO continued its work to recruit new businesses for state certification, to engage and connect
these companies with business opportunities, and to provide training and coordination to assist them in
securing new business. This vision of creating a steady stream of small and diverse businesses from certification
to business relationships is implemented by multiple SDO teams. These efforts are broken out into three groups:
program outreach and vendor engagement, strategic partnerships and collaboration, and the SDO Cross
Functional Team.
Program Outreach & Vendor Engagement
• Vendor Meetings and Technical Assistance Sessions. In FY2024, the SDO Programs and Engagement
team held more than 250 one-on-one virtual sessions with business owners. In addition, the SDO held
in-person office hours at Latino Economic Development Corporation offices in Springfield, MA. During
these sessions, SDO staff worked directly with business owners to help them determine which
certifications their businesses may be eligible for and show them how to find bidding opportunities
relevant to their business.
• Public Resource Partner Events. From The Berkshires to Cape Cod, the SDO participated in more than
100 public events aimed at providing vital information and resources to local business owners. At nearly
half of these events, SDO staff gave presentations or spoke on panels regarding diverse business
certification and state contracting. These events were hosted by organizations such as the Harvard Ed
Portal, U.S. Small Business Administration Massachusetts District Office, U.S. Haitian Chamber of
Commerce, the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA), Keolis Commuter Services,
Lawyers for Civil Rights/BizGrow, and the Western Massachusetts Economic Development Council.
• Introduction to Diversity Certification workshops. The SDO worked with several organizations and
public entities to hold in-person and virtual informational sessions to promote certification; these
organizations include the City of Cambridge, Women of Color Entrepreneurs, Nashoba Valley Chamber
of Commerce, Holliston Public Library, Merrimack Valley Strong, Salem Enterprise Center, City of
Fitchburg, India Society of Worcester, and the Town of Acton (sponsored by Rep. Danillo Sena).
• Certification Renewals. To increase the retention of certified businesses, the SDO Programs and
Engagement team collaborated with the Certification unit to conduct outreach to businesses whose
certification was set to expire. The SDO’s Diverse and Small Business Recruitment, Growth, and
Retention Coordinator sent nearly 600 direct emails and conducted more than 300 phone calls to
maximize the SDO's efforts to retain its certified businesses.
• Virtual Speed Networking. In August 2023, the SDO held a virtual speed networking session to bring
together potential statewide contract vendors and certified businesses interested in becoming supplier
diversity partners.
• Pathways and Connections. The SDO continued to release its re-branded monthly newsletter, Pathways
and Connections, sharing news and upcoming events from the SDO and its partners with more than
4,000 vendors, advocates, and buyers.
42

Strategic Partnerships & Collaboration
In FY2024, in addition to continuing our outreach to small and diverse businesses across the Commonwealth,
the SDO established new strategic partnerships and strengthened existing ones. These partnerships helped the
SDO remove procurement barriers and connect community organizations and their members to business
opportunities and resources.
The SDO continues to work with organizations such as the U.S. Small Business Administration Massachusetts
District Office, MassAbility (formerly Massachusetts Rehabilitation Commission), Western Mass Economic
Development Council, 1Berkshire, the Black Economic Council of Massachusetts (BECMA), Amplify Latinx, the
Governor's Advisory Council on Black Empowerment and Advisory Council on Latino Empowerment, the City of
Boston, the Greater New England Minority Supplier Development Council (GNEMSDC), Minority Business
Development Agency (MBDA), the Center for Women and Enterprise (CWE, New England WBENC), the National
LGBT Chamber of Commerce (NGLCC), the Massachusetts LGBT Chamber of Commerce, Disability:IN, the
Persons with Disabilities Employment Advocacy Group, and all of the SDO’s Certification and Community
Organizational Partnerships.
Examples of FY2024 collaborative projects and events created through the above partnerships include:
- SDO Diverse and Small Business Advisory Board. The SDO Diverse and Small Business Advisory Board,
formed in late 2023, had its first meeting in January 2024. The goal of this board is to provide guidance
and advice to the SDO in fulfilling its mission to promote equity and fairness in state contracting.
Throughout the second half of FY2024, the Advisory Board focused on promoting state contracting
opportunities to the business owners they serve.
- U.S. Small Business Administration Massachusetts District Office. The SDO welcomed the SBA for a
virtual session to provide information regarding SBA resources and funding programs, including disaster
relief loans and the SBA’s online lender match. The SDO also attended ten SBA resource matchmakers
across the state, in towns such as Boston, Springfield, Newton, Taunton, and Barnstable. The SBA
continues to be a valued partner for individuals looking to start or grow their business.
- Black Economic Council of Massachusetts (BECMA). The SDO continued to participate in events with
BECMA, exhibiting at the Mass Black Expo and presenting to BECMA members participating in their EV
Kickstarter Program.
- Holyoke Veterans Home Access, Inclusion and Diversity Committee. The SDO Executive Director serves
on this committee, which in FY2024 was chaired by the SDO’s Senior Advisor for Veterans Business
Services.33 The committee meets monthly and is responsible for actively promoting and reporting on
the inclusion of MBE, WBE, and VBE/SDVOBE-owned businesses in the construction of the Holyoke
Veterans Home.
- SCORE. The Service Corps of Retired Executives (SCORE), a non-profit and affiliate organization of the
Small Business Administration (SBA) with members who provide free consultation services and advice
to entrepreneurs, continues to be a valued partner to the SDO. Representatives from SCORE attend
each newly certified vendor onboarding to inform these vendors how SCORE can assist them through
their public procurement journeys.
33 Upon the retirement of the Senior Advisor for Veterans Business Services, the Committee is chaired by DCAMM's

- Collaboration with Certification Partners. The SDO continued to work with our cross-certification
partners while simultaneously enabling and supporting diverse and small businesses to apply for SDO
certification through our streamlined process. The SDO has thus maintained vital relationships with the
City of Boston, the Center for Women and Enterprise, the Greater New England Minority Supplier
Diversity Council, Disability:IN, the National LGBT Chamber of Commerce, and the U.S. Small Business
Administration.
- VetCert. The SDO's Senior Advisor for Veteran Owned Business Development and Partnerships
continued our collaboration with NaVOBA to conduct outreach to additional veteran-owned businesses.
- The City of Boston. The SDO has continued its partnership with the City of Boston by working with the
city to incorporate businesses certified by our respective entities into each other’s database and search
engine. This enhanced partnership better enables purchasing and procurement staff from the
Commonwealth and the City of Boston to locate diverse businesses that may be interested in competing
for public contracts.
- Cannabis Control Commission. The SDO continued to work closely with the Cannabis Control
Commission to enable full participation in the marijuana industry by people from communities that have
been disproportionately harmed by marijuana prohibition and enforcement, and to positively impact
those communities. The SDO provides supplier diversity certification services to cannabis companies
and collaborates with the Commission to educate diverse cannabis companies about certification. The
SDO also works with the Cannabis Control Commission to promote procurement opportunities to SDO-
certified businesses. We are pleased to announce that the Cannabis Control Commission is now a full
participant in SDO programs.
The SDO Cross Functional Team
In FY2024, the Cross-Functional Team (CFT) started its second year by continuing to remove barriers and connect
businesses with resources that assist them with becoming successful bidders, prime contractors, or Supplier
Diversity Partners. The CFT work is an integral part of the ongoing SDO initiative known as “SDO Means Business
– From Intent to Impact.”
The CFT’s goal in FY2024 was to increase the number of SDO-certified diverse and small business prime
contractors on specified contracts by 25 percent. We are happy to report that the CFT met and exceeded this
goal (see the “FY2024 SDO Prime Contractors Goal” table below).
The FY2024 initiative also included promoting departmental bid opportunities for the Department of Children
and Family (DCF), MassAbility (formerly Mass Rehabilitation Commission – MRC), Massachusetts Department
of Transportation (MassDOT), and the Cannabis Control Commission.
Contract Selection Process
The CFT identified statewide contracts that were expiring and being resubmitted for bids, as well as those with
rolling enrollments in FY2024 by monitoring the Operational Services Division (OSD) Procurement Schedules. A
baseline was established based on previous contract information. This thorough assessment process enabled
the CFT to identify potential for increased inclusion of diverse and small businesses as prime contractors.
Once the statewide and departmental contracts were assessed and selected, the CFT implemented several
actions to ensure the success of SDO-certified diverse and Small Business Purchasing Program (SBPP) businesses.
In FY2024 the CFT:
• Used bid and contract documents from previous contracts to provide guidance and support
44

• Cross-referenced classification codes for UNSPSC products and services with NAICS industry codes
• Retrieved lists of potential diverse businesses and SBPP participants from SDO and COMMBUYS
databases
• Conducted extensive outreach efforts that include sending notifications and surveys
• Presented vendor readiness training to prepare potential diverse businesses and SBPP participants for
bidding
The table below outlines the statewide contracts selected for promotion by the CFT:

• MassDOT Catering Services
• MassAbility - Development of a learning & training workplan and implementation of training
• Cannabis Control Commission
o Social Equity RFR for Technical Assistance and Training
o Travel Services RFR
o Seed-to-Sale System RFR
Measuring Success and Final Results
The FY2024 goal was to increase the number of SDO-certified and recognized diverse and small business prime
contractors on 14 selected statewide and six departmental contracts by 25 percent, which represents an
increase of 69 businesses.
To measure our success, the CFT established a baseline amount of diverse and small businesses that were prime
contractors on the departmental and statewide contracts from the previous year. For replacement contracts,
the initial number of diverse and/or small business prime contractors was the baseline to measure the increases
of newly awarded SDO contractors. The overall results of the CFT’s work on the selected contracts are shown in
the tables below.

Reopened Contracts
In addition to meeting and exceeding the FY2024 goal, the CFT focused on recruiting diverse and small
businesses as prime contractors on the reopening of seven current statewide contracts. These contracts,
managed by the Operational Services Division (OSD), were assessed and reopened to ensure greater
representation of diverse and small businesses in the areas of information technology, energy and climate
action, and tradesperson services.
46

Reopening these contracts successfully increased opportunities for a wider range of diverse and small
businesses to participate in state procurement. It also provided public purchasers with a greater selection of
SDO prime contractors to meet their needs. The contracts include:
▪ Building Maintenance Repair and Operations Project Materials and Supplies – FAC124
• Pharmaceutical Prime Vendor and Specialty Pharmaceuticals – MED56
• Landscaping Services, Snow Removal, Tree Care, and Related Services – FAC120
• Software and Services Reopening Category 3 and Category 4 – ITS75
• Energy, Climate Action, and Facility Advisory Service – PRF74
• Tradesperson Installation, Repair, and Maintenance Services – TRD01 (Boilers; Drains; Electrical;
Fencing; General Contracting; Generator/Turbine; Glass/Window/Doors; HVAC/Sheet Metal; Painting;
Plumbing, Solar Array Inspection)
• Tradesperson Installation, Repair, and Maintenance Services – TRD03 (Elevator; Exhaust Services; Fire
Detection; Fire Suppression; Overhead Doors; Signage; Welding
Through the work of the CFT, the reopening of these contracts led to the addition of 84 diverse and small
business prime contractors, an increase of 118 percent. This achievement demonstrates the CFT's commitment
to fostering a more inclusive and equitable procurement environment.
The table highlights the significant increase in participation, emphasizing CFT success:

SDP Spending Compliance Verification
The goal of the Supplier Diversity Program (SDP) Spending Compliance Verification program is to assess the
accuracy of SDP reports submitted by Commonwealth Contractors. This is done by requesting that SDO-certified
vendors confirm they received payments as stated on a sample of spending reports. This program ensures the
accuracy of Contractor SDP-related reporting. FY2024 is the second fiscal year that both Statewide Contract
Goods and Services contractors and Health and Human Services contractors were included in the program.
For reports submitted for FY2024, the SDO Compliance Team sent out verification emails for 2,531 line items of
spend to 1,188 unique certified diverse businesses who served as Contractors’ supplier diversity partners. A
total of 783 diverse businesses responded, verifying a total of 1,741 line items of reported spend exceeding
$404 million, a 24% increase over FY2023. Compared to FY2023, the number of line items verified has increased
from 1,469 to 1,741. The response rate for FY2024 reported spend verification was 69%, an 8% increase over
FY2023’s verification rate.
Based on the responses received, the SDO Compliance Team found the following:
Accurate and Understated reports: 1,455 line items of spend (84% of the reports, representing 82% of the
expenditures reported) were confirmed to be accurate or higher than reported. Of that number, 273 line items
(16% of the responses, representing 26% of the reported expenditures) were understated, and the Contractor,
in fact, spent more than reported.
Overstated reports: 286 line items (16% of the reports and 18% of the expenditures reported) were found to
be overstated by Contractors. All Contractors who overstated their spending received notice from the SDO
Compliance Team of the discrepancies identified. For Statewide Contractors, the SDO Compliance Team also
alerted the OSD Sourcing unit and requested that proof of payment and any corrections, updates, or revisions
be provided to both the SDO and OSD.
Data used for this Annual Report spending section was updated to reflect the spending amounts confirmed by
diverse vendors. All amounts were revised and the corrected spend is reflected in this Annual Report.

Narrative Reports by Quasi-Public/Non-Executive Organizations
In FY2024, the SDO, in collaboration with the Governor’s Office of Access, Opportunity, and Community Affairs,
continued to coordinate supplier diversity activities among more than two dozen quasi-public and non-
executive organizations across the state. In addition to meetings, resources, and best practices, participants in
this effort were offered the opportunity to report the results of their supplier diversity programs through this
Annual Report.
This chapter contains information from 18 quasi-public or non-executive organizations that submitted such
narrative reports, including four organizations also participating in the quantitative sections of this report (the
Cannabis Commission, Massachusetts Convention Center Authority, Massachusetts Gaming Commission and
MassHousing).34 For the first time, the Bristol County Sherriff’s Office, the Community Economic Development
Assistance Corporation (CEDAC), and the Office of State Treasurer and Receiver General contributed narratives.
An additional three organizations that include a constitutional office (Office of the Governor) and two non-
executive organizations (Commission Against Discrimination and Disabled Persons Protection Commission) also
participate in the quantitative sections of this report. The following is a summary of the spending reported in
those narratives further below. This includes diverse and/or Massachusetts small business spending, which
totals more than $200 million.35

Bristol County Sheriff’s Office (BCSO)
The Bristol County Sheriff’s Office (BCSO) is a public safety organization committed to care, custody, control,
and rehabilitation of inmates. The BCSO strives to promote a work environment where employees feel valued
and have a sense of purpose in their daily work and will assist other public organizations when needed.
34 The Narrative Reports included in this SDO Annual Report were written and submitted by each individual Quasi-
Public/Non-Executive Organization and were not authored by the SDO.
35 While a summary of the table equals $379.28. million, the reference to “more than $200 million” accounts for vendors
that fall into more than one certification category and is not a sum of the lines below. Furthermore, this table does not
include spending by any quasi-public or non-executive organizations that participate in the quantitative sections of the
report.
36 The abbreviation “DBE” as used by MassDevelopment is distinct from the federal Disadvantaged Business Enterprise
certification with the same abbreviation.

For Fiscal Year 2024, the BCSO’s budget was $58,403,434.00. We are proud to present our spending dollars with
Minority-Owned, Women-Owned and Veteran-Owned Businesses, as well as our spending with Small Business
Purchasing Program participating businesses. The table below shows each category individually.

Cannabis Commission
The Cannabis Control Commission (“Commission”), established in 2017, is responsible for implementing and
administering laws governing access to medical and adult-use marijuana. The Commission regulates an
industry that includes both small and large participants and works to promote diversity and inclusion by
encouraging full participation of individuals from communities disproportionately impacted by marijuana
prohibition, as well as minorities, women, and veterans.
The Commission strives to prioritize supplier diversity in its procurement activities by considering businesses
certified by the SDO across all designations. The Commission remains dedicated to creating equitable
opportunities for diverse suppliers and continually working towards improving efforts, emphasizing the
importance of diversity in purchasing decisions.

$467,817.41 $727,868.56 $12,169.45 $11,933.13 $19,705.95 $119,599.76
The Commission has collaborated with the SDO and looks forward to continuing efforts to educate cannabis
businesses about obtaining SDO certifications. Marijuana Establishment applicants who complete SDO training
and sign attestations regarding their ownership benefit from expedited licensing application processes and
become eligible for them. Additionally, licensees certified by the SDO and meeting the Commission’s small
business eligibility requirements qualify for license fee waivers, as well as waivers for future applications related
to other types of operations.
Community Economic Development Assistance Corporation (CEDAC)
CEDAC is a quasi-public agency of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, established as a public corporation by
state legislation in 1978 (Chapter 40H) to provide technical assistance to nonprofit community-based
organizations to help them carry out community economic development activities in distressed areas of the
state.
CEDAC’s major program area is affordable housing. CEDAC provides predevelopment and acquisition financing
and technical assistance to nonprofit, community-based organizations for the development, preservation, and
rehabilitation of affordable housing. CEDAC also works closely with the Executive Office of Housing and Livable
Communities (EOHLC) and its state agency partners on several of the capital bond programs used to develop
supportive housing for homeless families or other vulnerable populations. CEDAC is active in state and national
53

housing preservation policy research and development and is widely recognized as a leader in the nonprofit
community development industry. Please visit CEDAC’s website for more information CEDAC.org.
Since FY2022, CEDAC has been tracking its operating expenditures by type of vendor: BIPOC-owned, woman-
owned, veteran-owned, person with disability-owned or LGBTQ+-owned. CEDAC proactively seeks diverse
vendors using the Massachusetts Supplier Diversity Office (SDO) database for bids and RFPs. In FY2022, CEDAC
confirmed spending $153,972 using diverse vendors and of that total $79,807 on BIPOC-owned vendors. In
FY2023, CEDAC confirmed spending $255,509 using diverse vendors and of that total, $174,923 on BIPOC-
owned vendors. In FY2024, CEDAC confirmed spending $402,476 on diverse vendors and of that total, $327,089
on BIPOC- owned vendors.
Commonwealth Corporation
Commonwealth Corporation, better known as CommCorp for short, is a quasi-public agency delivering
innovative and collaborative career development solutions that help employees and businesses succeed.
CommCorp is dedicated to creating a globally competitive workforce that fosters the success and well-being of
all individuals. Partnering with the Executive Office of Health and Human Services (EOHHS), the Department of
Youth Services (DYS), and the Executive Office of Labor and Workforce Development (EOLWD), CommCorp
deploys millions of dollars annually to provide residential programming, mental health services, and career
development opportunities to individuals. Through skill building, high-quality education, and a pathway to
employment, our programs enable participants to redirect their lives and break the cycle of recidivism. We
empower participants to re-enter the workforce with the experience, tools, and resources needed to thrive.
At CommCorp, we are deeply committed to diversity, and that commitment is evident throughout our work.
First, we prioritize representation in our ranks. As of December 2024, 49% of our staff self-identify as people of
color, 14% self-identify as having a disability, and 67% self-identify as women, signifying our efforts to build a
staff that reflects the diverse communities across the Commonwealth.
Programs housed under CommCorp specifically focus on providing access and opportunity to the most
systemically excluded communities. For example, our Re-entry program aims to increase the number of formerly
incarcerated individuals successfully placed into career track, sustainable wage employment opportunities. We
are creating a statewide network of industry-focused training programs with expertise serving this population–
no matter what region of Massachusetts a returning citizen is released to, there will be re-entry support. This
program will also increase the number of Black & Brown-owned and operated business partners, community-
based organizations, and training partners applying for and receiving funds to work with this population.
Our Youthworks program stands as another example of how we create access for the populations we work with.
Youthworks is a state-funded youth employment program that helps teens and young adults develop the skills
and experience needed to find and keep jobs. Participants take part in paid short-term work placements during
the summer and/or school year at public, private, and nonprofit work sites. As part of the program, they receive
training in core soft skills, practice professional behavior and learn how to work effectively with supervisors, co-
workers, and customers at their work sites. They also learn how to take the next steps in their education and
career pathways.
54

We have integrated SDO certifications into the Workforce Training Fund Express Program Directory and we are
continually identifying and pursuing opportunities to support and build partnerships with organizations
currently engaged in promoting racial and economic justice within the communities served.
CommCorp works to provide economic opportunities to historically and systemically marginalized communities
through our grant services and technical assistance programs-preparing them to administer funds and expand
their capacity. However, this goal requires the collaborative effort of personnel, partners, and the community
at large.
We use the SDO’s directory to look for relationships that allow them to leverage their unique assets across
disciplines and sectors to build power for marginalized communities, seeking out partnerships and vendors that
focus on the intersection of DEI issues with other pressing social problems such as health disparities, education
disparities, and criminal justice reform.
CommCorp is currently updating our vendor selection and procurement policies and is finalizing a plan to direct
any eligible vendor or supplier we use who is not SDO certified directly to the SDO office to start the certification
process. We will also track our spending with those businesses.
The journey to supporting, expanding, and investing in an equitable workforce is not always linear. Therefore,
Commonwealth Corporation’s goal is two-fold: to learn from the mistakes they are aware of, and to foster an
environment that encourages partners, stakeholders, and employees to hold them accountable. Read more
about CommCorp’s DEI initiatives here.
Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA)
The 3rd Annual MBTA Supplier Diversity Report showcases the performance of the MBTA with certified diverse
businesses receiving payments or awards as primes or sub-primes from federal and non-federal funds within
goods & services and design & construction with operating and capital funds in fiscal year 2024.
The two key sections of this report focus on FY2024 (7/1/23 to 6/30/24):
• Payments made to diverse businesses (this is our 3rd annual analysis).
• Awards made to diverse businesses (this is our 1st annual analysis).
Certified diverse businesses at the MBTA are defined as:
• Minority-owned (MBE)
• Woman-owned (WBE)
• Disadvantaged business enterprise (DBE)
• Service-disabled veteran-owned(SDVOBE)
• Disability-owned (DOBE)
• Portuguese-owned (PBE)
• LGBT-owned (LGBTBE)
• Veteran-owned (VBE)
By producing an aggregate MBTA annual report focusing on payments and awards for the agency’s total federal
and non-federal supplier diversity components, the agency can better:
55

• Measure our total impact and performance with diverse businesses.
• Understand opportunities, strengths, and challenges of the supplier diversity programs.
• Leverage synergies on federal and non-federal programs to grow results with diverse businesses.
The Awards & Payments sections of the report together are a synergetic and important tandem to better
measure and understand the supplier diversity progress of the MBTA.
• Awards are defined as base executed contracts, purchase orders, and task orders. This section serves as a
leading indicator of the MBTA’s supplier diversity program. Federal includes FTA and other federally
funded awards. FTA’s DBE program awards are reported to the FTA semi-annually during the federal fiscal
year (Oct 1 to Sep 30).
• Payments are defined as direct payments issued to businesses. This section serves as a lagging indicator of
the MBTA’s supplier diversity program as many of our contracts are multi-year. Federal includes FTA and
other federally funded payments. FTA’s DBE Program payments are reported to the FTA semi-annually
during the federal fiscal year (Oct 1 to Sep 30).
FY24 Awards-- Key Results
In FY24, the MBTA awarded $128.3M or 9% to 186 diverse companies from an overall total of $1.4B in awards
issued for all companies.

CONCLUSION & ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
Sharing our trends transparently with the public, leadership, Board of Directors, and key stakeholders on an
annual basis is an important part of our commitment to supplier diversity by showcasing and embracing our
strengths and areas for improvements.
Several key elements for our path forward stand out:
• Improve on outreach and engagement efforts targeting diverse firms for opportunities
• Develop more opportunities for diverse firms to win prime & sub-prime contracts
• Leverage synergies across the state and federal programs, initiatives, and efforts
• Continue to receive support from Executive Leadership and Board of Directors
Production of this report is led by the DEI team via an integrated collaboration between various departments,
including Procurement, Capital, ODCR, OPMI, Legal, and Finance. The report includes awards & payments with

funding from the Federal Transit Authority (FTA) and the report does not supersede or determine the program
components set by the FTA for the DBE program.
Massachusetts Convention Center Authority (MCCA)
The MCCA adopted the SDO’s methodology and procedures for measuring diverse business spending, beginning
with its FY2017 reporting. While it has not tracked additional categories for diverse business types in the past,
the MCCA now is asking vendors to report their certification status among a broader set of business categories
(e.g., veteran-owned, LGBT-owned).
In FY2018 and again in FY2023, the MCCA was proud to receive a Supplier Diversity Award for its efforts in
promoting economic opportunity for small and diverse businesses in the Commonwealth in the prior fiscal year.
Through its centralized Purchasing and Procurement team, the MCCA is looking to continually build upon these
achievements to increase opportunities for diverse suppliers. Beginning in FY2023, the MCCA’s spending data
reflects the purchasing activities of its food and beverage contractors at the Boston Convention & Exhibition,
Hynes and MassMutual Centers as well as the diverse supplier results reported by its venue manager for the
MassMutual Center in Springfield. The MCCA’s spending activity is also reflected in its cleaning contractor.
The MCCA advertises major procurements on its website and through local and regional news outlets. Typically,
firms responding to such procurements are required to identify how and in what amount they are including
diverse businesses within their proposals. Please visit the MCCA Business Opportunities page for information
on current and upcoming Requests for Proposals, Requests for Qualifications, and Invitations for Bids.
Massachusetts Development Finance Agency (MassDevelopment)
The Massachusetts Development Finance Agency’s (MassDevelopment) Board of Directors (Board) on June 8,
2017, voted to adopt a Diverse Business Participation Program for MassDevelopment’s direct contracting. This
Program encourages parties seeking contracts with MassDevelopment to use good faith efforts to include MBEs,
WBEs, VBEs, and SDVOBEs. MassDevelopment refers to these four categories as Diverse Business Enterprises
(DBEs).
MassDevelopment’s Program encourages DBE participation (which is measured in annual reports submitted by
vendors to the Agency) by providing all Requests for Proposals, Requests for Qualifications, and invitations for
bids to the SDO, the Greater New England Minority Supplier Development Council (GNEMSDC), and the Center
for Women & Enterprise for dissemination.
In FY2018, MassDevelopment worked to roll out the program and track its “baseline” for future years and annual
reporting which resulted from a collaboration between the finance, legal/procurement, and information
technology divisions. MassDevelopment applied the same FY2018 methodology to subsequent years, including
the FY2024 reporting. MassDevelopment’s total consolidated dollar spend on all vendors for FY2024 was
$23,956,106. MassDevelopment then identified, through cross-checking with the SDO database and through
subsequent coding, all vendors eligible for inclusion in the program.
58

The total SDO-certified, DBE vendor spend was determined to be $1,569,397. Accordingly, 6.6% of
MassDevelopment’s total direct contracting was procured through DBE vendors in FY2024. Factoring in non-
certified DBE vendors for $3,983,742, the percentage of participation by DBE Vendors is 23.2%. This is a
signification decrease from FY2023, which was 57.5% for certified DBE vendors. This was due to a decrease of
spend of $15,276,139 in FY2023 versus a spend of $3,702,211 in FY2024 to one vendor for utility infrastructure
work at Devens. Previously, this vendor was classified as a non-certified SDO vendor and as Vendor with DBE
Subcontractors in FY2024.
Vendor payments to DBE subcontractors are not factored in the above numbers. Unfortunately, our current
system cannot extract the subcontractor portion so that number is not reportable at this time. However, total
payments to vendors with DBE subcontractors totaled $632,890 in FY2024. We routinely encourage non-
certified DBE vendors to seek or update their SDO certifications.
Massachusetts Gaming Commission (MGC)
The Massachusetts Gaming Commission (MGC) has elected to follow 801 CMR 21.00, which governs the
acquisition of all commodities and services by executive agencies including following OSD’s guidelines regarding
diversity spending. MGC posts bid opportunities on COMMBUYS and on MGC’s website, in addition to engaging
a company to enlarge the pool of diverse vendors to many of our RFRs.
The MGC continues to make small and diverse businesses a priority in our procurements, resulting in $3.39M
spending with small businesses, $3.79M with women-owned businesses, $660K with minority-owned
businesses, $28K with veteran-owned businesses, $28.5K with disability-owned businesses and $109K for LGBT-
owned businesses. Furthermore, the MGC hit five out of six of its spending benchmarks set by the SDO for
FY2024. The MGC fully participates in the SDP and SBPP and their results are included in the quantitative sections
of this report.
In addition to the Commission’s direct purchasing, MGC monitors the casino licensees in meeting their own
supplier/vendor diversity goals and compliance with required diversity plans (available on the MGC website).
Each casino’s progress toward reaching those goals is published on the MGC Reports and Publications Webpage.
The Massachusetts Gaming Commission Licensees’ Supplier Diversity Performance in FY2024
Supplier Diversity MBE VBE WBE
Goal | Result Goal | Result Goal | Result

MGM Springfield 10%| 8% 2% | 3% 15% | 7%
Plainridge Park 6% | 7% 3% | 5% 12% | 15%
Oversight for each licensee’s spending involves quarterly diversity reporting, compliance audits and reviews, as
well as working with community organizations to assist the casinos in sourcing diverse vendors. The most
current information on supplier diversity status can be found in their quarterly reports posted to the website.

Massachusetts Growth Capital Corporation (MGCC)
MGCC empowers small businesses in Massachusetts through access to capital, managerial education, and
resources, and promotes economic development in underserved and under-resourced communities and our
gateway cities. With economic opportunities, these business owners – often women, minorities and veterans –
can build assets, create employment, and strengthen their communities. MGCC has been providing these
entrepreneurs with alternative funding solutions and free managerial assistance since 2010.
MGCC communicates with statewide partners and the SDO to expand its reach to diverse suppliers. MGCC
offerings, as well as further inclusive opportunities and initiatives supported by MGCC, may be found on MGCC’s
website: EmpoweringSmallBusiness.org.
Massachusetts Housing Finance Agency (MassHousing)
The Massachusetts Housing Finance Agency (MassHousing) is now in its sixth decade of providing economic
opportunities to Diverse Business Owners, not limited to Minority Businesses (MBEs) and Women Businesses
(WBEs). MassHousing’s Diverse Business & Engagement team works in collaboration with diverse business
owners, property managers, and construction general contractors within MassHousing-financed development
communities. The objective is to connect businesses by fostering equity of access to qualified diverse businesses.
It is MassHousing’s long-standing commitment to leverage economic opportunities within the affordable and
mixed income housing area. MassHousing’s multifamily borrowers have maintained a long-standing relationship
with deep efforts and commitments in building the workforce landscape to include MBEs and WBEs. The Agency
negotiates and manages Access Opportunity Contracts on both Construction and multifamily contracts.
The Diverse Business Engagement division works with general contractors, property managers, and vendors to
ensure the established MBE/WBE goals are being met with success and continuity. MassHousing actively
participates in conferences and workshops sponsored by public, private, and non-profit organizations. The
Agency provides outreach, technical assistance, and opportunities at housing developments throughout the
Commonwealth.
In FY2024, MassHousing continues to set ambitious goals and expand opportunities for the participation of
diverse businesses in all aspects of the Agency’s operations.
Massachusetts Port Authority (Massport)
The Massachusetts Port Authority (“Massport”) is an independent public authority and is self-sustaining. It is
governed by a seven-member board, of which five members are appointed by the Governor of Massachusetts,
and one is appointed by the Massachusetts Port Authority Community Advisory Committee. These six members
serve staggered terms of seven years each. The seventh member is the Secretary of Transportation and Chief
Executive Officer of the Massachusetts Department of Transportation.
A world-class organization moving people and goods, Massport connects Massachusetts and New England to
the world – safely, securely and efficiently, with a commitment to sustainability, our neighboring communities,
and equal opportunity in its contracting. Massport facilities generate $22 billion a year in total economic impact
and support more than 107,000 direct jobs. After some challenging years, Boston Logan has surpassed pre-
pandemic levels. Serving more than 43 million passengers, exceeding the 2019 benchmark of 42.5 million.
60

Massport is well-positioned to further its mission and uphold its commitments to the travelling public, while
driving economic opportunities for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.
Through its Supplier Diversity Program, Massport encourages participation of certified minority-owned business
enterprises (MBEs), women-owned business enterprises (WBEs), and other small businesses.
Massport issued new Requests for Proposals (RFPs) and Requests for Qualifications (RFQs) for Goods & Services
with a value of $53.8M during FY2024. Awards to MBEs and/or WBEs totaled $3.5M, or 24.8% of awards for
multiple and single-year contracts.
The following highlights showcase our key initiatives and accomplishments in FY2024:
Supplier Diversity
• Janitorial Services for Boston Logan International Airport Non-Terminal Buildings: C&W Services
partnered with MBE Done Right Building Services, Inc.
• Janitorial Services at the Massport Fish Pier awarded directly to a WBE, Star Building Services

Boston to provide internships, scholarships, and job opportunities to students in targeted areas of
aviation-related study
Massachusetts School Building Authority (MSBA)
The Massachusetts School Building Authority (the “MSBA”) is a quasi-independent state authority that provides
partial reimbursement grant funding for school construction projects across the Commonwealth. The MSBA has
a long-standing partnership with the Massachusetts Supplier Diversity Office (SDO), which enhances the MSBA’s
commitment to developing and strengthening Minority Business Enterprises (MBEs), Women Business
Enterprises (WBEs), Veteran Business Enterprises (VBEs), Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Business Enterprises
(SDVOBEs), Disability-Owned Business Enterprises, LGBT Business Enterprises, Minority Nonprofit Organization
(M/NPOs), and Women Nonprofit Organization (W/NPOs); and expanding equal opportunity in the primary and
secondary industries affected by MSBA procurements for goods and services.
The MSBA works with the SDO to notify certified diverse businesses of upcoming MSBA procurements. Also, the
MSBA awards points to respondents that demonstrate the existence of, or an intent to develop, a relationship
with one or more certified diverse businesses. The MSBA publishes RFRs for open procurements on the MSBA’s
website and on COMMBUYS, where the MSBA welcomes certified diverse businesses to submit responses to
61

these procurements. Additionally, the MSBA holds information sessions in conjunction with the SDO to provide
information about upcoming MSBA procurements.
This year, the MSBA worked with the SDO and hosted a procurement overview for potential designers for heat
pump projects within the MSBA’s Accelerated Repair Program. The MSBA also coordinated with the SDO to
establish MBE/WBE goals for the MSBA’s own public construction bid for a project that includes low-voltage
wiring for the MSBA’s new office location.
Districts in the MSBA’s grant program are independently responsible for following all state laws and state agency
requirements that are outside of the MSBA’s jurisdiction, including the participation goals for certified diverse
businesses on MSBA-funded school construction projects.
The MSBA encourages districts to employ M/WBEs on school construction projects through language
incorporated in MSBA template contracts and procurement documents which detail the requirements for
M/WBEs on school construction projects pursuant to M.G.L. Ch. 7C, section 6. Also, the MSBA requires Owner’s
Project Managers (“OPMs”) to monitor goals for hiring M/WBE’s in the design and construction phases of a
project in the OPM Monthly Reports that are submitted to the MSBA.
In February 2025, the MSBA issued Project Advisory #90, an update to its previous Project Advisory #62, to
reshare the SDO’s latest State Funded Municipal Construction Affirmative Marketing Program (MCAMP) General
Guidelines. To ensure project goals are set properly, the Project Advisory provides municipalities with contact
information for the SDO's Construction Program Coordinator Meghan Costa so that they can seek assistance
from the SDO and DCAMM in goal setting. The MSBA also updated the following MSBA forms to align with the
new MCAMP requirements:
• Designer Request for Services (“RFS”) Template
• Designer Services Base Contract for Design/Bid/Build and CM at Risk
• Designer Selection Procedures
• Designer Services Base Contract and Attachments
The MSBA looks forward to continuing its partnership with the SDO to enhance the MSBA’s initiatives for
promoting the hiring of certified diverse businesses on MSBA procurements and MSBA-funded school
construction projects. Please visit the MSBA’s website for information about open procurements.
Massachusetts State College Building Authority (MSCBA)
The Massachusetts State College Building Authority (MSCBA or Authority) is responsible for financing, designing,
constructing, and overseeing the management of residence halls and student activity facilities for the nine state
universities and 15 community colleges. The Authority is committed to fostering, cultivating, and preserving a
culture of diversity, equity, and inclusion.
The Authority communicates with the Commonwealth’s Supplier Diversity Office, other state entities, and
industry associations to encourage diversity of the workforce within the Commonwealth. In addition to adopting
the Commonwealth’s diversity goals for hiring design and construction firms, the MSCBA continues to reach out
to the subcontractor community by engaging Minority Business Enterprises, Woman-Owned Business
Enterprises, and Veteran-Owned Business Enterprises through a web-based trade contractor prequalification
process. There they are awarded additional credit toward becoming prequalified to bid on MSCBA projects.
Notifications of current opportunities are posted in the Central Register and on the Authority website.
62

Along with the MBE/WBE goals, the Authority also has adopted workforce participation goals to ensure
opportunities for minorities and women to participate in our construction projects. A monthly review of the
workforce data on each project results in an open dialog, creates demand, and results in real job opportunities.
The Authority tracks this data on all projects to the established goals to measure growth and identify areas in
need of improvement. Further, the Authority promotes diversity throughout other internally hired vendors and
in other types of procurement and regularly engages minority and women-owned firms for consulting and
project support roles, as well as in financing activities. The MSCBA’s annual report and additional information,
including current projects and annual reports, may be viewed online on the Authority website at mscba.org.
Massachusetts Water Resources Authority
The Massachusetts Water Resources Authority’s MBE/WBE/DBE Program ensures the equitable participation of
Minority/Women/Disadvantaged Business Enterprises in the award of all contracts, including contracts for
construction, goods/non-professional services and professional services.
A quarterly report is generated on spending for MBE/WBE/DBEs, which includes construction, goods/non-
professional services and professional services contracts. These expenditures are presented to the MWRA’s
Board of Directors in the quarterly Orange Notebook Report on Key Indicators of MWRA Performance.
The table below shows the MWRA’s FY2024 Report
Type Certification Diverse Spending Annual Goal % of Goal
Construction MBE $3,439,415 $7,708,717 44.6%
WBE $5,152,090 $3,833,064 134.4%

Goods/Services MBE $167,497 $408,184 41.0%
WBE $1,122,653 $1,363,266 82.4%
Listings for the MWRA bidding and contracting opportunities, including for construction, goods/non-
professional services and professional services can be found on the MWRA Supplier Portal site and/or
publications such as the Central Register, Goods and Services, The Boston Herald, Bay State Banner, El Mundo
and/or COMMBUYS (www.commbuys.com).
Office of the Inspector General
The Office of the Inspector General’s Academy (OIG Academy, formerly known as the Massachusetts Certified
Public Purchasing Official program), offered classes that focused on diversity and inclusion in procurement.
Specifically:
• The OIG Academy partnered with the Division of Capital Asset Management and Maintenance (DCAMM) and
the Attorney General’s Office (AGO) to present class segments related to diversity. In these classes the
requirements of the Massachusetts’ Affirmative Marketing Program and Workforce Participation Goals were
reviewed. The presentations in these classes, including the Public Contracting Overview class, the Design and
Construction Contracting class, and School Project Designer and Owner’s Project Manager Certification class
63

discussed the legal requirements for vendor diversity goals in construction contracts. The number of students
who participated in these classes totaled 1,241 in FY2024.
• The OIG Academy also partnered with the Supplier Diversity Office (SDO) to provide training entitled
Promoting Procurement Diversity Using Chapter 30B. The OIG Academy and the Supplier Diversity Office
presented information on how Chapter 30B can be used to promote a diverse vendor pool. For example, how
to develop a request for proposals (RFP) with evaluation criteria that provides “highly advantageous” status to
SDO-certified vendors; or how to use the price quotation process to seek quotes from SDO-certified vendors on
statewide and cooperative contracts. The training also reviewed 65 resources available to vendors and
municipalities to assist in promoting diversity and inclusion in public contracting. For example, the SDO Certified
Business Directory provides multiple search functions to search for certified diverse vendors. The number of
students who participated in this class totaled 33 in FY2024.
Office of the State Treasurer and Receiver General
The Office of the State Treasurer and Receiver General (Treasury) is a Constitutional Office comprised of 13
departments and agencies. Under the leadership of State Treasurer Deborah B. Goldberg, the office provides a
wide range of services, including the state’s cash and debt management, deferred compensation and retirement
plans, Veteran's benefits, the Office of Economic Empowerment, and the State Retirement Board.
The Treasury works with a variety of businesses in service to its various departments: investment management
firms, large-scale printing companies, IT firms, and highly specialized audit firms to report and deliver unclaimed
property to the state. In each of the Treasury’s procurements, firms are required to submit the Treasury Supplier
Diversity Plan form outlining any diverse suppliers with whom they’re engaged. These forms are evaluated as
part of the procurement process with points awarded for participation. To engage more small and diverse
businesses the Treasury joined the SDO’s Diverse & Small Business Opportunity Fair in Framingham to share the
type of work they do.
To continue expanding opportunities and engaging with more small businesses, Treasurer Goldberg’s office in
2023 announced the launch of a newly renamed state program, Investing for the Long Term (Invest MA).
Previously referred to as the Small Business Banking Partnership (SBBP), Invest MA enhanced the existing
guidelines by promoting and strengthening small business growth. This initiative shifts state cash deposits under
the control of the Treasurer to banks that are willing to expand their small business lending, particularly in
“gateway” cities that are targeted for economic development.
Invest MA builds on the progress the Treasury has made in supporting our state’s small businesses. In November
of 2023, the Treasurer’s office launched the Small Business Resource Toolkit (www.smallbusinessma.org),
designed to provide a range of relevant, important information, often needed for the challenges that
entrepreneurs will encounter. The website offers valuable educational materials on how to plan, maintain, and
grow successfully.
The Treasury works hard to have a positive impact not only on small and diverse business development, but also
local communities and the state’s economy.

University of Massachusetts (UMass)
The University of Massachusetts started supplier diversity initiatives in a harmonized way in 2020 with the
formation of the Unified Procurement Services Team (UPST). The UMass Supplier Diversity program intensified
its partnership with diversity organizations like the Greater Boston Chamber of Commerce (GBCC) – Pacesetters
Initiative, Northeastern University’s Lab for Inclusive Entrepreneurship, and the Commonwealth’s Supplier
Diversity office (SDO).
FY2024 was a year full of achievements as the UMass Supplier Diversity program and its Chief Procurement
Officer as we celebrated five years of formation. Some of the significant achievements include:
• The UMass Supplier Diversity Program was recognized when the CPO, David Cho, won the Pacesetter
Champion of the Year award from GBCC.
• Increasing the percentage of total diversity spending from 4.9% (FY2019) to 11% (FY2024) over five
years
• Spending $138 million over five years with Tier 1 diverse suppliers
• Implemented a Tier 2 (subcontractor) diverse spend reporting program with prime suppliers by
including contract language to leverage tier 2 diverse suppliers (i.e., putting a 20% Tier 2 diversity spend
requirement in specific contracts)
• Ramped up participation and partnership with diversity organizations while supporting other higher ed
organizations to ramp up their programs
Goods and Services: UMass System Office
The long-term strategy implemented to grow diverse and local supplier usage continues to bear fruit for UMass.
In FY2024, we experienced a 17% increase in spending with diverse suppliers, i.e., $119 million (FY2024) against
$102 million (FY2023). Out of a total spend of $1.07 billion in FY2024, 11.2% ($119 million) was with Tier 1
diverse suppliers; we continue to ramp up supplier participation in our Tier 2 program, which we hope we can
report on in the future.
To illustrate the variety of representations in UMass’s supply chain, this year’s narrative includes a full
breakdown of each diversity category tracked by the university.
FY2024 UMass Goods & Services Diverse Spending By Diversity Category
Certification Description FY2024 Diverse Spend*
Small Disadvantaged Business (SDB) $66,458,515
Women-owned Business Enterprise (WBE) $43,200,728
Minority-owned Business Enterprise (MBE) $36,840,979
Veteran-owned Business Enterprise (VBE) $14,531,350
HUBZone Certified (HUB) $10,964,521
Service-Disabled Veteran-owned Business Ent. $10,185,457
Disadvantaged Business Enterprise (DBE) $4,316,728
Disability-owned Business Enterprise $138,934
LGBT-owned Business Enterprise $ 58,202
* UMass direct (Tier 1) supplier expenditures only. Some suppliers hold multiple certifications.
65

For FY25, we continue to focus on solidifying the achievements of the last five years while looking at additional
ways to entrench diverse purchasing in all our transactions, e.g., define a diverse supplier target for the system,
standardize our Tier 2 program (effective reporting and tracking) and deepening our Construction category
diversity tracking and compliance needs.
University of Massachusetts Building Authority (UMBA)
During FY2024, the University of Massachusetts Building Authority continued implementing best practices to
improve and support its compliance model. In September, UMBA participated in Governor Healey’s Public
Construction Advisory Council to identify barriers and recommendation options in construction and design for
Minority Business Enterprises (MBE) and Women Business Enterprises (WBE).
UMBA broadened its efforts by engaging with more organizations like the Massachusetts Minority Contractors
Association and InOrder Business to help create more opportunities for women and minority firms. UMBA also
continued to collaborate with the building trades, vocational/technical schools, pre-apprenticeship programs
and community organizations to attract and recruit more MBE and WBE firms to bid on our construction
projects. We will continue to meet with our General Contractors, Owner Project Managers, Subcontractors,
Architectural firms, and the Design, Construction and the Compliance Working Groups that we have established
on the UMass Campuses to review the compliance results, provide resources and support MBE/WBE initiatives.
In FY2024, UMBA paid $42,812,763 to MBE and WBE firms working on capital projects.
FY2024 Construction & Design Spending
Minority-Owned - Construction $5,351,763
Women-Owned - Construction $26,380,750
Minority-Owned - Design $2,419,958
Women -Owned - Design $5,094,033
OPM-MWBE $3,566,259
Grand Total $42,812,763
