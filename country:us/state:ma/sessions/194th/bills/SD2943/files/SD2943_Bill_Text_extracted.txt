Legislative Mandate
The following report is hereby issued pursuant to Chapter 179 of the Acts of 2022,

Section 4:
Section 83 as follows:

Section 5:
SECTION 83. (a) The Massachusetts School Building Authority shall conduct an
assessment of elementary and secondary school buildings relative to energy efficiency,
building conditions, safety, and public health. The assessment shall include cataloging
the age and condition of any building systems relying on the on-site combustion of fossil
fuels. The assessment shall be conducted in coordination with ongoing assessments or
surveys of the authority. The authority shall determine the means of conducting the
assessment which may include a representative sample of schools. In planning said
assessment, the authority shall consult with the department of public health, the
department of elementary and secondary education and the department of energy
resources.
Following completion of the assessment, the department of public health, in consultation
with the Massachusetts School Building Authority, the department of elementary and
secondary education, and the department of energy resources, shall develop, and
report on, methods, best practices, and standards for achieving green and healthy
schools strategies to for (sic) the students of the commonwealth. Methods, best
practices, and standards may involve, but shall not be limited to: (i) increasing energy
efficiency, increasing electrification, and shifting to fossil-free fuels; (ii) efficiently using
resources, including, but not limited to, low flow water fixtures; (iii) improving water and
air quality, ventilation, and air circulation systems; (iv) maintaining thermal comfort,
humidity, and temperature controls; and (v) taking other actions the department may
determine.
The department of public health shall issue a report on the methods, best practices and
standards and may include recommendations to prioritize schools with the greatest
needs, consider the unique environmental differences of schools located in urban,
industrial, rural and other areas facing site challenges, and consider the need to
address historic patterns of inequity in education and schools including, but not limited
to, patterns of inequity involving students in special education programs. The report
shall include a projected cost estimates (sic) for implementing its recommendations in a
cost-effective manner.
(b) The report shall be published on the website of the department of public health and
submitted to the house and senate committees on ways and means, the joint committee
on telecommunications, utilities and energy, the joint committee on public health, and
the joint committee on education not later than December 31, 2024.
(c) Any findings or recommendations may be used to guide the department of
elementary and secondary education in its implementation of item 1599-2055 of section
2A of chapter 102 of the acts of 2021.

Methods, Best Practices, and Standards for Achieving Green and Healthy Schools in the Commonwealth
of Massachusetts
Executive Summary
As the oldest public school system in the United States, the Commonwealth of
Massachusetts has a unique history that helped establish the fundamental basis for the
current universal public education system across the United States. This history is
incomplete without also acknowledging the legacy of profound injustices based on race
and ethnicity, gender, abilities, faith/spirituality, and more.
Chapter 179 of the Acts of 2022, Section 83, charged the Massachusetts Department of
Public Health (DPH) with identifying methods, best practices, and standards for
achieving green and healthy schools across the Commonwealth. Given its mission and
vision statement, DPH has included a specific focus on equity so that all students can
access and fully appreciate the numerous and far-reaching benefits associated with
green and healthy schools—regardless of their race and ethnicity, gender, abilities,
faith/spirituality, and family income.
DPH developed this report to serve as a resource for individual schools, school districts,
municipalities, and others who share a goal of implementing cost-effective strategies
that create sustainable, healthy, and equitable learning environments for all students
across the Commonwealth. This report outlines strategies to help Massachusetts
schools incorporate sustainable design, construction, and operations and provide a
healthy learning environment for all students. One recurring theme throughout the report
is the ability of certain strategies to produce co-benefits that cut across numerous
objectives. For example, the installation and optimization of heating, ventilation, and air
conditioning (HVAC) systems enables schools to improve energy efficiency, enhance
thermal comfort and climate resilience, and provide healthier learning environments
through improved indoor air quality. Another cross-cutting best practice is to incorporate
health equity and environmental justice principles and data into decision making to
address disease, race, economic, and environmental burdens in the schools and
communities.
Implementing the strategies in this report requires both financial and human resources.
While many can be implemented at relatively low cost, others would require large
capital improvement projects and significant funding and human resources to champion,
initiate, plan, and manage. School districts could use additional resources for items
such as professional environmental building assessments and capital improvement
projects for HVAC systems, workforce training, technical assistance to prepare grant
applications or develop Statements of Interest for Massachusetts School Building
Authority funding, hazard removal, building envelope/window repairs, vehicle
electrification, and other building energy efficiency improvements. Similarly, cities and
towns may benefit from outdoor air quality monitoring to determine how to improve
indoor air quality in schools and, consequently, the health of staff and students in those
buildings.

I. Introduction
Massachusetts Department of Public Health – Our Mission and Vision
The mission of the Massachusetts Department of Public Health (DPH) is to promote and
protect health and wellness and prevent injury and illness for all people. DPH prioritizes
racial equity in health by improving equitable access to quality public health and health
care services and partnering with communities most impacted by health inequities and
structural racism.1
DPH envisions a Commonwealth with an equitable and just public health system that
supports optimal well-being for all people in Massachusetts, centering those with
systemically and culturally oppressed identities and circumstances.
DPH Resources for Schools
DPH has subject matter and inspectional expertise as well as data resources for
numerous topic areas covered in this report, including indoor air quality, lead, and
radon. DPH manages and maintains numerous programs and resources to ensure
and promote healthy learning environments across the Commonwealth, including the

Addressing Structural Racism
DPH’s Strategic Plan to Advance Racial Equity acknowledges that to advance health
equity, DPH must use an intersectional, equity-centered lens to focus on addressing the
persistent racial inequities impacting the health access, treatment, outcomes, and
overall well-being of people across the Commonwealth, specifically those who identify
as Black, Indigenous, Hispanic/Latino, and/or Asian/Pacific Islander. The COVID-19
pandemic brought into painful, undeniable public view the clear, present, and ongoing
health inequities perpetuated by systemic racial inequities across the public health
infrastructure, health care delivery systems, and social determinants of health (SDOH)
in Massachusetts. Understanding the ways that systems of oppression create and
perpetuate structural inequities supports DPH in making system-level changes to
advance health equity. DPH seeks to understand how the structures it designs,
operates, and builds perpetuate inequities. By embracing an understanding of the ways
that state and national public service systems have been built upon racialized policies,
practices, and institutions,

The Healey Administration’s Advancing Health Equity in Massachusetts (AHEM)
initiative has two initial key focus areas: maternal health and SDOH that impact
cardiometabolic disease. SDOH are nonmedical factors—i.e., conditions in which
people are born, grow, work, live, and age—that influence health outcomes and may
make a person more vulnerable to diseases. SDOH are a key priority area for the U.S.
Department of Health and Human Services’ Healthy People 2030, with objectives to set
data-driven policy within the areas of health care access and quality, education access
and quality, social and community context, economic stability, and neighborhood and
built environments. While more research is needed, asthma in young people has been
linked to an increased risk of cardiovascular disease.2

In our country, a person’s zip code is more predictive of one's life expectancy than
one’s own genetic code. As a result, around the country, credible, serious efforts to
address health disparities have all prioritized developing a granular, “place-based”
understanding of where disparities in the community are most profound.
Inequities in Asthma Burden in Massachusetts
Like many other New England States, Massachusetts has a high prevalence of
asthma compared to national rates. Among those living with asthma in the
Commonwealth, there are significant disparities in asthma outcomes by
race/ethnicity. Following are notable details contributing to and related to these
disparities:
• Various forms of discrimination and racism have created long-standing structural
health inequities for people of color and lower-income individuals. These
populations have historically been excluded from meaningful participation in
decisions that impact their communities’ environmental health. For example,
people of color and people with limited incomes are more likely to live near toxic
waste sites, in areas with high air pollution, and in low-quality housing because
of the inequitable distribution of these high-polluting sites.
• Structural inequities result in fewer health care providers, limited access to
transportation options, and limited access to community health information due
to inaccessible health communications and lack of access for non-English
speakers.
• As of 2020, the rates of asthma-related hospitalization and emergency
department visits for Black non-Hispanic and Hispanic residents are three-to-
four times higher than those of White non-Hispanic residents.
Source: DPH 3
Acknowledging the SDOH and the broader structural factors that have led to historic
disinvestment in communities of color, DPH’s 2022–2026 Strategic Plan for Asthma in
Massachusetts strives to address the significant racial disparities in asthma burden that
exist in Massachusetts through the “leading with race and racism explicitly but not
exclusively” framework. The 2022–2026 Strategic Plan for Asthma in Massachusetts is
the result of a comprehensive planning process undertaken virtually in the summer and
fall of 2020, in accordance with the COVID-19 guidance at the time, by the DPH’s
Asthma Prevention and Control Program (APCP) and the Massachusetts Asthma Action
Partnership (MAAP), in collaboration with asthma partners, stakeholders, and thought
leaders across Massachusetts. It is meant to highlight opportunities for cross-
collaboration and collective impact in how programs and organizations address asthma,
specifically the inequitable burden of asthma across the Commonwealth of
Massachusetts and identified priority areas of schools, housing, community and clinical
coordination, and outdoor air quality. The 2022–2026 Strategic Plan for Asthma in
Massachusetts is also grounded in the principles of environmental justice and equitable

distribution of environmental benefits—that all people have a right to be protected from
environmental pollution and live in and enjoy a clean environment. It is within this
context that it specifically identifies air quality and pollution as asthma triggers that
disproportionately exist in underserved communities and affect people of color. The
data-driven Strategic Plan for Asthma makes a commitment to center asthma efforts
within the 11 communities of focus that DPH identified as experiencing the highest
burden of asthma inequities in Massachusetts at the time of the development of the
Strategic Plan in 2020.
DPH identified 11 communities of focus based on the following indicators of asthma
burden:
• Asthma hospitalization rates that are significantly higher than the state average
(all ages)
• Asthma emergency department rates that are significantly higher than the state
average (all ages)
• Index of the Concentration at the Extremes score that is lower than the state
average, a measure of privilege and disadvantage examining both racial/ethnic
and economic segregation
See Figure 1 for a map illustrating the 11 communities of focus.

For the first year of the pilot, DPH invited five public K–8 schools—each located in a
different school district—to participate. Of these, schools in Chicopee, Gardner,
Holyoke, and Lowell agreed to participate. DPH conducted comprehensive indoor air
quality assessments in the schools and provided school-specific and best practice
recommendations to improve indoor air quality, technical assistance, and educational
materials and resources. DPH plans to continue this initiative for the 2024–2025 school
year and to expand the pilot to additional districts based on more recent pediatric
asthma surveillance data.
Additionally, DPH and the Massachusetts Executive Office of Energy and
Environmental Affairs (EEA) are leading numerous other racial equity initiatives that
address racism as a serious public health threat, including:
• DPH’s Community Health Equity Initiative
• DPH’s Determination of Need Community Health Initiatives
• DPH’s Racial Equity Data Roadmap
• DPH’s Root Cause Solutions Exchange
• EEA’s 2024 Environmental Justice Strategy
Overview of Public Schools in Massachusetts
Home to the oldest public school system in the United States, Massachusetts has a
long and unique history of planning, constructing, and operating taxpayer-funded public
schools, evidenced by the following timeline of notable historical facts:
• 1635 – Puritan settlers established the first public school, Boston Latin School, in
Boston Massachusetts, in what would eventually become the United States. 5
• 1643 – The Town of Dedham, Massachusetts, unanimously voted to authorize
the first taxpayer-funded public school in the United States.6

With this legacy, Massachusetts is home to four of the five oldest U.S. public high
schools still in use10 and 28 of the 100 oldest high schools in America.11 Over the nearly
400 years since the founding of the first public school, the Commonwealth of
Massachusetts has seen its public school system grow to its current collection of more
than 1,800 public schools spread across nearly 400 public school districts.12 Table 2
provides a closer look at some of the key characteristics of the Commonwealth’s
portfolio of public school buildings.

Environmental Differences and Challenges by Location
The Commonwealth’s 399 school districts, which collectively operate 1,827 public
elementary and secondary schools,13 are dispersed across a range of geographic
locations, including those defined as urban, rural, and close to industrial activity. Each of
these geographic categories presents a unique collection of environmental challenges
and considerations that impact the extent to which students can thrive in an
environmentally sustainable and healthy learning environment.
Urban Regions
There are numerous ways to define urban regions. Qualitatively, an urban area can
refer to large cities, towns, and suburbs.14 The U.S. Census Bureau defines urban areas
as geographic areas of 50,000 or more people.15 It further defines urban clusters as
geographic areas of 2,500 to 50,000 people. Urban areas are typically characterized by
a high density of people, human structures (including older buildings that may have
environmental hazards such as lead-based paint and asbestos), transportation
infrastructure (including impervious surfaces that absorb heat and prevent the natural
percolation of rainwater to underground aquifers), and traffic congestion. Urban regions
in the Commonwealth experience numerous environmental challenges, including the
following:
• Degraded air quality resulting from higher emissions of criteria and toxic air
pollutants from both stationary and mobile sources
• Long-duration elevated ambient temperatures resulting from the heat island
effect16
• Flash flooding resulting from the higher concentration of impervious surfaces
• Increased likelihood of pediatric exposure to lead (on interior painted surfaces
and in the soil) as a result of older building stocks that commonly used lead-
based paint prior to federal regulations restricting its use and proximity to
emissions from vehicles that use leaded gasoline17
Rural regions
The Massachusetts State Office of Rural Health considers a municipality in
Massachusetts as rural if it meets at least one of the following criteria:15
• Meets at least one of the following three federal rural definitions at the sub-
county level:
11
I. Introduction

o U.S. Census Bureau: Urban areas are geographic areas of 50,000 or more
people. Urban clusters are geographic areas of 2,500 to 50,000 people. Any
area not categorized as an urban area or urban cluster is considered rural.18
o Office of Management and Budget: Designates counties as metropolitan
(metro), micropolitan (micro), or neither (as summarized in Table 3.19
Table 3. Office of Management and Budget’s Definition of Rural

people per square mile
• Has an acute care hospital in the town that meets the state hospital licensure
definition of a small rural hospital, or is a certified Critical Access Hospital
Rural communities comprise 59 percent of the land area in the Commonwealth yet only
13 percent of the total statewide population.21 There are 170 communities in
Massachusetts that meet the state definition of rural and are primarily located in western
and central Massachusetts, with additional clusters in the northeast, southeast and the
Cape.
Rural areas in Massachusetts do not experience many of the same environmental
challenges noted above for urban areas; however, they do still encounter other
environmental challenges, such as a reduction in the supply of clean water, particularly
for communities reliant on well water.22 In addition, rural areas in Massachusetts often
face financial challenges that negatively impact the learning environment and outcomes,
such as:23
• Significant student enrollment decline, which contributes to:
o Higher per-pupil operating costs
o Substantially reduced course offerings, student support services, and
extracurricular activities
• Locations farther away from economic opportunities concentrated in more
populated areas of the Commonwealth, which contributes to:
o An insufficient and stagnant tax base
o A greater proportional share of local government budgets to fund school
operating budgets

Regions Close to Industrial Activities
Across the United States, there are 12,000 schools located within a mile of a hazardous
chemical facility.24 In Boston, almost one in three public schools is located within one
mile of such a facility.25 Schools in close proximity to industrial activities and industrial
and chemical waste sites may experience impaired indoor air quality via infiltration of
outdoor air pollutants to the indoor environment through vents and open windows.
Schools in these locations may also experience vapor intrusion, which is a chemical
transport process by which vapor-forming chemicals migrate from a subsurface source
into an overlying building.26 Students and school personnel may also be exposed to
outdoor air pollutants while outside the school. See the Mitigate Occurrences of Vapor
Intrusion discussion and Objective 2a(7). Reduce Exposure to Outdoor Air Pollutants for
additional details.
Massachusetts School Building Authority (MSBA)
In 2004, the State Legislature established the
Source of MSBA Funding

municipalities and school districts to provide Commonwealth using a
competitive grant funding to create safe and dedicated revenue stream of
sustainable learning environments using right- one penny of the state’s 6.25
sized, fiscally responsible, and educationally percent sales tax, known as the
appropriate solutions.27 A seven-member Board of School Modernization Trust
Directors oversees the MSBA, and the State Fund (“SMART Fund”).
Treasurer serves as the MSBA’s chair.
Proud History of Greening Schools in Massachusetts
As noted in the October 2023 Office of the Governor’s Recommendations of the
Climate Chief, Pursuant to Section 3(b) of Executive Order No. 604:
Since its formation, the MSBA has been an advocate of ‘green’ sustainable building
design for all MSBA-funded public K-12 school buildings and has regularly adjusted
its Green Program Policy since then to promote increasing levels of energy efficiency
in school design… to decarbonize buildings. In the last ten years, 95 percent of the
MSBA-funded schools have exceeded MSBA’s base project requirements with one
school achieving ‘Platinum’ in the U.S. Green Building Council’s (USGBC’s)
Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certification program, 27
schools achieving LEED ‘Gold,’ and 47 schools achieving LEED ‘Silver.’ As of June
2023, the MSBA has funded 20 all-electric schools and 18 schools employing
ground-source heat pumps.
13
I. Introduction
Methods, Best Practices, and Standards for Achieving Green and Healthy Schools in the Commonwealth
of Massachusetts
The MSBA is required to perform periodic school surveys of all public elementary and
secondary schools in the Commonwealth to observe and assess numerous key
parameters, including building systems conditions, the general physical environment,
and space utilization. The surveys provide important information that enables the MSBA
to better understand the unique needs of individual schools and their respective school
districts and assist the MSBA in providing equitable funding for school construction,
renovation, and repair projects across the Commonwealth.28 To date, the MSBA has
completed three cycles of school surveys: in 2005, 2010, and 2016. The MSBA expects
to complete its next survey and publish the accompanying report by the end of 2025.
The MSBA provides competitive grant funding through two main programs:
• Core Program: provides grant funding for new construction, additions, and major
renovation projects
• Accelerated Repair Program: provides grant funding for buildings that need
roof and/or window/door replacements but are otherwise structurally sound.
Boiler replacements were last included for invitation in 2022. The MSBA is
completing a study with a consultant in anticipation of adding heat pump
conversions to the Accelerated Repair Program for existing buildings beginning
in 2025.
To be considered for MSBA grant funding, school districts must submit a Statement of
Interest (SOI) during the MSBA’s established open submittal period each year.
Following the closing of the SOI submittal period, MSBA staff conduct due diligence and
recommend SOIs for the MSBA Board of Directors’ review and approval of invitations
into the grant program based on demonstrated need and urgency. Per legislative
mandate,29 the MSBA approves SOIs in accordance with the priority criteria established
in MA General Law (M.G.L.) 70B, including but not limited to the eight priority criteria
outlined in §8 (outlined in the following text).30
14
I. Introduction
Methods, Best Practices, and Standards for Achieving Green and Healthy Schools in the Commonwealth
of Massachusetts
Priority Criteria for the Approval of MSBA-Funded Projects
• Priority 1: Priority shall be given to school projects needed in the judgment of
said board to replace or renovate a building which is structurally unsound or
otherwise in a condition seriously jeopardizing the health and safety of school
children, where no alternative exists.
• Priority 2: Priority shall be given to school projects to eliminate existing
severe overcrowding.
• Priority 3: Priority shall be given to school projects needed in the judgment of
said authority to prevent loss of accreditation.
• Priority 4: Priority shall be given to school projects needed in the judgment of
said authority to prevent severe overcrowding expected to result from
increased enrollments which must be substantiated.
• Priority 5: Priority shall be given to projects needed in the judgment of said
authority for the replacement, renovation, or modernization of the heating
system in any schoolhouse to increase energy conservation and decrease
energy related costs in said schoolhouse.
• Priority 6: Priority shall be given to any school project needed in the
judgment of said authority for short-term enrollment growth.
• Priority 7: Priority shall be given to school projects needed in the judgment of
said authority to replace or add to obsolete buildings in order to provide for a
full range of programs consistent with state and approved local requirements.
• Priority 8: Priority shall be given to projects needed in the judgment of said
authority to transition from court-ordered and authority approved racial
balance school districts to walk-to, so-called, or other school districts.
Following the evaluation and approval of SOIs using the statutorily mandated priority
criteria, the MSBA calculates the value of each grant. For grants approved through the
Core Program, the MSBA determines the grant value by utilizing the reimbursement
rate formula outlined in M.G.L., 70B, §1030,31 (presented in Table 4).

Massachusetts toward its goal of net zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2050
via clean energy production, battery storage, and electrification of buildings and the
transportation sector.32 Section 83 specifically focuses on creating sustainable and
healthy learning environments in public elementary and secondary schools across the
Commonwealth. Section 83, in particular, requires two primary actions:

Section 6:
1. The MSBA is required to “conduct an assessment of elementary and secondary
school buildings relative to energy efficiency, building conditions, safety, and public
health” that includes “cataloging the age and condition of any building systems
relying on the on-site combustion of fossil fuels. The assessment shall be conducted
in coordination with ongoing assessments or surveys of the authority. The authority
shall determine the means of conducting the assessment which may include a
representative sample of schools. In planning said assessment, the authority shall
consult with the department of public health, the department of elementary and
secondary education and the department of energy resources.”

2. DPH is required to draft and issue a report on “methods, best practices, and
standards for achieving green and healthy schools strategies to for (sic) the students
of the commonwealth” and include cost estimates for implementing its
recommendations cost-effectively. The legislation provides DPH latitude to optionally
include the following content as part of the report:
a. Increasing energy efficiency
b. Increasing electrification

The Critical Need for Green and Healthy Schools
The numerous methods and best practices for achieving green and healthy schools
outlined in this report are interconnected and promote vibrant, just, inspiring, engaging,
healthy, and high-performing schools and surrounding communities.33 Many of the
strategies for achieving green schools provide critical support to the Commonwealth’s
goal of net zero GHG emissions by 2050. Additionally, by applying an equity lens to the
implementation of the strategies in this report, school districts can address disparities in
the health and educational outcomes of students from underserved and marginalized
communities that have resulted from historical structural racism.
17
I. Introduction
Methods, Best Practices, and Standards for Achieving Green and Healthy Schools in the Commonwealth
of Massachusetts
While the path ahead is filled with opportunities, there are numerous challenges that
school districts will likely face. There are many strategies that schools can implement
with relatively low costs and human resource burdens. Many of the more impactful
strategies, however, will require significant financial resources, technical expertise, and
human resources to initiate, plan, implement, and sustain.
Purpose
DPH identified its Bureau of Climate and Environmental Health (BCEH) to lead the
development of this report to respond to and comply with the requirements outlined in

This report outlines best practices to help Massachusetts schools incorporate
sustainable design, construction, and operations and provide a healthy learning
environment for all students. Implementing these best practices requires financial and
human resources. While many can be implemented at low cost, others require large
capital improvement projects and significant funding and human resources to champion,
initiate, plan, and manage. School districts might require resources for comprehensive,
professional environmental building assessments and capital improvement projects for
heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems, workforce development,
health equity data reviews, technical assistance to prepare grant requests or SOIs for
MSBA funding, hazard removal, building envelope/window repairs, vehicle
electrification, installation of green technology, and other building energy efficiency
improvements. Similarly, cities and towns may benefit from outdoor air quality
monitoring to determine how to improve indoor air quality in schools and the health of
staff and students in those buildings.

I. Introduction
Methods, Best Practices, and Standards for Achieving Green and Healthy Schools in the Commonwealth
of Massachusetts
Co-benefits and Disbenefits
There are numerous cross-cutting methods and best practices presented throughout
this report that not only address a primary goal area and/or objective, but also
produce positive outcomes, or co-benefits, in one or more other goal areas and/or
objectives. One example that this report frequently highlights is the ability of
optimized HVAC systems to produce both green and healthy co-benefits related to
building energy efficiency, enhanced climate resilience, and improved indoor air
quality—including helping to mitigate exposure to radon, PCBs, carbon monoxide,
and mold.
Conversely, there are also some methods and best practices (often those that are
more “short-term” in nature) that produce disbenefits. That is, they mitigate concerns
in one goal area and/or objective, but further exacerbate concerns in one or more
goal area and/or objective. For example, short-term increases in ventilation rates to
improve indoor air quality can increase facility energy consumption and associated
GHG emissions.
Local Public Health Departments as Partners
Local and regional public health departments are essential partners to school districts
wishing to implement the strategies outlined in this report, including addressing health
equity, identifying environmental justice concerns, reviewing possible sites for new
buildings, and providing health data for local funding requests.
Local public health officials should be at the table for local policy changes and to
support the school district in prioritizing buildings to meet equity goals by collaboration
on data analysis and community outreach.

other metrics related to the design and operation of
schools. More recently, the pursuit of green schools has
included a prominent emphasis on building decarbonization—the process of reducing
(or eliminating) GHG emissions associated with the construction and operation of
buildings. Green schools also pursue goals and implement best practices related to
water efficiency, solid waste diversion, electrification of school vehicle fleets, optimized
climate resilience, and other operational areas.
Following teacher salaries, school utilities (i.e., energy and water) and services (e.g.,
waste management, transportation) represent some of the largest operating costs to
school districts. Efficiency improvements in each of these areas can offer financial
savings and help school districts meet their fiduciary duty while also offering numerous
co-benefits to school district staff, the enrolled student body, and the surrounding

community. School districts are increasingly considering and implementing strategies
that address these areas so that schools can continue to operate reliably in the face of a
changing climate.
This section presents a brief background, a tabular summary of the methods and best
practices that can help school districts across the Commonwealth achieve green
schools, and a brief discussion of notable barriers and challenges that schools are likely
to face. Content is provided across the following six objectives:
a. Decarbonize buildings
b. Optimize water efficiency
c. Optimize solid waste reduction and diversion
d. Electrify school bus fleets
e. Provide electric vehicle charging stations for school staff and public use
f. Enhance climate resilience

while also generating or procuring renewable electricity that produces zero GHG
emissions.

While approximately 79 percent of
Massachusetts households heat their homes using fossil fuels, the MSBA found during
its 2016 School Survey that 97 percent of assessed school buildings relied on fossil fuel
heating systems. With expectations for the Massachusetts government to lead by
example41 and nearly 300 municipalities across the Commonwealth designated as
Green Communities by DOER, decarbonizing schools—which make up the largest
portion of most municipal building footprints—is a natural point of focus for climate
change mitigation. Projects to decarbonize school buildings also offer an opportunity to
achieve several other health-related co-benefits, including improving air quality through
optimized ventilation, improving occupant thermal comfort by adding air conditioning,
and other benefits described in this section.
The pathway and process to decarbonizing school buildings will vary at the building and
school district level depending on existing conditions, school program requirements,
available funding, and various other infrastructural and operational factors described in
this section. The core strategies for building decarbonization promoted by the
Commonwealth of Massachusetts include: (1) electrifying non-electric energy uses; (2)
decarbonizing the electric grid; and (3) reducing energy costs and the costs of transition
by increasing the efficiency of transportation and energy systems.40 Figure 2 depicts an
example pathway for how this process can occur over time in existing school buildings.

For many school districts, funding pressures present a recurring challenge for basic
operations; consequently, planning significant investments can feel daunting. Utility
expenditures can, however, represent both a budget pressure and an opportunity for
savings. After accounting for salaries, energy costs often represent a school’s largest
expense.43 Reducing facility energy consumption also offers additional budget stability
through reduced exposure to energy price volatility. Over time, realized energy cost
savings can be redirected to other school district priorities.
Methods and Best Practices
There are a number of methods and best practices that have been implemented to
successfully decarbonize schools across Massachusetts. These are organized in the
following sections in order of implementation:
• Conduct analysis and planning
• Implement strategies to achieve energy efficiency and building decarbonization
• Operate and maintain schools
• Procure decarbonized electricity
Table 6 provides a summary of methods and best practices for decarbonizing schools.
For each method and best practice, the table presents the approximate capital and
operating costs, implementation timeframe, and ease of implementation. See Section
VI, Objective 1a for additional narrative descriptions of each of the methods and best
practices.

Barriers and Challenges
Barriers to decarbonizing buildings are listed below:
• Significant investments are required to make improvements to school
infrastructure and augment operation and maintenance staffing. Future resource
needs are compounded by current and historical inequities in school and
community resources. Varying access to the financial and human resources
required to do this work is likely to lead to further inequities between school
districts.
• While there is a diverse array of commercially available technologies today,
some space-constrained or urban sites may have fewer options and need to
identify design alternatives as outlined in the component and whole system
retrofit strategy sections.
• Staff that have a long track record of safe operations of boilers (high pressure,
combustion steam vessels) will be required to become experts in the vapor
compression refrigeration cycle used by all heat pump technologies and
increasingly computerized operations. This transition will require significant
training initiatives, technical assistance/support, updates to hiring practices, and
in some cases major changes to operations and maintenance (O&M) programs.
• As with any retrofit project, there is an abatement risk that is not fully known
before a complete assessment is conducted. Older buildings that are anchors of
communities may also have legacy toxins (e.g., asbestos, PCBs) that require an
unknown amount of expensive abatement to implement many of the projects
described in this section. See Objective 2a. Improve Air Quality for additional
details about reducing exposure to these toxins.
There are already a number of successful all-electric schools and net zero school
projects across Massachusetts that can offer helpful case studies on how these
challenges have been successfully addressed.
Objective 1b. Optimize Water Efficiency
Background
Even though 70 percent of the Earth is covered by water, only 1 percent is available for
human use.44 As the impacts of climate change increase, optimizing water efficiency is
vital to managing intermittent and recurring drought conditions in Massachusetts and
ensuring water supply for future generations. Optimizing water efficiency can also help
2 The capital cost for installing onsite renewable energy systems will be highly dependent on the funding
strategy(ies) used to implement the project. For example, if a school utilizes the Energy Management
Services procurement method, the school could complete the project using no capital funding. See the
Funding Strategies section for additional information about funding strategies for decarbonization project
implementation.
3 The cost estimate scale in this section differs from other sections due to the higher capital intensity of
projects.
30
II. Goal 1: Achieve Green Schools
Methods, Best Practices, and Standards for Achieving Green and Healthy Schools in the Commonwealth
of Massachusetts
reduce the burden on aging infrastructure. Reduced demand for potable water, in turn,
reduces the need for water extraction, pumping, treatment, and delivery by existing
systems. In addition, since extracting, pumping, treating, and delivering water and
treating wastewater also consumes energy, decreased potable water consumption also
reduces energy use and associated GHG emissions.
In recent decades, Massachusetts has regularly experienced varying degrees of
drought conditions, ranging from abnormal dryness to extreme drought, as illustrated in
Figure 3.45 Annual precipitation amounts in Massachusetts have been increasing in
recent decades and are expected to continue to rise due to climate change.46 However,
according to the Massachusetts State Climate Summary 2022, scientists predict that
precipitation events over this century will be fewer more extreme events rather than
multiple smaller storms; extreme events often don’t translate to groundwater
replenishment or steady stream flows.47 In addition, scientists predict that the expected
warmer temperatures will increase evapotranspiration and decrease snowpack.47
Scientists project these conditions, when combined, may increase Massachusetts’
frequency and severity of droughts, prompting a need for optimizing water efficiency
across the state.46

The Alliance for Water Efficiency’s 2022 U.S. State Policy Scorecard for Water
Efficiency and Sustainability evaluates and scores states by their adoption of policies
and laws that advance water efficiency, conservation, and sustainability.48 On the 2022
scorecard, Massachusetts scored the most points for incorporating water efficiency in
plumbing fixture standards and codes and providing state funding for water efficiency
31

programs; however, the Commonwealth scored low on water conservation planning and
drought preparedness planning, among other things. If Massachusetts schools
collectively increase their focus on optimizing water efficiency, they can help the state
better prepare for drought and manage its water resources.
Schools use water in restrooms and cafeterias and can use water for building and
process cooling, irrigation, pools, laundries, and laboratories. Methods and best
practices to optimize water use overall and by specific end use are discussed in this

Section 26:
section.
Methods and Best Practices
There are many methods and best practices for optimizing water efficiency in schools,
including monitoring and managing water use, optimizing water efficiency of end uses
and systems, and using alternative water sources. Table 7 summarizes methods and
best practices for optimizing water efficiency in schools. For each method/best practice,
the table presents the approximate capital and operating costs, implementation
timeframe, and ease of implementation. See Section VI, Objective 1b for additional
narrative descriptions of each of the methods and best practices.

Barriers and Challenges
The two primary barriers and challenges to optimizing water efficiency in schools are
necessary funding and staff availability. Schools and school districts may not have
33
II. Goal 1: Achieve Green Schools
Methods, Best Practices, and Standards for Achieving Green and Healthy Schools in the Commonwealth
of Massachusetts
funding for some of the larger-scale water efficiency projects identified in this section,
but they may be able to implement the lower-cost projects more easily.
Some water efficiency methods and best practices require trained and knowledgeable
staff. For example, facility water assessments and irrigation system audits require
trained professionals to accurately and efficiently evaluate buildings and systems and
identify efficiency opportunities. Some schools may not have the resources to hire these
professionals and, further, do not have full-time facility management staff on site to do
the work themselves. Where facility management staff are present, they can be trained
on water-using systems and water efficiency to implement the methods and best
practices to optimize water efficiency identified here.
Objective 1c. Optimize Solid Waste Reduction and Diversion
Background
Virtually all human activities, including the construction, day-to-day operation, and
disposition of school facilities, generate some form of waste. Solid waste, also
commonly referred to as “trash” or “garbage,” consists of both municipal solid waste
(items that consumers dispose of after use, including food; organic materials; plastic,
glass, and aluminum containers and consumer packaging; corrugated cardboard;
furniture; electronics; and appliances)49 and non-municipal solid waste, which includes
construction and demolition debris.
Solid waste can have detrimental impacts on the environment. Municipal solid waste
landfills utilized to dispose of solid waste release methane gas as organic waste
decomposes. The release of this methane contributes to global climate change.
Landfills represent the third largest source of human-related methane emissions in the
United States.50 Landfills also produce leachate, which forms when rainwater passes
through waste materials in a landfill and leaches chemicals from the various materials. If
not properly collected and treated, leachate can find its way into and contaminate
groundwater.51 An alternative to sending solid waste to landfills, waste incineration (also
referred to as “energy recovery” or “waste-to-energy”) releases harmful pollutants such
as particulate matter (PM), lead, mercury, per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS),
and dioxins, which enter the air, water, and food supply near waste incinerators.52
In 2022, Massachusetts disposed of 6 million tons of solid waste, of which 3.4 million
tons were disposed of in-state (the remaining 2.6 tons were exported for disposal out-of-
state).53 Of the portion of solid waste disposed of in-state, nearly 86 percent of the
Commonwealth’s solid waste is incinerated in waste-to-energy facilities, while the
remaining 14 percent goes to landfills.6 In 2020, the incineration and disposal of solid
waste in landfills in Massachusetts generated 1.44 million metric tons of carbon dioxide
equivalent (MMTCO e), representing 2.2 percent of Massachusetts’ gross GHG
2
emissions in 2020.54 In the Commonwealth’s 2030 Solid Waste Management Plan,
MassDEP has established a goal of reducing annual solid waste disposal by 30 percent
by 2030 and by 90 percent by 2050, relative to a 2018 baseline. MassDEP has
identified food waste as the largest single material category found in the

Methods, Best Practices, and Standards for Achieving Green and Healthy Schools in the Commonwealth

Barriers and Challenges
Schools face several challenges in pursuing zero-waste operations. Namely, many
schools lack professional oversight over organics management. In this absence,
students often volunteer to staff smaller-scale composting programs, which, while
educational for the student, do not provide the long-term staffing that waste
management requires. Schools may not have dedicated waste diversion professionals
but rather depend on district or county-level support. Negotiations with janitorial or
custodial unions are often cited as bottlenecks that derail progress toward implementing
a compost program because janitors or custodians may view composting as an
additional responsibility outside of their agreed responsibilities. Roles and
responsibilities must be mutually agreeable, and an effectively implemented compost
program should not require significant additional labor from janitorial or custodial staff
since the total amount of waste produced does not change.
Zero-waste options are sometimes seen as being costly because of upfront capital
costs or increased labor costs. However, savings from lower procurement costs,
decreased hauling fees, and potential rebates or incentives can make zero-waste cost-
saving.
Objective 1d. Electrify School Bus Fleets
Background
Historically, the most frequent passengers of school buses are students from Black
households and low-income backgrounds.56,57 While school buses provide a crucial
service to families who may otherwise be unable to get their children to school due to
working schedules or other circumstances, these vehicles are not without their
drawbacks. Emissions from internal combustion engine (ICE) school buses have been
linked to worsening air quality, increased GHG emissions, and adverse health effects.58
Diesel exhaust, a known carcinogen, has been associated with respiratory illness, heart
disease, and low attendance rates.58,59 Furthermore, the passengers on school buses
are children, who—along with those having pre-existing conditions—are most affected
by diesel exhaust.60 The negative effects of these fossil fuel-burning buses are
experienced not only by the communities in which the buses operate but also by those
students riding the bus, where a lack of ventilation often leads to high levels of pollution
within the vehicle cabin.61
Electric school buses (ESBs) offer a zero-emission alternative to legacy ICE vehicles.
These buses not only release zero direct emissions and have a smaller carbon footprint
than traditional school buses but also generally have a lower total cost of ownership as
compared to ICE school buses.62 Despite a higher upfront price, owners of ESBs
experience lifetime savings in lower fuel and mechanical costs.63 These savings are
realized in part because of the simplicity of an electric power train. While a traditional
ICE vehicle can have more than 200 moving parts, an electric vehicle usually has only
about 17.64 With fewer parts at risk of failure, ESB owners find their vehicles spend less
time undergoing maintenance. Additionally, it is less expensive (on average) to charge
37
II. Goal 1: Achieve Green Schools
Methods, Best Practices, and Standards for Achieving Green and Healthy Schools in the Commonwealth
of Massachusetts
an ESB than it is to fully fuel an ICE vehicle. A study by school bus manufacturer Blue
Bird found that while it costs 49 cents per mile to operate a diesel school bus, it only
costs about 14 cents per mile to operate an electric school bus.65 Estimates have
determined that owners of electric school buses save around $100,000 throughout the
vehicle’s lifetime.63
Reports from ESB operators suggest that the vehicles are performing well. All ESBs
have at least 100 miles of driving range per charge, and some buses can travel up to
210 miles on a single charge.66 Drivers cite the vehicle’s smooth handling and quiet
operation as major benefits of the technology.67 Some drivers even suggest that the
reduced noise from the ESB’s electric traction motor has had positive impacts on
student behavior.67
A favorable policy environment has increased the presence of these vehicles on the
road. A December 2023 estimate found that 8,570 ESBs are either on the road, on
order, or have been awarded.68 In addition, numerous states such as New York and
California have passed mandates that all purchased or leased school buses be electric
or zero-emission in the near future.69,70 Momentum for similar legislation is growing
within Massachusetts. In February 2024, electric
school bus supporters delivered a letter signed by Multi-State ZEV Task Force

Barriers and Challenges
One of the most frequent concerns for school bus operators is the effect that cold
weather can have on vehicle performance. This concern is valid as the range of an
electric school bus can decrease in cold temperatures as the vehicle pulls energy from
the battery to heat the cabin and the vehicle battery itself.75 Districts have reported a
10–15 percent decrease in battery capacity during winter months.75 Studies of electric
transit buses have reported a 33 percent decrease in range when temperatures
dropped below 25° Fahrenheit (F).76 Despite this, ESBs are present in cold weather
climates. In fact, 49 states have electric school buses either operating or committed.68
There are even electric school buses as far north as Alaska, where Tok Transportation
has been successfully operating an ESB in temperatures as low as -40° F since 2019.77
Some districts have gone as far as to say that they prefer their ESBs in the winter since
they start more reliably and their comparatively heavier weight makes the vehicles more
stable on icy roads.78 To combat the decrease in the cold weather range, districts have
installed auxiliary diesel heaters to warm the vehicle cabins. Other districts have found
preconditioning, a process where the vehicle is warmed while still connected to the
charger, a successful strategy to avoid losing battery capacity to cold weather.
39
II. Goal 1: Achieve Green Schools
Methods, Best Practices, and Standards for Achieving Green and Healthy Schools in the Commonwealth
of Massachusetts
Extreme heat can also affect the ESB battery range to a lesser extent. A study of
electric transit buses determined that energy used by the vehicle’s HVAC and
ventilation reduced the vehicle’s range.79 While there isn’t available data to quantify this
loss for buses specifically, studies that have analyzed EVs generally found that when
temperatures climb above 95° Fahrenheit, the range decreases by around 4 percent.80
Similar strategies can be used to limit the effect of heat on the ESB range, such as
preconditioning. Furthermore, some fleets find storing their vehicles and chargers in
shaded or covered areas helpful in reducing range loss.
Some districts are hesitant to pursue ESBs due to range anxiety. Fears of electric buses
losing power and needing to be towed while on routes have slowed the adoption of the
technology. However, with careful planning, these scenarios can be avoided. All ESB
models on the market can travel at least 100 miles on a single charge, and some
models can travel 210 miles or more.66 Districts that place ESBs on routes within their
actual range or account for range loss by utilizing mid-day charging have found electric
school buses to be a reliable alternative to ICE buses.66
The costs associated with ESBs are a common deterrent to the technology. The initial
purchase price of an electric school bus can be about three times more expensive than
an ICE bus, with some models going for as much as $400,000.81 In addition, fleets that
are just beginning their electrification journey can expect $10,000 to $30,000 in
infrastructure expenses per bus.82 While initial costs may be higher for an electric
vehicle, ESB owners can expect to save $100,000 in lifetime fuel and maintenance
costs.63 Additionally, numerous tax credits and funding programs are offered by federal,
state, and local governments, as well as electrical utilities. On average, this leads to
ESBs having a lower total cost of ownership than ICE buses.63
Objective 1e. Provide Electric Vehicle Charging Stations for School
Staff and Public Use
Background
The federal government has provided record funding for electric vehicle (EV) projects in
recent years. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (2021) and the Inflation Reduction Act
(2022) offer a combined $100 billion in EV project-eligible funding.83 Generally, this
funding has been met with enthusiasm as annual EV sales surpassed 1 million for the
first time in 2023.84 To support this influx of EVs on the road, robust EV charging
infrastructure is needed. Research suggests that roughly 45 million EV charging
stations will need to be operational by 2032, with a suggested 3.7 million Level 2
chargers at public locations and workplaces alone.85
The three most common EV charger levels are level 1, level 2, and direct current (DC)
fast chargers. Level 1 and level 2 chargers deliver energy in an alternating current while
DC fast chargers deliver energy in a direct current. Level 1 chargers are usually used
for long charging sessions with light-duty vehicles (such as overnight charging). These
chargers are commonly found in residential settings for personal use. Level 2 chargers,
in turn, can charge a light-duty vehicle in 4 to 10 hours and a heavy-duty vehicle (such
40
II. Goal 1: Achieve Green Schools
Methods, Best Practices, and Standards for Achieving Green and Healthy Schools in the Commonwealth
of Massachusetts
as an ESB) in 6 to 11 hours.86,87 These chargers may be more common in shared
residential spaces, workplaces, or facilities housing EV fleets. Finally, DC fast chargers
offer the ability to charge a light-duty EV in 20 minutes to an hour and a heavy-duty
vehicle in 1 hour to 4.5 hours.86,88 These chargers are most common along major
roadways or with EV fleets.
Making electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE) accessible in school parking lots for
use by staff and the public presents opportunities to expand EV utilization, reduce local
air pollution, and potentially create revenue for school districts. School districts that
install EVSE will need to establish policies regarding permissible users of the charging
stations.
Some schools choose to allow only district fleet vehicles to access charging stations.
The benefit of this approach is that chargers are available when needed and are
properly maintained. Additionally, there would likely be no need to have payment
systems installed in the chargers; a digital key can be issued to eligible vehicles that will
allow them to access the charger while preventing unauthorized users.
Other schools prefer to allow their staff to access the chargers to charge their personally
owned vehicles. Doing so helps incentivize the staff to adopt EVs. Additionally, the
inclusion or exclusion of payment systems can make the chargers either a revenue
creator for the school or a free perk for district employees.
Finally, some districts may choose to make the chargers accessible to the general
public. Doing so presents the opportunity to create revenue through payment systems
and incentivizes the presence of EVs on campus.
As EVs become more common near schools, there will likely be local air quality
improvements. According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), vehicle
emissions have been linked to certain cancers, as well as “neurological, cardiovascular,
respiratory, reproductive and/or immune system damage.”89
Recognizing the benefits of EVSE at workplaces, the Massachusetts government has
offered numerous incentive programs to encourage their deployment. Most of these
funding opportunities are offered through the Massachusetts Electric Vehicle Incentive
Program (MassEVIP). The following are recent MassEVIP opportunities that school
districts might qualify for:
• MassEVIP Public Access Charging
• MassEVIP Multi-Unit Dwelling & Educational Campus Charging
• MassEVIP Workplace and Fleet Charging Program Requirements
• MassEVIP Direct Current Fast Charging
41

These programs offer various funding amounts and have different eligibility
requirements. Prior to applying to any program, it is important that projects meet all
eligibility requirements.

Methods, Best Practices, and Standards for Achieving Green and Healthy Schools in the Commonwealth

Barriers and Challenges
When procuring new EVSE, an important first step in the commissioning process is
testing the compatibility of an EV and the charger together. If the technologies have an
issue, the fix can require a range of actions. The resolution could involve quick on-site
adjustments or could require sending the charger back to the original equipment
manufacturer (OEM) for a repair. To avoid this scenario, schools should consult the
OEM of the charger and the OEM of the primary vehicle it will be charging (if applicable)
to ensure compatibility.
Depending on the charger type, EVSE can have a high upfront cost. While there are
grant programs to help defray these costs, not every school district may qualify. In
particular, DC fast chargers can be expensive from both an acquisition and operational
standpoint. To address this, some EVSE owners choose to install payment platforms on
their chargers as a means of collecting revenue to help offset operational costs. This
may be a suitable strategy for reducing some of the upfront cost barriers.
A common concern for EVSE owners is how their monthly energy bill will be impacted
by vehicle charging. This is an especially important consideration for districts that plan
to charge vehicles during peak energy demand hours when many utilities will use
dynamic pricing and increase the rate at which they are charging for electricity. While
peak electrical demand hours will vary by location, the grid is typically the busiest
anywhere from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m.90 Many school districts have found managed charging to
be a helpful strategy to reduce the impact of vehicle charging on monthly utility
expenditures. This technology allows vehicle owners to schedule their vehicle charging
sessions to occur at times when electricity is comparatively cheaper, such as in the
middle of the night. While managed charging is not a feasible solution for every district
(such as those that need to utilize mid-day charging), it can help minimize charging
costs when implemented.
Because EVSE is high-voltage equipment, some charger owners run into issues finding
electricians who are certified to service them. Many EVSE funding programs require
that electricians performing work on chargers purchased with grant funding be certified
through the EVITP. Because this is a newer certification, many electricians may not yet
be certified to work on EV charging stations. Service contracts and warranties can help
connect EVSE owners to qualified technicians.
EV chargers that are left exposed in winter conditions may experience issues such as
the charger handle freezing to the charger body or a vehicle. The process of removing a
frozen charger handle can be difficult and time consuming. Districts in especially cold
weather climates should consider installing EVSE in covered areas.
Another concern for EVSE located in public areas is vandalism. The vandalism of EV
charging stations can include anything from graffiti, the theft of charger cables (likely for
the copper inside), or purposefully short-circuiting the charger.91 There can also be
issues with users not treating the equipment well, such as someone who charges their
vehicle but then leaves the cord on the ground when they leave. Solutions to curbing
43

vandalism include protecting chargers behind cages and the use of retractable cables,
bollards, and security cameras.92
Objective 1f. Enhance Climate Resilience
Background
Resilience refers to “the capacity of individuals, communities, businesses, institutions,
and governments to adapt to changing conditions and prepare for, withstand, and
rapidly recover from disruptions to everyday life, such as hazard events.”93 Nationwide,
schools are faced with increases in lost learning time from closures due to extreme
heat, wildfires, flooding, and other extreme weather events that are exacerbated by
climate change.94 Aging facilities and infrastructure, building conditions, and lack of
sufficient long-term maintenance and investments have forced school districts to make
difficult decisions regarding learning disruption to protect students and staff from
unhealthy conditions related to hazards. In addition to providing critical education
facilities, schools serve the broader community in times of need as emergency shelters,
food and aid distribution sites, cooling centers, and resilience hubs. These roles
servicing the broader community require close coordination between schools and local
municipal programs working on climate resilience. To reduce educational disruptions
associated with natural hazards, an increasing number of school districts have passed
climate resilience resolutions to encourage comprehensive planning and associated
infrastructure improvements.
ResilientMass is the statewide initiative led by the Massachusetts Emergency
Management Agency (MEMA) in conjunction with EEA; it covers resilience and climate
adaptation programs, policies, and initiatives. BCEH provided data metrics on negative
health impacts associated with climate change

Figure 4 presents a framework from the ResilientMass Plan for ranking the magnitude
of consequences for various hazards as informed by the risk assessment. While this
framework is a helpful reference at the statewide level, individual school districts and
schools may face hazards at differing magnitudes of consequences depending upon
their geographic location and adaptation capacity and, thus, are encouraged to evaluate
risk at the local or facility level using the methods described below. At a minimum, the
hazards associated with extreme heat should be a priority consideration for planning
purposes. The 2022 Massachusetts Climate Change Assessment notes that
researchers estimated that “at least 40 percent and as much as 100 percent of
classrooms in Massachusetts counties lack air conditioning, compared to 0 to 20
percent of classrooms in southeastern U.S. states that are better adapted to extreme
heat.” These same researchers estimated that—on a national scale—each 1⁰F increase
in school year temperature without air conditioning reduced the amount learned that
year by one percent, as measured by test performance.22

Barriers and Challenges
While larger school districts may have the capacity to perform vulnerability assessments
and develop climate action plans, smaller school districts may be more resource-
constrained. Where planning efforts do move forward, this can lead to a more limited
engagement process with environmental justice and other priority populations, which
can have disproportional negative impacts on these underserved communities.95 In the
absence of planning, school districts may only begin to consider implementing resilience
strategies after a hazard event damages assets or otherwise disrupts school operations,
as opposed to proactively developing plans and strategies to mitigate impacts from
hazards. Some projects described in this section have significant capital costs and may
not result in operating cost savings, hampering the ability to use some alternative
financing options such as Energy Management Services (EMS. This can make the
upfront investment challenging, even while school districts may recognize the potential
for avoided costs from a partial or total loss of assets or operational disruptions.
Assessing the exposure to certain hazards can also be challenging due to limitations in
available data. As an example, the Metropolitan Area Planning Council (MAPC)
released a report analyzing data on the 2010 flood event in the Greater Boston area
46

and found that the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Flood Maps did

47
II. Goal 1: Achieve Green Schools
Methods, Best Practices, and Standards for Achieving Green and Healthy Schools in the Commonwealth

III. Goal 2: Achieve Healthy Schools
Children, teachers, and other school staff spend approximately 1,000 hours inside
schools each year and possibly more for extracurricular activities. Children are exposed
to building conditions—both healthful and hazardous—for much of their lives and are
biologically more susceptible to certain environmental hazards than adults because of
their smaller size and developmental stage. Many students also have asthma, which
increases their susceptibility to respiratory irritants. During the 2022–2023 school year,

Section 27:
9.9 percent of all enrolled students in Massachusetts had confirmed instances of
asthma.97 Given children’s constant exposure to school buildings and their
susceptibility, achieving a healthy school free of hazardous substances and with clean
air and water is essential.
New buildings are not always free from environmental hazards. In recent years, newer
environmental health concerns have arisen in schools, such as exposure to airborne
infectious diseases and possible exposures from the use of artificial turf fields. Not only
should schools be free from hazards, but schools should also strive for proactively
healthy environments, which includes maintaining a comfortable learning environment
and properly designing spaces. Both existing and future buildings can be retrofitted or
designed to achieve a healthy and productive learning environment for all.

touching shared objects, or breathing air with infectious particles.98 While different
diseases are spread by different transmission pathways, this section focuses on
reducing transmission of diseases that can spread via airborne transmission. SARS-
CoV-2 (which causes COVID-19), influenza viruses, and respiratory syncytial virus are
some of the major pathogens that spread in schools through airborne transmission.
Reducing airborne transmission of disease can reduce illness among students and staff,
as well as illness-related absenteeism.98
Methods and Best Practices
The first category of recommendations are practices that schools can use in their daily
operations to reduce the airborne transmission of disease. The second category is
steps for when an individual is sick or when rates of disease are high in a school
community. Table 12 summarizes the methods and best practices for reducing airborne
transmission of disease/illness in schools. For each method and best practice, the table
presents the approximate capital and operating costs, implementation timeframe, and
ease of implementation. See Section VII, Objective 2a(1) for additional narrative
descriptions of each of the methods and best practices.

Barriers and Challenges
One major barrier to reducing airborne transmission of infectious diseases through
ventilation and air filtration is the costs associated with updating many school ventilation
systems and purchasing and maintaining portable air filters. While lower in cost, moving
large events outdoors can create a logistical challenge, depending on the space
available at a given school, and the feasibility of outdoor events may not be possible
due to weather, particularly in the winter when rates of respiratory infections are
generally highest. Another challenge may be implementing more rigorous infection
control measures during outbreaks or epidemics. For example, very young children
often have difficulty wearing masks properly, and modifying class size, establishing
cohorts, or changing schedules may be constrained by the size of school buildings.

2a(2) Prevent Exposure to Asbestos
Background
Asbestos is a group of naturally occurring minerals. Historically, asbestos was used
extensively in diverse products due to its strength, flexibility, and resistance to heat and
chemicals. Asbestos-containing material (ACM) can be found in most primary,
secondary, and charter schools, with building materials and insulation often being the
most common ACMs.99,100 Building materials are considered ACMs if they are made of
over 1 percent asbestos.100 When ACMs deteriorate over time or are disturbed, they
can release asbestos fibers, which can stay suspended in the air for hours or even
days, posing an exposure risk.99–101 Exposure to asbestos fibers can cause serious
health problems, including lung cancer, mesothelioma, and asbestosis.99,101 Generally,
materials containing asbestos do not pose a health risk if they are maintained intact and
undisturbed.101
Methods and Best Practices
Table 13 summarizes the methods and best practices for preventing asbestos exposure
in schools across three areas: preparation; continual monitoring and exposure
mitigation; and exposure mitigation during renovations or abatement. For each method
and best practice, the table presents the approximate capital and operating costs,
implementation timeframe, and ease of implementation. See Section VII, Objective
2a(2) for additional narrative descriptions of each of the methods and best practices.

Barriers and Challenges
Challenges to asbestos abatement can be both financial and logistical. Schools often
lack funding to inspect for, test, and remove ACM.102 Asbestos abatement can be
disruptive to normal school activities since asbestos must be removed by professionals
and must comply with safety measures required by state and federal regulations.102
53
III.Goal 2: Achieve Healthy Schools
Methods, Best Practices, and Standards for Achieving Green and Healthy Schools in the Commonwealth
of Massachusetts
Considerations for Renovations
Massachusetts has many older school buildings that periodically need renovations to
maintain functionality. Older buildings are also likely to have harmful substances
contained within legacy building materials, such as asbestos, PCBs, lead, and
mercury. In addition, mold may be revealed by renovation projects, and renovations
that change air flow or the building envelope may impact radon levels. Many of these
materials only become a health risk when they are disturbed, which includes
renovation projects. When disturbed, these substances can become airborne and
accumulate in dust. Without proper renovation controls, school occupants can
become exposed to these materials through inhalation and ingestion pathways.
There are several steps that schools can take to mitigate these risks:

Section 36:
1. Schools should create and maintain an inventory of materials that contain
asbestos, PCBs, lead, and mercury along with where they are found within
the school.

Section 37:
2. Do not disturb any of these materials unnecessarily. Many building
components which contain these chemicals only become dangerous to health
when they are exposed or moved. For example, building occupants will not
be exposed to asbestos within insulation until a wall is opened and the
insulation is disturbed.

Section 38:
3. Use the inventory of materials to routinely check to make sure that building
components containing these materials are in good condition. If they need
repair, it is more likely that these substances will be released into the
environment. If building components need repair, plan to do so with the
proper controls in place.

Section 39:
4. When renovating, consider the risks of disrupting any of these materials
before starting the project. Plan to implement mitigation strategies to protect
building occupants. Mitigation strategies are specific to the contaminant of
concern, but cordoning off the area under renovation, keeping renovation
areas clean, and planning renovation projects for times when the building has
fewer occupants (i.e., summer) are good practices.

Section 40:
5. Before a renovation project starts, create a communication plan for informing
staff, parents, students, and other involved community members. The plan
should provide details about the extent of the health risks posed by the
project, as well as an outline of the mitigation procedures that will be used to
protect those on the school campus. The communication plan should also
include contact information and can direct interested parties to further
resources explaining the risk posed by legacy building materials.

2a(3) Reduce Exposure to Carbon Monoxide
Background
Carbon monoxide is a colorless, odorless, tasteless gas that can be deadly at high
concentrations. Exposure to carbon monoxide can also produce symptoms such as
headache, nausea, dizziness, confusion, fainting, and unconsciousness, or can mimic
flu symptoms.103 Carbon monoxide is one of the leading causes of poisoning deaths in
the United States.103 It is produced through incomplete combustion of fuels such as gas,
oil, kerosene, or wood. Older or poorly maintained combustion-based appliances are
more likely to produce excess carbon monoxide. Proper ventilation can prevent the
accumulation of carbon monoxide in enclosed spaces.101,104 Carbon monoxide should
not be detectable in a typical indoor environment unless detected outdoors, in which
case indoor levels should be less than or equal to those measured outdoors.
Methods and Best Practices
Table 14 summarizes the methods and best practices for reducing carbon monoxide
exposure in schools in two areas: planning and management; and technical
interventions. For each method/best practice, the table presents the approximate capital
and operating costs, implementation timeframe, and ease of implementation. See

Ease of Implementation: 1= easier to implement; 3 = more difficult to implement
Barriers and Challenges
Because carbon monoxide is a colorless, odorless gas, it is difficult to detect without
alarms. Prevention of carbon monoxide exposure in school buildings relies on
monitoring carbon monoxide levels and proper ventilation. Potential barriers to
preventing carbon monoxide exposure include a lack of financial resources to install or
maintain a carbon monoxide monitoring and alarm system or a lack of financial
resources or expertise to maintain one properly. The biggest challenge to reducing
carbon monoxide exposure in schools is the location of schools, as proximity to major
roadways will increase the likelihood of elevated carbon monoxide.
2a(4) Reduce Exposure to Mold and Moisture
Background
All types of molds have the potential to cause health effects, although some are more
harmful than others. Health effects can include irritation of the eyes, skin, and
respiratory system.101 Many people are allergic to mold, and mold can exacerbate
asthma.101 Molds can be found almost everywhere, and they thrive in moist areas.101
56
III.Goal 2: Achieve Healthy Schools

The key to controlling mold exposure is to prevent excessive moisture, repair leaks,
address condensation promptly, and use the appropriate cleaning methods and
products.

Barriers and Challenges
Mold can present significant challenges in school buildings in Massachusetts.
Massachusetts has months with high humidity and temperatures, and precipitation year-
round. Climate change and an increase in extreme heat and humidity will inevitably
exacerbate mold problems for schools. Many of the schools in Massachusetts are older
buildings with systems that are inadequate for removing humidity and need repair to
prevent leaks and water intrusion. These repairs and system updates carry significant
costs, which is one of the greatest challenges in preventing mold in Massachusetts

schools. There is also significant misinformation about the need for or efficacy of mold
testing or sampling that can potentially result in spending unnecessary resources for
sampling that should have instead been directed towards mitigation.
2a(5) Reduce Exposure to Polychlorinated Biphenyls (PCBs)
Background
PCBs are a class of human-made organic chemicals that consist of over 200 unique
compounds (commonly referred to as congeners) that make up numerous mixtures.105
At certain levels, PCBs can be hazardous to human health.106 Numerous U.S. and
international health agencies have determined that PCBs are a probable human
carcinogen.105 Research in humans has found that PCBs are also associated with
immune system suppression, reproductive effects, neurological effects in children
exposed in utero, altered thyroid hormone levels, and cardiovascular effects.105
PCB exposure can be an issue in school buildings, as PCBs were widely used in
building materials found in construction and renovations circa 1950 to 1979.106,107 PCBs
have been widely detected in schools in the northeast region, leading to legislation in
Vermont, for example, requiring all schools in the state built or renovated prior to 1980
to have their air tested for PCBs by 2027.108 PCBs are most commonly found in
fluorescent light ballasts (FLBs), caulking, and mastic (plant-based resin); it was also
used in tiles or carpets, window glazing, and some adhesives and paints.106,109 Although
PCB production was banned in 1979, they are still in the building materials that were
installed before 1979 and represent potential sources of PCB exposure in schools.106,110
If caulking with PCBs is deteriorating, or light ballasts with PCBs are in disrepair, they
may release PCBs into the air, which could be directly inhaled or may settle onto dust.
Dust poses both an inhalation risk (when recirculated back into the air) and an ingestion
risk (when people touch dusty surfaces then touch their mouth or food). 106,109
Methods and Best Practices
Table 16 summarizes the methods and best practices for reducing exposure to PCBs in
schools across three areas: identifying and removing PCBs from schools;
considerations during renovations and repairs; and simple steps to reduce exposure to
PCBs found in air and dust. For each method and best practice, the table presents the
approximate capital and operating costs, implementation timeframe, and ease of
implementation. See Section VII, Objective 2a(5) for additional narrative descriptions of
each of the methods and best practices.

Barriers and Challenges
Even before remediation, one challenge to reducing PCB exposure is pinpointing the
exact sources of PCBs.111 Locating PCB sources can require lengthy and expensive
testing; alternatively, the building manager can assume all materials suspected to
contain PCBs do contain PCBs and treat them as such. However, a survey found that a
lack of awareness of what PCBs are was the most commonly cited impediment to PCB
testing in school buildings.111
60
III.Goal 2: Achieve Healthy Schools
Methods, Best Practices, and Standards for Achieving Green and Healthy Schools in the Commonwealth
of Massachusetts
Two major barriers to PCB remediation in schools are logistics and cost. PCB
remediation requires, at a minimum, cordoning off portions of a school building.111 At
most, it can require temporarily shutting down or completely razing a school building.111
Both the moving of students and staff within a building or to another location and paying
for remediation and renovations can become extremely expensive.111,112 As a result,
school districts with greater financial resources tend to take steps to mitigate PCB
exposure, while school districts with limited financial resources are often unable to
undertake the necessary renovations, exacerbating health inequities and perpetuating
structural racism. 112
2a(6) Reduce Exposure to Radon
Background
Radon is a naturally occurring radioactive element that is released when rocks and soil
break down. During that process, this colorless, odorless, tasteless gas can migrate
through the soil to the ground surface.113 Radon can enter buildings such as schools
through cracks, joints, and gaps in basement flooring and walls. Long-term inhalation of
radon can increase the risk of lung cancer, making radon the second leading cause of
lung cancer after smoking. Among smokers, lung cancer risk from radon exposure is
even greater, as exposure to tobacco and radon interact synergistically.113 Smoking and
radon exposure can increase risk of lung cancer up to 10-fold compared to radon
exposure alone.113 Radon is a relevant issue across all of Massachusetts.113 An
estimated 650,000 homes in Massachusetts have radon levels that exceed EPA’s
action guideline of 4 picocuries per liter (pCi/L).114
Methods and Best Practices
Table 17 summarizes methods and best practices for reducing radon exposure in
schools related to planning and management and technical interventions. For each
method/best practice, the table presents the approximate capital and operating costs,

Barriers and Challenges
The greatest barrier to addressing radon in schools is the cost of mitigation. The cost of
mitigation, or fear of a potentially high cost, can discourage school administrators from
testing for the presence of radon because if they were to detect it, they would face
pressure to install a mitigation system. Because testing is not required, radon testing
may be more likely to be deprioritized. Another barrier is the associated cost of radon
testing equipment and its routine maintenance, as well as maintaining and operating the
HVAC system to reduce radon exposure, which may also pose a challenge for some
school districts.

Mitigating Occurrences of Vapor Intrusion
Vapor intrusion occurs when vapor-forming chemicals from a subsurface source
migrate into a building. Basements are more prone to higher levels of chemicals
from vapor intrusion given that they are underground and have more entry points.
Some substances that enter a building through vapor intrusion have harmful health
effects, including volatile organic compounds (VOCs) such as trichloroethylene and
benzine, semi-volatile organic compounds (SVOCs) such as naphthalene, some
PCBs and pesticides, and elemental mercury. However, not all buildings are likely
to be affected by vapor intrusion of harmful substances.
Existing schools located near (<100 yards) past or present industrial or commercial
facilities may consider testing indoor air for VOCs using EPA Method TO-15. Since
the vapor intrusion pathway relies on chemicals coming up from the subsurface,
floor drains, particularly in bathrooms, are common subsurface vapor entry points.
In the siting and construction phase of building a new school in an urban area or
any area with historical use of VOCs, school districts should conduct a thorough
subsurface and groundwater investigation to identify potentially harmful chemicals
that may enter through vapor intrusion. This information is used to determine the
appropriate design elements to include as part of a vapor barrier and potential sub-
slab soil vapor collection system. If school districts are utilizing state funding for new
construction projects (e.g., via a grant from the MSBA), the project will be subject to
the Massachusetts Environmental Protection Act, which requires that state agencies
use all practicable means and measures to minimize a proposed project’s potential
damage to the environment.

2a(7) Reduce Exposure to Outdoor Air Pollutants
Background
Students and staff are exposed to outdoor air pollution at schools during outdoor
activities such as recess and during pickup and drop-off times. It can also impact the
quality of indoor air at the school as HVAC systems draw in outdoor air to ventilate
indoor spaces. The quality of outdoor air near schools is greatly impacted by proximity
to roadways and industrial areas. While air quality impacts everyone, children with
developing respiratory systems are particularly susceptible to the impacts of poor air
quality. 101
A major source of outdoor air pollution is emissions from motor vehicles; vehicle
emissions having harmful health effects include fine particulate matter (PM ), carbon

Section 42:
2.5
monoxide, nitrogen oxides, and benzene, among other substances.117,118 Idling school
buses can be a major source of vehicle emissions near schools, particularly when
buses have older engines. In addition to upgrading vehicle fleets, exposure to exhaust
63
III.Goal 2: Achieve Healthy Schools
Methods, Best Practices, and Standards for Achieving Green and Healthy Schools in the Commonwealth
of Massachusetts
can be reduced by parking idling vehicles where exhaust is less likely to enter the
school and by reducing idling time for all vehicles in close proximity to the school.
Vehicle emissions will also be higher if a school is located in a busy urban area or sited
near a major roadway or highway.
Another source of outdoor air pollution that is of increasing concern in Massachusetts is
wildfire smoke.119 This type of smoke consists of a mix of gasses and PM that is

Section 43:
2.5
unhealthy to breathe and can be dangerous for vulnerable populations, including
children.119 In Massachusetts, wildfire smoke events are sporadic and intermittent.
These events are, however, expected to increase in frequency as a result of climate
change.22 There are several measures that schools should take to prepare for providing
a safe and healthy learning environment for students during these events.
Methods and Best Practices
Table 18 summarizes the methods and best practices for reducing exposure to outdoor
air pollution in schools across two areas: policy and education; and infrastructure. For
each method and best practice, the table presents the approximate capital and
operating costs, implementation timeframe, and ease of implementation. See Section

Barriers and Challenges
Schools must be aware of the many sources of outdoor air pollution that could impact
the health of those learning and working at the school. Certain interventions are easier
than others; for example, the cost of electrifying or upgrading school bus fleets can be a
significant challenge for many school districts. While electric school buses have lower
maintenance costs, the price of new electric buses is significantly higher than new
diesel buses. Reconfiguring pickup and drop-off zones at existing schools can also pose
design challenges.
In addition, wildfire smoke events have historically been relatively uncommon in
Massachusetts, and schools may not have experience preparing for and reacting to
them. Creating a wildfire smoke plan may be new to school administration, as may
routinely checking outdoor air quality

Objective 2b. Improve Water Quality
2b(1) Reduce Exposure to Lead in Drinking Water
Background
Since clean drinking water is essential for the health and well-being of all people, water
with levels of heavy metals such as lead and copper can be particularly damaging. Lead
and other metals can leach into drinking water from pipes, solder, and even the interior
components of drinking fountains.99,101 Further, improper treatment of public water
systems and poor maintenance of or malfunctioning plumbing systems can also lead to
detectable lead levels in drinking water.120 There is no safe level of lead in drinking
water. Lead can have long lasting impacts to health, including damage to the brain,
nervous system, kidneys, and more.99 Exposure to lead in drinking water can cause
serious health effects in all age groups, but children are most vulnerable to health
effects from lead exposure since their growing bodies can absorb more lead than the
average adult.101 Lead can be especially harmful to children’s cognitive function due to
its neurotoxic effects; reduced attention span, verbal skills, and overall IQ can be
attributed to lead exposure.120 Thus, it is essential to provide children with access to
water without detectable levels of lead, especially in schools, by conducting testing,
issuing awareness statements, and implementing remediation efforts.
Many schools are supplied by public water systems; others have their own water supply
and are themselves classified as public water systems under the Safe Drinking Water
Act (SDWA). 121,122 In both cases, they are regulated by MassDEP for lead under the
Lead and Copper Rule and are required to do varying amounts of limited testing.
However, there is no federal or state requirement to test every outlet in schools nor is
there a federal or state regulatory standard for lead in school drinking water. MassDEP
regulations require that community public water systems test two outlets at two schools
or EECFs every six months, annually, or every three years depending on the required
monitoring schedule of the public water system. In addition, MassDEP has established
a guideline level of lead in school and EECF drinking water of 1 part per billion (ppb),
which is the laboratory detection limit. When levels above 1 ppb are detected,
MassDEP recommends taking remediation actions and provides guidance and
resources on methods to reducing levels.
MassDEP’s Water-Smart Program (formerly called the Lead in Schools Assistance
Program) offers a free comprehensive approach to testing for lead in schools (and
EECFs) and provides resources to take action when lead is detected above 1 ppb. The
Program is funded by EPA’s Water Infrastructure Improvements for the Nation grants.
The Water-Smart Program is a component of the Lead Contamination Control Act
(LCCA) Program, which offers additional ongoing support to schools concerning
addressing lead in drinking water.

Barriers and Challenges
The most significant barriers to improving water quality by reducing lead levels are the
mostly voluntary nature of testing and the cost associated with remediation actions.
Schools should prepare to develop communication, sampling, and testing plans over
time and to work with community organizations and state agencies to identify the
necessary resources to act.

Barriers and Challenges
There are many challenges related to reducing exposure to PFAS, as these are
widespread chemicals. All public water suppliers in Massachusetts are required to test
for PFAS, whether the supplier is a community system or a school with its own well. If
schools are part of a larger community public water system, it is the responsibility of the
public water system to test for PFAS. Thus, schools must build local partnerships to
assess potential contamination, address exceedances of drinking water standards, and
reduce sources of PFAS where feasible.
Objective 2c. Maintain Thermal Comfort
Background
Massachusetts school buildings experience a wide range of temperatures making
maintaining thermal comfort for students and staff both challenging and necessary. All
school buildings in Massachusetts have heating, though the system may not always
operate consistently throughout classrooms. However, many schools do not have air
69
III.Goal 2: Achieve Healthy Schools
Methods, Best Practices, and Standards for Achieving Green and Healthy Schools in the Commonwealth

conditioning, which is becoming a concern for student and staff health, given the
increase in hot and humid days during the school year resulting from climate
change.128,129 Schools may also lack other strategies to keep classrooms cool, such as
windows that can open and window shades.130 Extreme heat in schools with no cooling
can harm human health and academic attainment. Specifically, effects include reduced
cognitive function, learning, and academic performance; exacerbation of asthma,
bronchitis, and other respiratory conditions; increased incidence of heat stroke and heat
exhaustion; and loss of school time due to school closures or early dismissals.104,129–131
One analysis estimates that, since 1970, the number of days above 80°F, the threshold
identified as requiring air conditioning, has increased by nine to 13 days per school
year, depending on the Massachusetts school district.128

Barriers and Challenges
The major challenges to maintaining thermal comfort in schools are the age of school
buildings and HVAC systems in Massachusetts and the cost of installing or updating air
conditioning systems. Massachusetts public school buildings, some over 100 years old,
were built when there were fewer extreme heat days during the school year.128,132
Objective 2d. Use Integrated Pest Management
Background
Pest management in schools is important because certain pests can trigger allergies
(e.g., cockroach dust) and may contaminate food and transmit disease. Integrated pest
management (IPM) is a sustainable approach to managing pests that combines
biological, cultural, physical, and chemical tools to minimize economic, health, and
environmental risks. IPM strategies focus on long-term prevention and suppression of
71
III.Goal 2: Achieve Healthy Schools
Methods, Best Practices, and Standards for Achieving Green and Healthy Schools in the Commonwealth
of Massachusetts
pests, ultimately reducing the use of potentially hazardous chemical pesticides. IPM
approaches prioritize reducing or mitigating conditions that make facilities vulnerable to
pests through pest-preventive building design and repairs, building occupant education,
and proactive pest population monitoring. The Massachusetts Pesticide Control Act
(M.G.L., c.132B) restricts the use of most pesticides in schools.
Methods and Best Practices
Table 22 summarizes methods and best practices for implementing IPM in schools. For
each method/best practice, the table presents the approximate capital and operating
costs, implementation timeframe, and ease of implementation. See Section VII,

Barriers and Challenges
Perceived pest threats often do not align with the real threats that pests pose. For
instance, many families are worried about lice transfer at school, whereas mosquito
bites are far more prevalent and pose more significant risks. Building occupants may
have varying levels of tolerance for pest presence. Education and communication are
critical to establishing shared expectations and clarifying the important role that students
and staff play in maintaining pest-free facilities.

Objective 2e. Procure and Use Green Cleaning Supplies and
Chemicals
Background
Thousands of chemicals are used as part of daily practices in schools, including those
used in laboratory settings or as art supplies, cleaning agents, and tools for building
O&M.99 Students and staff can be exposed to unnecessary risks when hazardous or
mismanaged chemicals are present in schools.101 Further, exposure to certain
chemicals can lead to serious health effects, including cancer, reproductive disorders,
organ damage, and irritation to the eyes, nose, and throat.99,101 Thus, it is essential that
schools have a robust chemical management system to prevent the improper use,
storage, and disposal of chemicals. Additionally, schools should procure green
chemicals to reduce the amount of hazardous and toxic chemicals stored onsite.
Methods and Best Practices
Table 23 summarizes the methods and best practices for procuring and using green
cleaning supplies/chemicals in schools across two areas: implementing a chemical
management system; and utilizing green chemicals to protect the health and safety of
staff and students using chemicals in schools. For each method and best practice, the

Ease of Implementation: 1= easier to implement; 3 = more difficult to implement
Barriers and Challenges
Schools may face challenges when trying to implement a chemical management system
or procure green chemicals. Some notable challenges in regard to school chemical
management systems may be the lack of environmental, health, and safety staff onsite
or protective systems such as personal protective equipment (PPE), medical
monitoring, control mechanisms for hazardous chemical releases, etc.133 Additionally,
challenges regarding the procurement of green chemicals may include lack of
knowledge on which chemicals are considered hazardous and which are considered
safer alternatives, as well as limited financial resources to purchase such
alternatives.133,134 Thus, it is essential that schools build a team of partners and a long-
term plan that can assist in working towards these goals.

Objective 2f. Reduce Exposure to Hazardous Substances
2f(1) Reduce Exposure to Lead in Paint and Soil
Background
Lead is a naturally occurring metal once used in various products, including paints and
primers.100 Lead is considered highly toxic and is associated with adverse effects for
both children and adults.101 Outside of lead in drinking water, people can be exposed by
inhaling dust or ingesting particles via hand-to-mouth contact, where lead-based paint is
one of the most common sources of contamination.100 There is no safe level of lead
exposure, with associated health effects including anemia, decreased kidney function,
high blood pressure, reproductive harm, and damage to the brain and nervous
system.99,100 Children under the age of six are the most vulnerable to long-lasting
damage from lead exposure due to its neurotoxic capabilities, where health effects such
as behavioral and learning problems, low IQ, hyperactivity, slowed growth, hearing
issues, and more have been identified.99–101
Methods and Best Practices
Table 24 summarizes the methods and best practices for reducing exposure to lead in
paint and soil at schools. For each method and best practice, the table presents the
approximate capital and operating costs, implementation timeframe, and ease of

75
III.Goal 2: Achieve Healthy Schools
Methods, Best Practices, and Standards for Achieving Green and Healthy Schools in the Commonwealth

Barriers and Challenges
A major barrier to minimizing exposure to lead from paint is the need for renovations.
Renovating buildings with lead-based paint can be challenging since it is not only a
costly venture but may also require that the building remain unoccupied throughout the
renovation process. As a result, schools must be prepared to handle these issues if
lead-based paint is identified.
2f(2) Reduce Exposure to Mercury
Background
Mercury is a naturally occurring element traditionally used in many products due to its
advantageous properties, such as high density, liquid state at room temperature, ability
to conduct electricity, and more.135 While mercury can be a helpful substance, exposure
to high levels by breathing in vapors, touching mercury in its liquid state, or eating
contaminated food sources is associated with damage to the brain, heart, kidney, lungs,
and immune system.99,136 Further, it is considered a neurotoxic substance that can be
particularly harmful to children.101
Methods and Best Practices

III.Goal 2: Achieve Healthy Schools
Methods, Best Practices, and Standards for Achieving Green and Healthy Schools in the Commonwealth
of Massachusetts
Barriers and Challenges
The greatest barrier to reducing exposure to mercury in schools is replacing mercury-
containing products; however, replacing products is more cost-effective than paying to
clean up a mercury incident. One challenge is that, despite the best efforts of school
leaders, students may bring an item containing mercury to school. As a result, schools
must be prepared to address mercury incidents, even if they do not use or maintain an
inventory of mercury-containing products on-site.
Objective 2g. Safely Procure, Use, and Dispose of Crumb Rubber
Background
Artificial turf fields (ATFs) for school sports are popular alternatives to natural grass.137
ATFs are often cheaper—or perceived as cheaper—to maintain, and can be used
during and immediately after rain, which enables more playing time.138,139 ATFs
commonly comprise three core components: padding and backing materials at the
bottom, infill in the middle, and artificial grass blades at the top. The grass blades are
made of plastic, and the infill layer is typically composed of a mixture of sand and what
is referred to as “crumb rubber,” often made from recycled car and truck tires.137
Alternatives to recycled tires for crumb rubber include ethylene propylene diene
terpolymer, thermoplastic elastomer, and waste athletic shoe materials, among many
other materials.138 Mineral-based and plant-derived materials such as sand, cork,
coconut hulls, and walnut shells can also be used and may provide lower chemical
alternatives to crumb rubber.138
While DPH has found that scientific research generally concludes that adverse health
effects from ATFs are unlikely, there are no existing studies that have specifically
examined the relationship between exposure to crumb rubber and disease outcomes. 137
Communities have raised concerns about potential exposure to chemicals that may be
found in the crumb rubber infill layer, which include PFAS, VOCs, SVOCs, and metals
such as lead.137,140 Exposure to chemicals in ATFs could occur through inhalation of
VOCs or particles released by the ATF during use, swallowing crumb rubber while
playing on fields, and skin contact with crumb rubber and plastic blades.137 138 137,138
In response to concerns about ATFs, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC)/Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, EPA, and the
Consumer Product Safety Commission conducted a multi-year research effort to
understand the constituent chemicals in tire crumb rubber and how people may be
exposed while playing on ATFs. 141 Only small amounts of chemicals were found to be
released into the air from tire crumb. For many chemicals measured, concentrations
measured near ATFs were no different than background levels; for some chemicals,
however, measured concentrations were higher near the ATF. Less than 1 to 3 percent
of metals were released from tire crumb rubber into simulated biological fluids.
Concentrations of metals in the blood of people who played on ATFs were similar to
those of the general population. There was no difference in polycyclic aromatic
77
III.Goal 2: Achieve Healthy Schools
Methods, Best Practices, and Standards for Achieving Green and Healthy Schools in the Commonwealth
of Massachusetts
hydrocarbon metabolites found between people playing on ATFs and those playing on
grass.141
Beyond possible exposure to hazardous chemicals, there are additional health-related
concerns about using ATFs as an alternative to natural grass fields, including more
frequent skin abrasions, higher risk of heat-related illness during exercise, higher
incidence of joint injuries, and potentially more significant risk of head injuries.137,139
Various studies have found ATFs to be anywhere from 35°F to 86°F hotter than natural
grass, which can contribute to heat-related illness and burns.138 Heat can also lead to
increased emissions of VOCs and SVOCs from the plastic and rubber materials that
make up ATFs.138
ATFs have a limited lifespan, and they can become unsafe to play on beyond that
timeframe.139 Disposal and replacement of fields represent additional costs that schools
often overlook when deciding whether or not to install an ATF. While some cities in
Massachusetts have developed rules related to the use of ATFs, there are currently no
state regulations related to ATFs. 140 When considering the installation of ATFs or when
playing on an ATF, school leaders can take numerous steps to weigh their options and
reduce children’s exposure to chemicals or particles from ATFs while playing sports.
Methods and Best Practices

Barriers and Challenges
One particular challenge regarding the use of ATF is the lack of definitive research on
the safety or health effects of playing on ATFs. While research suggests that chemical
exposure while playing on an ATF is not much greater than background exposure, not
all chemicals in ATFs are always known and characterized, and numerous routes of
exposure exist. Both ATF and natural grass fields cost money to maintain; disposal
costs and methods for ATF at the end of their useful life span will need to be accounted
for in school district budgets.

Objective 2h. Create a Safe Environment for Students with Life-
Threatening Food Allergies
Background
Food allergies affect about 8 percent of children in the United States.142 People can be
allergic to any food, but the nine most common food allergens in the United States are
milk, eggs, fish, shellfish, wheat, soy, peanuts, tree nuts, and sesame.142 Food allergies
can be life-threatening, and some people with severe reactions may not have
experienced them in the past. Avoidance is the best way to keep children safe.
Individuals with life-threatening food allergies may be prescribed epinephrine auto-
injecting pens in the event of exposure to allergens. During the 2021–2022 school year
in Massachusetts, 259 students and 27 other individuals were treated for anaphylaxis at
school, and 39.5 percent of these anaphylactic shock events were among individuals
with no history of anaphylaxis.143 Most of these reactions (65.7 percent) were caused by
food, and in 159 of the 188 food allergen anaphylactic events, the reaction was caused
by ingesting a food allergen.143
Schools can help students avoid food allergens by creating allergy- or food-free spaces
outside of designated eating areas, keeping and understanding ingredients in each of
the food items being served (especially if the items are prepared and do not have visible
labels), ensuring proper food preparation practices, and avoiding cross-contact in food
preparation and service areas, including in kitchens and eating areas. Schools must
also be able to respond to anaphylactic shock events in the case of cross-contact or in
the case of previously unknown allergies.
In Massachusetts, public and private schools, educational institutions, summer camps,
childcare facilities, and other childcare programs approved to participate in U.S.
Department of Agriculture (USDA) Child Nutrition Programs are exempt from DPH
regulations 105 CMR 590.000 regarding food allergens, provided that they have written
policies and procedures for identifying, documenting, and accommodating students with
food allergies. Documentation is also required to verify participation in food allergen
training recognized by DESE and DPH. These institutions must also train their
employees in food allergy awareness as it relates to their assigned duties.
Methods and Best Practices
Table 27 summarizes the methods and best practices for creating a safe environment
for students with life-threatening food allergies in schools related to developing written
protocols, ensuring preparedness, and implementing prevention measures. For each

Barriers and Challenges
By the time children are in elementary or secondary school, many life-threatening
allergens are already known. A significant percentage of school epinephrine
administrations, however, involve individuals who did not have a previously recognized
allergy. For example, between 2004 and 2010, 23 percent of epinephrine
administrations in Massachusetts schools were to individuals without a previously
recognized allergy.144 This means that regardless of prevention efforts, schools will
always need to be prepared to respond to serious allergic reactions. Additionally, while
food is not typically an asthma trigger, children with both food allergies and asthma are
at greater risk of a serious reaction.
Maintaining allergy-free zones can be difficult when physical space is limited, such as in
cafeterias and kitchens. This is especially true for existing older buildings, though it can
and should be done regardless of the space limitations.

Methods, Best Practices, and Standards for Achieving Green and Healthy Schools in the Commonwealth
of Massachusetts
Objective 2i. Create a Productive Learning Environment for All
Students
2i(1) Optimize Lighting
Background
Students are engaged in various visual tasks throughout the day, from reading printed
materials up close to blackboards at a distance.145 Studies show that children are
sensitive to light exposure and that low levels of light indoors can be associated with an
increased risk of nearsightedness.120 Further, bright lighting is associated with greater
alertness and can enhance a student’s performance at school.120 Thus, school
classrooms with high-quality lighting promote effective learning and teaching.
Methods and Best Practices
Table 28 summarizes the methods and best practices for optimizing lighting in schools.
For each method and best practice, the table presents the approximate capital and

Barriers and Challenges
Barriers associated with lighting as a means of creating a productive learning
environment may include the cost of artificial lighting with appropriate illuminance and
color temperature and building-specific constraints that may limit available natural light.
Schools should strive to balance artificial and natural lighting based on their current
lighting system and available resources.

2i(2) Optimize Acoustic Performance
Background
Ensuring that classrooms have appropriate noise levels and listening conditions is
essential for students to clearly understand the instruction delivered by teachers.146
Children younger than 15 years old are more sensitive to disruptive listening conditions,
where excessive noise can cause cognitive distress and reduced performance in
school.145,146 Thus, schools should focus on improving the acoustic environment in the
classroom to enhance the learning experience for all students.
Methods and Best Practices
Table 29 summarizes the methods and best practices for optimizing acoustic
performance in schools. For each method and best practice, the table presents the
approximate capital and operating costs, implementation timeframe, and ease of

Ease of Implementation: 1= easier to implement; 3 = more difficult to implement
Barriers and Challenges
The main barrier to creating a productive learning environment by enhancing acoustic
performance is ensuring that building materials have good sound-absorbing capabilities.
While new construction and modernization projects can seamlessly incorporate these
materials into the design and construction, this can require more work to implement as a
retrofit measure in an existing building. Further, background noise from sources outside
of the school (e.g., vehicular traffic from nearby roadways) can also impact student
learning yet are challenging to control. Thus, schools should focus on minimizing noise
from sources they can control, such as HVAC systems, and invest in materials that
effectively reduce sound reverberation times.
83
III.Goal 2: Achieve Healthy Schools
Methods, Best Practices, and Standards for Achieving Green and Healthy Schools in the Commonwealth
of Massachusetts
Objective 2j. Design the Built Environment to Foster a Peaceful
School Community
Background
In Massachusetts, students and staff spend long days in school buildings. The design of
these buildings can play an important role in creating conditions that foster a peaceful
school community. High-traffic areas that force crowding and jostling can lead to stress
and increased violence, whereas specific and intentional design elements can support
positive mindsets and interactions.
Methods and Best Practices
Table 30 summarizes the methods and best practices for designing the built
environment to foster a peaceful school community across three categories: reducing
stressors resulting from the built environment; designing spaces in school buildings to
promote overall well-being; and designing spaces that facilitate positive social
interactions at school. For each method and best practice, the table presents the
approximate capital and operating costs, implementation timeframe, and ease of
implementation. See Section VII, Objective 2j for additional narrative descriptions of

Ease of Implementation: 1= easier to implement; 3 = more difficult to implement
Barriers and Challenges
The greatest challenge to designing schools that foster a peaceful school community
lies in the existing infrastructure of Massachusetts school buildings. School building
layouts tend to be static. Changing built environment features such as room and hallway
layouts to reduce crowding and facilitate easy movement of students and staff may only
be possible with costly renovations. Additionally, many schools face crowding
challenges and might not have the physical space to provide students with options for
calming and activation without extensive renovations. Environmental stressors can also
be a challenge for older school buildings to address. See Objective 2a. Improve Air
Quality, Objective 2c. Maintain Thermal Comfort, and Objective 2i. Create a Productive
Learning Environment for All Students for additional relevant barriers and challenges.
85
III.Goal 2: Achieve Healthy Schools
Methods, Best Practices, and Standards for Achieving Green and Healthy Schools in the Commonwealth
of Massachusetts
IV. Goal 3: Achieve Equitable Outcomes for All Students
Achieving equitable outcomes for all students is essential to accomplishing the goal of
having green and healthy schools throughout the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. For
too long, inequitable distribution of funding and resources has led to inequitable
outcomes for marginalized students, including those with special education needs.
These inequities are the result of intentional choices that have been made by
policymakers and school districts since public schools first entered the
Commonwealth.147–149 To mitigate the inequities previously inherent in school systems,
policymakers and school districts must be intentional about centering equity when
dispersing funding and resources for capital improvement projects.
Segregation of Black and Latino students is a growing issue throughout
Massachusetts.148 This is evident in the number of schools experiencing racial isolation
and in the over-placement of Black and Latino students in more restrictive learning
environments.148,149 As school districts move toward a more green and healthy school
model, it is their responsibility to provide students with equitable access to inclusive and
healthy learning environments—regardless of race, gender, disability, or any other
identity. Just as every student has the right to receive an education in the least
restrictive learning environment, every student has a right to attend accessible, inclusive
schools free of environmental and health hazards.
86
IV. Goal 3: Achieve Equitable Outcomes for All Students
Methods, Best Practices, and Standards for Achieving Green and Healthy Schools in the Commonwealth
of Massachusetts
This section presents a tabular summary of the methods and best practices that can
help school districts across the Commonwealth achieve equitable outcomes for all
students and a brief discussion of notable barriers and challenges that schools are likely
to face. Content is provided across the following three objectives:
a. Optimize space to equitably meet special education needs
b. Prioritize universal accessibility
c. Use available data to identify and equitably prioritize schools of greatest need
and advocate for additional funding opportunities

Section 45:
Section VIII provides a more detailed narrative description of the methods and best
practices, details related to the relevant statutory/regulatory framework and notable
standards, and relevant resources across each of the three objectives.
Objective 3a. Optimize Space to Equitably Meet Special Education
Needs
Background
Federal and state regulations guarantee all students in the Commonwealth of
Massachusetts access to a free and appropriate public education (FAPE) in the least
restrictive environment (LRE), regardless of disability.150–152 This guarantee is especially
important for historically excluded students from underserved and marginalized
communities. Integrating students with disabilities into school communities is essential
for their behavioral, social, and academic well-being. Optimizing learning spaces to
meet the needs of all learners equitably must be a top priority for schools and school
districts to guarantee students’ access to FAPE in the least restrictive learning
environment possible.
A review of special education in Massachusetts examined the identification, placement,
and performance of students with disabilities throughout Massachusetts’ school
districts.149 The study developed four key findings:
• Low-income and non-low-income students with disabilities experience substantial
differences in identification, placement, and performance.
• Students with disabilities placed in full inclusion settings outperformed peers with
similar disabilities who spent less time in the general education setting.
• Secondary schools offer limited inclusive options for students with disabilities.
• Special education identification, placement, and performance varied significantly
from district to district.
In addition to the four key findings, the study also found that Black and Latino students
were disproportionately excluded from the general education setting.149 This was
especially evident in secondary schools where Black students were twice as likely as
their White peers to be placed in a substantially separate setting, even though Black
87
IV. Goal 3: Achieve Equitable Outcomes for All Students
Methods, Best Practices, and Standards for Achieving Green and Healthy Schools in the Commonwealth
of Massachusetts
and White students have similar rates of inclusion at the elementary level.149 These
disparities are a result of historical and systemic practices limiting access to special
education services in underserved and marginalized communities. Student placement
should always be based on individual needs rather than available space. 153 To
accomplish this, schools and school districts must evaluate the availability of and
access to special education services and inclusion classrooms.
There is no one-size-fits-all solution to educating students with disabilities. However, in
Massachusetts, students with disabilities placed in inclusion settings are five times more
likely to graduate in five years or less than peers of similar ability excluded from the
general education setting.149 Adequately placing students in the least restrictive
environment, most appropriate to serve their individual needs, is paramount to their
success. Schools and school districts across Massachusetts must deploy a wide variety
of strategies to mitigate the disparities found in special education services. Optimizing
learning spaces to meet the needs of all students equitably requires existing schools to
rethink and revise their current classroom compositions. In contrast, schools undergoing
new construction and/or renovations can integrate universal design (UD) and other
design principles to plan for a more inclusive environment from the start. Sufficiently
designing spaces to meet the programmatic needs of all students receiving special
education takes thoughtful consideration and intentional planning.
Methods and Best Practices
Table 31 summarizes methods and best practices for optimizing space to meet special
education needs equitably in schools. For each method/best practice, the table presents
the approximate capital and operating costs, implementation timeframe, and ease of
implementation. See Section VIII, Objective 3a for additional narrative descriptions of
each of the methods and best practices.

Barriers and Challenges
Optimizing space to meet special education needs more equitably is essential; however,
optimizing space alone will not fix the special education disparities in Massachusetts
schools. Proper identification of students and adequate staffing are also essential
elements in equitably meeting special education needs. This document addresses how
schools and school districts can optimize space while assuming appropriate
identification and staffing.
Not every school and school district are able to meet the individual needs of every
student. Out-of-district placements and Education Collaboratives can help ease the
challenges that come with serving students with the greatest educational needs. School
districts in urban and suburban areas have a greater concentration of resources,
allowing them to place most students in an appropriate setting within a reasonable
distance from their home. Rural districts are more likely to face challenges placing
students in the proper settings because resources are more dispersed than in urban
and suburban areas. For this reason and many others highlighted earlier in the report,
rural districts face more challenges when trying to meet the needs of every student.
Transportation can be an issue for students in urban and rural areas. Though students
with transportation listed on their Individualized Education Plan (IEP) are entitled to
transportation to out-of-district placements, this transportation can be unreliable.
Students without transportation on their IEP and placed out of district will face even
greater challenges since transportation falls on the parents. Parents that work long
hours, have other children, lack transportation, or in many other circumstances may
struggle or be unable to transport their child to a school out of their district, further
89
IV. Goal 3: Achieve Equitable Outcomes for All Students
Methods, Best Practices, and Standards for Achieving Green and Healthy Schools in the Commonwealth
of Massachusetts
exacerbating inequities. Teachers, parents, and everyone on a student’s IEP team
should consider potential transportation barriers before placing a student.
Objective 3b. Prioritize Universal Accessibility
Background
Massachusetts is home to some of the oldest schools in the country, with many school
buildings more than 70 years old.154 Historically, schools were not designed to
guarantee access for disabled students and were not welcoming to students of all
genders or races. Black and Latino students are more likely to attend older, out-of-date
schools. Schools are mandated to protect students from discrimination based on
disability, gender identity, sexual orientation, and race by state and federal laws and
regulations.155,156 To accomplish this, school facilities need to adopt more inclusive and
accessible policies. Disabilities are only disabling if they limit people from achieving
what they want and need to do. Increasing the accessibility of school facilities and
learning environments creates more opportunities for students to thrive in their school
communities.
Methods and Best Practices
Table 32 summarizes methods and best practices for universal accessibility in schools.
For each method/best practice, the table presents the approximate capital and
operating costs, implementation timeframe, and ease of implementation. See Section
VIII, Objective 3b for additional narrative descriptions of each of the methods and best
practices.

Barriers and Challenges
Schools and school districts must constantly decide how to best utilize limited funds and
resources. This often means that funding is directed to the most pressing needs that
impact the most students. For older buildings, this means that structural and safety fixes
take priority. Prioritizing universal accessibility is important and, in some cases, required
by law; however, deciding which aspects of improving accessibility to address first can
be difficult. Each school faces different challenges and serves students with a wide
range of needs. In many cases, schools and school districts will have to use discretion
when deciding which elements of accessibility to prioritize.
91
IV. Goal 3: Achieve Equitable Outcomes for All Students
Methods, Best Practices, and Standards for Achieving Green and Healthy Schools in the Commonwealth
of Massachusetts
Another challenge in prioritizing universal accessibility is the impact of segregation and
the inequitable distribution of resources throughout schools in the Commonwealth.
White, affluent communities have more resources, receive more funding, and often
contain more updated, accessible schools.154 This results in inequalities that must be
addressed beyond the three categories of methods and best practices outlined in Table

Section 46:
32. School districts that serve low-income, Black and Latino, and rural students face
greater challenges.23,148 Systemic changes to funding and school placement must be a
part of the conversation around prioritizing universal accessibility.
Existing schools may face challenges when providing gender-neutral bathrooms to
students. If the nurse’s office or a staff bathroom is the best option for a student, the
student may have to spend more time out of class to access the bathroom. This can
also result in students feeling “othered” or isolated, especially if they are facing the issue
alone. Schools should enable students to access gender-neutral bathrooms with ease
to minimize time out of class and create an inclusive environment. This will be less of a
barrier for new schools and schools undergoing renovations, as they will typically have
greater flexibility to determine the placement of gender-neutral bathrooms.
Objective 3c. Use Available Data to Identify and Equitably Prioritize
Schools of Greatest Need and Advocate for Additional Funding
Priorities
Many of the best practices outlined in this report require little or no funding; therefore,
school districts can readily adopt many of these strategies across all schools in their
respective district. There are also many best practices that can be very costly to
implement; for these best practices, school districts will need to determine which
school(s) in their respective district have the greatest need. There is no “one-size-fits-
all” approach for a school district to identify those schools having the greatest need and
to develop a corresponding prioritized plan for project funding and implementation
across its portfolio of schools. As noted in prior sections, the many school districts within
the Commonwealth of Massachusetts vary across many characteristics, including
geographic location, facility portfolio (number, size, and type of buildings), student
enrollment, racial and demographic composition of the student body, student
performance, annual capital and operating budgets, and amount of annual state aid
received. A small rural school district with one elementary school will likely take a very
different approach to selecting and prioritizing projects as compared to a large urban
school district with dozens of elementary, middle, and high schools in its portfolio.
The objective of this section is to call attention to a collection of readily available data
sources that school districts can consider when thinking about how to identify the
schools having the greatest needs. School districts can then prioritize projects in an
equitable manner to advocate for and work towards green and healthy schools across
their district. Districts can also use this data to demonstrate need and potential health
co-benefits as part of grant applications.
This section presents data sets across the following two categories:
92
IV. Goal 3: Achieve Equitable Outcomes for All Students
Methods, Best Practices, and Standards for Achieving Green and Healthy Schools in the Commonwealth
of Massachusetts
• Tier 1 represents the primary data that school districts should evaluate to identify
schools of greatest need.
• Tier 2 represents additional data for school districts that have additional
time/resources available
and are interested in
examining data at a
deeper level.
Within each Tier 1/Tier 2
category, this section presents
data sets pertaining to the
following four categories:
• Physical infrastructure
• Environmental health
• Learning environment and
outcomes
• Additional demographics
Tier 1 Data Sets
Physical Infrastructure
Perhaps the most obvious factor to consider when identifying schools having the
greatest need is the existing condition of a school’s physical infrastructure. School
districts should consider evaluating the following three data sources from the MSBA to
evaluate the physical infrastructure of the schools in their portfolio:
• MSBA School Survey Report
• MSBA School-Level Summary Reports
• MSBA District-Level Summary Reports
MSBA School Survey Report
As noted in the Introduction, the MSBA has thus far performed School Surveys in 2005,
2010, and 2016, and expects to complete its next survey and publish the accompanying
report by the end of 2025. The information outlined in this section is based on the
MSBA’s most recently completed and published 2016 School Survey Report (see the
“School Summaries” section on page 44). Table 33 outlines notable details and
recommendations for school districts to evaluate the schools in their district having the
greatest need.

Environmental Health
Beyond consideration of the physical infrastructure of each district’s portfolio of school
buildings, DPH suggests that school districts also evaluate publicly available
environmental health and disease data for communities where their students live. This
will help districts identify schools that may experience disproportionally high rates of
childhood lead poisoning and/or pediatric asthma. Both of these health outcomes are
directly linked to future school performance, increased learning disabilities, and,
consequently, an increased burden on schools. School districts should consider
evaluating the following two sources from DPH to evaluate relevant environmental
health indicators that will help increase awareness of and identify schools having the
greatest needs:
• DPH Annual Childhood Lead Poisoning Surveillance Reports
• Massachusetts Environmental Public Health Tracking Tool
DPH Annual Childhood Lead Poisoning Surveillance Reports
DPH’s Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention Program publishes an Annual Childhood
Lead Poisoning Surveillance Report. In each of these reports, DPH identifies a list of
communities within the Commonwealth that DPH has determined to be at high risk of
having childhood lead poisoning based on the following factors:
• Rates of newly poisoned children
• Age of housing
• Income levels
• At least 15 cases of lead poisoning in the previous five years
Figure 11 presents the list of 16 communities that DPH identified in 2023 as having a
high risk of childhood lead poisoning. In addition, for rural communities that may not
meet the 15-case threshold but may exhibit high prevalence of childhood lead exposure,
the report provides special analyses and mapping to identify areas of high risk. In
particular, many rural areas in the central and western parts of the state have a higher
prevalence of elevated blood lead levels compared to the state overall and children in
rural level 2 communities are twice as likely to have elevated blood lead levels. While
the Annual Childhood Lead Poisoning Surveillance Report does not provide a school
district the means to differentiate levels of risk between specific schools within its
district, the annual list of high-risk communities contributes to general awareness of the
prevalence of this health indicator within a community.

Massachusetts Environmental Public Health Tracking Tool
DPH maintains the Massachusetts Environmental Public Health Tracking Tool (EPHT),
which includes a wealth of environmental and health data for communities across the
Commonwealth. The EPHT enables users to query comprehensive health data sets and
produce custom map overlays with vulnerability criteria to identify areas where public
health mitigation actions should be implemented. DPH encourages school districts to
evaluate the following two particular areas within the tool, each of which is covered in
more detail in this section:
• Prevalence of pediatric asthma
• Community profiles
Prevalence of Pediatric Asthma
Since 2003, DPH has tracked the occurrence of pediatric asthma using health record
data reported by school nurses from all public and private K-8 schools. Within the
EPHT’s Health Module, school districts can explore pediatric asthma maps and data
tables from the 2009–2010 school year to the present. Table 36 outlines notable details
supporting the evaluation of the EPHT’s pediatric asthma prevalence data to assist
school districts in identifying schools of greatest need.

Community Profiles
Within the Planning and Tools Module of the EPHT, school districts can view
Community Profiles, which present a comprehensive synopsis of community-specific
health, demographic, and environmental data, including how each pertains to climate
change, all in a single, easy-to-use report. Figure 17 illustrates a screenshot of a
sample Community Profile in the EPHT. The Community Profiles in the EPHT do not
provide a school district the means to differentiate health indicators between specific
schools within its district; however, the Community Profiles in the EPHT further
contribute to general awareness of environmental health indicators within a community.

Learning Environment and Outcomes
In addition to considering the physical infrastructure of each district’s portfolio of school
buildings and environmental health data from DPH, school districts should also evaluate
109
IV. Goal 3: Achieve Equitable Outcomes for All Students
Methods, Best Practices, and Standards for Achieving Green and Healthy Schools in the Commonwealth

data from DESE’s School and District Profiles, which provide insights into individual
school learning environments and outcomes. This will help districts identify schools
having greater percentages of non-white students, who have been historically
marginalized; schools that have greater percentages of students with disabilities, high
needs, low-income backgrounds, and for whom English is not their first language; and
schools that have lower graduation rates relative to other schools. School districts
should consider evaluating the following three reports in DESE’s School and District
Profiles to evaluate relevant learning environment and outcome indicators that will help
increase awareness of and identify schools having the greatest needs:
• Enrollment by Race/Gender
• Selected Populations
• Graduation Rate
Enrollment by Race/Gender Report

Additional Demographic Data
DPH’s geographic information system-based Massachusetts Health Data Tool
supplements the school-specific learning environment data in DESE’s School and
District Profiles. The Tool provides school districts a means of visually evaluating
additional community-specific demographic data and overlaying the locations of
individual schools. These additional demographic data will help school districts better
understand the broader community context influencing student health and education
outcomes and further prioritize schools having the greatest needs.
The Massachusetts Health Data Tool is a suite of reporting and mapping platforms
designed to help visitors find community- and state-specific data quickly and easily.
With access to more than 100 indicators, the Community and State Reporting tools
provide access to up-to-date data on SDOH, as well as health behaviors, health
outcomes, and healthcare delivery.
When viewing data from the Massachusetts Health Data Tool, users may see
differences among population groups. The differences are especially noticeable
between white people and people of color. These differences exist because of structural
racism. These differences are not because of an individual’s choices, behaviors, or
identity. Systems of oppression, such as racism, cause harm to everyone. They also
influence the SDOH, which impact health outcomes (see Figure 21.)

Figure 21. Health Equity Framework
Source: Massachusetts Health Data Tool
If sharing these data, it is important to use racial equity context and framing. The DPH
Racial Equity Data Road Map is one resource that can help.
Additionally, the datasets from the Massachusetts Health Data Tool currently have
limited (or no) data broken down by sexual orientation, gender identity, and intersex
status. Many of the indicators in the State Health Assessment report data by gender;
however, the data made available reflects gender as the sex assigned by birth
(male/female). This binary framework of reporting does not capture the full spectrum of
gender identity. Gender is a multi-dimensional construct that includes identity and
expression. By maintaining binary language, data sources can be exclusionary and
render transgender and non-binary populations invisible. By gathering information
around gender identity, sex assigned at birth, and sexual orientation, DPH can provide
opportunities to monitor population health and the impact of policies and other macro-
level changes and interventions on population health and health inequities.
As described in the beginning of this report, DPH’s Strategic Plan to Advance Racial
Equity acknowledges that, to advance health equity, DPH must use an intersectional,
equity-centered lens to focus on addressing the persistent racial inequities impacting
the health access, treatment, outcomes, and overall well-being of people across the
Commonwealth, specifically those who identify as Black, Indigenous, Hispanic/Latino,
and/or Asian/Pacific Islander. The COVID-19 pandemic brought into painful, undeniable,
public view the clear, present, and ongoing health inequities perpetuated by systemic
racial inequities across public health infrastructure, health care delivery systems, and
SDOH in Massachusetts. Understanding the ways that systems of oppression create
and perpetuate structural inequities supports DPH in making systems-level changes to
114
IV. Goal 3: Achieve Equitable Outcomes for All Students
Methods, Best Practices, and Standards for Achieving Green and Healthy Schools in the Commonwealth
of Massachusetts
advance health equity. DPH seeks to understand the ways that the structures it designs,
operates, and builds perpetuate inequities. By embracing an understanding of the ways
that state and national public service systems have been built upon racialized policies,
practices, and institutions, DPH aims to lead health equity efforts across the agency, the
secretariat, and the Commonwealth using a structural analysis of how systemic racism
works. In leading racial-equity-centered change, DPH notes the imperative for a shared
approach to equity across all public agencies as racial inequities are also replicated in
educational systems, housing and built environments, carceral systems, economic
systems, climate response, and public workforce systems

V. Funding Strategies
Among other things, the Massachusetts Education Reform Act of 1993 increased the
Commonwealth’s role in funding public education.157 Most notably, it introduced the
concept of an annual “foundation budget” — a unique minimum budget for each school
district in the Commonwealth required to provide constitutionally adequate education.
Each school district’s foundation budget is calculated annually based on a collection of
factors, including enrollment size and demographic data.158 School districts fund their
annual foundation budgets using a combination of state education aid (commonly
referred to as “Chapter 70” aid) and local dollars.158 State funding for local aid and K-12
education represents the second largest category of investment in the Commonwealth’s
budget.159
School districts often plan, track, and account for annual budgets and expenditures
across two separate categories:
• Operating budgets/expenses include the expenses required for day-to-day
school operations, including salaries, utilities, administrative costs, and
maintenance expenses.
• Capital budgets/expenditures cover longer-term investments in the
infrastructure, facilities, and equipment for a district’s schools.
131
V. Funding Strategies
Both operating and capital funding are necessary to implement the collection of
strategies included in this report.
Schools often operate in funding constrained environments
Schools across the
and compete against other schools for grant funding and
Commonwealth have
other limited resources. Among other impacts, this limitation
an estimated capital
of financial resources can result in significant deferred
expenditure gap of
maintenance of school buildings. A 2021 report by the
$1.39 billion.
Office of the State Auditor noted that schools across the
Commonwealth have an estimated capital expenditure gap of $1.39 billion.160
Organizations often use lifecycle cost analyses to understand the relationship between
upfront capital costs and expected operational savings over the life of a project. While
many schools strive to implement lifecycle cost-effective projects to meet their fiduciary
duty, limited capital funding at the time of project implementation often results in
projects that do not realize the full benefit of ongoing operational savings.
This section provides an overview of the following categories of funding sources and
strategies that help Massachusetts school districts achieve green and healthy schools:
• Local contribution to municipality’s foundation budget
• Chapter 70 state aid
• Rural school aid
• Municipal debt
• Grants
• No-cost technical support
• Incentives/rebates/tax credits
• Third-party financing
ocal Contribution to Municipality’s oundation Budget
As previously noted, each Massachusetts school district has its foundation budget
calculated annually. This annual foundation budget is then funded by a combination of
local contributions by the municipality and Chapter 70 aid from the Commonwealth.
Each community’s local contribution is unique and based on the community’s respective
property values and resident incomes.161 Annual local contributions are calculated using
a progressive formula whereby municipalities having greater fiscal resources contribute
a larger share of their foundation budgets, while municipalities having fewer fiscal
resources contribute a smaller share. The maximum local contribution is set at 82.5
percent of the foundation budget.
132
V. Funding Strategies
Chapter 70 State Aid
Chapter 70 state aid represents the quantity of annual funding that the Commonwealth
provides to each school district to make up the difference between each district’s annual
foundation budget and the local contribution provided from the community.
Rural School Aid
The state legislature has appropriated rural school aid since fiscal year 2020.162 DESE
determines funding to eligible school districts based on each district’s student density
and per capita income. School districts are permitted to use rural school aid for a variety
of purposes to support district operations, including increasing regional collaboration,
consolidation, and improving long-term operational efficiency and effectiveness.163
Municipal Debt

Grants
There are numerous state and federal competitive grant programs that can help
Massachusetts school districts across a range of initiatives, including new construction,
renovations and repairs, energy audits, building decarbonization planning, climate
hazard identification and resilience planning, and lead mitigation in drinking water.
Below are some high-level details for a sampling of current grant programs.
• The MSBA Core Program offers grant funding for new construction, additions,
and major renovation projects. Funding levels are based on a reimbursement
rate calculation that considers community income, property wealth, poverty,
along with project-specific incentive points. See the Introduction for additional
details about the MSBA grant award process and determination of funding levels.
• The MSBA Repair Program funds retrofits of building systems. Projects are
categorized as either major repairs, which cover a broad scope and follow a
similar process to the Core Program, or accelerated repairs, which cover
buildings in need of roof and/or window/door replacements, but that are

otherwise structurally sound. Boiler replacements were last included for invitation
in 2022. The MSBA is completing a study with a consultant in anticipation of
adding heat pump conversions to the Accelerated Repair Program beginning in

Section 49:
2025.
• The EEA Municipal Vulnerability Preparedness (MVP) Program provides grant
support to define climate-related hazards, identify existing and future
vulnerabilities, and develop and prioritize community-level actions to reduce risk
and build resilience.
• The DOER Green Communities Grant Program funds energy efficiency
measures, clean energy projects, and other decarbonization strategies in
qualifying communities.
• The MA Clean Energy Center’s (MassCEC’s) Green School Works provides
wraparound services including bridge loans, grant funding, and strategic
technical assistance to schools for decarbonization projects, make-ready
projects, portfolio decarbonization planning, and project planning.164 Preference
is given to schools serving low-income and environmental justice populations.
• The MassDEP School Water Improvement Grants (SWIG) Program provides
funding to schools for lead mitigation in drinking water by installing filtered water
bottle filling stations. SWIG builds on the Lead in School Drinking Water
assistance program that pays for schools to test their drinking water.165
• The Massachusetts Federals Funds & Infrastructure Office tracks federal
opportunities and supports successful applications for Massachusetts projects.
• DOE’s Renew America’s Schools Program is a highly competitive grant program
to promote clean energy improvements in schools. Districts can apply for funding
and technical assistance for strategic planning, energy audits, and project
implementation.
• EPA’s Clean School Bus Program provides grant funding to replace existing
school buses with zero emission and clean school buses
No-cost Technical Support
In addition to grant funding, there are also state programs that provide no-cost technical
support to school districts, including the following examples:
• DOER’s Green Communities Division awards Municipal Energy Technical
Assistance grants to school districts to support decarbonization and energy
resilience of public facilities. Projects can include feasibility studies, auditing, and
assistance with solar development.
• The MassDEP Water-Smart Program offers schools no-cost drinking water lead
sampling, post-sampling analysis, and development of outreach materials.
134
V. Funding Strategies
• MassSave Building Energy Assessments offers no-cost in-person or virtual
assessments for schools, where energy consultants will perform assessments
and provide a customized energy savings report.
Incentives/Rebates/Tax Credits
There are numerous incentives, rebates, and tax credits that are also available to
Massachusetts school districts that can greatly improve the cost-effectiveness of the
many of the best practices outlined in this report. Below is a brief summary of options in
this category of funding sources.
• MassSave offers a variety of incentives to schools, including decarbonization
roadmap services and project implementation for component retrofits up to new
construction and modernizations. Retrofit incentives include building insulation
and weatherization, abatement of hazardous materials (asbestos, vermiculite,
knob and tube wiring), HVAC, lighting and controls, building automation systems
(BAS), specialty equipment, water heating, and pipe insulation. New construction
and modernization incentives offer multiple pathways based on establishing
aggressive energy use intensity (EUI) targets.
• MassSave’s ConnectedSolutions Active Demand Reduction Initiative can further
improve project economics by allowing for compensation from demand response
activities. School districts can contact a curtailment service provider to determine
school- or district-level potential for reducing electricity demand at peak times.
This provides additional grid resilience benefits to the surrounding community.
• The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) Investment Tax Credit (ITC) provides taxable
entities non-competitive cash reimbursements with no funding limit. The IRA ITC
is established by law and extends through 2032-2035. The IRA added a direct
pay (also referred to as elective pay) option, which allows non-taxable entities
(e.g., school districts) to receive the ITC as cash payments. The ITC provides
school districts with the ability to plan over a long-time horizon to install eligible
clean energy technologies—often at lower costs than the conventional
alternative. Eligible technologies include ground-source heat pumps (GSHP),
wastewater energy recovery, solar, battery energy storage systems, ESBs, light
duty battery electric vehicles, and EVSE. MassCEC Green School Works bridge
loans can cover the initial project costs, or municipalities may be able to issue
Federal and State Aid Anticipation Notes.166 Below are some additional points
regarding the IRA ITC:
o ITC funds are intended to be stacked with other funding sources discussed in
this section; however, the use of tax-exempt bonds (e.g., general obligation
bonds) to finance an energy project reduces the ITC by 15 percent. Districts
can consider using cash on hand to finance discrete energy projects while
using tax-exempt bonds to finance the balance of the project.
o Taking advantage of the full value of the ITC requires upfront coordination
with a variety of project stakeholders, including general council, a municipal
tax advisor, capital construction project managers, contracts and
135
V. Funding Strategies
procurement, and an energy services company (ESCO), if applicable. The
project team should review and incorporate all applicable ITC requirements
into the project requirements, including domestic content, prevailing wage,
and apprenticeship requirements. While stakeholders may offer input or
support, the school district is the tax filing entity and has ultimate
responsibility to comply with ITC requirements.
Third-Party Financing
Energy management services (EMS), also referred to as energy savings performance
contracts (ESPC), allow for third-party investment by an energy services company
(ESCO) in school buildings with no upfront cost to the school district. The ESCO will
bring in energy professionals to conduct an investment-grade assessment of the facility
and propose cost-effective retrofit measures that meet the school district’s stated goals.
Once the retrofit measures are agreed upon, the ESCO will install and commission the
systems. The ESCO performs measurement and verification throughout the life of the
contract to ensure that the systems operate as intended and that utility savings are
maintained. The ESCO’s upfront investment is paid back over the life of the contract (up
to 20 years) through a portion of the savings that the school realizes on its utility bills,
making the project budget-neutral. Given that EMS are based on utility cost savings as
opposed to emission reductions, the initial statement of objectives should specify the
school district’s decarbonization goals, environmental health goals, and school program
needs.
EMS projects can include a variety of energy and water conservation measures and
often seek to bundle measures that have short and long paybacks to allow for a larger
overall investment. For example, light-emitting diode (LED) retrofits with quick payback
periods will help offset the costs of larger capital equipment, such as a new HVAC
system. Bundling multiple buildings in a single EMS contract can improve the overall
project economics and allow for deeper emission reductions. School districts can
identify candidate buildings for an EMS through the emissions reduction plan (ERP) and
facility condition assessment (FCA) processes (see Objective 1a. Decarbonize
Buildings for more details). Good candidates are often buildings that are in good
condition (e.g., envelope, finishes) with modern electrical, HVAC, and plumbing
distribution systems but with mechanical equipment that is nearing the end of useful life.
EMS contracts can also incorporate third-party O&M services for newly installed
systems, which can be helpful when existing staff and resources are at capacity or do
not have expertise on the new systems.
The Massachusetts DOER Green Communities Division provides information and
assistance to local jurisdictions on the use of EMS, including draft request for proposals
(RFPs) and request for quotes with language that includes guarantees of savings,
maximum cost, and energy generation (where applicable for onsite clean energy). The
MSBA has issued guidance to clarify that EMS costs are separate from any
reimbursable MSBA project costs. An EMS project will not result in the school being
eliminated from consideration for an MSBA grant award, and schools can still submit an
SOI for buildings undergoing an EMS for any projects that are not covered by the EMS.

Objective 1a. Decarbonize Buildings
Methods and Best Practices
There are a number of methods and best practices that have been implemented to
successfully decarbonize schools across Massachusetts. These are organized in the
following sections in order of implementation, starting with analysis and planning
activities and followed by implementation strategies, operational best practices, and
procurement strategies for decarbonized electricity.
Conduct Analysis and Planning
Analysis and planning provide the foundation for successfully decarbonizing schools by
gathering data to understand the current conditions, establishing goals, developing
interim milestones, and prioritizing strategies at both the school district portfolio level
and for individual schools. This is especially important given the variability in school
conditions and the high capital cost of many decarbonization strategies. Some
strategies can be completed via low-cost desktop analysis, while others require more
time-intensive on-site analysis. To conduct analysis and planning, schools should
compile and analyze facility energy data, perform facility condition assessments and
energy/emissions audits, and prepare and routinely update an Emissions Reduction
Plan.
(1) Compile and analyze facility energy data
The ability to quickly capture energy data and reliably generate actionable insights to
manage building energy use is key to building decarbonization. There are many
different types of systems and commercial off-the-shelf software options that vary in
utility and value based on the size and complexity of a school district’s portfolio. The
U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) broadly refers to this suite of technologies as energy
management information systems (EMIS).167
Utility bill management systems are some of the most common types of EMIS and allow
users to view, validate, and track various metrics related to energy consumption and
corresponding utility payments. Increasingly, municipal and state energy disclosure
ordinances require building owners to compile, document, and report energy data
annually. Among other end goals, the resulting comprehensive data set allows an
organization to compare or “benchmark” the energy performance of its buildings to other
buildings of similar type (see text box below for more details about statewide building
energy disclosure requirements in Massachusetts).
139
VI. Additional Details Related to Goal 1: Achieve Green Schools
Statewide Building Energy Disclosure Requirements
Chapter 179 of the Acts of 2022 requires the annual reporting of energy use data for
all buildings in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts larger than 20,000 square feet.
Electric, natural gas, and steam utility providers are required to report this information
to DOER; individual building owners must report annual usage data for all delivered
fuels (e.g., fuel oil, propane). DOER is developing draft regulations and intends to
finalize them in preparation for the first disclosure period in 2025. Similar ordinances
have already been implemented by some municipalities, including Boston and
Cambridge.
Source: DOER168
Benchmarking is commonly done via free, government-provided platforms such as
EPA’s ENERGY STAR Portfolio Manager (ESPM). In Massachusetts, Green
Communities share data with DOER via the MassEnergyInsight Platform (MEI). Many of
these systems enable automatic data transfers to allow seamless and efficient reporting
by an energy manager, sustainability manager, utility billing specialist, or other school
district staff charged with tracking and analyzing building energy use and cost data.
In addition to meeting benchmarking requirements, ESPM and MEI offer other powerful
tools, including:
• ENERGY STAR Score for K–12 Schools provides a 1 to 100 score that
accounts for and normalizes numerous factors such as weather, number of
building staff, standard operating hours, the presence of cooking facilities, school
type, and the percent of floor area that is heated and cooled. A higher score
indicates better energy performance.169
• MEI Buildings to Target Report allows users to compare energy use intensity
(EUI), total energy consumption, cost, and total emissions by fuel type for all of
their schools (see Figure 28).

VI. Additional Details Related to Goal 1: Achieve Green Schools
Additional EMIS functionality can include interval metering, weather data, BAS, and
other connected devices. Some more advanced functions are discussed in greater
detail in the O&M section below (methods and best practices 10–12).
The availability of building energy use and other data in an EMIS can greatly benefit
project implementation (methods and best practices 4–9) by allowing A/E firms to use
real-world operational data (e.g., utility billing, equipment run time/load, occupancy,
equipment submetering) to inform project concepts and designs.
(2) Perform facility condition assessments (FCAs) and energy/emissions audits
FCAs are commonly used across industries and building types to better understand the
attributes and condition of an organization’s assets for planning and budgeting for O&M
and capital expenditures. The MSBA shall conduct a periodic needs survey of schools
across the Commonwealth and may ascertain the capital construction, reconstruction,
maintenance, and other capital needs. The MSBA School Survey can be generally
understood as an FCA with the supplemental inclusion of school-specific programs,
security, and information technology infrastructure data.
ASTM International (formerly known as American Society for Testing and Materials)
Standard E2018-15 provides a Standard Guide for Property Condition Assessments:
Baseline Property Condition Assessment Process for commercial real estate, which
includes schools. Organizations often expand the scope of FCAs beyond base building
systems to include additional audits and assessments. This approach takes advantage
of having an assessment professional onsite. Examples of additional assessments
include energy audits, building floor plan mapping, analytical measurements (e.g.,
indoor air quality, blower door testing, functional testing), environmental compliance
audits, and health and safety audits. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration
and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) Standard 211 establishes the scope of a
level two energy audit.
To maximize the benefit of FCAs and facility energy audits, schools and school districts
should engage staff to understand their objectives and goals for using the outputs from
these activities. Boston Public Schools publishes an FCA Dashboard to transparently
display data resulting from completed FCAs, which will inform decision making for
repairs, replacements, and renovations. DOER’s MEI Blueprint module offers FCA
database functionality in a tool that many Massachusetts communities already use
regularly.
School district staff may already perform informal auditing as part of their daily duties.
Anecdotal information that district staff members routinely observe and document can
help identify buildings to prioritize for a more focused audit. Common examples of
anecdotal information that staff might notice include:

may indicate inefficient simultaneous heating and cooling loads that can be
corrected.
• Abnormal window air conditioning unit operations. Window air conditioning
units that operate loudly and/or during the heating season are likely an indication
of performance degradation and/or inefficient simultaneous heating and cooling
loads that can be corrected.
(3) Prepare and routinely update an emissions reduction plan (ERP)
An ERP helps organizations establish an actionable and phased roadmap to identify,
prioritize, plan, and implement emissions reduction measures (ERMs)—discrete or
bundled projects resulting in GHG emissions reductions.170 School districts,
municipalities, and other regional entities can make use of the ERP framework to:

Figure 29 offers an example of categorizing an organization’s buildings by HVAC
system type and GHG intensity (a means of normalizing GHG emissions on a per-
square-foot basis). In viewing this example, a school district may decide to prioritize
a single high-impact project to retrofit a district system or establish a program to
address the distributed emissions via less disruptive retrofits to individual packaged
units.

and/or regulatory requirements that might influence the scope and/or prioritization of
ERMs).
143
VI. Additional Details Related to Goal 1: Achieve Green Schools
Implement Strategies to Achieve Energy Efficiency and Building Decarbonization
Once districts complete the initial analysis and planning, they can turn towards
implementation using the strategies covered in this section. While new construction and
major modernization projects have demonstrated a clear path to deliver NZE schools,
many district buildings that exist today will still be in operation in 2050.171 As a general
best practice for all project types, districts should consider projects that optimize energy
efficiency first and then seek to electrify the remaining building loads. As with any
program, the results of implemented projects should be tied back to ongoing planning
efforts and inform future projects. For example, energy efficiency projects may include
make-ready infrastructure or design drawings for future electrification projects to show a
clear path forward for building decarbonization.
(4) Implement NZE new construction and major modernizations
The process of building a new school or modernizing an existing one is a major
undertaking for a community that often spans multiple years. The MSBA provides
modules that outline the process for districts seeking grant funding and the collaborative
process following an invitation to the MSBA’s capital pipeline. The Northeast Energy
Efficiency Partnership (NEEP) Zero Energy Schools Toolkit outlines a general process
for building a new school or modernizing an existing one:172

Section 55:
1. Pre-Design: Establish educational specifications and conduct community
engagement.

Section 56:
2. Design: Select an architect, complete the schematic design, and select a general
contractor to lead construction.

Section 57:
3. Construction: Complete site work, building construction, and landscaping.

Section 58:
4. Occupancy: Conduct occupant engagement and training before the school’s
opening and on an ongoing basis.
The comprehensive nature of new construction and modernizations allows districts to
establish decarbonization goals at the pre-design project phase. Most commonly, these
goals are communicated to project teams by establishing site EUI (energy consumption
measured at the meter) and source EUI (includes the fuel required to generate and
deliver the energy) targets. The targets in
Table 44 are included as a 2019 reference based on MA’s location in climate zone
5A.173 It is important to understand the current market landscape as targets are being
set, given that efficiencies improve over time. These EUI targets are more aggressive
than others defined for K–12 schools in Massachusetts.174 Other new construction and
modernization goals should consider the environmental health, sustainability, and equity
programs discussed in more detail in other sections.

Section 59:
19.2 19.1 57.1 56.9
For new construction and modernization projects, a DOE study found that net zero
schools have comparable capital costs to traditional school projects, and there is no
correlation between project capital costs and EUI. Instead, a fixed budget and target
EUI were found to be key determinants for a successful, cost-effective project by
providing firm boundaries that allow project teams to find creative solutions.43
While both new construction and modernization projects decrease operational
emissions, they differ in their relative embodied carbon intensities, which impacts a
building’s overall carbon footprint. In this context, embodied carbon refers to the
emissions generated during the resource extraction, manufacturing, transportation,
replacement, and disposal of building materials. Construction projects result in a
significant generation of emissions from embodied carbon, separate from the
operational emissions that result from using a school over the building’s useful life.
Reducing a project’s embodied carbon results in immediate climate mitigation benefits
in the present. Modernization projects generally have lower embodied carbon intensities
because they reuse structural components that include the majority of the high carbon
intensity materials, like concrete and steel. Modernization projects also retain school
resources in the existing community and require less land disturbance. The MSBA
incentivizes building reuse with up to five

(5) Implement deep energy retrofits
145
VI. Additional Details Related to Goal 1: Achieve Green Schools
Deep energy retrofits achieve 40 percent or greater reductions in an existing building’s
site EUI through a comprehensive design process that considers improvements to all
building systems.
Deep energy retrofits can be achieved as part of a larger modernization project that also
includes updates to finishes, school programming, site work, and other non-energy
areas. Later sections address individual building systems and retrofit strategies in more
detail.
In addition to optimizing a building’s energy efficiency, deep energy retrofits also help
enable the electrification of building heating systems. A critical step to efficient
electrification is understanding a building’s heating requirements and identifying
opportunities to reduce heating loads to more effectively maintain occupant comfort
while right-sizing new, all-electric equipment. For example, designing a system based
on the total capacity of all existing fan coil units (FCUs) in a building may result in a
heating system size that is challenging to electrify cost-effectively. By looking at trend
data for the actual heating load of all FCUs over a range of conditions, designers may
find that all but the FCUs serving the coldest zones operate at 35 percent capacity.
Thus, the central system capacity can be reduced while still providing supplemental
heat to the coldest zones when needed.
Critically, gaining a better understanding of and reducing heating loads can lower supply
hot water temperatures and expand the options of available, efficient, all-electric
systems.175
(6) Improve building envelopes
The building envelope refers to the windows, walls, and roofs that provide a barrier
between indoor and outdoor spaces and accounts for approximately 30 percent of the
primary energy consumed in typical commercial buildings.176 Improving the building
envelope can reduce the building’s overall heating and cooling loads, reducing the
necessary size and cost of the HVAC system. For example, a Virginia elementary
school invested an additional $200,000 in the school’s envelope, resulting in savings of
about $500,000 in HVAC first costs.43 Building envelopes serve the following purposes:
• Maintain thermal comfort by reducing radiant heat and drafts. In the case of a
power outage, a well-designed envelope can help a building maintain indoor
temperatures over a more extended period; this is referred to as “passive
survivability.” With lower heating and cooling loads, it is increasingly important to
confirm that sufficient ventilation is provided to all spaces. See Goal 2: Achieve
Healthy Schools, Objective 2c. Maintain Thermal Comfort for additional details.
• Air and vapor barriers maintain indoor air quality (IAQ) and appropriate
humidity levels and prevent moisture damage to building materials. Tighter
envelopes allow the HVAC system to supply only filtered and conditioned outdoor
air, addressing the concern of outdoor air pollutants resulting in degraded IAQ
(see the Reduced Exposure to Outdoor Air Pollutants section for more details),

(7) Optimize and electrify component retrofits
Component retrofits refer to the replacement of individual pieces of equipment, some of
which may be part of a larger system, or equipment that operates independently of a
central plant. In all retrofits, schools should strive to improve upon energy efficiency and
electrify any existing components that currently combust fossil fuel. DOE’s
Decarbonizing HVAC and Water Heating in Commercial Buildings provides building
owners and facilities engineers with a valuable resource when conducting the technical,
economic, and feasibility assessment for converting to all-electric solutions.175 The DOE
report demonstrates how building owners can retrofit a variety of existing system types
to alternative systems that rely on electric heat pump (HP) technology. These systems
are often classified by their heat source (e.g., air-, water-, and ground-source) and
thermal distribution method in the building (e.g., air for packaged rooftop units, water for
hydronic heat pumps, and refrigerant for variable refrigerant flow solutions). Examples
of component retrofits are outlined below.
• Rooftop units (RTUs) are individual pieces of equipment that are often used to
provide heating and cooling to large open spaces, including a school’s
gymnasium, cafeteria, auditorium, and library. Conventional RTUs that combust
fossil fuel (typically natural gas) to provide space heating can often be replaced
in-kind by a HP RTU that uses the existing electrical service to provide both
heating and cooling. Furthermore, if there is an existing supply line for natural
gas, a school can use this natural gas service to provide second-stage heating to
supplement heating from the HP RTU on the coldest days. This can result in
147
VI. Additional Details Related to Goal 1: Achieve Green Schools
greater than 80 percent electrification of heating for the given zone. The retrofit
project requires a crane to move equipment to and from the roof and can be
completed during school breaks.
• Water heaters provide domestic hot water for small applications such as
bathrooms and locker rooms. Heat pump water heaters (HPWHs) are available in
sizes ranging from 40 to 120 gallons and some available models can operate
using a standard 110V wall outlet, reducing the need for electrical work ahead of
the installation. HPWHs extract heat from the air in the room in which they are
located, which has the added benefit of dehumidifying the room.
• Lighting retrofits frequently install LED fixtures in existing fluorescent lighting
troffers and in space types where the existing lighting fixture may need to be
replaced (gymnasiums, outdoor site lighting). Schools should consider keeping
lighting controls simple so that untrained users can quickly and easily use
them.177 Lighting retrofits often provide quick financial paybacks, making them a
good candidate to bundle with other ERMs to improve overall project economics.
Existing FLBs that contain PCBs should be properly handled and disposed of as
part of a retrofit. See Goal 2: Achieve Healthy Schools, Objective 2a. Improve
Indoor Air Quality for additional details about reducing exposure to PCBs.
Realizing Indoor Air Quality Co-benefits
Updated HVAC equipment (e.g., RTUs) can provide numerous IAQ co-benefits,
including:
• The installation of air filters that have a minimum efficiency reporting value
(MERV) of 13 or higher.
• The use of demand control ventilation increases ventilation rates when a
setpoint (e.g., 800 parts per million [ppm] carbon dioxide) is reached. This
ensures that both a crowded gymnasium with high school physical education
classes and an elementary school library are appropriately ventilated based
on occupancy levels and activity types.
• The installation and use of carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, and PM
sensors that can help building engineers monitor and quickly resolve any
identified air quality issues. See the Reduce Exposure to Mold and Moisture

Section 61:
section for additional details about the use of sensor technology to monitor
IAQ parameters.
(8) Electrify whole system retrofits
Whole system retrofits most often refer to HVAC retrofits that include the central plant
equipment, the terminal equipment serving individual classrooms and zones, and in
some cases, the distribution system connecting the two. A key use case in
Massachusetts, as climate change is expected to increase the number of high-heat
days, is to add air conditioning to buildings that currently only provide heating or use
148

window air conditioning units. The more comprehensive nature of these projects allows
engineers to consider a wider range of available technologies, including:
• Variable refrigerant flow (VRF) systems use heat pumps in each zone to
provide heating and cooling by modulating the amount of refrigerant sent to each
unit and moving heat between rooms. VRF systems are a common retrofit option
in buildings that use window air conditioning units or provide only heat. These
projects require significant redesign since the refrigerant-distribution system is
fundamentally different compared to an
existing hydronic or steam boiler.175 Networked Geothermal in

of the stable year-round ground temperature to provide heating and cooling at 3
to 6 times the efficiencies of legacy fossil fuel systems, even in cold climates.178
GSHP systems require an appropriately sized wellfield that houses the vertical
bores, which circulate a fluid before returning to the building. Wellfields can be
installed under parking lots, athletic fields, or other adjoining open spaces.
GSHPs are a well-established technology that have compelling lifecycle costs. A
study conducted by the Town of Arlington, MA, across six schools found that
GSHP systems have lower first cost and lifecycle costs when accounting for
federal and state incentives.179
• Wastewater energy recovery, another established technology, uses sanitary
sewer infrastructure as a heat source/sink. Wastewater is diverted to a heat
exchanger, which transfers energy to a heat pump system that serves the
building. This technology can support electrification in space-constrained urban
environments that may not be able to support a GSHP wellfield.
The co-benefits described in the component retrofit section also apply to the above
technologies but across a larger portion of the school.
(9) Electrify cafeteria kitchens
After space and water heating, cafeteria kitchens are often the next largest consumer of
fossil fuels in schools. In addition to the kitchen equipment that combusts fossil fuels
(e.g., ovens, cooktops, fryers), the combustion activity releases toxic chemicals into the
air and requires significant ventilation, which contributes to electricity consumption
149
VI. Additional Details Related to Goal 1: Achieve Green Schools
through exhaust fan power and conditioning the outdoor makeup air. Traditional
kitchens are loud (ventilation) and hot (open combustion inefficiently transferring heat)
environments that can provide significant workplace improvements by electrifying
equipment. Another co-benefit of all-electric kitchens is the reduction of asthma triggers.
Like space heating systems, a variety of options are available to efficiently electrify
kitchen operations. The type of kitchen operations occurring at a given school (full-
service kitchen, commissary serving multiple schools, reheat kitchen) and the food
program (food served, single use vs. reusable service ware, lunch seatings and
throughput) will determine the requirements for an all-electric alternative design. It is
important to engage with the district’s food and nutrition group to understand and
document kitchen requirements.
All-electric kitchens have been demonstrated to meet or exceed the throughput of
traditional kitchen lines and can often do so using a smaller footprint. Where there are
concerns about equipment performance or power availability, installing an induction
cooktop is a good entry point to demonstrate proof of concept. Schools can install
additional electric kitchen equipment as they replace existing fossil fuel-fired
equipment.180
Operate and Maintain Schools
O&M refers to all the daily and ongoing tasks performed by school staff and contractors
to prioritize that schools continue to operate as they are intended to. Staff members
with a deep understanding of the school facility are critical to schools achieving the
goals of any of the implementation methods and best practices described above, from
project inception through the end of life of the school. When conducting O&M, schools

VI. Additional Details Related to Goal 1: Achieve Green Schools
• Preventive maintenance, which helps support reliable operation of equipment.
A preventive maintenance plan outlines the frequency of maintenance tasks for
all pieces of equipment. A lack of preventive maintenance can lead to an
increase in emergency replacements, which often necessitate in-kind
replacements with equipment available from existing inventory. This often results
in a project missing a critical opportunity to thoughtfully electrify systems.
Re-commissioning/retro-commissioning (RCx), which involves a process of
examining and recalibrating an existing building’s equipment and systems to better
meet the building’s operational needs. The term “re-commission” is used for
buildings that were properly commissioned following original construction; the term
“retro-commission” is used for existing buildings that were never properly
commissioned following original construction. Schools should conduct RCx every
five years or when there are significant changes in operations (e.g., a change of
occupancy greater than 20 percent). This practice confirms that equipment is
performing according to the original design intent and can include the recalibration or
replacement of sensors and other minor repairs to control systems.
Computerized maintenance management systems, which help manage all
maintenance activities across a portfolio of buildings. Larger school districts
responsible for maintaining a greater number of buildings should consider using
these systems to more efficiently manage and coordinate maintenance activities
across facilities staff and contractors.
Engaging O&M staff in capital projects, which prioritizes their expertise in
operating building systems and addressing existing pain points so they are
appropriately accounted for in the design phase. O&M staff often provide a unique
perspective regarding the feasibility of proposed design options, including an
awareness of zones that have trouble maintaining setpoints and knowledge of
system access points that enable preventative maintenance without disrupting
classrooms.
(11) Utilize BAS to optimize building performance and energy efficiency
A BAS provides automatic controls, visualizations, and trend data for the operation of
various building systems. BAS support reliable building operations while also reducing
energy and water consumption. ASHRAE Guideline 36-2021 outlines best-in-class
HVAC control sequences and should be used to establish requirements for new BAS or
to conduct RCx for existing systems. Examples of BAS best practices follow.
• Setpoints and schedules helps to balances the thermal comfort of building
occupants (see Goal 2: Achieve Healthy Schools, Objective 2c. Maintain
Thermal Comfort for additional details) and energy-efficient operations by
reducing system runtime during unoccupied periods. Both should be established
by district policy and allow for room-level adjustments by occupants (rooms with
southern exposure may feel warmer) and special events (after-school uses of
specific spaces).
151
VI. Additional Details Related to Goal 1: Achieve Green Schools
• Demand Controlled ventilation is a best practice for ensuring sufficient
ventilation is provided in an energy-efficient manner.
• Optimal start and stop refers to the use of trend data to understand how long
the building takes to warm up or cool down based on weather conditions and
schedules the HVAC system to turn on at a specific time based on current
conditions. The alternative is using a static startup time that is often overly
conservative (resulting in excessive equipment run time and energy waste) and
may not be updated to account for sporadic, extreme conditions.
• Central monitoring and control of BAS can be a beneficial strategy for larger
districts. Trained operators can remotely monitor building conditions across
multiple schools, perform fault detection and diagnostics, and find energy
savings (e.g., utility load curtailment or demand response programs).181
• Preventive maintenance such as front-end software updates (what the user
interacts with), controller firmware updates, and sensor calibration all help
support the proper operation of and interpretation of the data from the BAS.
Co-benefits of improved building performance via BAS optimizations include controlling
humidity and excess moisture in schools, which in turn can decrease mold growth,
reducing allergens and asthma triggers. See the Reduce Exposure to Mold and
Moisture section for additional information.
(12) Establish and train an NZE workforce
Massachusetts has identified expanding the clean energy sector workforce as a key
strategy to achieving the Commonwealth’s climate goals. This includes trades relevant
to school O&M staff, including HVAC and smart building technicians, as well as other
trade partners with whom schools are likely to contract.182 While Massachusetts
continues to build out equitable pathways to bring more people into the clean energy
trades, districts can consider the following for existing staff and new hires:
• The existing workforce benefits from continued investment in job training such
as those offered by MassCEC through the Clean Energy Careers Training and
Education Directory, Massachusetts’ 15 community colleges, and Building
Operator Certification (discounted rates available to registrants served by
Eversource Massachusetts or National Grid).182
• Evaluate the job descriptions and required licensing/certifications of new
hires. For example, as districts electrify schools, roles that traditionally required
boiler plant operator licenses will require an HVAC technician skillset to
understand the vapor compression refrigerant cycle used by heat pumps. There
is also an increasing need for computer skills so that BAS-connected systems
run automatically based on the original design intent and are only overridden for
manual operation briefly and when necessary.
152
VI. Additional Details Related to Goal 1: Achieve Green Schools
Procure Decarbonized Electricity
The procurement and use of decarbonized electricity is the final pillar of decarbonization
following efficiency improvements and electrification projects. Using decarbonized
electricity is a key step to decarbonization, especially as more building systems are
electrified and building electricity consumption increases. By nature, decarbonized
electricity also keeps district money in the regional community as a school’s utility
budget transitions from being spent on fuels that are most often brought in from outside
of the community to electricity that is generated within the region. To pursue
decarbonized electricity, schools should consider both the installation and use of onsite
renewable energy systems and the procurement of bundled renewable electricity from
the grid.
(13) Install and use onsite renewable energy systems
Onsite renewable energy systems allow schools to generate and consume their own
electricity, while still being connected to the broader electrical grid to support reliable
operations and to export power when it is not needed. Solar photovoltaic (PV) arrays
are the most common onsite renewable energy systems and can take advantage of the
large flat roofs installed on many schools. Districts can use DOER’s Technical Solar
Potential Map to help prioritize schools with the greatest solar potential. To the
maximum extent possible, schools should coordinate the installation of onsite solar PV
arrays to coincide with roof replacements to help make certain 20 to 25 years of
uninterrupted generation from the array. Other project types (such as roof
replacements) can include PV make-ready infrastructure (home run conduit from the
roof to the electrical room) to lower the cost of future installation. Systems that require
dedicated structures (carports) are more costly to install but can offer additional benefits
such as shading and supporting electric vehicle charging. See Objective 1e. Provide
Electric Vehicle Charging Stations for School Staff and Public Use for additional
information about electric vehicle charging infrastructure and Objective 1f. Enhance
Climate Resilience for additional information for how solar PV arrays can incorporate
battery energy storage systems (BESS) to optimize a school’s resilience to climate
change.
NE-CHPS defines zero energy capable design as having PV generation equal to or
greater than 100 percent of annual electricity consumption, covering a minimum of 65
percent of the roof area. This highlights the benefit of project designs that minimize
rooftop equipment to maximize PV capacity.183
(14) Procure bundled renewable electricity from the grid
Massachusetts is a retail choice electricity market served by ISO New England—the
independent regional transmission organization that oversees the operation of the grid
in New England. In a retail choice market, organizations can participate in competitive
procurements and select their own electricity supply, which is delivered to facilities by
the serving distribution utility (the company that owns the wires to the building, owns the
meter, and bills the customer). Massachusetts’ Renewable Energy Portfolio Standard
153
VI. Additional Details Related to Goal 1: Achieve Green Schools
(RPS) ensures that the amount of grid-supplied clean electricity that a facility receives
by default increases over time.
Bundled renewable electricity (also known as “delivered green power”) refers to a
customer’s purchase of physical electricity flowing from the grid to the customer’s site
paired with the underlying environmental attributes associated with the electricity
generated from a renewable source, for which the customer pays a premium. These
attributes are commonly referred to as renewable energy credits or energy attribute
certificates. PowerOptions is an organization that manages competitive utility
procurements for non-profit and public sector entities in Massachusetts, Connecticut,
and Rhode Island, helping schools in these states meet their goals and reduce utility
price volatility by locking in stable long-term electricity rates.

Objective 1b. Optimize Water Efficiency
Methods and Best Practices
There are many methods and best practices for optimizing water efficiency in schools,
including monitoring and managing water use, optimizing water efficiency of end uses
and systems, and using alternative water sources. Each of these methods and best
practices are described in more detail below.
Resources to Jump Start Water Efficiency in Schools
Schools can begin optimizing water efficiency by reviewing WaterSense’s Best
Management Practices, the Massachusetts Water Conservation Standards, and the
Schools, Recreation and Facilities Managers web page offered by the
Commonwealth’s Water Resources Commission.
158
VI. Additional Details Related to Goal 1: Achieve Green Schools
In general, schools should consider reviewing the EPA WaterSense® program’s best
management practices, collectively known as WaterSense at Work.199 WaterSense at
Work is a comprehensive guide developed to help commercial and institutional facility
owners and managers understand and better manage their water use. It is designed to
provide guidance to help establish an effective facility water management program and
identify projects and practices that can reduce facility water use and associated
operating costs. It includes best practices and O&M, retrofit, and replacement
recommendations for most if not all water end uses that may be found in Massachusetts
schools, and provides a compilation of additional resources on each topic.
In addition, Massachusetts Water Conservation Standards provides best practices and
recommendations for optimizing water efficiency for water suppliers and water users,
including schools.200 Specifically, schools should consider reviewing Section 7.0, which
provides recommendations for schools, and Section 9.0, which provides
recommendations on outdoor water use. Recommendations for schools are also
summarized on the School, Recreation, and Facilities Managers web page offered by
the Water Resources Commission.201
Monitor and Manage Water Use
When monitoring and managing water use, schools should consider metering and
tracking water use, benchmarking water use against other schools, and conducting
individual facility water assessments.
(1) Meter and track water use
Metering and tracking water use can help schools identify leaks and other abnormalities
in water use, identify areas for targeted reductions, help measure progress from
implementing water efficiency best practices, and allow for benchmarking.
At a minimum, schools should consider regularly tracking their building- or campus-level
metered water consumption using bills provided by their water utility. Schools should
strive to meter all water uses, including all indoor and outdoor water use, as well as
both utility-supplied sources and onsite alternative water sources (e.g., rainwater,
graywater).200 Schools should consider entering data into ESPM or another similar utility
management program.202 ESPM is a free, interactive tool for managing energy, water,
waste, and GHG emissions of any building type. ESPM has tools to help understand
metrics, monitor trends, and generate reports of metered data. Schools should use
graphs of water use data to help identify potential leaks or other water use abnormalities
and fix them immediately.203
Some schools may be able to access advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) data from
their water utility, if their utility uses advanced meters. Advanced water meters record
water meter data at least hourly and automatically transmit data regularly to a central
collection point. School facility managers can learn more about how to use AMI data by
reviewing WaterSense’s Improving Water Management Using Advanced Metering
Infrastructure Data: A Guide for Facility Managers.204
159
VI. Additional Details Related to Goal 1: Achieve Green Schools
In addition to metering and tracking building- or campus-level water use data, schools
should consider submetering high water end uses, including cooling towers, steam
boilers, single-pass cooling systems, irrigation systems, pools, and any product, system,
or process predicted use 1,000 gallons of water or more per day or 100,000 gallons of
water or more per year. 205
For more information about how to optimize water efficiency by metering and tracking
water use, schools should review WaterSense at Work Section 2.1: Metering and
Submetering. 199
(2) Benchmark water use
To further optimize water efficiency, Massachusetts schools should consider
benchmarking school water use. Benchmarking is the process of measuring a building’s
water use and comparing it to its own historical usage, the water use of similar facilities,
or a reference performance level. Similar to metering and tracking water use,
benchmarking can be as simple as measuring and comparing one school’s water
consumption over time (e.g., gallons per year). However, benchmarking can be more
powerful when water use data is normalized so that it can be compared across similar
facilities of the same type.206
Normalizing Water Consumption Data
To compare schools of all sizes and populations to one another, water use data
should be normalized. To normalize water use data, schools can select a metric to
help best compare water use data among schools, such as by facility size (e.g.,
gallons per square foot per year) or by population served (e.g., gallons per student per
year).
Massachusetts schools can benchmark building water consumption by:
• Metering and tracking water use (as described in best practice 1)
• Selecting a metric to normalize water use data, such as gallons per square foot
per year (also known as water use intensity [WUI]) or gallons used per student
per year
• Comparing normalized water use data across schools within individual school
districts or municipalities
Individual school districts or municipalities throughout the Commonwealth could use
normalized water use data to compare schools within their district to one another to
identify the schools in greatest need of efforts to increase water efficiency. School
districts/municipalities could choose to focus efforts on the highest water-using schools,
potentially deciding to conduct water assessments (as described in best practice 3) on
those schools first.
160
VI. Additional Details Related to Goal 1: Achieve Green Schools
In addition to comparing schools within a municipality or across the state, schools might
also compare building water performance to other schools across the nation. EPA has
developed a technical reference on median WUI values and other metrics observed in a
variety of facility types based on water use data entered into ESPM, which schools
could review to compare themselves against other schools in the United States.207 For
select building types in ESPM, there is an EPA Water Score (from 1 to 100) that allows
a facility to compare itself relative to the national population of buildings with similar
characteristics. For example, a building receiving a score of 75 indicates the building
performs better than 75 percent of similar buildings nationwide. While this EPA Water
Score rating system is not yet available for schools in ESPM, schools should continue to
report water use data into it to support this functionality in the future.
Some Massachusetts municipalities, including Boston208 and Lexington,209 currently
require large commercial buildings such as schools to report energy and water use data
annually using ESPM. Schools and school districts should be sure to report water use
where required and should consider tracking and reporting water data in ESPM, even if
not required.
For more detailed information on optimizing water efficiency by benchmarking water
use, review WaterSense at Work Section 2.3: Benchmarking.199
(3) Conduct water assessments
Understanding how water is used in each school individually is critical to optimizing
water efficiency across the portfolio of schools in Massachusetts. An individual facility
water assessment can:210
• Provide a comprehensive account of all water end uses at a school
• Identify leaks and potential simple operations and maintenance changes (unique
to each school) that could reduce water use
• Establish a school’s water use baseline
• Prioritize a list of water efficiency projects and improvements at a school,
including potential water and energy savings, project cost, and return on
investment
Schools should consider hiring water efficiency professionals with specific water
assessment experience to conduct school building water assessments. Alternatively,
existing facility management staff can educate themselves to conduct water
assessments using tools and resources developed by EPA’s WaterSense program and
other organizations. School facility managers can begin to train themselves to assess
their schools by reviewing WaterSense at Work Section 1.2 Water Management
Planning, 199 watching EPA’s latest “Conducting a Water Assessment from Start to
Finish” webinar,211 and familiarizing themselves with additional tools and resources
available to help conduct a water assessment.212
161
VI. Additional Details Related to Goal 1: Achieve Green Schools
WaterSense recommends that facilities conduct water assessments every four years to
continue to identify O&M practices, retrofits, and replacements that may optimize water
efficiency at a facility.210
Optimize Water Efficiency of End Uses and Systems
To optimize water efficiency of end uses and systems, schools should consider
installing WaterSense® labeled, ENERGY STAR® certified, and other high-efficiency
products in restrooms and cafeterias; implementing water-efficient O&M and user
education in restrooms and cafeterias; eliminating non-functional irrigated turf and
installing water-efficient landscaping; optimizing irrigation systems and installing
WaterSense labeled irrigation products; eliminating single-pass cooling; optimizing
cooling towers and steam boilers; and optimizing the water efficiency of other
uncommon end uses where applicable.
(4) Install WaterSense labeled, ENERGY STAR certified, and other high-efficiency
products in restrooms and cafeterias
Whenever possible, schools should install WaterSense labeled, ENERGY STAR
certified, and other high-efficiency water-using products in restrooms and cafeterias.
248 CMR 10.00 Uniform State Plumbing Code specifies maximum flow rate
requirements for residential and non-residential lavatory faucets; residential kitchen or
bar faucets; and non-residential sink faucets, showerheads, tank-type toilets,
flushometer-valve-type toilets, and urinals that align with current WaterSense
specifications, where applicable.213 Further, 225 CMR 9.00 Appliance Energy-Efficiency
Standards, Testing and Certification Program requires that commercial dishwashers
and steam cookers sold in Massachusetts be ENERGY STAR certified.
WaterSense labeled restroom products use at least 20 percent less water than standard
models and are independently certified for efficiency and performance. Because
WaterSense labeled products have maximum flow rates aligned with Massachusetts
plumbing code and are independently tested and certified, Massachusetts schools
should use the WaterSense Product Search Tool to look for WaterSense labeled
products specifically when replacing or purchasing new bathroom fixtures and fittings.214
These products include:
• WaterSense labeled flushometer-valve and tank-type toilets
• WaterSense labeled urinals
• WaterSense labeled showerheads
• WaterSense labeled private lavatory faucets (intended for private bathrooms not
available to walk-in traffic)
WaterSense does not label public lavatory faucets (i.e., those installed in public
restrooms open to walk-in traffic). New lavatory faucets in public restrooms should
162
VI. Additional Details Related to Goal 1: Achieve Green Schools
either be 0.5 gallons per minute (gpm) public-use lavatory faucets or 0.25 gallons per
cycle metering faucets to align with Massachusetts plumbing code.213
Similarly, WaterSense does not label kitchen faucets. Instead, schools should install 1.8
gpm kitchen sink faucets with a 2.2 gpm maximum temporary override for classrooms
and other areas with residential-style kitchen sinks to align with requirements in 225
CMR 9.00 Appliance Energy-Efficiency Standards, Testing and Certification Program. 215
ENERGY STAR specifies energy- and water-efficiency criteria for several water-using
commercial kitchen products and appliances. Massachusetts regulations require that
commercial dishwashers and steam cookers sold in the Commonwealth be ENERGY
STAR certified.215 To align with these regulations and to save energy and water across
all water-using cafeteria equipment, Massachusetts schools should use the ENERGY
STAR Product Finder to look for ENERGY STAR certified commercial kitchen products,
specifically when replacing or purchasing new water-using kitchen equipment.216 These
products include:
• ENERGY STAR certified commercial ice makers
• ENERGY STAR certified dishwashers
• ENERGY STAR certified combination ovens
• ENERGY STAR certified steam cookers
WaterSense and ENERGY STAR do not label commercial pre-rinse spray valves used
for rinsing dishes prior to dishwashing in cafeterias. Instead, schools should install 1.28
gpm commercial pre-rinse spray valves to align with the final rule that DOE published in
the Federal Register in 2016.217
In addition, schools should consider retrofit and replacement options for steam kettles,
dipper wells, wash-down sprayers, food disposals, and other commercial kitchen
equipment, where applicable, as described in WaterSense at Work Section 4.0. 199
(5) Implement water-efficient operations, maintenance, and user education in
restrooms and cafeterias
When schools do not replace or have a need to install new restroom and cafeteria
equipment (per the recommendations outlined in best practice 4), schools should
consider implementing O&M and user education recommendations for restroom fitting
and fixtures and cafeteria equipment as described in WaterSense at Work Section 3:
Sanitary Fixtures and Equipment and WaterSense at Work Section 4.0 Commercial
Kitchen Equipment. 199 These best practices provide simple, often low-cost operational
and user-focused changes that can help schools use existing fittings, fixtures, and
equipment as efficiently as possible.

(6) Eliminate irrigated non-functional turf and install water-efficient landscaping
In general, water-efficient landscaped plant beds require less water than turfgrass.
Where possible, schools should consider eliminating irrigated non-functional turf and
replacing it with water-efficient landscaping—ideally, landscaping that does not require
supplemental irrigation. In addition to reducing a school’s water consumption, this
practice can also create additional outdoor spaces with shade that provide relief for
students and staff participating in outdoor activities. Non-functional turf includes turf
areas that are decorative and have no other functions. Functional use includes—but is
not limited to—turf for sports fields, picnic areas, and outdoor classrooms.
Schools should review WaterSense at Work Section 5.1: Landscaping for further O&M
and user education best practices and retrofit and replacement options to optimize the
water efficiency of landscaping.199
(7) Optimize irrigation systems and install WaterSense labeled irrigation products
Where supplemental irrigation is needed to maintain school landscapes, schools should
confirm that irrigation systems are optimized and should consider using WaterSense
labeled irrigation products.
EPA recommends a full audit of an irrigation system every three years by a qualified
irrigation auditor certified by a WaterSense labeled program, if possible.218 An irrigation
system audit evaluates the irrigation system’s performance and schedule, identifies
deficiencies, and provides suggestions for water efficiency improvements. Schools can
identify irrigation professionals certified by a WaterSense labeled program using
WaterSense’s Find a Pro tool.219 For schools that would prefer to use in-house staff for
this purpose, existing facility managers can

guidelines for conducting an irrigation audit.220
Following an irrigation audit, schools should implement recommended improvements to
the irrigation system. If a full irrigation audit isn’t performed, schools should consider
reviewing WaterSense at Work Section 5.2: Irrigation and implementing the
recommended O&M and user education best practices and/or retrofit and replacement
options to optimize the water efficiency of irrigation systems.199
When possible, schools should consider installing WaterSense labeled irrigation
products, which can be found using the WaterSense Product Search Tool, including:214
164
VI. Additional Details Related to Goal 1: Achieve Green Schools
• WaterSense labeled irrigation controllers, which include weather- or soil-
moisture-based control technology
• WaterSense labeled spray sprinkler bodies where spray irrigation is used, as
required by 225 CMR 9.00 Appliance Energy-Efficiency Standards, Testing and
Certification Program
Further, schools should ensure that all newly installed or renovated irrigation systems
override and suspend programmed operation during periods of sufficient moisture.
Schools should also inspect system interruption devices at least every three years by an
irrigation contractor as required in M.G.L c 21, § 67: System Interruption Devices
Requirement for New Irrigation Systems.221 Schools can meet this requirement by using
WaterSense labeled irrigation controllers or otherwise installing rain sensors that
suspend irrigation upon the detection of rain.
Schools with irrigation systems should consider the water-smart irrigation principles
outlined in Massachusetts Water Conservation Standards Section 9.0 Outdoor Water
Use.200 In addition, schools should follow state guidance for limiting nonessential
outdoor water use during droughts as outlined in the Guidance on Nonessential Outdoor
Water Use Amended Water Resources Management Program Regulations 310 CMR

Section 63:
36.00 and the Massachusetts Drought Management Plan Preparedness &
Response. 222,46
(8) Eliminate single-pass cooling
Single-pass cooling systems use approximately 40 times more water to remove the
same heat load than a cooling tower operating at five cycles of concentration (see best
practice 9 for more details about cycles of concentration).223 Many types of equipment
cooled with single-pass cooling can be replaced with air-cooled systems.
Schools should identify any instances of single-pass cooling and minimize or eliminate
them where possible. Types of equipment that may use single-pass cooling and may be
present in Massachusetts schools include:
• Ice makers
• Point-of-use chillers for HVAC and other refrigeration systems
• Air compressors
• Welding machines
• Vacuum pumps
Ice makers are likely the most common type of single-pass cooled equipment found in
schools. Schools should consider replacing water-cooled ice makers with ENERGY
STAR certified commercial ice makers using the ENERGY STAR Product Finder.216
165
VI. Additional Details Related to Goal 1: Achieve Green Schools
For recommendations on how to minimize or eliminate single-pass cooling identified
elsewhere, schools should review WaterSense at Work Section 6.2: Single-Pass
Cooling.199
(9) Optimize cooling towers and steam boilers
Some schools may use cooling towers to dissipate heat from recirculating water that is
used to cool chillers, air conditioning equipment, or other process equipment. By design,
cooling towers consume large volumes of water, as the cooling towers use evaporation
to remove heat from the recirculated water loop. The operation of cooling towers can,
however, be optimized for water efficiency.
When water evaporates from a tower, dissolved solids are left behind. Eventually the
total dissolved solids (TDS) concentration gets too high for optimal performance and
some water must be removed, or blown down, from the system. Make-up water is
added to the system to replace the blowdown and decrease the concentration of TDS.
The ratio of make-up to blow down is known as cycles of concentration.
To optimize a cooling tower’s water use, a facility should maximize the tower’s cycles of
concentration without increasing TDS such that it impacts the tower’s water quality and
performance. A school’s BAS can offer visibility and help optimize cooling tower
performance both by monitoring TDS and by implementing control strategies described
in best practice 11 of the “Objective 1a. Decarbonize Buildings” section. Schools with
cooling towers may have water chemistry vendors that can help optimize their tower’s
cycles of concentration. Otherwise, a school’s facility manager can review WaterSense
at Work Section 6.3: Cooling Towers for more information on how to monitor and
optimize water efficiency in cooling towers.199
Some schools may use steam boilers in building heating systems. As water is converted
to steam, TDS increases. Similar to cooling towers, steam boilers require blow down to
control TDS and the addition of make-up water to replace water lost during blow down.
In addition, when steam is distributed, its heat is transferred to the ambient
environment, and it recondenses to water. From a water efficiency standpoint, schools
should consider capturing steam condensate and returning it to the boiler for reuse
since this will decrease the amount of make-up water needed and reduce the frequency
of blowdown. Steam boiler systems without condensate capture may need to add cold
water to the hot steam condensate before it can be discharged to the sewer system, so
steam condensate capture systems eliminate the need for this tempering water, as well.
For further information on how to optimize steam boiler water use, schools should
review WaterSense at Work Section 6.5 Boiler and Steam Systems.199
As schools work to electrify HVAC systems (following the best practices outlined in the
“Objective 1a. Decarbonize Buildings” section), some boilers and cooling towers may be
replaced with alternative heat pump technologies. Many of these all-electric alternatives
can significantly lower water demand by using closed-loop systems in the case of
GSHPs or by using refrigerants to transfer heat in place of water.
166
VI. Additional Details Related to Goal 1: Achieve Green Schools
(10) Optimize water efficiency of uncommon end uses, where applicable (pools,
laundries, laboratories)
Although not as ubiquitous as water use in restrooms and cafeterias, some schools may
have swimming pools; laundry equipment supporting athletics, family, and consumer
science classrooms, or daycares; and/or water-using laboratory equipment. Schools
should consider all end uses of water that may be present and estimate the total water
use of each end use when conducting a water assessment (as described in best
practice 3). Schools can then determine if these uncommon end uses are significant
and the extent to which they can optimize the efficiency of these end uses.
Where applicable, schools should consult appropriate sections in WaterSense at Work
for recommendations on O&M and user education, retrofit options, and replacement
options for uncommon end uses like swimming pools, laundries, and laboratories.199
Use Alternative Water Sources
Schools should also consider using onsite alternative water sources for some end uses,
where feasible as discussed below.
(11) Use onsite alternative water sources for irrigation, cooling towers, and toilet
and urinal flushing
Where potential water sources meet needs, schools should consider collecting and
reusing water on site. For example, existing schools with irrigation systems could
consider collecting and using rainwater for irrigation. Some treatment may be needed to
confirm the water is safe for landscape application, but water doesn’t need to be
potable-level quality for irrigation system use. In addition, existing schools with cooling
towers could consider collecting and reusing air handler condensate for cooling tower
make-up water. Air handler condensate is typically produced during hot, humid months
when cooling towers are operating closest to peak and need the most make-up water.
This is an example of an alternative water source that matches the need well.
It is likely not cost-effective for existing school buildings to be re-plumbed to use
graywater or rainwater for toilet and urinal flushing, but schools undergoing major
renovations or new schools could be designed to implement these systems. Newly
designed schools could consider water sources including graywater from lavatory sinks,
laundries, and showers; rainwater; and air handler condensate. Newly designed schools
should also consider reusing onsite alternative water for irrigation systems and cooling
towers as described previously.
For more information on collecting and using onsite alternative water sources, schools
should review WaterSense at Work Section 8.0: Onsite Alternative Water Sources and
the Federal Energy Management Program’s (FEMP’s) Alternative Water Sources web
page, which provides tools for determining the viability of rainwater harvesting and air
handler condensate capture.199,224

Objective 1c. Optimize Solid Waste Reduction and Diversion
Methods and Best Practices
This section offers a discussion of methods and best practices for optimizing solid waste
reduction and diversion in schools across two categories. First, this section summarizes
methods and best practices for reducing the generation of waste. These are important
practices, as they ultimately reduce the total volume of waste that schools need to
expend resources to properly manage. Next, this section summarizes methods and best
practices for effectively managing the solid waste that schools generate through routine
operations.
Reduce Solid Waste Generation
To reduce the generation of solid waste as part of routine operations, schools should
consider strategies for reducing cafeteria waste, educating staff and students to
transform habits, and implementing item exchange opportunities.
171
VI. Additional Details Related to Goal 1: Achieve Green Schools
(1) Reduce cafeteria waste
Across the nation, K–12 school cafeteria waste amounts to approximately 530,000 tons,
representing one of the largest waste streams coming out of K–12 schools.235 The
following practices can be adopted to minimize the amount of waste and money lost to
food waste and disposables in the cafeteria.
(1a) Practice offer versus serve
The concept of Offer versus Serve (OVS) allows students to decline select food items
offered by the National School Lunch Program and School Breakfast Program if they
choose not to eat these items. OVS is a mandatory practice for Massachusetts high
schools during lunch but is optional for elementary and middle schools in the
Commonwealth.236 Elementary schools that practice OVS waste significantly fewer
calories, fruits, and vegetables than schools that practice the “serve-only” model.237
While few studies have quantified the reduction of food waste in school cafeterias
associated with OVS, it is a commonly accepted best practice for food waste reduction.
According to the USDA, upwards of 81 percent of middle schools and elementary
schools practice OVS during lunch.238
Elementary and middle schools interested in implementing OVS to reduce food waste in
their cafeteria should see additional guidance from the USDA for implementing OVS for
the National School Lunch Program and School Breakfast Program.239
(1b) Serve grab-and-go meals
Grab-and-go style meals can allow students more time and flexibility to eat their food.240
This practice has increased in popularity under the School Breakfast Program in
particular—in 2014, only 7 percent of schools served grab-and-go meals, while in 2019,
this figure increased to 23 percent.241 Pre-packaged, grab-and-go style meals are
allowed to be served to all grade levels and ages.
(1c) Offer student-informed meal options
Students produce less food waste at school when they find the meals served more
palatable. Taste tests offer an opportunity to receive student feedback on meal
preferences and have been shown to reduce the amount of wasted food.242 Schools
should consider surveying and/or interviewing the student population to determine the
cultural backgrounds and dietary preferences of their students.243
(1d) Extend the lunch period
Many studies have shown that extending the lunch period decreases the amount of food
that students throw away.244–246 Students require a minimum of 20 minutes of sitting
time to eat and socialize. Students with longer lunch periods are more likely to consume
at least 10 percent more of their food.244 A minimum 30-minute lunch period is
recommended to allow students enough time to grab food, eat, socialize with peers, and
tidy up.
172
VI. Additional Details Related to Goal 1: Achieve Green Schools
(1e) Schedule recess before lunch
Scheduling recess before lunch in elementary schools can reduce food waste
generated by students.242 Taking recess before lunch results in students consuming a
greater variety of foods that they may not typically favor.242
(1f) Use reusable and washable trays and utensils
Schools can reduce waste by limiting their use of disposable trays and utensils.
New Bedford Public Schools Goes Green with Grant
In 2019, New Bedford Public Schools received a School Recycling Assistance Grant
through MassDEP’s Sustainable Materials Recovery Program to purchase and install
10 school dishwasher systems. The grant has enabled the school district to
completely eliminate Styrofoam trays (the district purchased 1,627,980 Styrofoam
trays in the 2018-2019 school year) and use paper trays when a disposable option is
needed. Despite the initial capital costs of dishwashers and the additional labor
needed to clean reusable trays, the recurring costs associated with disposable and
recyclable trays exceed those of reusable trays and utensils.
Source: MassDEP 247
If schools must use disposable trays and cutlery, compostable options are preferred to
divert waste from the landfill. Where possible, schools should strive to procure cutlery
that is not wrapped in plastic packets since these packets are typically not recyclable or
compostable.
(1g) Install and use milk dispensers as an alternative to milk cartons
The installation and use of milk dispensers can reduce milk waste by as much as 40
percent, increase cost savings, and decrease vulnerability to supply chain instability.248
Milk cartons are a major waste product from schools, with some waste audits estimating
that milk cartons represent upwards of 17 percent of a school district’s waste stream.248
In 2023, schools around the nation faced milk shortages due to carton supply chain
issues.249,250 In King County, Washington, school districts that switched from milk
cartons to milk dispensers realized (1) a reduction in milk waste, (2) increased cost
savings resulting from reduced garbage and recycling collection costs, and (3) lower
supply costs due to reduced milk waste and the phaseout of purchased milk cartons.251
K–12 schools are widely adopting milk dispensers, and they are already widely
implemented in college cafeterias.
(1h) Install and use water bottle fillers
Water bottle fillers are widely implemented across educational buildings to reduce
plastic waste. Many students and staff carry and customize reusable water bottles.
While studies at the K–12 level are limited, one mid-sized university reported that the
173
VI. Additional Details Related to Goal 1: Achieve Green Schools
implementation of water bottle fillers reduced their annual use of disposable single-use
plastic water bottles by approximately 400,000.252
(1i) Establish and use food share tables
Based on federal guidance from USDA,253 DESE encourages and outlines guidance for
the use of food share tables in schools in its Massachusetts School Meal Programs
Share Table Guidance. Students use share tables to exchange whole and
uncontaminated food items (e.g., whole fruit, chip bags). Schools can elect to manage
these tables in different ways: (1) food can be exchanged with no costs, (2) students
can be reimbursed for later meals, or (3) food can be donated to local institutions.253
Share tables must be in compliance with federal food safety regulations [7 CFR 210.13,

Section 64:
220.7, 226.20, and 225.16(a)] and the local School Food Authority’s food safety plan.
Schools should contact and obtain written approval from their respective local board of
health prior to establishing and using share tables.
(2) Educate staff and students to transform habits
Waste education is essential to encourage the adoption of new waste-reducing
infrastructure and practices and to increase awareness of the consequences of waste.
Schools can educate their staff and students on why waste matters (e.g., circular
economy, systems-thinking), how they can reduce the amount of waste they produce,
and how to properly sort their waste. Education should take place both in and out of the
classroom. Waste audits combined with field trips to waste processing facilities help
schools better understand their waste stream and are effective hands-on learning
experiences for students to learn the life cycle of waste. In Massachusetts, MassDEP’s
Green Team offers many waste lesson plans for teachers and awareness campaign
materials for administrators.
Implementing sustainable infrastructure often requires participants to disrupt their
current habits and adopt new ones. For example, a student may normally throw their
entire lunch tray into one trash bin. That student may find it inconvenient to adopt a
school’s transition to sustainable practices, which could require them to scrape food off
their reusable tray, recycle a fruit cup, and then place the tray in a designated location.
Interventions can be used to discourage old habits, and actions that encourage
repetition can reinforce the formation of new habits. Life changes make people more
likely to break their old habits; as such, when a student starts a new grade or begins at
a new school, they are especially able to accept new sustainable behaviors.254
Penalties for bad behavior (e.g., throwing trash in recycling) can be effective in
moderation but can often result in defensiveness and no behavioral changes.255 New
habits can be encouraged by making it easy to adopt them, using reminder prompts,
providing feedback, and creating incentives.254
(3) Institute item exchange opportunities
Schools can use item exchange opportunities to recirculate items in good condition that
are often discarded and replaced (e.g., backpacks, pencil boxes, and folders). Large
174
VI. Additional Details Related to Goal 1: Achieve Green Schools
events, such as school-sponsored yard sales or end-of-year exchanges, are effective at
diverting large amounts of waste, but may require substantial effort to organize. Schools
can supplement these large events with smaller, passive, easier-to-implement solutions,
such as swap tables or “good-on-one-side” paper swap boxes. Schools may also
choose to partner with faith-based organizations, thrift stores, food pantries, or donation
centers to transfer school-community resources into the broader community. Item
exchange opportunities have the co-benefit of supporting students from lower-resourced
backgrounds in obtaining essential school items.
Effectively Manage Generated Solid Waste
To effectively manage generated solid waste, schools should consider establishing an
effective electronic waste (“e-waste”) recycling program, designating staff and students
to manage and implement the school’s waste program, maximizing the collection of
divertible solid waste, optimizing collection bin location and labeling, processing organic
waste onsite, composting or leaving lawn clippings in place, and using smart waste
monitoring technology.
(4) Establish an electronic waste recycling plan for electronic learning tools
Prompted by the COVID-19 pandemic, many school districts have adopted electronic
learning tools (e.g., laptops and tablets) to facilitate remote learning and enhance in-
school instruction. According to some surveys, 90 percent of middle and high schools
and 84 percent of elementary schools provide electronic devices to their students.256
While this transition has contributed to a reduction of paper waste, the increased
prevalence of electronic learning tools has resulted in greater quantities of e-waste. If
not responsibly recycled (e.g., through a certified electronics recycling vendor), e-waste
can end up in the landfill or shipped to another country for unregulated, informal e-waste
recycling that often presents numerous human health risks, including increased lead
exposure for children.257 Typical K–12 laptops last an average of four years without
repairs, and the cost of simple repairs can often be equivalent to approximately half the
price of a new replacement laptop.256 School districts providing personal devices to
students should develop and routinely update an e-waste recycling plan that details the
district’s protocols for repair and sustainable, responsible disposal to maximize
diversion from landfills. In addition to reducing the amount of e-waste sent to landfills,
the effective and responsible management of e-waste also reduces the harmful
exposures that communities practicing informal e-waste recycling may face.257
(5) Designate staff members and students to implement and manage waste
programs
Improving waste management programs often requires redistributing responsibilities
across existing roles or hiring new staff to support the increased level of effort. In
schools, these responsibilities are often voluntarily assumed by students rather than
paid staff, leading to long-term staffing instability. To avoid this, schools can hold
conversations proactively, and include important stakeholders such as the custodial
union, cafeteria staff, and grounds workers.
175

management program. Student engagement
should be encouraged. It is recommended that To ensure school maintenance staff

recycling, compost, and e-waste) be managed for their participation in the school
professionally, but smaller waste programs waste management program,
(e.g., TerraCycle®) can be run effectively by schools should formally document
student volunteers. roles and responsibilities in all job
duty descriptions.
(6) Collect divertible waste
The first step to diverting waste from the landfill is to collect it separately from waste
intended for the landfill. Schools can collect recycling (paper, corrugated cardboard,
glass, plastics, and metals), compost (organics), and e-waste to meet zero-waste facility
and operations standards set by LEED v4.258 This standard also outlines how divertible
waste should also be collected during the construction of a new facility.258 Schools
registered as Green Team members through MassDEP can submit an application form
to receive single-stream recycling and composting equipment to collect these items.
(7) Optimize bin location and labeling
The thoughtful location and consistent labeling of bins can influence how students and
staff sort and dispose of various waste streams. To maximize the diversion of material
from the landfill, schools should locate bins as close as possible to the point of waste
generation. For example, schools implementing a compost collection program should
place compost bins in close proximity to food preparation (i.e., the kitchen) and
consumption (cafeteria). Where possible, the selection of bin color and labeling should
intuitively reflect the waste stream being collected. To avoid confusion and reduce
contamination, schools should implement a consistent approach to bin color and
labeling across all bins to the maximum extent possible. Table 49 provides an example
of effective bin color and labeling selections.

(8) Process organic waste on site
Some schools may be capable of processing organic waste on site. Onsite organics
waste processing can decrease hauling costs by reducing pickup frequency or
eliminating the need for organic waste haulers. Advanced technological options (e.g.,
176
VI. Additional Details Related to Goal 1: Achieve Green Schools
dehydrators, pulpers, and anaerobic digestors) have high up-front capital costs and
some ongoing operational costs. These machines suit facilities with sufficient outdoor
area for composting or limited hauler access and would likely be inefficient for most
schools; however, smaller-scale composting is appropriate in most schools. Schools
with agricultural or environmental programs may especially benefit from composting on
site with organic waste from the cafeteria, lawns or landscaping, livestock, agricultural
plots, or classrooms. The remaining compost should be hauled off-site for processing.
Schools that implement onsite composting must notify MassDEP.
(9) Leave lawn clippings in place or compost
Lawn clippings are often bagged and sent to the landfill, adding to a school’s total waste
stream. If it does not interfere with the purpose of the lawn, short clippings (~1 inch)
should be left in place to decompose after mowing to reduce nitrogen fertilizer
requirements (by as much as 75 percent) and increase soil organic matter content.259,260
Longer clippings could smother the grass and instead should be collected and
composted on-site or sent for off-site composting.
(10) Use smart waste monitoring technology
Smart waste monitoring technologies are used to provide real-time insights into waste
generation, composition, and collection. They are relatively inexpensive and can be
used to track a bin’s location and, when it is nearing capacity, allow for optimized
collection schedules that can reduce hauling fees. Schools can also leverage the data
collected from bin sensors to better understand their waste stream.

Objective 1d. Electrify School Bus Fleets
Methods and Best Practices
This section offers a discussion of methods and best practices for electrifying school
bus fleets related to planning, acquisition, and operations. Each of these methods and
best practices are described in more detail below.
Planning Considerations
When planning the electrification of a fleet of school buses, schools should consider
engaging with electric utility providers, utilizing microgrids for charging, and exploring
V2G and/or V2L technology. These three best practices are discussed in more detail
below.
(1) Engage electrical utility provider early and often
A school district’s successful deployment of ESBs requires careful planning and
coordination with the district’s electrical utility provider. ESBs have a larger battery than
light-duty electric vehicles. Therefore, the vehicles will draw larger amounts of electricity
from the grid when charging. Consistent communication with the electric utility provider
will assist with the timely completion of ESB projects by identifying and addressing
potential issues (e.g., necessary infrastructure upgrades) early in the electrification
process. Additionally, some electrical utilities may offer funding or technical assistance
to fleets that are in the process of converting their vehicles to electric.
(2) Utilize microgrids for charging
A microgrid usually uses a local power generation unit and an energy storage system
such as a battery to create an isolated electrical network. Microgrids can help
simultaneously reduce charging costs and improve operational resiliency. Districts that
operate their own fleets often choose to utilize on-site power generation units such as
solar PV panels/canopies to charge their vehicles. This improves the environmental
benefit of the vehicle by ensuring that it is powered (at least partially) by clean energy.
Power from solar panels also offers a charging option for ESBs, even during periods of
local electrical grid outages.
182
VI. Additional Details Related to Goal 1: Achieve Green Schools
(3) Explore V2G and/or V2L technology
V2G and V2L are areas of growing interest for ESB owners. Districts that procure both
V2G-/V2L-capable vehicles and chargers can essentially turn their ESBs into “batteries
on wheels.” This process involves a bus sending power back to either a load that
requires power (e.g., a school building) or to

Cajon Valley School District in California.
Electric School Bus Acquisition
When acquiring ESBs, schools should consider leveraging available funding, working
with a local vehicle dealer, and purchasing vehicle warranties. These three best
practices are discussed in more detail below.
(4) Leverage available funding programs
There are currently numerous federal-, local-, and utility-level funding programs
available to school districts interested in purchasing ESBs. Historically, EPA programs
such as the Clean School Bus (CSB) Program, the Diesel Emission Reduction Act
(DERA), and the Clean Heavy Duty Vehicle (CHDV) Program have funded the
replacement of ICE school buses with electric alternatives. Additionally, in 2022, the
Inflation Reduction Act made tax-exempt entities eligible for certain tax credits. Of note,
the Commercial Clean Vehicle Credit (Section 45W) provides up to $40,000 for certain
eligible vehicles weighing over 14,000 lbs. At the state level, MassCEC has provided
funding and technical assistance to districts through its ACT Program. The
Commonwealth has also encouraged EV adoption through its MOR-EV Program, which
provides rebates for a number of electric vehicles, including ESBs. Finally, it is also
crucial to determine if the local electrical utility provides financial assistance. Common
utility funding programs include time-of-use rates or make-ready programs. Time-of-use
rates incentivize the charging of electric vehicles at times when electricity demand is low
183
VI. Additional Details Related to Goal 1: Achieve Green Schools
through decreased billing rates. Make-ready funding subsidizes or entirely covers the
cost of preparing a charging site to handle the increased demand of school bus
charging. The Alternative Fuels Data Center’s Laws and Incentives Tool is a great way
to determine what local programs are available to fund an ESB deployment.
(5) Work with a local vehicle dealer
Many districts have found it beneficial to work with a vehicle dealer who has a local
presence, whether it be a dealership or service network. If a school district requires
significant repairs for an ESB, working with a local dealer can help districts avoid
incurring the cost and headache associated with shipping a bus out of state for repairs.
(6) Purchase vehicle warranties
While it is true that ESBs have comparatively fewer mechanical issues, in large part
because of the fewer moving pieces, when an ESB component does break, it can be
expensive to replace. This is partly due to the materials used to manufacture EV parts
and the complexity of the parts.264 Furthermore, the high-voltage systems in an EV can
make repairs more complicated as personnel must be properly trained and equipped to
work with high-voltage parts. For this reason, some districts chose to purchase an
extended warranty or a service contract on their vehicle.
Electric School Bus Operations
To optimize and maximize the safety of ESB operations, schools should consider
deploying telematics and implement operator training. Both of these best practices are
discussed in more detail below.
(7) Deploy telematics
A great way to track the performance of electric school buses is to utilize telematics.
While some manufacturers build telematics devices into their vehicles, there are also
third-party telematics devices that can be easily installed in any vehicle. Usually, third-
party telematics devices are connected to the vehicles through the onboard diagnostics-
II port. This allows the device to collect a variety of data. Most devices can measure the
speed of the vehicle, the time it takes to complete a route, the vehicle’s idling time,
internal temperatures, state of charge, and GPS location of the vehicle. The major
benefits of telematics include monitoring the vehicle’s battery life, aiding drivers and
vehicle monitor timecards, and quickly locating vehicles that have been in an accident
or have run out of battery. Many districts have also found telematics useful in
quantifying the environmental and financial impact of their ESBs. Some funding
programs, such as New Jersey’s Electric School Bus Program, require that telematics
be installed in ESBs purchased with awards.
184
VI. Additional Details Related to Goal 1: Achieve Green Schools
(8) Implement operator training
Crucial to the success of an ESB deployment is ensuring that drivers are trained on the
unique features of an electric vehicle. One of the most important skills for drivers to
learn is how to effectively use regenerative braking. Regenerative braking occurs when
an electric vehicle’s motor reverses while decelerating. As the motor reverses, energy is
captured and sent back to the battery, effectively extending the vehicle’s range. These
courses often also teach basic skills, such as how to plug a vehicle in and perform
simple troubleshooting. Operator training is often offered by the vehicle’s OEM or
dealer. Alternatively, many third-party, non-profit, and for-profit organizations offer driver
training courses and resources.
Statutes, Regulations, and Standards
Statutes, regulations, and standards that include a focus on school bus electrification
are detailed below.
Relevant Statutes
M.G.L. c. 30B and c. 30, § 39M concerns the procurement of electric vehicles and their
charging infrastructure in Massachusetts. Under current Commonwealth law, the
procurement of school buses falls under the jurisdiction of M.G.L. c. 30B.265 Conversely,
the procurement of charging infrastructure is considered a construction project under
M.G.L. c. 30, § 39M.265 This means that districts looking to procure ESBs must have
separate procurement processes for both the vehicles and the associated equipment.
Massachusetts does offer a state contract, but this contract currently has only one bus
vendor under contract.265
M.G.L. Part 1, Title XIV, c. 90, §7B determines the necessary features for a legal
school bus in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. The comprehensive list of
requirements includes everything from the necessary physical features such as the
word “School Bus” being painted on the vehicle to driver and operation requirements.221
Relevant Regulations
310-7.40 CMR adopts California’s vehicle emissions standards and compliance
requirements under the Massachusetts Low Emission Vehicle Standard. All new
passenger cars, light-duty trucks, medium- and heavy-duty vehicles and engines sold
and registered in Massachusetts must meet these requirements.266 Additionally, by
2035 all new passenger vehicles sold in Massachusetts must be zero-emission
vehicles.266
Relevant Standards and Other Requirements
Additional Funding for ADA-Compliant Buses: Some federal programs will provide
additional funding to school districts that procure ESBs compliant with the Americans
with Disabilities Act (ADA). For example, the CSB and CHDV funding programs each
offer an additional $20,000 for ESBs that are ADA-compliant.
185
VI. Additional Details Related to Goal 1: Achieve Green Schools
Leasing Exclusions for ESBs: The most popular school bus funding programs such
as EPA’s CSB Program, CHDV Program, DERA Program, and the Internal Revenue
Service’s (IRS’s) Section 45W Tax Credit, do not allow applicants to lease electric
school buses. All vehicles procured or reimbursed with funding from these programs
must be purchased.
Qualified Manufacturers for Certain Funding Programs concerns the qualified
vehicle manufacturers under Internal Revenue Code 30D(d)(1)(C). This is particularly
relevant for those interested in receiving tax credits under IRS Section 45W. It is
important to note that while this standard also applies to IRS Section 30D, school buses
and school districts do not qualify for the 30D credit. The IRS provides an index of
qualified manufacturers for clean vehicle credits.
Scrapping Requirement for ESB Programs: Most federal programs (including the
CSB Program, the CHDV Program, and the DERA Program) and many local programs
that fund the replacement of existing ICE school buses with ESBs include scrapping
requirements. These requirements involve some variation of cutting the frame rails and
drilling a hole in the engine block of the ICE vehicle to be replaced.

Objective 1e. Provide Electric Vehicle Charging Stations for School
Staff and Public Use
Methods and Best Practices
This section offers a discussion of methods and best practices for providing EV
charging stations for school staff and public use related to planning, acquisition, and
operations. Each of these methods and best practices are described in more detail
below.
Planning Considerations
When planning the electrification of a fleet of school buses, schools should consider
engaging with electric utility providers, confirming the onboard charger capacity of fleet
vehicles, determining the charger rating needs of vehicles, exploring V2G and V2L
technology, utilizing networked and managed charging, evaluating parking locations of
EVs, and exploring potential liability concerns. These best practices are discussed in
more detail below.
(1) Engage with the utility provider early and often
The electric utility provider is a key stakeholder in the EVSE installation process. It is
best practice to reach out to a potential site’s utility provider before beginning the
installation of the EV chargers. Communication with the electrical utility throughout the
project period can increase the likelihood that permitting, construction, and
commissioning deadlines are met. The utility provider should also be able to provide
information on necessary site upgrades and whether or not there are any incentive
programs offered by the utility.
(2) Confirm the onboard charger capacity of fleet vehicles
If an EV charger is being purchased to serve a particular vehicle or fleet, be sure that
the vehicle’s onboard chargers can accept the energy output of the charger. If the
187
VI. Additional Details Related to Goal 1: Achieve Green Schools
output of the charger is greater than the capacity of the onboard charger, it is possible
that the vehicle could encounter charging issues. The vehicle and charger OEMs may
be able to confirm compatibility.
(3) Determine the charger rating needs of vehicles
After deciding what vehicles will be using the EVSE, determine how much charging time
the vehicles will need. It is important to match the charger power rating to the vehicle
battery and vehicle downtime. In other words, do not default to DC fast chargers
because they are faster if level 2 or even level 1 chargers can meet the charging needs.
This is because higher-level chargers, especially DC fast chargers, are more expensive
to procure, operate, and maintain than lower-level chargers.
(4) Explore V2G and/or V2L technology
Consider whether your district will ever want to utilize V2G or V2L. V2G is the process
of hooking up an electric vehicle’s battery to the electrical grid, presumably in an
emergency scenario or when the grid cannot meet its demand. Some utility providers
may pay for energy dispensed to the grid. Similarly, V2L involves connecting an EV
battery to a load, such as a district building, and sending energy from the battery to the
load.
(5) Utilize networked and managed charging
Networked chargers are EVSE that can connect (wirelessly or through a wired
connection) to the internet. Networked chargers usually provide several unique benefits,
such as the ability to collect charger data, see when a charger is down and what the
issue is, schedule charging sessions, and easily contact the manufacturer. Included in
the benefits of a networked charger is managed charging, which allows operators to
schedule stop and end times for charging sessions without staff having to be on site to
plug in and unplug the vehicle. Many use this feature to schedule charging sessions
when electricity is comparatively cheaper, usually at night or in the early morning.
Networked chargers require the purchase of an additional subscription.
(6) Evaluate parking locations of EVs
Place the charger in a location accessible to different vehicles without interrupting the
flow of traffic. If the main use of the EVSE is to charge EVs owned by school staff
members and the general public, be sure that parking spots in which EVSE is installed
can comfortably fit a variety of light-duty vehicles. If the charger will mainly serve ESBs,
situate the charger in a location that buses can easily access. Make a note of where the
charge port is on the vehicle and place the charger in a location where the charging
cable can reach the port.
(7) Explore potential liability concerns
Some EV charger owners mandate that any vehicle using their equipment does so at
their own risk and is liable for any issues that may arise from connecting to the charger.
188
VI. Additional Details Related to Goal 1: Achieve Green Schools
This is particularly common with chargers that are made accessible at the workplace for
staff members’ personal vehicles. Districts should consider how to reduce their liability
as charger owners.
EVSE Acquisition and Installation
When acquiring EVSE, schools should consider leveraging available funding, planning
for long lead times, deploying charger retractors, and purchasing charger warranties.
These best practices are discussed in more detail below.
(8) Leverage available funding programs
Take advantage of existing funding programs. Many funding opportunities for electric
vehicles account for EVSE costs such as EPA’s Clean School Bus Program and the
Clean Heavy Duty Vehicle Program. Additionally, there are many EVSE-specific funding
programs on the federal level such as the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI)
Formula Program and the Charging and Fueling Infrastructure (CFI) Grant Program.
Locally, Massachusetts offers several EVSE incentive programs through the
Massachusetts Electric Vehicle Incentive Program (MassEVIP). Look into these
programs early in the EVSE exploration process to verify that any district project can
meet these program’s requirements. Finally, many electrical utility providers offer EVSE
financing programs such as reduced electricity rates for EV charging and make-ready
funding (funding devoted to upgrading site equipment and getting it ready to handle EV
charging).
(9) Plan for long lead times
Lead times for EV chargers and their associated equipment can be unpredictable.
Some Massachusetts-based projects have seen lead times for crucial equipment take
six months.267 This is why it is important to reach out to manufacturers early in the
process and prepare for components to take a while to be delivered.
(10) Deploy charger retractors
As previously mentioned, it is important to replace a charger cord at the end of the
charging session. Failing to do so may lead to a vehicle unknowingly running over the
charger’s cord or head. This, in turn, can damage the charger and potentially put it out
of service. To address this issue, many EVSE owners opt for cord retractors, which
automatically pull the cord and head back to the charger body after it has been
unplugged from a vehicle.
(11) Purchase charger warranties
EV chargers can be, at times, expensive or burdensome to repair. Warranties can help
alleviate some of the cost. Districts should consider warranties with a high percentage
uptime guarantee. An uptime guarantee is when the manufacturer guarantees that a
charger will be operational a certain percentage of the time. While charger warranties
vary by charger and warranty type, estimates suggest that an extended warranty for a
189
VI. Additional Details Related to Goal 1: Achieve Green Schools
DC fast charger can be over $800 a year.268 It is important that after a warranty is
purchased, proper documentation is kept to confirm all warranty requirements are met
so that the manufacturer honors the warranty.
Operations and Maintenance
To optimize EV charging operations, schools should consider developing a
maintenance plan and creating expectations for charger use etiquette. Both of these
best practices are discussed in more detail below.
(12) Develop a maintenance plan
Before purchasing a charger, verify that the OEM or an associated entity can provide
service to it locally. There are limits to what an OEM can do to troubleshoot a charger
over the phone or over the internet. If the charger OEM cannot provide service, it is
important to explore other maintenance options, such as local electricians who have
been certified to work on EVSE. It is crucial to develop a maintenance plan since having
access to an in-person technician can significantly reduce the downtime of a broken
charger.
(13) Create expectations for charger use etiquette
If charger usage is granted to district staff and the public, it will be important to create
expectations for its usage. This includes replacing the charger cord at the end of a
charging session and not occupying the charger beyond the time it takes to charge a
vehicle. Creating these expectations will help keep the charger cord from being
damaged and allow for more people to access the charger. Additionally, many charger
operators choose to limit charger availability to certain times of the day. This allows the
district to avoid charger usage during times of high electrical demand.
Statutes, Regulations, and Standards
Statutes, regulations, and standards that include a focus on EVSE are detailed below.
Relevant Statutes
Act of 2021, Chapter 8, Section 49, 2021 requires that all EV charging stations meet
certain energy efficiency requirements that are set by DOER.225
M.G.L. c. 25A, Section 16B-16E determines that the owners and operators of public
EV charging stations that require payment must allow for publicly accessible payment
options.269 This means that the charger cannot require a subscription fee or a
membership. Information on the charger (including the location, payment methods,
hours of access, etc.) must be shared with the DOE’s Alternative Fuels Data Center.
Build America Buy America (BABA) Act governs certain purchases made with
federal funding. Enacted in 2021, the BABA Act requires that federally funded
infrastructure projects use domestically produced iron, steel, manufactured products,
190
VI. Additional Details Related to Goal 1: Achieve Green Schools
and construction materials.270 Previously, EPA had issued a waiver for EV chargers that
were assembled in the United States.119 On July 1, 2024, however, this waiver expired,
and EV chargers are once again subject to BABA Act requirements.
Relevant Standards and Other Requirements
Data Collection Requirements: Some EVSE funding programs include requirements
for the recipient to collect and report data. When applying to an EVSE funding program,
schools should verify if the program requires the charger to collect and submit data. For
example, the Department of Transportation’s NEVI Formula Program lists the collection
of data from a national network of chargers as a primary program objective.271 Chargers
will need to be networked to collect data. Districts should be informed of the additional
costs and benefits of networked chargers.
The EVITP established a 20-hour training program provided exclusively to certified
electricians.272 This training program has become an industry standard with many
federal and state funding programs. For example, the NEVI Formula Program requires
that all electricians who work on program-funded projects be certified under EVITP.273
MassEVIP Availability Requirements: EVSE installed using funding from MassEVIP
must be publicly available for at least 12 hours a day.274 There are similar requirements
for the federal CFI Grant Program, which mandates that all chargers must be publicly
accessible. This is notable for districts who want to access EVSE funding but do not
want to make charger use available to the general public.
Open Charge Point Protocol (OCPP): This protocol is growing in popularity and
governs “networked” chargers. EV chargers that are considered networked can connect
to the internet and other chargers on the same network. Typically, these chargers can
share information that non-networked chargers cannot track, such as error codes and
usage data. A networked charger will usually require a subscription to a charger
network provider. OCPP-compliant chargers allow charger owners to easily change
charging network providers without having to replace the equipment itself.275 Prominent
federal and state funding programs such as the NEVI Formula Program and CFI Grant
Program require EVSE funded through their programs to be OCPP-compliant.276,277

(1) Conduct vulnerability assessments
Vulnerability assessments determine the exposure, vulnerability, and consequence of
climate hazards to a school district’s students, workforce, and assets, as well as the
utilities, infrastructure, and services upon which the school district relies to successfully
execute its mission. A school district should begin an assessment by organizing a team
of key partners and establishing the assessment goals, timeframe, and scope of the
hazards and school district operations it intends to analyze. After scoping the hazards
analysis, the school district should perform community and stakeholder outreach to
confirm that hazards appropriately reflect the concerns of the community. Once the
scope is established, a school district should identify existing local hazard mitigation
plans and data sources for the existing condition of assets, geospatial data, climate
hazard data, health data (e.g., asthma and heat stress), school district capabilities and
capacity, and any existing adaptation and risk reduction strategies. This data can be
applied to the site and asset level using a combination of surveys of key site staff and
site visits. There can be overlap with other assessment activities, such as FCAs, which
are also concerned with asset existing conditions, maintenance and replacement
schedules, past hazard events and associated damage, disruption, and loss.
The collected data is combined to score assets based on their hazard exposure,
sensitivity, vulnerability, and consequence. The final step of the vulnerability
assessment is to develop actions, adaptation, and hazard mitigation strategies to
reduce vulnerabilities. Additional details on the planning process are offered by the MVP
Program.
(2) Prepare a comprehensive climate action plan
A comprehensive climate action plan (CAP) uses the results of the vulnerability
assessment to establish an integrated strategic plan for the implementation of identified
strategies. At this stage, a district should:
• Prioritize strategies to address the most critical vulnerabilities to human health
and infrastructure resulting from the earliest hazard exposures and those that
have the highest consequence from a potential disruption.
• Summarize the high priority and high consequence assets for each school.
• Revise strategies to incorporate key issues such as equity and environmental
justice, feasibility, and economic benefits.
• Identify overlapping or integrated vulnerabilities and adaptation strategies
across schools. For example, multiple schools may be served by the same local
electricity distribution network that has proven to be unreliable in past hazard
events and would benefit from district coordination with the electric transmission
and distribution utility. This is the stage at which strategies should be
incorporated into existing capital planning processes.
193
VI. Additional Details Related to Goal 1: Achieve Green Schools
• Document key progress indicators, status, progress made, roles and
responsibilities for seeing it to completion, working timeline for completion, and
potential funding sources for each strategy.
• Develop and share resources, technical support, curriculum, and other guidance
to aid individual schools in implementation.
(3) Incorporate resilience into new construction and modernization projects
Districts should include resilience strategies and goals identified during the vulnerability
assessment in project requirements and other relevant procurement documents. For
projects that occur prior to a vulnerability assessment taking place, there are a number
of building code requirements and best practices included in other standards used by
schools that address resilient design. For example, the ResilientMass Climate
Resilience Design Standards Tool allows users to input project information to generate
recommended standards.278 Additionally, NE-CHPS awards points to projects that
conduct a vulnerability assessment, incorporate all feasible adaptation measures for top
hazards and include passive survivability in the design.183 For new construction, site
selection offers a significant opportunity to mitigate vulnerabilities, whereas hardening of
existing infrastructure may be necessary for modernization projects.
Many building decarbonization best practices also offer resilience benefits, including a
well-insulated and airtight building envelope; HVAC systems that provide sufficient
cooling, ventilation, and filtration; natural ventilation via operable windows; and
daylighting. In particular, investing in a high-performance envelope can support passive
survivability, where the building can maintain a habitable indoor environment without
active systems during disruptions to utilities or HVAC systems.279
(4) Implement retrofit projects targeting resilience
Some discrete resilience strategies that apply to new construction and modernizations
can be implemented as individual retrofits or a phased series of retrofits. Specific types
of retrofits that address Massachusetts’ highest consequence hazards (extreme
temperatures, flooding, hurricanes, severe winter storms, and tsunamis) include
installing central air conditioning and increased cooling capacity, wind-resistant roofs
and windows, and green infrastructure for flood mitigation and shading. Districts should
work with project teams to identify HVAC and envelope retrofits that achieve health co-
benefits from improvements to indoor air quality.
Backup power generation to cover critical building services is one of the most commonly
considered resilience projects. While backup power has traditionally been provided by
diesel and natural gas generators, there are increasing options for non-GHG emitting
backup power in the form of onsite solar PV, BESS, and even V2L-enabled electric
school buses (see Objective 1a. Install and Use Onsite Renewable Energy Systems
and Objective 1d. Electrify School Bus Fleets for additional details). It is important to
note there are specific electrical infrastructure and permitting requirements to allow
schools to safely “island” themselves from the electrical grid in the event of an outage.
194
VI. Additional Details Related to Goal 1: Achieve Green Schools
BESS and other forms of energy storage also support Massachusetts’ Energy Storage
Initiative goas and targets.
(5) Perform resilient O&M
Knowledgeable O&M staff are critical to school operations and increasingly important in
the event of a disruption. A strong preventive maintenance program can decrease the
risk of system failures due to a hazard event. Emergency preparedness plans can
establish procedures for response to hazard events and prepare staff to execute plans.
This can range from O&M staff being knowledgeable about transferring from grid-
supplied electricity to backup power systems to district staff expanding community
support services at a school following a hazard event. Establishing mutual aid
agreements with other government and community organizations can provide a
framework for a coordinated response to hazard events.
Statutes, Regulations, and Standards
Statutes, regulations, and standards that include a focus on climate resilience are
detailed below.
Relevant Regulations
Massachusetts State Building Code (MSBC) 780 CMR is a statewide mandated
construction code that “includes most of the federal construction requirements listed in
the U.S. Code of Federal Regulations Title 44, Section 60.3 for floodplains as defined

VII. Additional Details Related to Goal 2: Achieve Healthy Schools
Objective 2a. Improve Air Quality
2a(1) Reduce Airborne Transmission of Disease
Methods and Best Practices
The first category of recommendations are practices that schools can use in their daily
operations to reduce the airborne transmission of disease. The second category is
steps for when an individual is sick or when rates of disease are high in a school
community.
In Everyday Operations
These recommendations are steps that schools can take in their everyday operations to
reduce the airborne transmission of diseases. Schools may want to increase these
practices during winter months when respiratory virus transmission is typically highest.
(1) Increase ventilation to bring more outdoor air to indoor spaces
Improving indoor air quality can reduce the concentration of pathogens and, therefore,
reduce airborne transmission of diseases.280,281 One major way to improve air quality for
this purpose is to bring more outdoor air indoors, which dilutes the concentration of
pathogens released by anyone who may be sick. HVAC systems should meet the
minimum outdoor air ventilation requirements in accordance with design codes and
consider enhancements to ventilation systems when remodeling or planning new
construction.280,281 HVAC systems that mix outdoor air with recirculated indoor air
should be set to maximize outdoor air, within manufacturer’s recommendations, during
periods of high disease transmission.281 Note that in conditions of high humidity when
the HVAC system is providing chilled air, there are more opportunities for condensation
and mold growth if the system and building are not designed to accommodate 100
percent fresh air. In these conditions, check for condensation more frequently to avoid
mold growth.
Opening windows can help bring more outdoor air to indoor spaces without mechanical
ventilation, such as rooms with low airflow, schools without ventilation systems, or
school buses.280,281 This is a short-term solution when mechanical ventilation systems
are not available and is not an energy efficient solution to outdated building heating
systems. Even cracking a few windows open is better than keeping all shut.280 Using
fans to draw in outdoor air can help increase the effectiveness of open windows.280,281
However, opening windows may not always be possible on very hot summer days, very
cold winter days, days when outdoor air pollution is high, or in areas with outdoor safety
concerns.281 Schools should keep windows closed during periods of elevated relative
humidity (>60 percent) and when air conditioning is operating so as to prevent
condensation and mold growth. See the Reduce Exposure to Mold and Moisture section
for additional details about the use of sensor technology to monitor indoor relative
humidity and other air quality parameters.
199
VII. Additional Details Related to Goal 2: Achieve Healthy Schools
(2) Filter indoor air
For buildings with ventilation systems that recirculate air, schools should increase the
level of their air filter to MERV 13 or higher, if appropriate for the system.281 In addition,
whoever manages the air filtration system should check that the filters are installed
correctly and fit well, check that sufficient airflow is maintained across the filter, and
maintain and change filters based on the manufacturer’s recommendation.281 For
spaces with low ventilation or to supplement ventilation, schools can filter the air with
portable air cleaners with high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters.280,281 When
selecting a portable air cleaner with a HEPA filter, school staff should consider the size
of the room, the clean air delivery rate of the unit, the airflow pattern of the room, the
distribution of people in the room, and decibel or sound rating of the device.281
(3) Move large gatherings to outdoor spaces
Holding large gatherings of students and staff outdoors can greatly reduce the risk of
airborne disease transmission.280 This may include assemblies, lunch, certain classes
(e.g., physical education, music, theater), and recess or social periods.280,281 New
construction can include shaded outdoor green space to accommodate outdoor
gatherings in warmer weather in accordance with climate model projections indicating
warmer temperatures and more frequent heat waves in Massachusetts throughout the
21st century in Massachusetts.22
(4) Teach and reinforce respiratory etiquette
Schools should teach and reinforce respiratory etiquette to reduce the amount of
airborne pathogens expelled by individuals who may be sick.280 CDC recommends
covering the mouth and nose with a tissue when coughing or sneezing, throwing the
used tissue in the trash, and then washing hands. If a tissue is not available, coughing
or sneezing into the elbow is better than into the hands. Teachers should provide
tissues in easily accessible areas around the classroom.280 Encourage students and
staff to wash hands frequently, especially after coughing, sneezing, or blowing their
nose. Good hygiene practices, such as hand-washing, help to prevent the spread of
illness as well as ingestion of contaminants like PCBs or lead that may end up on hands
(see best practice (10) Teach and reinforce good hand-washing etiquette, particularly
before eating and drinking in the Reduce Exposure to Polychlorinated Biphenyls [PCBs]

Section 68:
section).
During Times of Illness
The last two recommendations here apply during times of illness, whether for a sick
individual or for a school community at large.
(5) Encourage students and staff to stay home when sick
When students or staff members are sick, school administrators should encourage them
to stay home while they are contagious.281 105 CMR 300.00 provides minimum periods
200
VII. Additional Details Related to Goal 2: Achieve Healthy Schools
of isolation, which includes staying home from school, for some illnesses transmissible
through air, such as measles and pertussis.282
(6) Take additional steps to minimize transmission during times of elevated rates
of illness
During periods of increased illness in a school, as indicated by high rates of
absenteeism, or during an epidemic, pandemic, or public health emergency, the CDC or
the DPH may recommend additional steps to reduce airborne transmission of disease in
schools.283 These could include wearing masks or respiratory protection, physically
distancing students and staff within classrooms, and grouping students in cohorts to
minimize the spread of disease throughout the community, monitoring for signs and
symptoms of illness, testing if available, and creating spaces where sick students can
isolate while waiting to leave school.283 Other strategies to reduce airborne transmission
of disease in schools may include staggering arrival/dismissal times, transition times,
and lunch times; holding staff or parent-teacher meetings via videoconferencing; and
providing additional protections for people at higher risk of severe disease.281
Statutes, Regulations, and Standards
Statutes, regulations, and standards that include a focus on airborne transmission of
respiratory disease and illness are detailed below.
Relevant Regulations
105 CMR 300.00: Reportable Diseases, Surveillance, and Isolation and Quarantine
Requirements describes isolation and quarantine requirements for certain infectious
diseases, which would apply to schools. Any students or staff with diseases listed here
with isolation or quarantine requirements would need to comply by staying home as
required by this law. Infections transmitted through the air that have isolation and
quarantine requirements include measles and pertussis.282

2a(2) Prevent Exposure to Asbestos
Methods and Best Practices
This section summarizes methods and best practices for preventing exposure to
asbestos across three areas: preparation; continual monitoring and exposure mitigation;
and exposure mitigation during renovations or abatement.
202
VII. Additional Details Related to Goal 2: Achieve Healthy Schools
Preparation (Education and Planning)
(1) Develop an Asbestos Management Plan (AMP) in accordance with the
Asbestos Hazard Emergency Response Act and 454 CMR 28.00
As required by the Asbestos Hazard Emergency Response Act (AHERA) and 454 CMR

Section 69:
28.00, districts must have school buildings, porticos, and roof mounted ventilation
components inspected for ACM, then prepare an AMP to prevent and reduce asbestos
hazards in school buildings.99,101,284,285 The MA Department of Labor Standards (DLS)
uses EPA’s model AMP for schools, which is available for schools to use on the DLS
and EPA websites (see list of resources in Table 61).286 In accordance with AHERA and
454 CMR 28.00, the AMP should specify a “designated person” to oversee asbestos-
related activities in the school.286 Table 30 includes Massachusetts resources that may
be helpful for the designated person. Once developed, schools should store the AMP on
site and keep it up to date. The plan should also include records of relevant events such
as response actions, training, and inspections.287
(2) Provide easy access to and training for the effective implementation of the
AMP
School leaders should confirm that all O&M staff thoroughly understand the AMP and
how to minimize asbestos exposure. This may require training on the AMP, review, and
frequently sharing the AMP. The AMP should be available to anyone who is interested
without restricitons.101,287
Continual Monitoring and Exposure Mitigation
(3) Inspect schools for ACM every three years
Schools should be inspected for ACM by licensed asbestos inspectors in compliance
with 454 CMR 28.00. A licensed inspector should re-inspect ACM at least every six
months, as required by 454 CMR 28.00, to look for any changes in the condition of the
materials and any suspected ACM not previously identified.100,284,287
(4) Label all ACM
All ACM should be prominently labeled.287 They typically do not need to be removed
unless severely damaged or disturbed, but should be identifiable.101
(5) Train staff to report any asbestos exposure risks to the building administrator
Train staff about common locations of and procedures for identifying ACM. Urge staff to
report any concerns about damage or deterioration of ACM to the school building
administrator.101
203
VII. Additional Details Related to Goal 2: Achieve Healthy Schools
(6) Conduct asbestos response actions to reduce exposure risk in accordance
with AHERA and 454 CMR 28.00
In accordance with 454 CMR 28.00, response actions must be consistent with the
assessment.288 Minimizing the risks of asbestos, as mandated by AHERA, is based on
the principle of “in-place” management. The goal of this approach is to teach people to
recognize and monitor ACM, then manage it as necessary without removing it. Removal
is not usually necessary unless the ACM is severely damaged or disturbed, which may
happen during a major renovation project or during an incident such as a burst pipe or
flooding event.101,284,285 Air clearance monitoring must be conducted after a response
action.288
Exposure Mitigation During Renovations or Abatement
(7) Minimize disturbance of ACM during renovations or conduct appropriate
abatement actions
Before undertaking renovations, school personnel should review the AMP and location
of any ACM.100,287 Schools should create barriers so that ACM is not touched during
renovations or should take appropriate abatement actions. Abatement procedures
should be included in the design of the renovation project.100 All renovations must be
completed in compliance with National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants
(NESHAP), which requires that schools notify the appropriate state agency before any
demolition or renovation of buildings with a certain amount of ACM. In Massachusetts,
schools should contact MassDEP and DLS at least 10 business days before conducting
renovations that involve ACM or, in the case of an emergency project, within one
working day after the project begins.100,287
(8) Schedule renovations or asbestos abatement activities when students and
staff are not in the building
Renovations that involve ACM or asbestos abatement activities should not occur when
students or staff are in the building. Schools should schedule renovations outside the
school year or during school breaks, unless in emergency situations.100,288
(9) Confirm safe air quality sampling results prior to allowing students and staff
to return to the building
After completing renovations involving ACM or asbestos abatement activities, schools
must contract for asbestos clearance air monitoring in accordance with 454 CMR 28.00.
Students and staff should only be allowed back into the building once the air has been
cleared of asbestos.289
204
VII. Additional Details Related to Goal 2: Achieve Healthy Schools
Statutes, Regulations, and Standards
Statutes, regulations, and standards that include a focus on exposure to asbestos are
detailed below.
Relevant Regulations
310 CMR 7.15 U Asbestos applies to anyone engaged in or associated with asbestos
abatement activities, including surveys, visual inspections, and record-keeping.290 The
regulation specifies how to conduct asbestos-related activities. Prior to renovations,
facility operators are required to have an asbestos inspector identify any ACM that may
be affected and prepare the findings in a written asbestos survey report, as described in
4) Survey Requirements.290 The facility operators must remove or encapsulate ACM
during demolition or renovation. Facility operators are required to notify MassDEP of
ACM and obtain authorization before conducting any asbestos abatement activities
unless any exceptions described in 6) Notification Requirements apply.290 The
regulation includes specific requirements for working with ACM found in certain types of
materials such as asphaltic roofing, siding materials, window glaze or caulking, cement
pipes, floor tiles, and gypsum wallboard. Requirements for worker safety, packaging of
removed ACM, and labeling of ACM are also described.290
454 CMR 28.00: The Removal, Containment, Maintenance, or Encapsulation of
Asbestos protects the health and safety of workers and the public from asbestos.284 It
establishes health and safety requirements for when dealing with ACM and standards
for competency, certification, and licensure for those who work with ACM.284 All schools
subject to the Asbestos Hazard Emergency Response Act (AHERA) must comply with

Section 70:
section 28.13, which describes how local education agencies must:
• Develop an asbestos management plan
• Ensure that any asbestos-related activities are carried out in compliance with
these laws and regulations
• Designate a person to implement requirements
• Inspect each school building unless they have documentation of a recent
inspection compliant with AHERA
• Implement appropriate response actions
• Adhere to the law for all operation and management of buildings with ACM
• Maintain records of ACM and asbestos-related activities284
Asbestos-Containing Materials in Schools Rule requires schools to develop an
AMP, conduct inspections every three years to determine the presence of ACM, and
take steps to prevent or reduce exposure to asbestos.100,285
205
VII. Additional Details Related to Goal 2: Achieve Healthy Schools
Asbestos NESHAP specifies work practices and notification requirements for schools
undergoing demolition or renovations of structures that meet a certain threshold level of

2a(3) Reduce Exposure to Carbon Monoxide
Methods and Best Practices
This section summarizes the methods and best practices for reducing exposure to
carbon monoxide in schools in two areas: planning and management; and technical
interventions.
Planning and Management
The following recommendations involve planning measures and interventions to monitor
carbon monoxide.
(1) Annually inventory and inspect all gas-burning appliances
Carbon monoxide is produced by appliances which use combustion to generate energy.
Incomplete combustion results in more carbon monoxide. To prevent excess carbon
monoxide from being released at schools, it is best practice to annually inspect all gas
burning appliances, including stoves, furnaces, and water heaters, to confirm they are
working properly and are ventilated to the outside.101
(2) Install carbon monoxide alarms near fossil fuel-fired appliances
Carbon monoxide alarms should be installed, at a minimum, near all appliances that
burn natural gas, oil, wood, or gas.101 Carbon monoxide alarms are devices that can
warn of excess carbon monoxide and allow schools to mitigate the carbon monoxide
before building occupants are exposed to high levels. Schools should consider carbon
monoxide alarms that can detect and store carbon monoxide levels and integrate the
warning equipment into the school’s central monitoring system. Carbon monoxide
alarms should be installed near sources of combustion, as these spaces have a greater
risk of elevated carbon monoxide due to malfunctioning equipment or inadequate
ventilation.104 DPH also recommends installing sensor technology in classrooms that
measure carbon monoxide as a best practice.
207
VII. Additional Details Related to Goal 2: Achieve Healthy Schools
(3) Restrict school buses and other vehicles from idling directly outside of the
school
Carbon monoxide is a byproduct of gas or diesel combustion in vehicles. Avoid vehicle
idling directly outside of the school, particularly where products of combustion, including
carbon monoxide, can be drawn into the school through air handling intakes, windows,
or exit doors.101,104 See the Reduce Exposure to Emissions from School Bus Idling

Section 71:
section for additional details about best practices on this topic.
Technical Interventions
The following methods and best practices concern school equipment and equipment
operations.
(4) Ensure negative pressure in rooms where carbon monoxide is likely to be
generated
Rooms with certain equipment, like kitchens, science laboratories, and vocational
classrooms, are more likely to contain equipment that can generate carbon monoxide.
Ventilation in these rooms should be operated at negative pressure compared to
surrounding rooms (i.e., the air is removed at a greater rate) so that carbon monoxide
does not spread to other areas in the school. This can be done by adjusting
components of the mechanical ventilation or by installing local exhaust ventilation.
Ventilation in these rooms should be maintained such that it complies with other
guidelines.104
(5) Remove or replace any unvented gas or kerosene space heaters
While uncommon in schools, removing any unvented gas or kerosene space heaters
and restricting their use by contractors is essential. Incomplete combustion of these
fuels will lead to the formation of carbon monoxide and lack of ventilation will allow
carbon monoxide to accumulate. If the heaters are used as a primary heat source,
replace them with electric or vented, code-compliant heating systems.104
Statutes, Regulations, and Standards
Statutes, regulations, and standards that include a focus on exposure to carbon
monoxide are detailed below.
Relevant Regulations
105 CMR 675 establishes a corrective action air level of 30 parts per million (ppm) for
carbon monoxide in indoor ice staking rinks with ice resurfacing machinery powered by
combustible fuels. The same regulation establishes an evacuation air level of 125 ppm
for carbon monoxide.291
NAAQS for carbon monoxide: EPA sets National Ambient Air Quality Standards
(NAAQS) for six pollutants, including carbon monoxide, to protect public health and the
208
VII. Additional Details Related to Goal 2: Achieve Healthy Schools
environment. The current NAAQS for carbon monoxide are an eight-hour time-weighted
average of 9 ppm and a one-hour time-weighted average of 35 ppm.292
Permissible Exposure Level: The Occupational Safety and Health Administration
(OSHA) has established the permissible exposure level (PEL) for carbon monoxide as
an eight-hour time-weighted average concentration of 50 ppm. This is established in
CFR Title 29, Part 1910, Subpart Z.293
Relevant Standards
American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) Threshold
Limit Values (TLVs) recommends a TLV as an eight-hour time-weighted average
concentration of 25 ppm.294
ASHRAE 62.1: ASHRAE uses EPA’s one-hour NAAQS for carbon monoxide as a
component in their guidelines for “Ventilation and Acceptable Indoor Air Quality.”295
DPH IAQ Assessment Manual states that carbon monoxide should not be present in a
typical indoor environment. If present, carbon monoxide levels should be less than or
equal to outdoor levels.296
Recommended Exposure Limit: The National Institute for Occupational Safety and
Health (NIOSH) established a recommended exposure limit (REL) for carbon monoxide
as an eight-hour time-weighted average concentration of 35 ppm.297

(1) Choose materials that will control moisture
During construction or renovation projects, review the types of materials chosen and
select those that will control moisture in areas which may be prone to wetness or
humidity (e.g., insulation, sealant, basement moisture barriers). For example, use
nonporous or moisture-resistant materials in areas that are likely to become wet
frequently, like around water fountains or bathrooms.104 Use proper moisture barriers in
roofing systems and repairs and in the foundation.104 Also, below-grade space should
not be converted to occupied space if it is subject to chronic dampness.298

maintenance of school buildings.
(4) Maintain interior relative humidity levels below 60 percent
High humidity encourages mold growth. Indoor relative humidity should be maintained
at a level below 60 percent, but ideally between 30–50 percent.100,101,104 Humidity levels
can be maintained using an HVAC system or dehumidifiers. Schools can measure
indoor relative humidity with hygrometers; these devices range from low-cost handheld
instruments that can be carried from room-to-room, to devices integrated into building
systems that can transmit readings to centralized building monitoring systems and
create alerts when humidity is outside of the target range. Hygrometers are often paired
with thermometers to measure temperature. Sensors should be re-calibrated quarterly
or according to the manufacturer’s specification.

(5) Maintain a properly balanced HVAC system
A balanced, properly sealed HVAC system will maintain the indoor climate at an
appropriate temperature and humidity, thus reducing mold and moisture issues.298
Positive pressure can help reduce moisture intrusion into the building envelope.104
(6) Clean any wet or damp areas within 48 hours and promptly repair all observed
leaks
When wet or damp areas are discovered, dry and clean the area within 48
hours.100,299,300 Investigate the cause of the wet or damp spots and fix any leaks or
problems that led to the water buildup.101 This will help to prevent the growth of mold.100
(7) Perform regular checks for condensation, wet spots, and signs of mold
Routinely check the school for areas of condensation, wet spots, and signs of mold.
Proactively searching can help to prevent mold or stop moldy areas from expanding.101
Areas prone to moisture or leaks should be prioritized. BCEH recommends that schools
inspect below-grade spaces in school buildings at least quarterly, as well as after heavy
rainfall or snowmelt, for evidence of water penetration or water damage.
(8) Consider using dehumidifiers
When other ventilation systems are insufficient or for buildings without an HVAC
system, use dehumidifiers to reduce humidity to 30–60 percent.104,299 Dehumidifiers
may be necessary when HVAC systems are undergoing maintenance, outdoor heat and
humidity levels are unusually high, or after activities like carpet cleaning introduce extra
moisture into the school building.104 If sinks or drains are available, configure
dehumidifiers to empty directly into the sinks/drains to reduce maintenance and prevent
mold growth and associated odors.
Remediation
When mold has already grown in a school building, it must be properly cleaned to avoid
exposing students and staff to the mold as much as possible and to prevent recurrence.
Implement the following methods and best practices when mold is found at a school.
(9) Contain and do not disturb areas with significant mold until they can be
remediated
Disturbing mold can cause spores to become airborne and increase the likelihood of
exposure among building occupants. To prevent this, when significant amounts of mold
are found, contain the area and do not disturb the mold until proper remediation is
arranged.104 Remediate mold and damaged materials as quickly as possible. In
addition, if mold growth is severe, it should be removed outside of school hours to avoid
student exposure.100
212
VII. Additional Details Related to Goal 2: Achieve Healthy Schools
(10) Clean small areas of mold with proper cleaning supplies
Mold can be removed from hard surfaces by scrubbing with water and the appropriate
cleaning supplies.101,299 Where possible, use “green” cleaning products and dry the
surface completely after cleaning. Note that some cleaning products, such as bleach,
can trigger asthma attacks.299 Do not paint or caulk over mold without cleaning or
removing the mold and ensuring that the cause of the mold is addressed.100
(11) Repair or replace moldy ceiling tiles and carpet
Porous and slow-drying materials such as carpet or ceiling tiles with mold growth should
be replaced or repaired.299 These types of materials are difficult to rid of mold once it
has started growing, and often the most foolproof and cost effective way to address
mold in carpets or ceiling tiles is to replace them.
Statutes, Regulations, and Standards
There are currently no federal or state standards to determine a safe or unsafe amount
of mold.

2a(5) Reduce Exposure to PCBs
Methods and Best Practices
The methods and best practices described here cover identifying and removing PCBs
from schools, considerations during renovations and repairs, and simple steps to reduce
exposure to PCBs found in air and dust.
214
VII. Additional Details Related to Goal 2: Achieve Healthy Schools
Identify and Remove Sources of PCBs
This section describes how to identify and remove PCBs from schools, starting with an
inventory of potential PCB-containing materials and continuing with best practices for
removing, encapsulating, and disposing of PCBs.
(1) Conduct an inventory of possible locations of PCB-containing materials
The first step in determining whether students and staff at a school are at risk of PCB
exposure is determining where PCBs ≥50 ppm may be present in building materials.
There is no visual standard for determining whether or not PCBs are present in building
materials, but inspecting schools for potential sources of PCBs is a good place to
start.301,302 EPA recommends developing an inventory of all materials in the building that
may contain PCBs. Historical records can help identify materials, areas, or parts of the
school that were constructed or renovated between 1950 and 1979 or shortly after, and,
therefore may contain PCBs.301,302
PCBs have frequently been found in and around window and door frames, on surfaces,
within expansion joints, and in areas subject to high heat or fires, such as boiler
rooms.301,302 Potential manufactured PCB products that may be present in schools
include:
• Paint, varnishes, and lacquers
• Non-conducting materials in electrical cables (e.g., plastic and rubber)
• Rubber and felt gaskets
• Coal-tar enamel coatings (e.g., pipe coating) and rust inhibitor coatings
• Insulation materials (e.g., fiberglass, felt, foam, and cork)
• Adhesives and tapes
• Caulk, grout, and joint material (e.g., putty, silicon, and bitumen)
• Pipe hangers
• Plastic applications, including vinyl and polyvinyl chloride
• Galbestos siding
• Mastics
• Acoustic ceiling and floor tiles
• Asphalt roofing and tar paper
• Synthetic resins and floor varnish
• Sprayed-on fireproofing301
• Fluorescent light ballasts101
215
VII. Additional Details Related to Goal 2: Achieve Healthy Schools
Fluorescent light ballasts (FLBs) manufactured before 1979 are another common
source of PCBs in schools.104,303 PCBs can be found in the
FLB capacitors and interior potting material of old magnetic Check FLBs for
T12 lighting fixtures.303 FLBs manufactured between 1978 and PCBs

unless the manufacturer can confirm otherwise.104,303
(2) Conduct PCB sampling to confirm presence of PCBs
If leaders suspect that PCBs are present in school building materials, then schools
should test the air and surfaces around the potential sources of PCBs to determine
whether PCB exposure is occurring.106,301 If PCBs are present in an intact material, such
as caulking that is not deteriorating, then no appreciable PCB exposure or health effects
would be expected.106 If caulking or other PCB-containing materials are deteriorating or
damaged, then air and surface wipe testing near the source is recommended.106 Similar
testing should be conducted in an area without deteriorating caulking to use as a
comparison.106 The results of this testing can inform abatement activities, cleaning
procedures, and the implementation of other measures to reduce exposure. 106,301
Following the inventory of potential PCB-containing materials, the building operator may
choose to assume that they contain PCBs ≥ 50 ppm or test the composition of the
potential PCB-containing materials.301 If a school chooses to test materials, EPA
recommends developing a building material sampling plan that considers current and
future building use as well as remediation goals.301 When testing for PCBs present in
building materials, it is also important to consider porous materials that surround the
materials that contain PCBs.301 The EPA Technical Guidance for Determining the
Presence of Manufactured PCB Products in Buildings and Other Structures can be used
as a guide for sampling site selection, collection, and analysis.302 DPH does not
recommend disturbing intact materials for testing, as available data suggest that no
appreciable exposure is likely from intact materials containing PCBs.106 Information
about exposure can be determined through air and surface wipe testing as described
above.106 A consultant can be hired to conduct surface wipe testing or testing can be
done by school personnel and sent to an analytical laboratory. EPA’s regional office can
help identify contractors or laboratories for testing (see Table 67 for relevant contact
information for EPA Region 1, which encompasses Massachusetts).
216
VII. Additional Details Related to Goal 2: Achieve Healthy Schools
(3) Remove building materials with PCBs ≥50 ppm
The most effective way to reduce PCB exposure or risk of future exposure is to remove
materials that contain PCBs ≥ 50 ppm or that are assumed to contain the regulated
level of PCBs.109 Caulk and other building materials with PCBs should be removed by
personnel wearing appropriate PPE, following procedures

TSCA.110,304 Any oil and stains leaked from
FLBs with PCBs must also be cleaned up or
disposed of in accordance with TSCA.104,110 Schools should select an experienced
contractor or facilities staff person to remove PCB-containing FLBs and decontaminate
the surrounding area.303 In preparation for removal, the area should be isolated from the
rest of the building and ventilated separately; workers should wear proper PPE, and
furniture under the fixtures should be removed.303
(5) Consider encapsulation of PCBs to reduce exposure
Encapsulation is the practice of painting a contaminated surface with a barrier coating
that prevents the release of PCBs from the painted material.305 Encapsulation may be
helpful to reduce PCB emissions from sources contaminated by PCB-containing
materials once the PCB materials have been removed.304 For example, materials that
were touching PCB-contaminated caulking or paint could be possible sites for
encapsulation.304 Encapsulation is only suitable for building materials with low PCB
contents. Properties of the coating, properties of the source building materials,
environmental conditions, and mitigation goals must be considered when determining
whether encapsulation is appropriate.305 EPA recommends contacting your regional
PCB coordinator because the applicability of encapsulation can vary on a case-by-case
217
VII. Additional Details Related to Goal 2: Achieve Healthy Schools
basis.304 Post-encapsulation monitoring with either air or surface wipe sampling will
show whether the encapsulation was effective.305
EPA researchers tested the efficacy of ten coatings used for PCB encapsulation and
found that the three epoxy coatings performed better than the other coating materials.305
Generally, coatings that have smaller material/air partition coefficients and smaller
diffusion coefficients for PCBs are better at reducing PCB emissions.305 However, no
coatings are truly impenetrable to PCBs, so encapsulation may not meet the mitigation
goals of every situation.305
Renovations and Repairs
Schools planning renovations and repairs should consider the best practices described
here when planning for and carrying out the projects.
(6) Remove PCB-containing materials disturbed during renovations and repairs
and minimize PCB exposure
When undertaking normal renovations or repairs, school leaders and those planning for
renovations or repairs should consider whether caulk or other building materials that
contain PCBs may be disturbed.104,304 EPA recommends using planning renovations
and repairs as opportunities to remove PCB-containing materials (see Remove building
materials with PCBs ≥50 ppm in compliance with TSCA).304 Even if not removed,
renovations that affect PCB-containing
materials require additional caution. If PCBs EPA’s Steps to Safe Renovation

renovations, isolating the area undergoing
renovations, regularly wet-mopping renovation areas, modifying the HVAC system to
keep PCBs in the affected part of the building, and taking precautions to protect
workers. Once materials containing PCBs ≥50 ppm are removed, they must be handled
and discarded properly in accordance with TSCA waste disposal requirements.104,110
Schools should maintain all documentation of PCB testing results (if tested), sampling
locations, disposal measures, disposal companies used, and final destination of waste
materials.104
(7) Follow EPA recommended steps for cleanup and decontamination if a PCB-
containing FLB leaks, smokes, or catches fire
If an FLB that contains PCBs leaks, smokes, or catches fire, then the school must
properly remove and dispose of the fixture and clean up the surrounding area.303 EPA
recommends that only experienced contractors or facilities staff should remove, clean
up, and decontaminate areas around FLBs that leak, smoke, or catch fire.303 The
218
VII. Additional Details Related to Goal 2: Achieve Healthy Schools
process should begin with preparation of the space, including isolating the affected area
from the central ventilation system, ventilating the area separately, moving furniture and
other objects out from under the fixture and covering them with plastic sheets, and
turning off light switches and fuses or breakers.303 Workers should wear appropriate
PPE.303 EPA describes detailed steps for inspection of damaged FLBs, removal and
disposal of FLBs and other materials contaminated with PCBs, and cleanup of PCBs
spilled in the surrounding areas.
(8) Follow EPA recommended steps when performing a retrofit for non-leaking
PCB-containing FLBs
Even when performing a retrofit of undamaged PCB-containing FLBs, schools should
follow EPA-recommended steps.303 This applies to retrofits as part of other renovations
and repairs or in an effort to remove all PCB-containing FLBs. EPA recommends that
only experienced contractors or facilities staff should perform the lighting retrofit.303 EPA
describes detailed steps for removing and disposing of PCB-containing FLBs.
Reduce PCB Exposure Through Air and Dust
Given that it may not always be possible to identify all PCB sources or remove PCBs
immediately, it is important to take steps in ventilation and cleaning to reduce PCB
exposure through air and dust.
(9) Regularly inspect and maintain ventilation systems for proper operations
While the strategies described above can be used to reduce or remove PCB hazards,
not all schools may be ready to undertake full PCB removal, and removal may not mean
all residual PCBs are gone from school buildings. As a result, it is important to consider
strategies to reduce exposure to PCBs through air and dust.109,304 One common route of
PCB exposure is through inhalation into the lungs.109 Increasing ventilation to remove
indoor air containing PCBs and bring outdoor air into the building reduces inhalation
exposure to PCBs.109 Schools should confirm that ventilation systems are operating
properly, regularly inspected, and maintained according to system manufacturer
instructions and guidelines.109,304 EPA recommends use of ANSI/ASHRAE/Air
Conditioning Contractors of America (ACCA) Standard 180-2012—Standard Practice
for Inspection and Maintenance of Commercial Building HVAC Systems.304 If system
cleaning is needed, EPA recommends following ANSI/ACCA Standard 6–Restoring the
Cleanliness of HVAC Systems (2007).304 In addition to creating a healthy learning
environment, a well-operating HVAC system also contributes to energy efficiency and
climate resilience (see Objective 1a. Decarbonize Buildings and Objective 1f. Enhance
Climate Resilience for additional details about these co-benefits).
(10) Teach and reinforce good hand-washing etiquette, particularly before eating
and drinking
Another common route of exposure is through ingestion of PCBs in dust found on
surfaces and hands.109 Students and staff should wash hands with soap and water
frequently, particularly before eating and drinking.101,109,304 In classrooms with younger
219
VII. Additional Details Related to Goal 2: Achieve Healthy Schools
children, staff should regularly wash toys and frequently touched objects with soap and
water.101,109,304 In addition to preventing the accidental ingestion of PCBs, good hygiene
practices such as hand-washing can prevent the accidental ingestion of other
contaminants, such as lead, that may end up on hands, as well as prevent the spread of
illness (see best practice (4) Teach and reinforce respiratory etiquette under Reduce
Airborne Transmission of Disease)
(11) Reduce dust while cleaning
During some cleaning practices dust containing PCBs can be resuspended into the air.
In buildings with known or suspected PCBs, cleaning staff should help reduce PCB
exposure by using vacuums with HEPA filters and cleaning surfaces, including floors,
walls, and window sills regularly with wet microfiber mops and cloths.101,109,304 Cleaning
staff should not sweep with dry brooms or dust with dry dusters or cloths, as both can
resuspend PCBs in dust into the air.101,109,304
Statutes, Regulations, and Standards
This section summarizes the regulation that governs PCB testing and removal as well
as the standard oral reference dose (RfD) recommended for schools.
Relevant Regulations
40 CFR § 761: Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) – PCBs Manufacturing,
Processing, Distribution in Commerce, and Use Prohibitions prohibits PCB production
and establishes requirements for the manufacture, processing, distribution, use,
disposal, storage, and marking of items containing PCBs.110 Several subparts may be
relevant for schools managing, cleaning up, or disposing of PCBs:
40 CFR § 761.60: Disposal and 40 CFR § 761.62: Disposal of PCB Bulk Product
Waste describe appropriate ways to dispose of waste that contains PCBs. If schools
are undertaking renovations to remove PCBs, they are responsible for properly
disposing of PCBs whether in caulk, fluorescent light ballasts, or other sources in
accordance with 40 CFR § 761. 106,110,303
40 CFR § 761.65: Storage for Disposal describes how waste containing PCBs must
be stored while awaiting disposal.110,303
40 CFR § 761.125: Requirements for PCB Spill Cleanup pertains to all spills of PCBs
at concentrations of 50 ppm or greater.110 If such a spill were to occur at a school, for
example, from broken fluorescent light ballasts that contain PCBs, the school would
have to report, clean up, and certify clean up from the spill in compliance with 40 CFR §

estimated dose of daily exposure that is unlikely to have an appreciable risk of harmful
health effects during a lifetime.306 Considering all exposure pathways in school and non-
school settings, EPA calculated indoor air concentrations of PCBs that would result in
an estimated total PCB exposure equal to the RfD by age group, assuming other school
and non-school exposures were average background levels.306 Acceptable
concentrations in indoor air may vary by school and other background exposures.306
The exposure levels for evaluating PCBs in school indoor air are outlined in Table 65.
Table 65. Exposure Levels for Evaluating PCBs in School Indoor Air by Age

12 to < 15 yr (middle school) 500
15 to <19 yr (high school) 600
19+ yr (adult) 500
EPA recommends that these indoor air concentrations be used as a guide for thoughtful
evaluation of indoor air quality in schools, not strict criteria. PCBs in indoor air should be
as low as reasonably achievable, and total exposure should remain below the RfD.306

2a(6) Reduce Exposure to Radon
Methods and Best Practices
This section covers methods and best practices for the overall radon planning, testing,
and mitigation process. Some of these steps will be carried out by school staff, others
by certified radon mitigation professionals, but all will be organized and managed by
school or district personnel. The second section describes specific technical
interventions, most of which will be performed by radon mitigation professionals, to
reduce radon exposure in schools.
Planning and Management
This section includes a series of methods and best practices for planning for and
managing radon testing and mitigation in schools in both new and existing buildings.
The best practices are arranged somewhat chronologically, beginning with
considerations for new school construction (when relevant), then moving on to testing
for radon, developing a mitigation plan, taking mitigation action, communicating with the
school community, retesting for radon, maintaining records, and ensuring continuity.
(1) Consider radon in the design and construction of new school buildings
Rather than having to mitigate radon retroactively, it is best to consider radon in the
process of constructing new schools.183 The design and construction of new schools
should follow Soil Gas Control Systems in New Construction of Multifamily, School,
Commercial and Mixed-Use Buildings – Rev. 5/23 (ANSI/American Association of
Radon Scientists and Technologists (AARST) CC-1000-2018-0523) for incorporating
radon controls into new construction.
(2) Have certified personnel test all schools for radon
EPA recommends testing all schools for radon.307 Qualified professionals certified by
either the National Radon Safety Board (NRSB) or AARST’s National Radon Proficiency
Program (NRPP) should perform radon tests.183,308

have demand-controlled ventilation
systems may require special attention
during testing, as their ventilation rates
vary with occupancy. Assume a minimum outdoor air ventilation rate based on the
minimum expected occupancy when testing these spaces.104
(3) Develop and implement a radon reduction plan
Planning where, when, and how to test and mitigate radon is a critical step before a
school takes action. If schools have a larger approach to improving indoor air quality or
environmental health, a radon reduction plan should be incorporated into that.307
Schools may want to consult with the DPH Radon Assessment Unit (RAU) on specific
steps for their school. This planning phase can include identifying possible funding
sources and planning short- and long-term steps for radon reduction.307
(4) Take action to mitigate radon if levels are above or approaching EPA action
levels
EPA’s action level for radon (described under Relevant Standards) is 4 piC/L. However,
buildings should also consider mitigation if levels are between 2 and 4 piC/L.309 The
main action to mitigate radon levels is to install a radon mitigation system, which
removes air from indoor spaces and reduces radon exposure.101 Technical strategies to
mitigate radon are described below in 9, 10, and 11.
(5) Educate and communicate information to parents, students, and staff
Schools should communicate with parents, students, and staff regarding radon in their
building and the steps they take for mitigation.100 Schools should explain the importance
of testing and the link between radon and building operations; encourage parents to test
their homes for radon; share their radon reduction plan (#2 above); include teachers in
your testing process; and encourage teachers to incorporate radon-related science
projects into the classroom.307 It is also important to educate maintenance and facilities
staff about radon and how to identify radon risks.307
224
VII. Additional Details Related to Goal 2: Achieve Healthy Schools
(6) Periodically retest areas of the school after mitigation
Even after radon mitigation interventions, radon testing continues to be important,
particularly if any renovations occur. NE-CHPS suggests that radon should be tested at
least every two years after you implement mitigation interventions.183 After any
renovation, the flow of indoor air can change, and EPA recommends retesting for
radon.100,104 Changes to the building envelope or mechanical ventilation systems, in
particular, can affect indoor radon levels.104
(7) Maintain records of ongoing radon testing and radon mitigation system
Schools should maintain records of radon testing before and after mitigation, as well as
records related to their mitigation system.100 Review records as needed. When doing
renovations, keep radon reduction methods in mind while designing the renovation, or
leave existing mitigation systems in place.100
(8) Maintain continuity of the school’s radon mitigation plan
After mitigating radon, schools should evaluate the success of their radon mitigation
plan and program and find ways to continually improve. Determine if the school needs
additional testing or mitigation and follow up with the necessary steps. Schedule future
retesting with a certified professional. Consider how ongoing HVAC maintenance or
upgrades may affect radon in the building.307
Technical Interventions
This section covers technical interventions to mitigate radon exposure, some of which
should be performed by a certified radon mitigation professional.
(9) Install a radon mitigation system
Schools should hire a certified radon mitigation contractor to install a radon mitigation
system.307 Confirm that the contractor is certified through the NRSB or NRPP.183,308 A
radon mitigation system should follow the standards of practice described above in
Relevant Standards. In general, most mitigation systems use a fan to create suction
under the building’s slab, which is called sub-slab depressurization. The radon gas is
then forced up through a pipe and released outside.308
(10) Seal cracks and joints in concrete floors
Sealing cracks and joints in concrete floors may be a key part of the radon mitigation
system to prevent radon from entering from the ground below.104,308
(11) Provide ventilation using a properly balanced HVAC system
A building’s HVAC system can be operated to help reduce indoor radon concentrations.
A properly balanced HVAC system that maintains positive pressurization indoors can
reduce the intrusion of underground contaminants such as radon into the building.104
225
VII. Additional Details Related to Goal 2: Achieve Healthy Schools
HVAC systems should be maintained regularly and balanced upon beginning
operations, when there is a problem, or when there is a change in operations (e.g.,
every five years).
Statutes, Regulations, and Standards
This section describes an EPA action level at which schools should take steps to
mitigate radon as well as building standards pertaining to radon in schools.
Relevant Standards
EPA Action Level recommends that buildings with radon levels at or above this level
take steps to mitigate radon. Because there is no known safe level of radon exposure,
EPA also recommends that building owners consider radon mitigation when radon
levels are between 2 pCi/L and 4 pCi/L.309
Protocol for Conducting Measurements of Radon and Radon Decay Products in
Multifamily, School, Commercial and Mixed-Use Buildings (ANSI/AARST MA-MFLB-
2023) specifies procedures and minimum requirements when measuring radon
concentrations in structures such as schools to determine if radon mitigation is
necessary. MA-MFLB 2023 consolidates ANSI/AARST MAMF (rev. 1/21) and
ANSI/AARST MALB (rev. 1/21) into one publication. Compliance with this standard was
effective December 1, 2023.310
Soil Gas Control Systems in New Construction of Multifamily, School, Commercial and
Mixed-Use Buildings–Rev. 5/23 (ANSI/AARST CC-1000-2018-0523) provides
prescriptive minimum requirements for new construction, including of schools, to reduce
exposure to radon and other hazardous soil gases. First published in 2017, this
standard of practice was updated in 2023 for clarity and improvements such as making
inspections during construction required rather than optional; clarifying qualified
professionals needed; clarifying products to use for creating an air barrier between soil
and indoor air; and integrating vapor intrusion design features into relevant sections.
This standard should be used in the planning and construction of new school
buildings.310
Soil Gas Mitigation Standards for Existing Multifamily, School, Commercial and
Mixed-Use Buildings (ANSI/AARST SGM-MFLB-2023) specifies minimum
requirements for methods that mitigate risks posed by radon gas and other chemical
vapors or gases in existing buildings, including schools. SGM-MFLB consolidates the
radon mitigation ANSI/AARST RMS-MF (rev. 12/20) and ANSI/AARST RMS-LB (rev.
12/20) into a single publication and harmonized it with ANSI/AARST SGM-SF (Soil Gas
Mitigation in Existing Homes) for interactive use.310

2a(7) Reduce Exposure to Outdoor Air Pollutants
Methods and Best Practices
This section summarizes methods and best practices to reduce exposure to outdoor air
pollution across two areas: policy and education; and infrastructure.
Policy and Education
Policy and education interventions describe methods or best practices for reducing
exposure to emissions, achieved through increasing awareness of the issue and
creating a policy to reinforce behaviors that reduce exposure.
(1) Educate staff about how outdoor air quality impacts indoor air quality
Educate school staff about how outdoor air pollution can enter the school through open
doorways and windows, and what causes air pollution levels to increase. Empower
school staff and students to react to poor outdoor air pollution. One way to do this is to
implement an air quality flag program to increase awareness of outdoor air quality
among school communities. Schools participating in this type of program will fly a
colored flag that corresponds to EPA’s color-coded Air Quality Index each day. This
program educates students and staff and allows schools to make informed decisions
about exposure to poor outdoor air quality during activities such as recess or sports
practice.311 Schools can use this program to decide when to reduce the impact of poor
outdoor air quality on indoor air by closing doors and windows and increasing air
filtration through a building’s HVAC system.
In addition, school bus operators should receive information about idling and pollution
exposure.183,312 Morning and afternoon traffic periods (i.e., rush hour) are times
associated with higher pollution; schools should educate staff about not opening
windows and doors during these times.313
(2) Enforce a vehicle anti-idling policy
Schools can adopt and enforce a written idling-reduction policy that applies to all
vehicles, including but not limited to school buses, cars, and delivery vehicles.101,314 The
policy should be explained and shared with the school community. Policies should
include limits on the number of minutes that vehicles can idle (i.e., no more than 3–5
minutes).183,287,312
228
VII. Additional Details Related to Goal 2: Achieve Healthy Schools
(3) Create a wildfire smoke readiness plan
A wildfire smoke readiness plan will prepare schools to take action when wildfire smoke
events occur. Plans should include routine evaluation of the HVAC systems and routine
HVAC filter maintenance so the building systems can adequately filter polluted air.
Plans should also include routine assessment of the building envelope to limit wildfire
smoke intrusion.315,316 In addition, plans should specify other ways that the school will
prepare for wildfires, including methods to monitor outdoor air quality threats,
purchasing of equipment to monitor indoor air quality (see the Indoor Air Monitoring text
box for additional details), and a backup plan to supplement HVAC systems should they
not be able to adequately clean the indoor air.315,316
Infrastructure
Infrastructure interventions include methods to reduce exposure to poor outdoor air
quality that can be achieved through physical equipment and changes to the built
environment.
(4) Replace or retrofit legacy school buses
Older school buses typically emit higher levels of PM and other pollutants. Electrifying
school bus fleets will greatly reduce near-school vehicle emissions. See Objective 1d.
Electrify School Bus Fleets for more details about electrifying school bus fleets.
Alternatively, older school busses can be retrofitted with PM filters to reduce vehicle
emissions or replaced with engines that are certified to use alternative, cleaner
fuels.101,101,117
(5) Establish anti-idling zones
Post signage indicating where vehicles are prohibited from idling.104,183,314 This can
reinforce the school’s vehicle anti-idling policy.
(6) Locate passenger pickup and drop-off areas away from air intakes and
classroom windows
If necessary, redesign school bus parking zones to minimize the potential for diesel
exhaust to enter inside the bus or the school. Bus parking areas, passenger pick-up and
drop-off lanes, and any loading docks should be located away from the school building
air intakes.101,104,117,287 Consider other design features that can help minimize exhaust
exposure, including diagonal school bus parking.314
(7) Maintain HVAC systems and filter indoor air
Ensure that HVAC systems are maintained and properly filter any air entering the
school from outside.117,287 Filter systems will clean outside air that may be impacted by
air pollution, including vehicle exhaust, to minimize exposure within the school; air
should be filtered to the highest level of high-efficiency filtration the HVAC system is
designed to handle, and filters should be inspected and replaced quarterly. HVAC
229
VII. Additional Details Related to Goal 2: Achieve Healthy Schools
systems should be run continuously while the building is occupied. In addition, HVAC
systems should be balanced before beginning operation and when there is a change in
operations so as to keep positive pressure within the school; negative pressure can
draw in outdoor contaminants through the building envelope.104,117
(8) Consider sources of outdoor air pollution when siting a new school
Significant air pollution comes from heavily trafficked roadways and can also come from
industrial areas. When deciding where to locate a new school, consider these sources
of air pollution. Air pollution is higher within 500 feet of a major roadway.313
Municipalities and school districts should avoid siting schools immediately adjacent to
highly-traveled roadways and other significant sources of air pollution to the maximum
extent possible.
(9) Consider community- and building-level design elements that mitigate
infiltration of outdoor air pollutants from roadways and industrial areas
Ideally, a school district planning to construct a new school will have the flexibility to
select a site that is removed from heavily trafficked roadways and industrial sites. There
are often circumstances when this is not possible, including school districts located in
densely developed urban areas or instances when a school elects to undergo an in-
place renovation and the existing building is located near a busy roadway and/or
industrial site. If there are limitations that necessitate the siting of a new school in a
location near heavily trafficked roadways or industrial areas, or when a school is
undergoing an in-place renovation, school districts still have options at the community
and building levels to mitigate indoor exposure to outdoor air pollutants from roadways
and industrial areas, including the following:
• Install roadside vegetation barriers (either alone or in combination with solid
noise barriers) to reduce near-road air pollution317
• Locate school building spaces often occupied by people (e.g., classrooms,
playgrounds, athletic fields) further from busy roadways and industrial sites313
See the Mitigate Occurrences of Vapor Intrusion section for additional details about
mitigation strategies for schools located near industrial sites.
Statutes, Regulations, and Standards
Statutes, regulations, and standards that include a focus on outdoor air quality around
schools are detailed below.
Relevant Statutes
M.G.L., c. 90 §16A restricts the operation of motor vehicle engines while stopped in
excess of five minutes.318
230
VII. Additional Details Related to Goal 2: Achieve Healthy Schools

property specifically.319
Relevant Regulations
540 CMR 27.00, Regulation of Motor Vehicle Idling on School Grounds320 restricts
unnecessary idling time and governs the time during which a motor vehicle can idle on
school grounds, in order to improve and protect school campus air quality. Vehicle
operators are not permitted to idle motor vehicles within 100 feet of known and active
school intake systems. All schools must install and maintain permanent “NO IDLING”
signage in a conspicuous location and visible from a distance of 50 feet. All school bus
companies operating within the Commonwealth must inform each of their respective
school bus drivers of the regulation’s requirements and consequences of non-
compliance.

Objective 2b. Improve Water Quality
2b(1) Reduce Exposure to Lead in Drinking Water
Methods and Best Practices
The following best practices aim to identify lead sources in drinking water, create
communication, sampling, and testing plans, and remediate lead contamination drinking
water in schools.
(1) Be familiar with the school’s water source and condition of the school’s
plumbing system
An important first step when dealing with water quality concerns is identifying the
school’s drinking water source.321 Additionally, it is essential to be aware of the condition
of the plumbing system in schools since corroded systems can leach lead.122 It is helpful
to know how water enters and flows through schools and to have documented plumbing
configurations for the building.322 A water professional, such as a qualified plumber, may
be able to assist schools in determining their plumbing configuration, ensure the system
is functioning adequately, and identify lead-based or galvanized service lines and
faucets.287,322
(2) Create a communication plan to notify stakeholders and build partnerships
The only way to know if lead is present in drinking water is to test, though before
developing a sampling plan, it is essential that schools first create a communication
plan.121 The plan should be written for stakeholders such as staff, parents, students,
public water system officials, and local elected officials. It should also detail how
stakeholders will be notified regarding the health impacts of lead in drinking water,
sources of lead in drinking water, sampling plans, and any results from testing. Further,
schools should work to build partnerships with local community organizations or state
drinking water programs to assist in communicating relevant and factual information.121
(3) Implement a water sampling plan in compliance with state guidance
It is important that all schools have a well-developed water sampling and testing plan to
comply with state guidance. The first step of this plan should be to conduct a walk-
through of the school to identify all sinks and fountains that provide water meant for
consumption and to document the presence of aerators and filters.121,323 Based on the
information collected from the walk-through, determine which drinking water sources to
sample. Multiple sources should be chosen, and they should be representative of all
potential drinking water outlets, such as drinking fountains, kitchen sinks and kettles,
classroom sinks, etc.121
Before sampling, schools should identify a Massachusetts-certified laboratory to
analyze the water samples for lead.121 Laboratories should provide details on sampling
methodology, though MassDEP also provides the following information: 1) designate a
233
VII. Additional Details Related to Goal 2: Achieve Healthy Schools
school employee to lead the sampling plan or hire an experienced consultant, 2) create
a diagram of where samples will be taken and assign an identification code to each
location, and 3) record detailed notes during sampling such as the date and time of
sampling and observations for each location (i.e., type of water source, whether an
aerator or filter is present).324,325 Some essential things to note are to always sample
taps/outlets with aerators or filters attached if water is normally obtained using such
measures and to never sample immediately after an extended closure or following a
facility flush of the plumbing system.121,322
Note that MassDEP recommends that schools conduct testing once every three years,
and that results come back under the detection limit of 1 ppb.324 If results come back
above this level, MassDEP recommends that schools notify the administrator and
include the list of sampling locations with detectable levels and the remediation efforts
the school will implement to address the contamination.324 Regardless of the results,
staff, parents, students, and other stakeholders should be notified of the testing as
detailed in the school’s communication plan.
(4) Remediate sources of contamination and establish routine practices to
minimize future contamination

water flow to remove any stagnant water in
the interior of the pipes, as stagnant water
is more likely to have higher levels of lead.122,321,322,326 Permanent control measures will
require the complete replacement of problem outlets and any upstream plumbing
components like piping, valves, and solder.121 Another option would be to reconfigure
the plumbing system to re-route water away from sections identified to contain lead-
based materials.323 Finally, the School Water Improvement Grants (SWIG) Program
offers grants for the purchase and installation of filtered water-bottle filling stations in
eligible schools and EECFs, while the Water-Smart Program offers filtered pitchers.
Other daily practices can be implemented to reduce lead in drinking water. For example,
outlets should be flushed daily for at least 30 seconds, and complete system flushing
should occur weekly, particularly after breaks.326 Additionally, only cold water should be
used for drinking and cooking, as hot water may have more dissolved lead.122 Routine
234
VII. Additional Details Related to Goal 2: Achieve Healthy Schools
maintenance should also be performed, such as cleaning faucet aerators and installing
certified low-lead materials.122
Statutes, Regulations, and Standards
The following statutes, regulations, and standards contain relevant information to lead
and copper in drinking water, including the levels of contamination which should not be
exceeded.
Relevant Statutes
Lead Contamination Control Act (LCCA) provides recommendations for identifying
and addressing lead and copper at schools and childcare facilities.324
Reduction of Lead in Drinking Water Act prohibits the use or sale of lead pipes,
solder, and flux, where ‘lead-free’ systems must demonstrate they contain less than 0.2
percent lead.327
Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) sets standards for drinking water including the
control of contaminant levels, where lead and copper are regulated through the lead
and copper rule.328
Relevant Regulations
MA Drinking Water Regulations, 310 CMR 22, control levels of various contaminants
in drinking water and requires that levels remain under certain thresholds deemed
health protective.329 Such thresholds are set to the levels identified in the MA Maximum
Contaminant Levels standard.
Lead and Copper Rule requires that drinking water is monitored for lead and copper
and that levels remain below 15 ppb for lead and 1.3 ppm for copper.330 Public water
systems that exceed these action levels must undertake various control measures and
inform stakeholders of how the contamination will be managed.
National Primary Drinking Water Regulations enforce primary standards and
treatment techniques relevant to public water systems, where the maximum
contaminant level for lead in copper are set to the federal action levels of 15 ppb and

Section 74:
1.3 ppm, respectively.331
Relevant Standards
MA Maximum Contaminant Levels sets levels for various contaminants in drinking
water as required under MA 310 CMR 22, where levels for both lead and copper in
public water systems are set to the federal action levels of 15 ppb and 1.3 ppm,
respectively. These standards are for the entire system and not individual outlets such
as those at schools if the school is part of a larger water system.332

2b(2) Reduce Exposure to PFAS in Drinking Water
Methods and Best Practices
The following best practices are aimed at identifying PFAS contamination in drinking
water, remediating to reduce contamination, and eliminating sources of PFAS through
green purchasing.
(1) Identify whether the school’s drinking water source contains PFAS and
conduct additional testing to determine the source of contamination whenever
possible
An important first step in reducing exposure to PFAS in schools is to assess
contamination in drinking water. All public water suppliers in Massachusetts are
required to test for PFAS, whether the supplier is a community system or a school with
its own well. If PFAS are detected, schools should contact MassDEP to identify
appropriate next steps for addressing both long-term and short-term remediation
strategies.
237
VII. Additional Details Related to Goal 2: Achieve Healthy Schools
(2) Remediate sources of PFAS contamination and establish routine practices to
minimize future contamination (long-term mitigation)
If the school is part of a larger public water system, the public water system is
responsible for remediation actions to provide water to customers that complies with
regulatory requirements. Long-term remediation by public water suppliers may include
treatment to filter out PFAS or linking the water system to new sources of water that
does not contain PFAS.123 If the school is on well water, it is considered a public water
system and, as such, is required to comply with the same state drinking water
regulations (310 CMR 22). In such cases, schools can install activated carbon or
reverse osmosis filters to treat water onsite.124–126 The school should provide an
alternative source of drinking water while installing a treatment system.
(3) Remediate sources of contamination and establish routine practices to
minimize future contamination (short-term mitigation)
When PFAS contamination in local water sources cannot be immediately remediated,
schools can switch to the use of bottled water as a temporary alternative.124 DPH
regulates bottled water in Massachusetts and—together with MassDEP—publishes a
list of bottled water companies that have completed testing that demonstrates
compliance with drinking water standards for PFAS.126
(4) Procure certified PFAS-free items as part of the school’s green purchasing
program
In addition to reducing PFAS in drinking water, efforts can be taken to reduce PFAS
exposure in schools from everyday products. For example, New Hampshire has
identified floor waxing and refinishing products as sources of PFAS in schools.334
Schools should include PFAS as contaminants to monitor through their green
purchasing program. This would entail procuring certified PFAS-free products for any
food contact materials, cleaning products, classroom furnishings, flooring, paint, etc.125
Note that Massachusetts has set goals to require reporting of PFAS in products by
manufacturers and to phase out intentionally added PFAS in consumer products by

Section 75:

Statutes, Regulations, and Standards
The following statutes, regulations, and standards control hazardous waste containing
PFAS and set limits for these chemicals in drinking water and other matrices.
Relevant Statutes
MA Oil and Hazardous Material Release Prevention and Response Act, Ch. 21E
regulates oil and hazardous waste contamination where cleanup standards set the limit
to 20 ppt for the sum of perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorooctane sulfonic acid
(PFOS), perfluorohexanesulfonic acid (PFHxS), hexafluoropropylene oxide dimer acid
238
VII. Additional Details Related to Goal 2: Achieve Healthy Schools
(HFPO-DA), perfluorobutane sulfonate (PFBS), and perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA) in
groundwater and 0.3-2 ppb in soil.127
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act
designates PFOA, PFOS, and their salts and isomers as chemicals to be monitored for
cleanup in the event of uncontrolled or abandoned hazardous waste.335
Relevant Standards and Regulations
PFAS National Primary Drinking Water Regulation sets a maximum contaminant
level (MCL) standard in drinking water for five PFAS compounds where PFOA and
PFOS are 4 ng/L and PFHxS, HFPO-DA, and PFNA are 10 ng/L.336 Further, any given
mixture of PFHxS, PFNA, HFPO-DA, and/or PFBS cannot exceed a hazard index of 1.
This regulation also sets maximum contaminant level goals (MCLGs), which are non-
enforceable health-based levels. The MCLGs were set to zero ng/L for PFOA and
PFOS and 10 ng/L for PFHxS, HFPO-DA, and PFNA.
MA PFAS Drinking Water Standard (310 CMR 22.07: Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl
Substances (PFAS) Monitoring and Analytical Requirements) has a current MCL of 20
ng/L for the sum of the concentrations of the following compounds: PFOA, PFOS,
PFHxS, PFNA, PFHpA, and perfluorodecanoic acid. 337 MassDEP must adopt the
national MCLs noted above and is considering additional information that could result in
more stringent standards.
MA Drinking Water Standard (105 CMR 500.09: Standards for Bottled Water)
requires laboratory results for source and finished water, including bottled water, to be
under the MCL of 20 ng/L for the sum of the concentrations of the following compounds:
PFOA, PFOS, PFHxS, PFNA, PFHpA, and perfluorodecanoic acid.338 With regards to
bottled water, manufacturers are to provide lab results annually showing that their
finished water products meet these requirements.

Objective 2c. Maintain Thermal Comfort
Methods and Best Practices
Methods and best practices for maintaining thermal comfort are described here, ranging
from policy implementation, major changes to building HVAC systems, steps to consider
for new construction, and steps that teachers can take within their classrooms.
(1) Establish and implement an extreme heat policy aligned with a completed
climate vulnerability assessment
Climate change is contributing to more intense heat waves across Massachusetts and
forcing schools to confront the challenge of managing an increased number of school
days experiencing extreme heat.339 Extended periods of hot weather can exacerbate
underlying health conditions such as asthma and bronchitis, and prolonged exposure to
high temperatures can impair cognitive function, learning, and academic performance.
Using the results of a completed climate vulnerability assessment (see Objective 1f:
Enhance Climate Resilience for additional details), schools should determine the need
for, establish, and implement an extreme heat policy, where appropriate. An effective
policy will outline a multi-pronged approach that considers relative humidity levels,
appropriate air circulation, classroom temperature thresholds, appropriate hydration for
students and staff, and necessary modifications to physical activities.339
(2) Keep classrooms at a comfortable temperature and humidity for learning
While no exact definition exists for “comfortable temperature,” what is typically thought
of as a “comfortable temperature” will vary seasonally. Perceived heat and thermal
comfort is also highly dependent on humidity, and as such, schools should strive to
measure both temperature and humidity. There are several guidelines that schools can
use to determine what a comfortable range of temperature and humidity is in their
facilities. DPH recommends that classrooms be kept within the range of 70°F to 78°F
and 40 to 60 percent relative humidity.340 OSHA recommends that indoor workplace
temperatures stay between 68°F and 76°F with humidity between 20 and 60 percent.341
In addition, M.G.L., c. 149, § 113, which applies to workplace temperature, including
schools, requires that workplaces be properly heated from October 15 to May 15.342
During the heating season, DLS endorses keeping classrooms between 66°F and
68°F.343 OSHA is currently developing a national standard for protecting workers during
extreme heat, and recommendations for extreme heat in schools may change as the
number of hot days increases.344,345 Overall, schools should keep classroom
241
VII. Additional Details Related to Goal 2: Achieve Healthy Schools
temperature in the approximate range of 66°F to 78°F, as seasonally appropriate, and
avoid extremely low and extremely high levels of humidity.
(3) Install air conditioning if temperatures regularly get above recommended
levels (see best practice 1 above)
Some Massachusetts schools have begun installing air conditioning, which is the best
way to reduce temperature and humidity in classrooms.128,132 Schools have cited lack of
air conditioning as driving the need for early dismissals and closures during hot
conditions. Resources such as the National Best Practices Manual For Building High
Performance Schools provide guidance for school design considering air conditioning
requirements.131,339,346
(4) Maintain mechanical HVAC systems and balance systems as needed
For both heating and cooling systems, proper maintenance is essential. Schools should
take steps to make sure their HVAC systems are operating properly, such as calibrating
thermostats for accurate temperature control, balancing the system at least every five
years using a third party specialist, and ensuring that air conditioning (AC) drip pans are
properly draining and free of debris, all pipes are free of microbial growth, and window-
mounted AC units are properly installed and maintained.104,287
(5) Proper heating and cooling in new construction
Given the increase in hot and humid days and the currently observed and anticipated
future effects of climate change, schools should carefully consider projected heating
and cooling needs, including air conditioning, when constructing a new building. School
planners could consider passive heating and cooling systems, if thermal comfort can be
maintained with these systems.346 These systems aim to maximize heat from the sun in
the winter and minimize this heat gain in the summer. Strategic window placement and
shading play a large role in passive heating and cooling, prioritizing north-facing
windows and shading those that face south.346 Another way to improve the efficiency of
heating or cooling systems in schools is to improve the building envelope (see Objective
1a. Decarbonize Buildings for additional details on building envelope improvements).
(5) Take simple steps to mitigate the effects of heat on health and learning
While established mechanical or passive cooling systems are most effective at reducing
classroom temperature, school staff can take other interim steps to mitigate the
negative effects of extreme heat on students and staff. Steps to mitigate heat include
providing cool water for students and staff; reducing physical activity; improving air
circulation (e.g., providing at least one fan per classroom); dimming or turning off lights;
switching off unused electronics; opening windows (if cooler outdoors); closing shades
to block solar radiation; and providing “cooling breaks” between instruction during which
students can use misting fans, ice packs, or other cooling items.131,339,347 Schools should
develop a plan outlining which measures they will use to mitigate the effects of heat on
health and learning during heat waves and extreme heat.

Objective 2d. Use Integrated Pest Management
Methods and Best Practices
This section summarizes the methods and best practices for using integrated pest
management in schools.
(1) Create an IPM plan
The Massachusetts Pesticide Control Act requires schools to:
• Adopt and implement an IPM plan
• File a copy of the IPM plan with the state
• Make a copy available to the public upon request
• Review the plan annually
The Massachusetts Department of Agricultural Resources (MDAR) has produced a
model IPM plan that schools may adopt. School IPM plans must contain the following:
• Description of the school’s IPM communication and training programs for staff
• List of pesticides to be used
• List of non-pesticide control techniques and preventative methods to be used
• School location where the IPM plans and records are available for viewing
Schools are encouraged to further define routine service schedules and pest thresholds
for which advanced action is taken.
244
VII. Additional Details Related to Goal 2: Achieve Healthy Schools
(2) Perform routine and proactive pest service
A certified pest professional should proactively service all school spaces regularly.
Schools may elect to hire an in-house technician or contract with a pest management
company that practices IPM. At a minimum, the technician should:
• Report their pesticide applicator certification number
• Inspect for pest activity
• Inspect for structural, sanitation, or clutter concerns
• Place, remove, and replace traps, bait stations, and insect monitors; all should be
dated
• Record the quantity, percent active ingredient, and trade name of any toxicant
applied, and the weather conditions (if outdoors)
• Inquire with building occupants about any pest concerns
• Provide recommendations for resolving pest concerns
Any actions taken above should be recorded in a central data repository that is available
to both the pest professional and administrative decision makers. It is critical that the
time and locations for all observations are recorded so that problem areas can be
identified at a later date. If a problem is identified during routine service, the technician
should regularly service the space at an enhanced frequency until resolution. If the
school has capacity, annual quality insurance inspections should be conducted to check
the quality of the pest technician’s work.
The frequency of routine service should vary by space in accordance with the risks
associated with each space. For instance, cafeterias should be serviced more
frequently than administrative offices. Foodservice and childcare spaces are typically
monitored at least weekly or biweekly, while office-like spaces are monitored quarterly
or biannually. All spaces should be serviced by a technician at least twice a year.
(3) Field pest complaints from building occupants
Staff and students should be able to report any sighted pest activity to a central point of
contact or reporting platform. A complete pest service request contains the reporter’s
email, date and time of request, general type of pest or conducive condition observed,
and a detailed location description. These details should be provided to the pest
professional conducting routine pest service so that the technician can address the
reported issue during their next scheduled visit, or if needed, during a sooner non-
routine visit. The reporter should be notified that their complaint has been received and
what action was taken to resolve their concern.
245
VII. Additional Details Related to Goal 2: Achieve Healthy Schools
(4) Physically exclude pests
Preventing pests from entering facilities is the most effective way to reduce the need for
chemical pesticide use in buildings. Physically exclude pests via the following methods:
• Seal utility entry points, cracks, and gaps in foundations, walls, and around
windows. For larger openings, insert steel wool or mesh before sealing with caulk
or foam.
• Check that windows and doors close completely.
• Install door sweeps on exterior doors. The housing and sweep should be cut on
the “inside hinged” edge of the door and not the outer edge of the door.
• Install weep covers over window weep holes.
• Install screens in windows.
• Trim vegetation so that it does not touch building exteriors (vegetation should be
3 to 6 feet away from the building foundation).
While school maintenance teams may perform these exclusions, it is recommended that
a trained pest professional performs pest exclusion.
(5) Perform pest sealing before final acceptance of new construction projects
Structural pests, such as rodents and certain insects, can migrate along utility and
plumbing lines within building interiors. Before a new construction project is completed,
a trained pest professional should perform pest sealing within building interiors to
significantly reduce opportunities for pest mobility in buildings.
(6) Conduct pest-preventative repairs
Pest-preventative repairs should be implemented to address structural issues leading to
pest proliferation. A trained pest professional may perform these repairs or in-house
maintenance staff can be trained to do them. Below is guidance for common pest-
preventative repairs:
• Clean Drains: Regularly clean drains to prevent the buildup of organic matter
that can attract pests like flies and cockroaches. Inspect drains for the presence
of standing water since drain water within otherwise “dry” areas (e.g., bathroom
floor drains, mechanical room floor drains) may evaporate from the respective
drain trap, creating an “open line” for sewer-dwelling pests such as American
cockroaches, drain flies, phorid flies and other pests to emerge. If there is
standing water present, and the drain sees a high volume of organic matter (such
as shower drains in locker rooms or within food service areas), carefully remove
drain covers, apply Biozyme enzymatic drain cleaner (or similar foaming drain
cleaner) and scrub the inner walls of the drain to remove organic matter
physically. Simply pouring hot water, bleach, or a foaming agent will not eliminate
breeding sites. Mechanical organic matter removal is the only way to eliminate
246
VII. Additional Details Related to Goal 2: Achieve Healthy Schools
these breeding sites. Electric rotary brushes may also be used; stiff nylon bristles
are preferred over steel bristles since the latter may damage older pipe walls.
• Repair Water Leaks: Fix leaks promptly to eliminate a water source that attracts
pests and creates conducive conditions for mold. Standing water (even within the
confines of a building) may invite mosquito breeding in as little as four days.
• Manage Garbage Disposals: Maintain and clean garbage disposals regularly to
reduce odors and potential food sources for pests. In the event of a non-
functioning or broken garbage disposal, it should be removed and replaced since
organic matter collection will invite filth fly breeding. If a fly infestation occurs in a
fully functioning disposal, the discharge line (from disposal to plumbing trap) as
well as plumbing p-trap should be removed and brushed out to eliminate organic
matter buildup and subsequent fly breeding sites. Biozyme enzymatic drain
cleaner (or similar drain cleaner) may also be applied to make scrubbing easier.
• Install Door Sweeps: Properly install door sweeps to seal gaps at the bottom of
doors, preventing entry for pests such as rodents and insects. Door sweeps
should be bristled with aluminum housing and cut to allow for a 1/8” reveal on
each side of the bristle sweep. Cut the housing and sweep on the “inside hinged”
edge of the door and not the outer edge of the door. This practice will reduce cut
hazards by mitigating sharp edges on the outermost edge of the door that may
contact open-toed shoes of building occupants.
(7) Inspect buildings for conducive conditions
It is crucial to conduct annual, if not more frequent, building inspections for early
detection and prevention of pest infestations. Additional inspections may be warranted
throughout the year if significant changes to a building are expected to occur (e.g.,
façade renovation). Inspectors must keep detailed records of inspection findings, noting
signs of pests, conducive conditions, or structural issues. Inspection may be conducted
by a certified pest professional or facility manager. At a minimum, the inspection should
include the elements outlined in Table 78:
Table 78. Recommended Elements of a Pest Inspection

VII. Additional Details Related to Goal 2: Achieve Healthy Schools
(8) Educate building occupants on best practices
Student and staff behaviors have a substantial impact on pest presence within schools.
Therefore, they should be educated on how to report pest activity, what the school is
doing to address pest concerns, and what they can do to prevent pest activity. Namely,
students and staff can help by reducing food sources and clutter. The following
instructions could be placed on flyers and distributed in classrooms and break rooms:
• Avoid eating and storing food in classrooms, offices, or cubbies.
• Wipe spilled food items off surfaces.
• Do not leave dirty dishes in classrooms, offices, and cubbies.
• Store food in sealed heavy plastic, metal, or glass containers.
• Rinse recyclables before placing them in recycling containers.
• Reduce clutter by removing or storing unused items.
• Check that the soil is free of pests before bringing a plant to the school.
• Dry out potted plants completely before watering.

Pest Management in Schools
Objective 2e. Procure and Use Green Cleaning Supplies and
Chemicals
Methods and Best Practices
The methods and best practices in this section focus on implementing a chemical
management system and utilizing green chemicals to protect the health and safety of
staff and students using chemicals in schools.
250
VII. Additional Details Related to Goal 2: Achieve Healthy Schools
Chemical Management System
The following three best practices can assist in implementing a strong chemical
management system within schools. Schools must use, store, and dispose of chemicals
in a manner that minimizes the misuse of chemicals and ultimate exposure to
hazardous substances by staff and students.
(1) Develop a school chemical management program
An important first step to minimize exposure to hazardous or mismanaged chemicals in
schools is to develop a chemical management program, beginning with evaluating the
current conditions of a school’s use of chemicals and conducting an inventory of all
chemicals present onsite.133,352 A visual inspection should be performed to identify
mismanaged chemicals, which are characterized by expired chemicals or those in poor
condition (i.e., evident corrosion), unlabeled chemicals, mis-stored chemicals, and a
lack of displayed safety information on the label.101,133 A detailed chemical inventory
should be noted, and any chemicals deemed unnecessary, expired, or posing a health,
safety, or environmental risk should be appropriately disposed of.99,101,133,287
Additionally, attention should be paid to how chemicals are being physically stored and
whether safety information is available.99,101,133,287,353 Chemicals should be stored in an
appropriate cabinet depending on their properties or chemical class, where acids and
flammables are separated from other chemicals.133,287,353 The storage cabinets should
have shelving constructed to resist corrosion and include guardrails to prevent
accidental slippage.287,353 Designated chemical storage rooms should have dedicated
exhaust ventilation systems to reduce the availability of chemical vapors.133,353 Lastly,
chemicals should always be easily identifiable via proper labeling mechanisms, and
material safety data sheet (MSDS) information should be readily available.99,101,287,353
When disposing of hazardous chemicals, including electronics, follow guidance
provided by MassDEP and local hazardous waste collection facilities that have been
approved by MassDEP for collection. Massachusetts has a statewide contract
(FAC110) in place to aid with hazardous waste disposal.
These practices should be put into place regularly for long-term adequate chemical use,
storage, and disposal.
(2) Create an emergency and spill response plan
Another critical step in minimizing exposure to hazardous or mismanaged chemicals is
to create an emergency and spill response plan. This should be a written plan
describing what to do and who to contact in an emergency or spill.99 The plan should
include detailed information such as emergency response contact information, location
of necessary supplies (e.g., spill kits), diagrams of facility grounds, evacuation and
accountability plans, and communication plans or other means of alerting
individuals.99,133 Always call 911 in an emergency; however, the Massachusetts
Emergency Response Line (1-888-304-1133) may also be a useful contact for answers
251
VII. Additional Details Related to Goal 2: Achieve Healthy Schools
to technical questions or assistance in determining if non-emergency situations warrant
further action or reporting.133,353
(3) Form a chemical safety team and conduct adequate staff training
It is important to have a solid chemical safety team to oversee chemical management
programs and emergency or spill response plans. The chemical safety team should
coordinate and implement all strategic plans that minimize exposure to hazardous
substances, promote chemical safety, and retain documents for long-term institutional
memory.133 The team should include diverse areas of expertise, where leadership and
decision making roles are clearly defined.352 Further, the team should conduct proper
training for all staff and students who handle chemicals.99,101 Training on emergency or
spill response plans and MSDS and other chemical safety information should also be
available.99
Green Cleaning Supplies/Chemicals
The following two best practices can help implement a green chemical purchasing
policy and a plan effectively using such green chemicals. The goal of these practices is
to decrease the amount of toxic chemicals used in schools and provide green
alternatives.
(4) Implement a green chemical purchasing policy
A green chemical purchasing policy can help eliminate the purchase and use of
unnecessary hazardous products and thus reduce overall risks to students and staff. An
important first step may be to assess the current state of chemical purchasing to
determine the chemicals currently being purchased and how they are being used.99
Based on this information, the policy should be adapted to have defined quantities and
types of chemicals approved for purchase.99,133,287 Further, the policy should promote
the use of less toxic or non-toxic chemicals and products.99,133,134 Four top certifications
to look for include Design for the Environment, Green Seal, Safer Choice, and UL
ECOLOGO.134 The approved chemical purchasing list should be created and
maintained by the chemical safety and procurement teams and reviewed on a regular
basis.
(5) Design a plan for green cleaning, sanitizing, disinfecting, and other daily
practices plan
In addition to a green chemical purchasing policy, a plan that describes how these
green chemicals can be used effectively in daily practices such as cleaning, sanitizing,
and disinfecting will be helpful to schools. For example, some traditional cleaning
agents are also hazardous substances that can irritate the respiratory tract and lead to
unwanted side effects like triggering asthma symptoms.134,299 However, ensuring that
the alternative green cleaning agents are still effective in reducing the spread of
infectious diseases is important and some sanitizing solutions, such as using only FDA-
approved sanitizers on food preparation surfaces, may be required by regulation.134
Thus, schools should develop a routine cleaning, sanitizing, and disinfecting schedule
252
VII. Additional Details Related to Goal 2: Achieve Healthy Schools
that details the green cleaning supplies and their respective procedures for use, as well
as additional tools that can promote clean surfaces such as walk-off mats, microfiber
cleaning cloths and mops, and HEPA or high-filtration vacuums.134
Statutes, Regulations, and Standards
The following statutes and regulations focus on the use, storage, and disposal of
chemicals and provide information on chemical requirements that will be useful to
schools.
Relevant Statutes
MA Hazardous Waste Management Act, Chapter 21C provides guidelines on how
hazardous waste should be managed and requires the establishment of a hazardous
waste advisory committee for the state of Massachusetts.354 It also includes guidelines
on hazardous waste collection, transportation, storage, treatment, and disposal.
MA Right-to-Know Act, Chapter 111F provides rights to public sector employees
regarding information on toxic and hazardous substances.355 Such rights include a
labeling requirement that states that containers with toxic or hazardous substances
must be labeled, a MSDS requirement that states public employers must maintain
MSDS for all hazardous materials, required annual training for employees working with
chemical products, and required Right-to-Know notices in the workplace.
MA Toxics Use Reduction Act, Chapter 21I promotes reducing the use of toxic
chemicals to protect public health and the environment.356 It includes requirements for
reporting and planning and a fee structure for facilities that use large amounts of toxic
chemicals. It also provides services such as education, training, grant programs, and
technical assistance.
Relevant Regulations
Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA): This regulation gives EPA the
authority to control hazardous waste including, generation, transportation, treatment,
storage, and disposal.357 Schools that generate hazardous waste are required to notify
EPA where waste will be tracked throughout its lifecycle.

Objective 2f. Reduce Exposure to Hazardous Substances
2f(1) Reduce Exposure to Lead in Paint and Soil
Methods and Best Practices
The following best practices focus on identifying sources of lead (outside of drinking
water) in schools and implementing daily practices that can reduce student’s exposure.
(1) Examine for lead paint and conduct renovations
In 1978, the Consumer Product Safety Commission banned the use of lead in paint;
thus, if a school building was built prior to 1978, there is a chance that lead-based paint
exists onsite.99–101 The interior and exterior surfaces of the building, along with the
surrounding soil, may be contaminated with flaking paint chips or dust containing lead
particles.99 Lead-based paint may also be present under newer layers of paint.100 The
only way to establish whether lead is present is to test. An accredited analytical
laboratory or state-certified inspector should be used to test paint and soil for lead.99,100
If lead is detected, current or future renovation plans should take that into consideration.
The Department of Labor Standards regulations require that (1) renovators provide a
pre-renovation notification, (2) all individuals conducting the renovations must be trained
and certified, and (3) lead-safe work practices must be followed and well documented if
the school is considered a child occupied facility.358 It is important to note that common
renovation activities such as sanding, cutting, and demolition increase the spread of and
subsequent exposure to lead particles.100 Thus, vacating the building during renovations
will likely be necessary.
(2) Implement a hand-washing routine after recess and before eating
Outside of inhaling contaminated dust, children are most likely to be exposed to lead via
hand-to-mouth activity.99 EPA has stated that washing hands with water and soap can
effectively mitigate lead exposure.359 Thus, it is essential to implement a hand-washing
routine after playing outside and before eating to reduce the amount of accessible lead
on children’s hands.101
Statutes, Regulations, and Standards
The following regulations focus on setting requirements for removing lead paint and
later renovations of buildings.
Relevant Regulations
105 CMR 460.000 establishes a statewide program for the prevention and control of
lead poisoning. The regulation includes restrictions on the use of lead-based paints and
glazes in school buildings.360
255
VII. Additional Details Related to Goal 2: Achieve Healthy Schools
454 CMR 22.00 establishes regulations that require deleading and lead safe renovation
requirements for residences and child-occupied facilities.358
TSCA Section 402 requires that activities related to preventing, detecting, and
eliminating hazards associated with lead-based paint are performed by properly trained
and certified individuals.361
TSCA Section 404 includes requirements on reporting and recordkeeping as it relates
to any activities relevant to TSCA section 402.361 Additionally, subsection G also
provides guidance on grants that can be awarded to renovate buildings with lead-based
paint.
TSCA Title 40, Chapter 1, Subchapter R, Part 745, Subpart E provides guidelines for
renovations performed in residential and child-occupied facilities.362 It also describes the
requirements of pre-renovation education/notification, the certification details and
responsibilities of renovators and sampling technicians, and work practice standards.

2f(2) Reduce Exposure to Mercury
Methods and Best Practices
The following best practices focus on identifying mercury sources in schools and
implementing safety plans in the event of a spill to reduce student exposure.
(1) Develop a mercury spill response plan
In schools where mercury-containing items are still in use, it is essential to minimize the
chance that students and staff become exposed.101 School administrators should create
and distribute a mercury spill response plan and train appropriate staff to implement it in
the event of a mercury spill.
Mercury is a toxic substance; if more than 2 tablespoons (approximately the size of an
adult male thumb) of mercury has spilled, this is considered an environmental
emergency.363 Call 911 or MassDEP’s 24/7

available. Mercury spill kits typically include a mercury absorbent or amalgamation
powder, clean-up tools, disposal bags, and appropriate PPE, such as thick nitrile gloves
and goggles.
258
VII. Additional Details Related to Goal 2: Achieve Healthy Schools
(3) Properly dispose of all mercury-containing items and replace with alternatives
where possible
It is important to identify all mercury-containing items present in schools and to begin
replacing them with alternatives wherever possible. An essential first step will be to
conduct an inventory and locate all mercury-containing items.101,365 These items may be
located in science, art, home economics, HVAC and plumbing, automotive, or nursing
and dental vocational classrooms.366,367 Additionally, they may be used throughout the
building or in medical/nurse’s offices.367
Some of these mercury-containing items include thermometers/thermostats,
barometers, hygrometers, hydrometers, manometers, vacuum gauges, spectral tubes,
molecular motion devices, sling psychrometers, sphygmomanometers, elemental
mercury, mercury-based compound solutions or powders, mercury gas law
apparatuses, and float control switches, such as those used on sump pumps, vermillion
paints, and fluorescent lamps.366,367 Alternative products and practices can be
introduced for each of these items. For example, digital, glass bulbs, spirit-filled, or
tympanic thermometers are all effective alternatives to mercury-containing
thermometers.367
As these products are replaced with alternatives, it is important to follow the appropriate
safety steps. Mercury-containing items should always be placed in non-breakable,
sealable containers and clearly labeled as hazardous before disposal.365 It is important
to use a licensed hazardous waste facility to recycle these items.365 If needed, there are
environmental service companies that can assist with removing mercury-containing
items from schools. Contact the MassDEP’s mercury hotline at 866-9MERCURY (866-
963-7287) for assistance.136
Statutes, Regulations, and Standards
The following statutes and regulations set requirements for the use, storage, and
disposal of mercury-containing items.
Relevant Statutes
M.G.L., c. 21H, § 6G restricts school from purchasing mercury-containing items to be
used in the classroom.368 Thermometers and measuring devices may be excluded if no
adequate alternative exists.368 Section 6G does not apply to the sale of mercury-
containing lamps.368
M.G.L., c. 21H, § 6I restricts entities from knowingly disposing of mercury-containing
items in a manner other than recycling, disposing as hazardous waste, or other state-
approved methods.369 Section 6I also calls for mandatory education on proper disposal
of mercury-containing items for all citizens.369
259
VII. Additional Details Related to Goal 2: Achieve Healthy Schools
Relevant Regulations
RCRA requires that EPA manage hazardous waste, including waste generated from the
use, storage, and disposal of mercury-containing items.370 Before these items can be
disposed of, they must meet EPA’s treatment and recycling standards. Current
regulations require that low-mercury waste (<260 mg/kg total mercury) be treated to
achieve 0.025 mg/L, as measured using the Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure
(TCLP).371 Note that high-mercury waste (>260 mg/kg total mercury) must undergo
retorting or roasting where the residuals produced after thermal processing must
achieve 0.20 mg/L TCLP.371

Objective 2g. Safely Procure, Use, and Dispose of Crumb Rubber
Methods and Best Practices
This section summarizes the methods and best practices related to the procurement,
use, and disposal of ATFs containing crumb rubber. The first section presents best
practices for schools deciding whether to use an ATF and managing its use and
disposal. The second section includes best practices for students, staff members,
coaches, and families who play or attend events on ATFs.
Considerations and Practices for School Decision Makers and Field Maintenance
Staff
This section discusses practices for schools deciding on whether or not to use ATFs
and managing the use and disposal of an existing ATF.
(1) Consider the pros and cons of ATFs and natural grass when planning for field
upgrades
When considering whether to install an ATF or natural grass playing field, school
decision makers should consider the pros and cons of each. Materials in the resources

Section 82:
section below may be helpful. School leaders should consider the following factors:
installation and maintenance costs; individuals responsible for field maintenance;
lifespan; disposal cost of an ATF; amount of space available; the direction and flow of
runoff; whether small children will often be at this field; the typical temperatures during
the sports season; the possibility of the urban heat island effect increasing temperature;
the amount of use needed; and the availability of alternative fields if it rains. While some
municipalities have banned ATFs, no statutes or regulations address ATFs at the state
level; however, the Toxics Use Reduction Institute at UMass Lowell has identified
organically managed natural grass as a safer alternative for sports surfaces.138,372
(2) Plan for and implement routine ATF maintenance
If a school has an ATF, it is essential to plan for and maintain it to keep it safe for
students, staff members, and the environment. Maintenance may include disinfection;
seam repairs; watering to lower temperatures on hot days; and fluffing, redistributing,
shock testing, and replacing infill.372 Over time, the shock absorbency of ATFs declines,
meaning older turf can be less forgiving on joints and upon impact.139,372 Regular
maintenance and repair can help reduce the extent to which an ATF may contribute to
injuries.
(3) Plan for and conduct proper disposal of ATFs at the end of their lifespan
Any school district that has an ATF or is planning to install one should plan for end-of-
life disposal and the associated costs. Most municipalities have contractual
arrangements with waste haulers, but those contracts may have restrictions on the
types or volumes of waste. Disposal costs for ATFs will vary by waste contractor but
261
VII. Additional Details Related to Goal 2: Achieve Healthy Schools
may be substantial due to the size of an ATF. Improperly discarded ATF materials have
been found in Massachusetts and have contaminated nearby streams with crumb
rubber pellets and leached chemicals.373
Considerations and Practices for Students, Staff Members, and Families Playing
on ATFs
Best practices discussed in this section apply to students, staff members, coaches,
families, and school leaders when using ATFs for sporting events.
(4) Wear shoes on ATFs at all times
Wearing shoes eliminates dermal exposure to ATFs, which occurs when barefoot.137 It
also reduces the likelihood of getting crumb rubber stuck between the toes and tracking
it into the home. This applies to students playing on the field, friends, family, and
especially to any young children attending a sporting event.
(5) Do not swallow or allow small children to swallow crumb rubber
Students, staff members, and spectators should not swallow crumb rubber that
accidentally enters the mouth.137 If students playing on an ATF fall and get crumb
rubber or plastic grass particles in their mouths, encourage them to spit it out. Monitor
young children on ATFs to prevent them from swallowing or picking up crumb rubber
particles.
(6) Increase ventilation at indoor ATF facilities
If an ATF is located indoors, increase ventilation if possible by opening windows and
doors, turning on fans, and circulating air with outdoor air.137 Indoor use of an ATF is
generally thought to retain VOCs, SVOCs, or microplastic particles emitted by the ATF
closer to the ground level where students play compared to outdoors where emissions
are dissipated.
(7) Raise awareness of and protect against extreme heat exposure
In sunny, warm weather, the temperature of an ATF can be much hotter than the
temperature of the air on natural grass fields, causing it to act as a heat island.137,374
The hot temperature of an ATF can burn skin, damage equipment, and increase the risk
of heat-related illness.372 There are several methods to determine the temperature
around ATFs. One heat metric, wet bulb globe temperature (WBGT), accounts for
ambient air temperature, relative humidity, wind, and solar radiation, which can be
helpful given that solar radiation heats ATFs. The Massachusetts Interscholastic Athletic
Association 2019 heat policy is based on WBGT. However, WBGT does not capture the
temperature of an ATF itself, so athletic staff may also want to measure the temperature
of the ATF directly.372
Coaches and other staff should be educated about recognizing and preventing heat-
related illnesses.372 Prevention may mean providing additional water and shade breaks,
262
VII. Additional Details Related to Goal 2: Achieve Healthy Schools
monitoring for symptoms, changing practice times, and establishing a temperature and
humidity threshold above which sporting activities on ATFs are canceled. Evidence
shows that irrigating ATFs can reduce field temperatures for a short time, but
temperatures rebound quickly in sunny conditions.372,374 There is no standard approach
to mitigating the intense heat that can be observed on ATFs, so each school should
take appropriate steps to raise awareness of the ATF’s heat, reduce ATF temperature,
and prevent heat-related illness among students.
(8) Minimize passive recreation on ATFs
Minimize passive recreation on an ATF, such as laying and sitting.137 Such activities put
people physically closer to the ATF than playing sports and, unlike sporting practices
and games, they are activities that do not have to happen on sports fields.
(9) Clean hands, clothing, equipment, and turf burns after playing on ATFs
School staff, athletic staff, and coaches should encourage students to clean up properly
after playing on an ATF. Students should wash their hands after playing on an ATF and
before eating, especially younger children who may have had more contact with the
ground. When students arrive at home or go back to school, they should take off their
shoes before going indoors to prevent tracking crumb rubber indoors. Students and
parents should clean all clothes and equipment used on an ATF. If students have turf
burns from falls on an ATF, they should be cleaned with soap and water.137
Statutes, Regulations, and Standards
No federal or state regulations or standards currently exist for ATFs.4

Objective 2h. Create a Safe Environment for Students with Life-
Threatening Food Allergies
Methods and Best Practices
This section presents methods and best practices for creating a safe environment for
students with life-threatening food allergies related to developing written protocols,
ensuring preparedness, and implementing prevention measures. Each of these
methods and best practices are described in more detail below.
Develop Written Protocols
The following best practices concern creating plans for allergy planning and
management.
(1) Develop an allergy management and prevention plan
School nurses should consider leading an interdisciplinary team to develop and
implement an allergy management and prevention plan.375 If schools are claiming
exemption from other requirements of 105 CMR 590.011, schools must have written
protocols and procedures for identifying, documenting, and accommodating students
with food allergies. Allergy management and prevention plans should include cafeteria,
classroom environmental, custodial, and emergency response protocols and guidelines.
As necessary, allergen-free spaces should be designated in the cafeteria and in
classrooms. Among other components, the plan should specify cleaning products and
hand-washing protocols.144
(2) Develop and maintain individual health care plans
School nurses should maintain individual care plans for students with life-threatening
allergies, which should include the actions to take if an allergic reaction occurs. Written
504 plans (plans to give kids with disabilities the support they need at school)
personalized for each student with life-threatening allergies should also be written and
implemented as appropriate.376 As deemed necessary by school nurses, other school
personnel supervising or providing services to the student in a high-risk setting (e.g., the
cafeteria) should review and be aware of care plans.144
264
VII. Additional Details Related to Goal 2: Achieve Healthy Schools
Facilitate Food Allergy Preparedness
The following best practices help schools prepare for severe allergic reactions.
(3) Conduct training on life-threatening allergies and emergency response
All staff who supervise students must receive basic training on life-threatening allergies
and have education on the prevention and management of allergic conditions as it
relates to their assigned duties.144,375 The training must meet DESE and DPH
requirements.
(4) Maintain a supply of epinephrine auto-injectors in a secure location
Each school should maintain an unexpired supply of epinephrine auto-injectors in a
secure, unlocked location. All personnel approved to administer epinephrine to students
should know of and have access to this location.144 School bus drivers must receive
training on the administration of epinephrine.377
Implement Prevention Measures
The following best practices can be implemented to reduce the likelihood that exposure
to an allergen will cause an incident of anaphylactic shock at school.
(5) Prohibit eating food on school buses or in classrooms
To limit potential exposures, eating food on school buses should be prohibited, where
possible. In addition, eating food in classrooms should be prohibited or limited to labeled
approved foods. If food is allowed in classrooms, do not allow students to share food
and encourage hand-washing before the consumption of food.144,375
(6) Prevent cross-contact in food
Cross-contact is the transfer of food allergens from one surface or food to another
surface or food and can occur during food storage, preparation, or serving, as well as
during dish cleaning or dining. Schools must create protocols to prevent cross-contact
to protect people with food allergies. Measures to prevent cross-contact include storing
allergen-free foods in a designated space; designating an allergen-free food preparation
zone; fully cleaning and sanitizing containers, food preparation tools, and surfaces after
each use with warm, soapy water; following strict hygiene procedures; discouraging
students from sharing food; cleaning cafeteria tables after each use; and encouraging
proper hand hygiene. In addition, allergen-free foods should be prepared before any
allergen-containing foods.144,375
(7) Display a food allergen awareness poster
As required in M.G.L. c. 140, § 6B, schools must display an approved allergen
awareness poster in food preparation areas to remind food preparation personnel of the
importance of allergy-safe spaces and of common food allergens.378
265
VII. Additional Details Related to Goal 2: Achieve Healthy Schools
Statutes, Regulations, and Standards
Statutes, regulations, and standards related to creating a safe environment for students
with life-threatening food allergies are detailed below.
Relevant Statutes
M.G.L. c. 90, § 8A requires all licensed school bus drivers to complete a pre-service
school bus driver training, including a basic first aid course including instruction on the
administration of an epinephrine auto-injector.377
M.G.L. c. 71, § 55A limits the liability of public school employees who administer first
aid in good faith as a result of their actions or omissions of first aid. M.G.L c. 90, § 8A
specifically notes that this also applies to bus drivers providing first aid, including
administration of an epinephrine auto-injector.379
M.G.L. c. 140, § 6B establishes food allergy awareness protocols for licensed food
sellers. Requirements include the prominent display of a food allergy awareness poster,
notice on all menus of the customer’s obligation to inform the server about food
allergies, and manager training on food allergies. Schools approved to participate in
USDA Child Nutrition Programs may qualify for an exemption from parts of this law if
schools can demonstrate the following:380
• There are written policies and procedures for identifying, documenting, and
accommodating students with food allergies.
• There is documentation verifying participation in food allergen training that is
recognized by DESE and DPH.
Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), Title II prohibits discrimination against
qualified individuals with disabilities participating in state and local government
programs and services, including public schools. Life-threatening allergies are
considered disabilities, and all public and charter schools are covered under this act.155
Rehabilitation Act of 1973, Section 504 enables individuals with a disability to fully
participate in and receive the benefits of any program receiving federal financial
assistance. Life-threatening allergies are considered disabilities, and most public
schools will receive federal funding of some nature, including national school meal
programs. 381
Relevant Regulations
105 CMR 210.100 governs the administration of prescription medications in public and
private schools in Massachusetts. Any properly trained school personnel may
administer epinephrine in cases where the school nurse is not available, provided the
school district registers with DPH.382
266
VII. Additional Details Related to Goal 2: Achieve Healthy Schools
105 CMR 590.011 contains food allergy awareness requirements for all Massachusetts
food establishments.383 This regulation requires display of a food allergen poster, a
notice requesting a customer to make the food establishment aware of an allergen, and
mandatory training requirements. Public and private schools and educational institutions
are exempt from these requirements if they are approved to participate in USDA Child
Nutrition Programs. However, regardless of their participation in the USDA programs,
schools must train employees in food allergy awareness and provide written policies
and procedures for identifying and accommodating students with food allergies and
documentation verifying participation in food allergen training satisfying DESE and DPH
requirements.
CFR Title 10, Subtitle B, Chapter II, Subchapter A, Part 210 (National School
Lunch Program) requires schools (as a condition for receiving federal reimbursement
for school meals) to make substitutions for students whose disability restricts their diet
and for students who cannot consume the regular lunch or afterschool snack because
of medical or other special dietary needs. A physician or other recognized medical
authority must provide a signed statement to make substitutions.384

Students
2i(1) Optimize Lighting
Methods and Best Practices
The following best practices focus on enhancing natural and artificial lighting in schools
to promote visual comfort in the classroom.
268
VII. Additional Details Related to Goal 2: Achieve Healthy Schools
(1) Integrate both natural and artificial lighting throughout schools
High-quality lighting in the classroom should come from both natural and artificial
sources because natural light can promote health benefits while artificial light can
ensure appropriate illuminance.145,385 The direction and amount of daylight that enters a
space should be taken into account when designing the overall lighting system in the
classroom.145 Controls should be available to dim or turn off artificial lighting when
sufficient daylight is available, and window shades should be available when daylight is
excessive.145
(2) Consider illuminance, color temperature, and glare
In addition to natural and artificial lighting sources, it is important to consider factors
such as illuminance, color temperature, and glare. An illuminance level of 350 lux is
recommended for reading text in a normal-sized font with ease.120 Research suggests,
however, that 500-1,000 lux is more appropriate for the classroom.385 Additionally, color
temperature, measured as the thermal temperature of a light source, should be low to
better mimic natural daylight.120,385 Lastly, efforts should be taken to reduce or eliminate
glare by considering how light enters the classroom and where it may hit reflective
surfaces.145 Further, using shades and blinds to control the amount of natural light that
enters or modifying the brightness level of artificial light can be effective for minimizing
glare.
Statutes, Regulations, and Standards
The following standard is focused on promoting high-quality lighting in educational
facilities.
Relevant Standards

2i(2) Optimize Acoustic Performance
Methods and Best Practices
The following best practice focuses on creating optimal acoustic performance in the
classroom by reducing reverberation time and background noise.
(1) Reduce Sound Reverberation Time and Minimize Background Noise in
Classrooms
Schools should reduce sound

percent of the sound waves that
strike the material is absorbed.387
270
VII. Additional Details Related to Goal 2: Achieve Healthy Schools
Further, ceiling panels should have a high ceiling attenuation class value to reduce the
noise traveling through walls.387 Walls should also be constructed with sufficient
insulation to reduce noise transmission.388 Flooring can also assist in absorbing sound
waves; for example, carpeting, in particular, can reduce overall background noise.387
Lastly, HVAC units can be one of the primary sources of background noise in a
classroom.145,387 Centralized systems have reduced noise levels as compared to window
units; thus, these systems should be employed where possible, and air handlers or any
other equipment should be installed away from classrooms and near inherently noisy
areas such as cafeterias and gymnasiums.387
Statutes, Regulations, and Standards
The following standard addresses classroom acoustics and sets limits for optimal
speech intelligibility.

Objective 2j. Design the Built Environment to Foster a Peaceful
School Community
Methods and Best Practices
Methods and best practices for designing the built environment to foster a peaceful
school community are organized into three categories. The first focuses on reducing
stressors resulting from the built environment, the second focuses on designing spaces
in school buildings to support overall well-being, and the third focuses on designing
spaces that facilitate positive social interactions at school.
271
VII. Additional Details Related to Goal 2: Achieve Healthy Schools
Reduce Stressors
Reducing stressors from the built environment reduces tension experienced by students
and school staff members, an important step to facilitate a peaceful atmosphere.
Schools can reduce stressors associated with the built environment by reducing
crowding and environmental stressors.
(1) Reduce crowding
Crowding in schools can increase stress and the likelihood of pushing/shoving, leading
to further negative outcomes. 389–391 Schools should provide building spaces that are
sufficiently wide enough to accommodate students and staff members to reduce
crowding and resulting adverse outcomes. Areas to focus on include bathrooms, locker
rooms, hallways, stairways, entrances and exits to buildings, classrooms, and other
school spaces.
(2) Reduce environmental stressors
Environmental stressors such as noise, excessive lighting, poor air quality, and
uncomfortable temperatures are, by definition, stressful to the human body. Optimizing
environmental conditions reduces these stressors and improves well-being.392–394 Best
practices include using natural lighting through windows and skylights, acoustics to
minimize stressful noises, maintaining thermal comfort, and ensuring air is free of
pollutants or unpleasant odors. See Objective 2a. Improve Air Quality, Objective 2c.
Maintain Thermal Comfort, and Objective 2i. Create a Productive Learning Environment
for All Students for additional details and best practices for mitigating this collection of
environmental stressors.
Design Spaces to Support Wellbeing
Designing spaces to support wellbeing promotes positive experiences within the school
environment and enables students and staff members to be at their best, which, in turn,
supports a peaceful school community. Schools can meet this objective by providing
spaces to support neurocognitive balance, incorporating access to both indoor and
outdoor nature, and using colors and textures that promote a peaceful environment.
(3) Provide spaces to support neurocognitive balance
Indoor and outdoor facility design can calm or activate people’s neurological and
cognitive systems in various ways—by promoting alertness, agitation, vigilance,
distraction and calmness. For schools, the design goal is two-fold: to design facilities
that support neurocognitive balance and, where possible, to provide specific spaces that
are calming (when students’ minds and nervous systems are over-activated) or
activating (when students’ minds and nervous systems are shut down).392,393 In addition,
some students benefit from indoor and outdoor spaces that satisfy their need for
physical movement. See Objective 3b. Prioritize Universal Accessibility for additional
discussion of the design of neuro-inclusive spaces.
272
VII. Additional Details Related to Goal 2: Achieve Healthy Schools
(4) Incorporate access to both indoor and outdoor nature
Schools should provide students and staff with access to nature in diverse forms (e.g.,
visual, tactile). This can include nature-related art, windows with nature views, and live
plantings—both indoors and outdoors. Access to nature has been shown to have
important stress-relieving benefits and supports overall wellbeing,389,393–395 which in turn
contributes to a peaceful community.
(5) Use colors and textures that promote a peaceful environment
Color choices and textures facilitate calming environments supportive of learning and
positive interactions.392,395 Schools should incorporate textures and colors appropriate
for each space, considering how these materials will impact students’ experiences.
Design Spaces to Facilitate Positive Social Interactions
Designing spaces to facilitate positive social interactions supports the type of
engagement that fosters a sense of community within the school. Schools can achieve
these design goals by providing diverse communal spaces and designing spaces for
students and staff members to move easily.
(6) Provide diverse communal spaces
Schools should provide diverse communal spaces to facilitate positive engagement
among students and staff members. Spaces of different shapes, sizes, and purposes
will allow students with different needs to engage with others in a safe space.
(7) Design spaces for easy movement
Feeling safe is a critical component of promoting positive social engagement. Schools
should use care in the layout of school buildings to design spaces that facilitate easy
movement of students and staff. Layouts that can trap students in a corner or nook can
make them feel less safe, given the loss of freedom of movement. While designing
space, consider traffic patterns in areas of congestion (e.g., hallways, stairwells).
Statutes, Regulations, and Standards
Statutes, regulations, and standards provide baseline requirements and expectations for
topics relevant to fostering a peaceful school community. These include fire regulations,
building code occupancy limits, and minimum standards regarding environmental
conditions such as temperature, noise, air quality, and lighting. These frameworks are
designed with a different objective than the primary objective of fostering a peaceful
school community, which goes far beyond the minimum expectations of specific statutes
and regulations. Therefore, these are not covered in detail in this section. See Objective
2a. Improve Air Quality; Objective 2c. Maintain Thermal Comfort; and Objective 2i.

VIII. Additional Details Related to Goal 3: Achieve Equitable Outcomes for All Students
Objective 3a. Optimize Space to Equitably Meet Special Education
Needs
Methods and Best Practices
This section summarizes the methods and best practices for optimizing space to meet
special education needs equitably in schools.
(1) Design inclusive classrooms
Inclusion classrooms contain students with and without disabilities, incorporating
supports for students in need of special education services. Students who receive
special education in a full inclusion setting spend 80 to 100 percent of their day in a
general education setting, while students with partial inclusion spend 40 to 80 percent of
their day in general education.396 Inclusion classrooms are often, but not always, the
least restrictive learning environment for students receiving special education. In
Massachusetts, 18 percent of students are eligible for special education services; of
those students, approximately 60 percent are placed in an inclusion classroom.397
Inclusion classrooms benefit students both with and without disabilities. A review of
special education in Massachusetts found that students with disabilities placed in
inclusion settings were five times more likely to graduate high school in five years or
fewer compared to their peers placed in substantially separate settings.149 A study
completed in 2021 found that students without disabilities also benefit from inclusion
classrooms.398 Maximizing the impact of inclusive classrooms requires designing
classrooms with diverse learning needs in mind.
Student placement should always be based on individual needs rather than available
space.153 Existing schools are somewhat limited by existing classroom space; however,
schools undergoing renovations or being newly constructed should prioritize designing
inclusive classrooms. Inclusion classrooms should be large enough to accommodate
push-in services, like small breakout groups.396 When pull-out services are required,
resource rooms, which can be smaller, should be in the vicinity of general
classrooms.396
In some cases, substantially separate classrooms are the most appropriate learning
environment to meet student needs. Inclusion practices for substantially separate
classrooms involve locating these classrooms within general education neighborhoods,
ensuring rooms are the same size as general education classrooms, and placing
students of similar ages and grade levels together.396 Additionally, gymnasiums,
auditoriums, art rooms, and any other room that might supplement general education
should be accessible to students in substantially separate settings to maximize inclusion
opportunities when appropriate.
276
VIII. Additional Details Related to Goal 3: Achieve Equitable Outcomes for All Students
(2) Avoid clustering special education spaces
Massachusetts state regulations require that all eligible students have access to the
school facilities necessary for implementing a student’s IEP.399 State regulation also
requires that steps are taken to minimize the stigmatization of students receiving special
education.399 Classrooms designed to serve students with disabilities, like resource
rooms or substantially separate classrooms, should never be clustered away from the
age-appropriate general education neighborhood.396,399 To meet the LRE mandate,
schools must ensure every student, regardless of disability, has access to the general
education curriculum and environment whenever possible. Special education
classrooms should not be identifiable by signs or other means that differentiate them
from classrooms that serve non-disabled students.399
Existing schools should evaluate how classrooms are dispersed throughout the school
to determine if special education classrooms are clustered or located outside of age-
appropriate classroom neighborhoods. This evaluation should also ensure that special
education classrooms are not identified by signs or other means that stigmatize
students.
Schools undergoing renovation and new schools should plan classroom neighborhoods
to maximize the inclusion of special education services. These schools should consult
with UD experts (see best practice 3) to develop plans that optimize the school layout
so every student can access the general education environment, where appropriate.
Gymnasiums, auditoriums, and other elective classrooms and extracurricular spaces
should be accessible to every student in the school community, including students in
substantially separate classrooms.
(3) Prioritize principles of universal design
UD challenges the typical design approach for the “average user” and focuses on
developing designs with accessibility at the forefront.400 This is accomplished by
creating designs and products that are usable, accessible, and inclusive.400 Universal
design in learning (UDL) is an instructional approach aimed at creating a more inclusive
learning environment by providing adequate accommodations and eliminating
unnecessary barriers to the learning process.401,402 Together, UD and UDL improve
accessibility by guiding the development of buildings as well as the development of
computers, computer software, curriculum, instruction, and a host of other products and
services. Schools that incorporate principles of UD and UDL are better equipped to
serve students, staff members, and visitors with and without disabilities.400,403
Existing schools are limited by their physical structure and layout; however, there are
still ways to incorporate UD and UDL without renovations, especially in classroom
settings.404,405 Classrooms can be equipped with more physically accessible furniture
and furniture layouts. This can include upgrading to larger desks and ensuring desks
and chairs are not connected. Some resources for removing existing barriers and
incorporating elements of UD are included in Table 95.
277
VIII. Additional Details Related to Goal 3: Achieve Equitable Outcomes for All Students
Schools undergoing extensive renovations and newly constructed schools should
incorporate UD from the planning stage. The construction of Danahey Park in
Cambridge, MA, is an example of a project that incorporated UD from the planning
stage—ensuring the park is physically accessible while also accommodating the
sensory, cognitive, and emotional needs of users.406
(4) Collaborate within and across districts
With adequate planning, larger school districts in urban and suburban areas can ensure
that most students receive placements in the LRE within their district. Only some
schools will be able to serve students with the highest needs; with proper planning,
however, school districts can coordinate the placement of special education services
throughout the district. These services should be dispersed across the district to ease
accessibility for all.
In some cases, districts may only be able to meet the needs of some students. This is
more common in smaller and rural districts with limited resources; however, this can
also be challenging for larger districts. Collaboration across districts can help maximize
efficiencies when serving students with the highest needs. Massachusetts has 24
Education Collaboratives across the Commonwealth designed to increase regional
capacity and resources.407 Similar coordination should occur across collaboratives to
meet every student’s needs. When out-of-district placements are determined to be the
best option for servicing a student’s IEP and transportation is a requirement on the
student’s IEP, the student is entitled to receive transportation.151
Statutes, Regulations, and Standards
Relevant Statutes
M.G.L., c.71B: Children with Special Needs guarantees all school-aged children
(ages 3 to 21) in Massachusetts a “free and appropriate public education in the least
restrictive environment” regardless of disability.152 This statute is formerly known as
M.G.L. c.766, which pre-dated federal special education legislation.152
20 U.S.C §§ 1400-1482 Individuals with Disabilities in Education Act guarantees
free and appropriate public education to all eligible children with disabilities throughout
the nation. This statute protects the rights of children with disabilities and assists states,
localities, and other entities with providing those services.150

CFR Part 300 et seq) in Massachusetts schools so students receive services designed
to develop their individual potential in the least restrictive environment.151,399
34 CFR Part 300: Assistance to States for the Education of Children requires that
children with disabilities receive educational and other services in the least restrictive
environment. Removal of a student from an inclusion setting only happens if inclusion
cannot be achieved with supplementary aids and services due to the nature or severity
of the disability.409
Relevant Standards
Continuum of alternative services and placements: School districts must provide or
arrange for the placement of each student in an educational setting appropriate for their
learning needs from the time they are three to 21 years old.410
Equal opportunity to participate in educational, nonacademic, extracurricular, and
ancillary programs, as well as participation in regular education: Students
receiving special education in both inclusion and substantially separate settings must
have equal opportunity to participate in additional programs, classes, and extra-
curricular activities offered to students in a general education setting.410
Least restrictive program selected: Students must be placed in programming with the
least restrictive environment. If a student is removed from the general education
classroom, there must be a clear explanation for why the less restrictive environment is
appropriate for the student’s needs.410
MA Local Education Agency (LEA) Special Education Determinations: DESE
determines the needs for assistance or intervention in special education for every Local
Education Agency (LEA). LEAs are scored based on performance and compliance data

VIII. Additional Details Related to Goal 3: Achieve Equitable Outcomes for All Students
Objective 3b. Prioritize Universal Accessibility
Methods and Best Practices
This section describes the methods and best practices for prioritizing universal
accessibility in schools. Prioritizing universal accessibility is addressed in three sections:
• Physical Disabilities: Design Physically Accessible Spaces
• Transgender, Non-Binary, and Intersex Experience: Design Gender-Inclusive
Spaces
• Neurodivergence: Design Neuro-Inclusive Spaces
Physical Disabilities: Design Physically Accessible Spaces
This section describes the methods and best practices for creating accessible and safe
spaces for students with physical disabilities.
(1) Evaluate barriers to physical access
Ensuring physical accessibility in schools is necessary to meet legal requirements and
to guarantee students full access to the school community. By minimizing barriers to
physical access, school districts across Massachusetts can better serve their students.
Minimizing barriers to physical access requires understanding the barriers that exist.
Not all physical barriers are legal violations since the ADA includes certain exemptions;
however, ensuring all students have equal access to a free education in a least
restrictive environment requires school districts to minimize as many physical barriers to
learning as possible. Whether a school is planning to undergo renovations or not,
school districts, administrators, educators, and other staff members should be aware of
existing barriers to physical access and develop plans to mitigate or eliminate those
barriers.404 It’s important to note that not every solution will work for every school or
classroom; however, all schools should strive to improve physical accessibility
whenever feasible.
There are formal and informal methods to evaluate the physical accessibility of the
school. Formal audits of school accessibility can be costly. However, schools or school
districts can perform evaluations using in-house staff and resources. The “ADA
Checklist for Existing Facilities” (see Table 97) is a helpful checklist that summarizes the
accessibility requirements in the Department of Justice’s ADA Title II regulations,
28CFR Part 35.150.412 This checklist includes information on how to use the checklist
and conduct the survey, as well as post-survey activities. Since the survey was
developed for use in multiple places of public accommodation, not every section of the
survey is relevant to school facilities. Moreover, the survey does not cover classroom-
specific features, such as ensuring accessible paths through desks and lab spaces,
which schools should also consider.
281
VIII. Additional Details Related to Goal 3: Achieve Equitable Outcomes for All Students
(2) Prioritize universal access to school buildings
No two schools will have the same results following an accessibility evaluation. The
ADA Checklist covers many of the barriers to physical access that schools need to
address. A study from the U.S. Government Accountability Office on the accessibility of
school facilities found that two-thirds of school districts identified barriers that can limit
access to people with disabilities in a quarter or more of their school facilities.413 The top
five barriers found across school facilities are listed below.413
• Lack of accessible signs
• Playground barriers (e.g., mulch or other ground surface barriers)
• Door hardware that requires tight grasping, pinching, or twisting of wrist
• Assembly stages requiring steps
• Restroom barriers (e.g., lack of bathroom grab bars or exposed sink pipes)
The following are best practices schools should consider to provide universal access.
(2a) Update signage
ADA Standards call for accessible signs to identify spaces and accessibility elements in
public areas.414 Schools should update or add visual and tactile signs to identify
permanent rooms and spaces, provide directional information, indicate accessibility, and
highlight means of egress in compliance with ADA Sign Standards.
(2b) Update door handles
ADA Standards require door handles to be operable with one hand, not require tight
grasping, pinching, or twisting of the wrist, operate with five pounds of maximum force,
and be located 34-48 inches off the ground.415 Schools with non-compliant door handles
should invest in upgrades.
(2c) Update doors (i.e., remove heavy doors, add automatic door openers, etc.)
Doors and gates that provide accessible routes for user passage are required to comply
with ADA Standards. Compliance guidelines for doors and entryways cover
requirements for maneuvering clearance, thresholds, surface texture, hardware,
viewing, opening force, and closing speed.415
(2d) Add ramps and chair lifts
Ramps and chair lifts can help make entryways more accessible when modifying the
building or adding an elevator is not possible. ADA Standards define the necessary
safety elements, slope, and landing requirements for ramps,416 as well as the
requirements for lifts.417
282
VIII. Additional Details Related to Goal 3: Achieve Equitable Outcomes for All Students
(2e) Update bathroom infrastructure (i.e., sinks, stalls, etc.)
Bathrooms that do not meet ADA Standards should be altered for compliance. Existing
facilities have multiple avenues for ensuring adequate access to ADA-compliant
bathrooms.418 Bathroom updates for accessibility can also incorporate design elements
to increase gender-inclusive access to maximize the benefits of updates.
Transgender, Non-Binary, and Intersex Experience: Design Gender-Inclusive
Spaces
This section describes the methods and best practices for creating safe and inclusive
school environments for transgender, non-binary, and intersex students.
(3) Evaluate gender-based rules, policies, and practices
Students in Massachusetts are protected from discrimination based on gender identity
and sexual orientation.156,419 Schools and school districts should review their policies
and procedures to eliminate rules that perpetuate gender-based discrimination. This
includes examining policies around student records, bathroom and changing facility
access, dress codes, and any other gender-based policies.
(4) Provide access to gender-inclusive restrooms, locker rooms, and changing
facilities
All students should have access to a restroom, locker room, and changing facility that
aligns with their gender identity. If students do not feel safe accessing a facility, an
appropriate alternative should be made available. For existing facilities, this can include
changing a staff restroom to an all-gender restroom or providing access to the restroom
in the nurse’s office.
Newly constructed and renovated schools should strive to incorporate UD principles
from the planning stage forward. Restrooms, locker rooms, and changing facilities
designed around gender inclusion benefit everyone because they increase privacy,
physical accessibility, and safety.420
Neurodivergence: Design Neuro-Inclusive Spaces
This section describes the methods and best practices for creating safe and inclusive
school environments for neurodivergent students.
(5) Evaluate the school’s sensory landscape
Students spend much of their day at school. The sensory environment of a school
impacts all students; however, for some neurodivergent students, the sensory
environment has a larger impact.421,422 The sensory environment includes the school
building’s visual, auditory, and tactile stimuli. Currently, there are no readily available
sensory evaluation guides, but there is information on how to create sensory-friendly
environments that can inform how to design for the sensory experience (see Table 97).
283
VIII. Additional Details Related to Goal 3: Achieve Equitable Outcomes for All Students
(6) Design with sensory experiences in mind
Designing spaces to accommodate the sensory needs of neurodiverse students
benefits all students. Existing schools will be limited when addressing specific sensory
needs since the physical environment is somewhat set. Existing schools can prioritize
minimizing excessive visual, auditory, and tactile stimuli where possible. This can
involve replacing harsh light fixtures, installing sound-dampening materials, and
changing other elements of the environment (see Objective 2i. Create a Productive
Learning Environment for All Students for additional details about optimized lighting and
acoustics). In addition to making these changes, existing schools can create sensory
spaces designed to support the needs of neurodivergent students best.423
Newly constructed and renovated schools should consult experts on creating sensory-
friendly spaces throughout the school. From hallways to cafeterias and classrooms,
every student deserves to be in an environment designed to meet their needs.
Thoughtfully designing with neuro-inclusion can help decrease changes necessitated by
overstimulation and increase the time students spend with their peers focusing on the
task at hand, whether that is eating lunch, playing at recess, or learning in the
classroom.424

during their course of study at public schools and that public schools do not discriminate
based on race, color, sex, gender identity, religion, national origin, or sexual orientation.
This law takes precedence over any local law or rule or organization’s regulation that
discriminates on the aforementioned basis.419
28 CFR Part 35, Title II Regulations, Nondiscrimination on the Basis of Disability
in State and Local Government guarantees the rights of people with disabilities to fully
participate in all aspects of civic life by requiring all state and local governments to
follow ADA regulations regardless of municipality’s size.412
28 CFR Part 36, Title III Regulations, Nondiscrimination on the Basis of Disability
by Public Accommodations and in Commercial Facilities guarantees the rights of
people with disabilities to participate fully in all aspects of life by requiring most
businesses to follow ADA regulations regardless of the size of their business or the age
of the building.427
34 CFR Part 106, Title IX Regulations, requires the adoption of grievance procedures
to ensure complaints of sexual discrimination receive fair, prompt, and equitable
resolutions. Expands the meaning and clarifies the definition of sex discrimination to
include discrimination based on sex stereotypes, sex characteristics, pregnancy or
related conditions, sexual orientation, and gender identity.428
Relevant Standards
2010 ADA Standards for Accessible Design describes the requirements that must be
met when constructing new buildings and facilities or altering existing buildings and
facilities. Defines architectural barriers and explains how to remove them without
difficulty or expense to an existing building.429

IX. Conclusion
Massachusetts led the nation with the creation of the oldest public school system in the
United States. While that legacy is a testament to our commitment to the betterment of
our citizens, this legacy also leads to Massachusetts having an antiquated school
infrastructure that is dispersed across a range of geographic locations including urban,
rural, and those close to industrial activity. As this report demonstrates, the complexity
and the interdependency of the types of problems these schools and districts face, as
well as the complexity and interdependencies of the short-term and long-term solutions
to address these problems is highly variable and, in some instances, require significant
resources. This document strives to provide both high-level and detailed explanations of
strategies to help Massachusetts schools incorporate sustainable design, construction,
and operations and provide a healthy environment for all staff and students.

Methods, Best Practices, and Standards for Achieving Green and Healthy Schools in the Commonwealth
of Massachusetts
Legislative Mandate
The following report is hereby issued pursuant to Chapter 179 of the Acts of 2022,
Section 83 as follows:
SECTION 83. (a) The Massachusetts School Building Authority shall conduct an
assessment of elementary and secondary school buildings relative to energy efficiency,
building conditions, safety, and public health. The assessment shall include cataloging
the age and condition of any building systems relying on the on-site combustion of fossil
fuels. The assessment shall be conducted in coordination with ongoing assessments or
surveys of the authority. The authority shall determine the means of conducting the
assessment which may include a representative sample of schools. In planning said
assessment, the authority shall consult with the department of public health, the
department of elementary and secondary education and the department of energy
resources.
Following completion of the assessment, the department of public health, in consultation
with the Massachusetts School Building Authority, the department of elementary and
secondary education, and the department of energy resources, shall develop, and
report on, methods, best practices, and standards for achieving green and healthy
schools strategies to for (sic) the students of the commonwealth. Methods, best
practices, and standards may involve, but shall not be limited to: (i) increasing energy
efficiency, increasing electrification, and shifting to fossil-free fuels; (ii) efficiently using
resources, including, but not limited to, low flow water fixtures; (iii) improving water and
air quality, ventilation, and air circulation systems; (iv) maintaining thermal comfort,
humidity, and temperature controls; and (v) taking other actions the department may
determine.
The department of public health shall issue a report on the methods, best practices and
standards and may include recommendations to prioritize schools with the greatest
needs, consider the unique environmental differences of schools located in urban,
industrial, rural and other areas facing site challenges, and consider the need to
address historic patterns of inequity in education and schools including, but not limited
to, patterns of inequity involving students in special education programs. The report
shall include a projected cost estimates (sic) for implementing its recommendations in a
cost-effective manner.

Methods, Best Practices, and Standards for Achieving Green and Healthy Schools in the Commonwealth
of Massachusetts
Executive Summary
As the oldest public school system in the United States, the Commonwealth of
Massachusetts has a unique history that helped establish the fundamental basis for the
current universal public education system across the United States. This history is
incomplete without also acknowledging the legacy of profound injustices based on race
and ethnicity, gender, abilities, faith/spirituality, and more.
Chapter 179 of the Acts of 2022, Section 83, charged the Massachusetts Department of
Public Health (DPH) with identifying methods, best practices, and standards for
achieving green and healthy schools across the Commonwealth. Given its mission and
vision statement, DPH has included a specific focus on equity so that all students can
access and fully appreciate the numerous and far-reaching benefits associated with
green and healthy schools—regardless of their race and ethnicity, gender, abilities,
faith/spirituality, and family income.
DPH developed this report to serve as a resource for individual schools, school districts,
municipalities, and others who share a goal of implementing cost-effective strategies
that create sustainable, healthy, and equitable learning environments for all students
across the Commonwealth. This report outlines strategies to help Massachusetts
schools incorporate sustainable design, construction, and operations and provide a
healthy learning environment for all students. One recurring theme throughout the report
is the ability of certain strategies to produce co-benefits that cut across numerous
objectives. For example, the installation and optimization of heating, ventilation, and air
conditioning (HVAC) systems enables schools to improve energy efficiency, enhance
thermal comfort and climate resilience, and provide healthier learning environments
through improved indoor air quality. Another cross-cutting best practice is to incorporate
health equity and environmental justice principles and data into decision making to
address disease, race, economic, and environmental burdens in the schools and
communities.
Implementing the strategies in this report requires both financial and human resources.
While many can be implemented at relatively low cost, others would require large
capital improvement projects and significant funding and human resources to champion,
initiate, plan, and manage. School districts could use additional resources for items
such as professional environmental building assessments and capital improvement
projects for HVAC systems, workforce training, technical assistance to prepare grant
applications or develop Statements of Interest for Massachusetts School Building
Authority funding, hazard removal, building envelope/window repairs, vehicle
electrification, and other building energy efficiency improvements. Similarly, cities and
towns may benefit from outdoor air quality monitoring to determine how to improve
indoor air quality in schools and, consequently, the health of staff and students in those
buildings.

Addressing Structural Racism
DPH’s Strategic Plan to Advance Racial Equity acknowledges that to advance health
equity, DPH must use an intersectional, equity-centered lens to focus on addressing the
persistent racial inequities impacting the health access, treatment, outcomes, and
overall well-being of people across the Commonwealth, specifically those who identify
as Black, Indigenous, Hispanic/Latino, and/or Asian/Pacific Islander. The COVID-19
pandemic brought into painful, undeniable public view the clear, present, and ongoing
health inequities perpetuated by systemic racial inequities across the public health
infrastructure, health care delivery systems, and social determinants of health (SDOH)
in Massachusetts. Understanding the ways that systems of oppression create and
perpetuate structural inequities supports DPH in making system-level changes to
advance health equity. DPH seeks to understand how the structures it designs,
operates, and builds perpetuate inequities. By embracing an understanding of the ways
that state and national public service systems have been built upon racialized policies,
practices, and institutions,

The Healey Administration’s Advancing Health Equity in Massachusetts (AHEM)
initiative has two initial key focus areas: maternal health and SDOH that impact
cardiometabolic disease. SDOH are nonmedical factors—i.e., conditions in which
people are born, grow, work, live, and age—that influence health outcomes and may
make a person more vulnerable to diseases. SDOH are a key priority area for the U.S.
Department of Health and Human Services’ Healthy People 2030, with objectives to set
data-driven policy within the areas of health care access and quality, education access
and quality, social and community context, economic stability, and neighborhood and
built environments. While more research is needed, asthma in young people has been
linked to an increased risk of cardiovascular disease.2

of Massachusetts
In our country, a person’s zip code is more predictive of one's life expectancy than
one’s own genetic code. As a result, around the country, credible, serious efforts to
address health disparities have all prioritized developing a granular, “place-based”
understanding of where disparities in the community are most profound.
Inequities in Asthma Burden in Massachusetts
Like many other New England States, Massachusetts has a high prevalence of
asthma compared to national rates. Among those living with asthma in the
Commonwealth, there are significant disparities in asthma outcomes by
race/ethnicity. Following are notable details contributing to and related to these
disparities:
• Various forms of discrimination and racism have created long-standing structural
health inequities for people of color and lower-income individuals. These
populations have historically been excluded from meaningful participation in
decisions that impact their communities’ environmental health. For example,
people of color and people with limited incomes are more likely to live near toxic
waste sites, in areas with high air pollution, and in low-quality housing because
of the inequitable distribution of these high-polluting sites.
• Structural inequities result in fewer health care providers, limited access to
transportation options, and limited access to community health information due
to inaccessible health communications and lack of access for non-English
speakers.
• As of 2020, the rates of asthma-related hospitalization and emergency
department visits for Black non-Hispanic and Hispanic residents are three-to-
four times higher than those of White non-Hispanic residents.
Source: DPH 3
Acknowledging the SDOH and the broader structural factors that have led to historic
disinvestment in communities of color, DPH’s 2022–2026 Strategic Plan for Asthma in
Massachusetts strives to address the significant racial disparities in asthma burden that
exist in Massachusetts through the “leading with race and racism explicitly but not
exclusively” framework. The 2022–2026 Strategic Plan for Asthma in Massachusetts is
the result of a comprehensive planning process undertaken virtually in the summer and
fall of 2020, in accordance with the COVID-19 guidance at the time, by the DPH’s
Asthma Prevention and Control Program (APCP) and the Massachusetts Asthma Action
Partnership (MAAP), in collaboration with asthma partners, stakeholders, and thought
leaders across Massachusetts. It is meant to highlight opportunities for cross-
collaboration and collective impact in how programs and organizations address asthma,
specifically the inequitable burden of asthma across the Commonwealth of
Massachusetts and identified priority areas of schools, housing, community and clinical
coordination, and outdoor air quality. The 2022–2026 Strategic Plan for Asthma in
Massachusetts is also grounded in the principles of environmental justice and equitable

distribution of environmental benefits—that all people have a right to be protected from
environmental pollution and live in and enjoy a clean environment. It is within this
context that it specifically identifies air quality and pollution as asthma triggers that
disproportionately exist in underserved communities and affect people of color. The
data-driven Strategic Plan for Asthma makes a commitment to center asthma efforts
within the 11 communities of focus that DPH identified as experiencing the highest
burden of asthma inequities in Massachusetts at the time of the development of the
Strategic Plan in 2020.
DPH identified 11 communities of focus based on the following indicators of asthma
burden:
• Asthma hospitalization rates that are significantly higher than the state average
(all ages)
• Asthma emergency department rates that are significantly higher than the state
average (all ages)
• Index of the Concentration at the Extremes score that is lower than the state
average, a measure of privilege and disadvantage examining both racial/ethnic
and economic segregation
See Figure 1 for a map illustrating the 11 communities of focus.

For the first year of the pilot, DPH invited five public K–8 schools—each located in a
different school district—to participate. Of these, schools in Chicopee, Gardner,
Holyoke, and Lowell agreed to participate. DPH conducted comprehensive indoor air
quality assessments in the schools and provided school-specific and best practice
recommendations to improve indoor air quality, technical assistance, and educational
materials and resources. DPH plans to continue this initiative for the 2024–2025 school
year and to expand the pilot to additional districts based on more recent pediatric
asthma surveillance data.
Additionally, DPH and the Massachusetts Executive Office of Energy and
Environmental Affairs (EEA) are leading numerous other racial equity initiatives that
address racism as a serious public health threat, including:

Overview of Public Schools in Massachusetts
Home to the oldest public school system in the United States, Massachusetts has a
long and unique history of planning, constructing, and operating taxpayer-funded public
schools, evidenced by the following timeline of notable historical facts:
• 1635 – Puritan settlers established the first public school, Boston Latin School, in
Boston Massachusetts, in what would eventually become the United States. 5
• 1643 – The Town of Dedham, Massachusetts, unanimously voted to authorize
the first taxpayer-funded public school in the United States.6

With this legacy, Massachusetts is home to four of the five oldest U.S. public high

400 years since the founding of the first public school, the Commonwealth of
Massachusetts has seen its public school system grow to its current collection of more
than 1,800 public schools spread across nearly 400 public school districts.12 Table 2

Environmental Differences and Challenges by Location
The Commonwealth’s 399 school districts, which collectively operate 1,827 public
elementary and secondary schools,13 are dispersed across a range of geographic
locations, including those defined as urban, rural, and close to industrial activity. Each of
these geographic categories presents a unique collection of environmental challenges
and considerations that impact the extent to which students can thrive in an
environmentally sustainable and healthy learning environment.
Urban Regions
There are numerous ways to define urban regions. Qualitatively, an urban area can
refer to large cities, towns, and suburbs.14 The U.S. Census Bureau defines urban areas
as geographic areas of 50,000 or more people.15 It further defines urban clusters as
geographic areas of 2,500 to 50,000 people. Urban areas are typically characterized by
a high density of people, human structures (including older buildings that may have
environmental hazards such as lead-based paint and asbestos), transportation
infrastructure (including impervious surfaces that absorb heat and prevent the natural
percolation of rainwater to underground aquifers), and traffic congestion. Urban regions
in the Commonwealth experience numerous environmental challenges, including the
following:
• Degraded air quality resulting from higher emissions of criteria and toxic air
pollutants from both stationary and mobile sources
• Long-duration elevated ambient temperatures resulting from the heat island
effect16
• Flash flooding resulting from the higher concentration of impervious surfaces
• Increased likelihood of pediatric exposure to lead (on interior painted surfaces
and in the soil) as a result of older building stocks that commonly used lead-
based paint prior to federal regulations restricting its use and proximity to
emissions from vehicles that use leaded gasoline17
Rural regions
The Massachusetts State Office of Rural Health considers a municipality in
Massachusetts as rural if it meets at least one of the following criteria:15
• Meets at least one of the following three federal rural definitions at the sub-
county level:
11
I. Introduction

o U.S. Census Bureau: Urban areas are geographic areas of 50,000 or more
people. Urban clusters are geographic areas of 2,500 to 50,000 people. Any
area not categorized as an urban area or urban cluster is considered rural.18
o Office of Management and Budget: Designates counties as metropolitan
(metro), micropolitan (micro), or neither (as summarized in Table 3.19

people per square mile
• Has an acute care hospital in the town that meets the state hospital licensure
definition of a small rural hospital, or is a certified Critical Access Hospital
Rural communities comprise 59 percent of the land area in the Commonwealth yet only
13 percent of the total statewide population.21 There are 170 communities in
Massachusetts that meet the state definition of rural and are primarily located in western
and central Massachusetts, with additional clusters in the northeast, southeast and the
Cape.
Rural areas in Massachusetts do not experience many of the same environmental
challenges noted above for urban areas; however, they do still encounter other
environmental challenges, such as a reduction in the supply of clean water, particularly
for communities reliant on well water.22 In addition, rural areas in Massachusetts often
face financial challenges that negatively impact the learning environment and outcomes,
such as:23
• Significant student enrollment decline, which contributes to:
o Higher per-pupil operating costs
o Substantially reduced course offerings, student support services, and
extracurricular activities
• Locations farther away from economic opportunities concentrated in more
populated areas of the Commonwealth, which contributes to:
o An insufficient and stagnant tax base
o A greater proportional share of local government budgets to fund school
operating budgets

Regions Close to Industrial Activities
Across the United States, there are 12,000 schools located within a mile of a hazardous
chemical facility.24 In Boston, almost one in three public schools is located within one
mile of such a facility.25 Schools in close proximity to industrial activities and industrial
and chemical waste sites may experience impaired indoor air quality via infiltration of
outdoor air pollutants to the indoor environment through vents and open windows.
Schools in these locations may also experience vapor intrusion, which is a chemical
transport process by which vapor-forming chemicals migrate from a subsurface source
into an overlying building.26 Students and school personnel may also be exposed to
outdoor air pollutants while outside the school. See the Mitigate Occurrences of Vapor
Intrusion discussion and Objective 2a(7). Reduce Exposure to Outdoor Air Pollutants for
additional details.
Massachusetts School Building Authority (MSBA)
In 2004, the State Legislature established the
Source of MSBA Funding
MSBA as a quasi-independent government
authority to reform the process of funding capital The MSBA funds capital
improvement projects in public schools across the improvement projects in public
Commonwealth. The MSBA collaborates with schools across the
municipalities and school districts to provide Commonwealth using a
competitive grant funding to create safe and dedicated revenue stream of
sustainable learning environments using right- one penny of the state’s 6.25
sized, fiscally responsible, and educationally percent sales tax, known as the
appropriate solutions.27 A seven-member Board of School Modernization Trust
Directors oversees the MSBA, and the State Fund (“SMART Fund”).

Proud History of Greening Schools in Massachusetts
As noted in the October 2023 Office of the Governor’s Recommendations of the
Climate Chief, Pursuant to Section 3(b) of Executive Order No. 604:
Since its formation, the MSBA has been an advocate of ‘green’ sustainable building
design for all MSBA-funded public K-12 school buildings and has regularly adjusted
its Green Program Policy since then to promote increasing levels of energy efficiency
in school design… to decarbonize buildings. In the last ten years, 95 percent of the
MSBA-funded schools have exceeded MSBA’s base project requirements with one
school achieving ‘Platinum’ in the U.S. Green Building Council’s (USGBC’s)
Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certification program, 27
schools achieving LEED ‘Gold,’ and 47 schools achieving LEED ‘Silver.’ As of June
2023, the MSBA has funded 20 all-electric schools and 18 schools employing
ground-source heat pumps.
13
I. Introduction

Methods, Best Practices, and Standards for Achieving Green and Healthy Schools in the Commonwealth
of Massachusetts
The MSBA is required to perform periodic school surveys of all public elementary and
secondary schools in the Commonwealth to observe and assess numerous key
parameters, including building systems conditions, the general physical environment,
and space utilization. The surveys provide important information that enables the MSBA
to better understand the unique needs of individual schools and their respective school
districts and assist the MSBA in providing equitable funding for school construction,
renovation, and repair projects across the Commonwealth.28 To date, the MSBA has
completed three cycles of school surveys: in 2005, 2010, and 2016. The MSBA expects
to complete its next survey and publish the accompanying report by the end of 2025.
The MSBA provides competitive grant funding through two main programs:
• Core Program: provides grant funding for new construction, additions, and major
renovation projects
• Accelerated Repair Program: provides grant funding for buildings that need
roof and/or window/door replacements but are otherwise structurally sound.
Boiler replacements were last included for invitation in 2022. The MSBA is
completing a study with a consultant in anticipation of adding heat pump
conversions to the Accelerated Repair Program for existing buildings beginning
in 2025.
To be considered for MSBA grant funding, school districts must submit a Statement of
Interest (SOI) during the MSBA’s established open submittal period each year.
Following the closing of the SOI submittal period, MSBA staff conduct due diligence and
recommend SOIs for the MSBA Board of Directors’ review and approval of invitations
into the grant program based on demonstrated need and urgency. Per legislative
mandate,29 the MSBA approves SOIs in accordance with the priority criteria established
in MA General Law (M.G.L.) 70B, including but not limited to the eight priority criteria
outlined in §8 (outlined in the following text).30
14
I. Introduction

Methods, Best Practices, and Standards for Achieving Green and Healthy Schools in the Commonwealth
of Massachusetts
Priority Criteria for the Approval of MSBA-Funded Projects
• Priority 1: Priority shall be given to school projects needed in the judgment of
said board to replace or renovate a building which is structurally unsound or
otherwise in a condition seriously jeopardizing the health and safety of school
children, where no alternative exists.
• Priority 2: Priority shall be given to school projects to eliminate existing
severe overcrowding.
• Priority 3: Priority shall be given to school projects needed in the judgment of
said authority to prevent loss of accreditation.
• Priority 4: Priority shall be given to school projects needed in the judgment of
said authority to prevent severe overcrowding expected to result from
increased enrollments which must be substantiated.
• Priority 5: Priority shall be given to projects needed in the judgment of said
authority for the replacement, renovation, or modernization of the heating
system in any schoolhouse to increase energy conservation and decrease
energy related costs in said schoolhouse.
• Priority 6: Priority shall be given to any school project needed in the
judgment of said authority for short-term enrollment growth.
• Priority 7: Priority shall be given to school projects needed in the judgment of
said authority to replace or add to obsolete buildings in order to provide for a
full range of programs consistent with state and approved local requirements.
• Priority 8: Priority shall be given to projects needed in the judgment of said
authority to transition from court-ordered and authority approved racial
balance school districts to walk-to, so-called, or other school districts.
Following the evaluation and approval of SOIs using the statutorily mandated priority
criteria, the MSBA calculates the value of each grant. For grants approved through the
Core Program, the MSBA determines the grant value by utilizing the reimbursement
rate formula outlined in M.G.L., 70B, §1030,31 (presented in Table 4).

Acts of 2022, Chapter 179, Section 83
Chapter 179 of the Acts of 2022 is a comprehensive climate-focused bill that will help
Massachusetts toward its goal of net zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2050
via clean energy production, battery storage, and electrification of buildings and the

of Massachusetts
1. The MSBA is required to “conduct an assessment of elementary and secondary
school buildings relative to energy efficiency, building conditions, safety, and public
health” that includes “cataloging the age and condition of any building systems
relying on the on-site combustion of fossil fuels. The assessment shall be conducted
in coordination with ongoing assessments or surveys of the authority. The authority
shall determine the means of conducting the assessment which may include a
representative sample of schools. In planning said assessment, the authority shall
consult with the department of public health, the department of elementary and
secondary education and the department of energy resources.”
2. DPH is required to draft and issue a report on “methods, best practices, and
standards for achieving green and healthy schools strategies to for (sic) the students
of the commonwealth” and include cost estimates for implementing its
recommendations cost-effectively. The legislation provides DPH latitude to optionally
include the following content as part of the report:
a. Increasing energy efficiency
b. Increasing electrification
c. Shifting to fossil-free fuels
d. Efficient use of resources (e.g., low-flow water fixtures)
e. Improving water and air quality
f. Improving ventilation and air circulation systems
g. Maintaining thermal comfort, humidity, and temperature controls
h. Recommendations to prioritize schools with the greatest needs
i. Unique environmental differences of schools located in urban, industrial, rural,
and other areas facing site challenges

The Critical Need for Green and Healthy Schools
The numerous methods and best practices for achieving green and healthy schools
outlined in this report are interconnected and promote vibrant, just, inspiring, engaging,
healthy, and high-performing schools and surrounding communities.33 Many of the
strategies for achieving green schools provide critical support to the Commonwealth’s
goal of net zero GHG emissions by 2050. Additionally, by applying an equity lens to the
implementation of the strategies in this report, school districts can address disparities in
the health and educational outcomes of students from underserved and marginalized
communities that have resulted from historical structural racism.

I. Introduction

Methods, Best Practices, and Standards for Achieving Green and Healthy Schools in the Commonwealth
of Massachusetts
While the path ahead is filled with opportunities, there are numerous challenges that
school districts will likely face. There are many strategies that schools can implement
with relatively low costs and human resource burdens. Many of the more impactful
strategies, however, will require significant financial resources, technical expertise, and
human resources to initiate, plan, implement, and sustain.
Purpose
DPH identified its Bureau of Climate and Environmental Health (BCEH) to lead the
development of this report to respond to and comply with the requirements outlined in
the Acts of 2022, Chapter 179, Section 83. In addition to responding to this legislative
requirement, DPH also aims to use this report to provide actionable information for
schools, school districts, municipalities, and other interested parties who share an
interest in creating and fostering sustainable, healthy, and equitable learning
environments for all students in the Commonwealth.
Scope
The scope of this report is “traditional” public elementary and secondary schools and
attempts to cover the topics most relevant to the most significant portion of public
elementary and secondary schools in the Commonwealth. This report does not provide
methods, best practices, or standards tailored specifically to childcare/early education
and care facilities (EECFs), regional vocational/technical/agricultural schools, or schools
offering ancillary community services, each with additional unique considerations and
challenges.
Methods
BCEH and its support contractor, Eastern Research Group, Inc. (ERG), conducted the
following activities to compile the content included in this report:
• Conducted engagement with a broad technical working group comprised of staff
from the following organizations and programs within DPH:
o Bureau of Climate and Environmental Health

Program (July 17, 2024)37
• Performed additional desktop research to supplement information compiled from
direct engagement sessions with DPH and staff from partner agencies.
Multiple best practices and recommendations in this report draw from DPH’s 2022–2026
Strategic Plan for Asthma in Massachusetts. The 2022–2026 Strategic Plan for Asthma
in Massachusetts is the result of a comprehensive planning process undertaken by
DPH’s APCP and MAAP in collaboration with asthma partners, stakeholders, and
thought leaders across Massachusetts in the summer and fall of 2020. Extensive
outreach efforts to existing and previously engaged partners, as well as targeted
outreach and leveraging networks, resulted in the participation of a wide range of
stakeholders across the state in the development of the strategic plan.

I. Introduction

Methods, Best Practices, and Standards for Achieving Green and Healthy Schools in the Commonwealth
of Massachusetts
Because of the significant breadth and scope of the report and the potential need for
either a high-level or more in-depth understanding of the goal areas, objectives, co-
benefits, and potential disadvantages of approaches needed, the report is divided into
two distinct modules:
Module 1: High-Level Overview of Methods and Best Practices includes a discrete
section for each paired goal and objective (Sections II-IV) that includes the following
content:
• Background information to provide helpful context
• A high-level tabular summary of methods and best practices for achieving the

This report outlines best practices to help Massachusetts schools incorporate
sustainable design, construction, and operations and provide a healthy learning
environment for all students. Implementing these best practices requires financial and
human resources. While many can be implemented at low cost, others require large
capital improvement projects and significant funding and human resources to champion,
initiate, plan, and manage. School districts might require resources for comprehensive,
professional environmental building assessments and capital improvement projects for
heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems, workforce development,
health equity data reviews, technical assistance to prepare grant requests or SOIs for
MSBA funding, hazard removal, building envelope/window repairs, vehicle
electrification, installation of green technology, and other building energy efficiency
improvements. Similarly, cities and towns may benefit from outdoor air quality
monitoring to determine how to improve indoor air quality in schools and the health of
staff and students in those buildings.

Co-benefits and Disbenefits
There are numerous cross-cutting methods and best practices presented throughout
this report that not only address a primary goal area and/or objective, but also
produce positive outcomes, or co-benefits, in one or more other goal areas and/or
objectives. One example that this report frequently highlights is the ability of
optimized HVAC systems to produce both green and healthy co-benefits related to
building energy efficiency, enhanced climate resilience, and improved indoor air
quality—including helping to mitigate exposure to radon, PCBs, carbon monoxide,
and mold.
Conversely, there are also some methods and best practices (often those that are
more “short-term” in nature) that produce disbenefits. That is, they mitigate concerns
in one goal area and/or objective, but further exacerbate concerns in one or more
goal area and/or objective. For example, short-term increases in ventilation rates to
improve indoor air quality can increase facility energy consumption and associated
GHG emissions.
Local Public Health Departments as Partners
Local and regional public health departments are essential partners to school districts
wishing to implement the strategies outlined in this report, including addressing health
equity, identifying environmental justice concerns, reviewing possible sites for new
buildings, and providing health data for local funding requests.
Local public health officials should be at the table for local policy changes and to
support the school district in prioritizing buildings to meet equity goals by collaboration
on data analysis and community outreach.

other metrics related to the design and operation of
schools. More recently, the pursuit of green schools has
included a prominent emphasis on building decarbonization—the process of reducing
(or eliminating) GHG emissions associated with the construction and operation of
buildings. Green schools also pursue goals and implement best practices related to
water efficiency, solid waste diversion, electrification of school vehicle fleets, optimized
climate resilience, and other operational areas.
Following teacher salaries, school utilities (i.e., energy and water) and services (e.g.,
waste management, transportation) represent some of the largest operating costs to
school districts. Efficiency improvements in each of these areas can offer financial
savings and help school districts meet their fiduciary duty while also offering numerous
co-benefits to school district staff, the enrolled student body, and the surrounding

community. School districts are increasingly considering and implementing strategies
that address these areas so that schools can continue to operate reliably in the face of a
changing climate.
This section presents a brief background, a tabular summary of the methods and best
practices that can help school districts across the Commonwealth achieve green
schools, and a brief discussion of notable barriers and challenges that schools are likely
to face. Content is provided across the following six objectives:
a. Decarbonize buildings
b. Optimize water efficiency
c. Optimize solid waste reduction and diversion
d. Electrify school bus fleets
e. Provide electric vehicle charging stations for school staff and public use
f. Enhance climate resilience
Section VI provides a more detailed narrative description of the methods and best
practices, details related to the relevant statutory/regulatory framework and notable
standards, and relevant resources across each of the six objectives.

while also generating or procuring renewable electricity that produces zero GHG
emissions.

While approximately 79 percent of
Massachusetts households heat their homes using fossil fuels, the MSBA found during
its 2016 School Survey that 97 percent of assessed school buildings relied on fossil fuel
heating systems. With expectations for the Massachusetts government to lead by
example41 and nearly 300 municipalities across the Commonwealth designated as
Green Communities by DOER, decarbonizing schools—which make up the largest
portion of most municipal building footprints—is a natural point of focus for climate
change mitigation. Projects to decarbonize school buildings also offer an opportunity to
achieve several other health-related co-benefits, including improving air quality through
optimized ventilation, improving occupant thermal comfort by adding air conditioning,
and other benefits described in this section.
The pathway and process to decarbonizing school buildings will vary at the building and
school district level depending on existing conditions, school program requirements,
available funding, and various other infrastructural and operational factors described in
this section. The core strategies for building decarbonization promoted by the
Commonwealth of Massachusetts include: (1) electrifying non-electric energy uses; (2)
decarbonizing the electric grid; and (3) reducing energy costs and the costs of transition
by increasing the efficiency of transportation and energy systems.40 Figure 2 depicts an
example pathway for how this process can occur over time in existing school buildings.

For many school districts, funding pressures present a recurring challenge for basic
operations; consequently, planning significant investments can feel daunting. Utility
expenditures can, however, represent both a budget pressure and an opportunity for
savings. After accounting for salaries, energy costs often represent a school’s largest
expense.43 Reducing facility energy consumption also offers additional budget stability
through reduced exposure to energy price volatility. Over time, realized energy cost
savings can be redirected to other school district priorities.
Methods and Best Practices
There are a number of methods and best practices that have been implemented to
successfully decarbonize schools across Massachusetts. These are organized in the
following sections in order of implementation:
• Conduct analysis and planning
• Implement strategies to achieve energy efficiency and building decarbonization
• Operate and maintain schools
• Procure decarbonized electricity
Table 6 provides a summary of methods and best practices for decarbonizing schools.
For each method and best practice, the table presents the approximate capital and
operating costs, implementation timeframe, and ease of implementation. See Section
VI, Objective 1a for additional narrative descriptions of each of the methods and best
practices.

Methods, Best Practices, and Standards for Achieving Green and Healthy Schools in the Commonwealth

Barriers and Challenges
Barriers to decarbonizing buildings are listed below:
• Significant investments are required to make improvements to school
infrastructure and augment operation and maintenance staffing. Future resource
needs are compounded by current and historical inequities in school and
community resources. Varying access to the financial and human resources
required to do this work is likely to lead to further inequities between school
districts.
• While there is a diverse array of commercially available technologies today,
some space-constrained or urban sites may have fewer options and need to
identify design alternatives as outlined in the component and whole system
retrofit strategy sections.
• Staff that have a long track record of safe operations of boilers (high pressure,
combustion steam vessels) will be required to become experts in the vapor
compression refrigeration cycle used by all heat pump technologies and
increasingly computerized operations. This transition will require significant
training initiatives, technical assistance/support, updates to hiring practices, and
in some cases major changes to operations and maintenance (O&M) programs.
• As with any retrofit project, there is an abatement risk that is not fully known
before a complete assessment is conducted. Older buildings that are anchors of
communities may also have legacy toxins (e.g., asbestos, PCBs) that require an
unknown amount of expensive abatement to implement many of the projects
described in this section. See Objective 2a. Improve Air Quality for additional
details about reducing exposure to these toxins.
There are already a number of successful all-electric schools and net zero school
projects across Massachusetts that can offer helpful case studies on how these
challenges have been successfully addressed.
Objective 1b. Optimize Water Efficiency
Background
Even though 70 percent of the Earth is covered by water, only 1 percent is available for
human use.44 As the impacts of climate change increase, optimizing water efficiency is
vital to managing intermittent and recurring drought conditions in Massachusetts and
ensuring water supply for future generations. Optimizing water efficiency can also help
2 The capital cost for installing onsite renewable energy systems will be highly dependent on the funding
strategy(ies) used to implement the project. For example, if a school utilizes the Energy Management
Services procurement method, the school could complete the project using no capital funding. See the
Funding Strategies section for additional information about funding strategies for decarbonization project
implementation.
3 The cost estimate scale in this section differs from other sections due to the higher capital intensity of
projects.
30
II. Goal 1: Achieve Green Schools

Methods, Best Practices, and Standards for Achieving Green and Healthy Schools in the Commonwealth
of Massachusetts
reduce the burden on aging infrastructure. Reduced demand for potable water, in turn,
reduces the need for water extraction, pumping, treatment, and delivery by existing
systems. In addition, since extracting, pumping, treating, and delivering water and
treating wastewater also consumes energy, decreased potable water consumption also
reduces energy use and associated GHG emissions.
In recent decades, Massachusetts has regularly experienced varying degrees of
drought conditions, ranging from abnormal dryness to extreme drought, as illustrated in
Figure 3.45 Annual precipitation amounts in Massachusetts have been increasing in
recent decades and are expected to continue to rise due to climate change.46 However,
according to the Massachusetts State Climate Summary 2022, scientists predict that
precipitation events over this century will be fewer more extreme events rather than
multiple smaller storms; extreme events often don’t translate to groundwater
replenishment or steady stream flows.47 In addition, scientists predict that the expected
warmer temperatures will increase evapotranspiration and decrease snowpack.47
Scientists project these conditions, when combined, may increase Massachusetts’
frequency and severity of droughts, prompting a need for optimizing water efficiency
across the state.46

The Alliance for Water Efficiency’s 2022 U.S. State Policy Scorecard for Water
Efficiency and Sustainability evaluates and scores states by their adoption of policies
and laws that advance water efficiency, conservation, and sustainability.48 On the 2022
scorecard, Massachusetts scored the most points for incorporating water efficiency in
plumbing fixture standards and codes and providing state funding for water efficiency
31

programs; however, the Commonwealth scored low on water conservation planning and
drought preparedness planning, among other things. If Massachusetts schools
collectively increase their focus on optimizing water efficiency, they can help the state
better prepare for drought and manage its water resources.
Schools use water in restrooms and cafeterias and can use water for building and
process cooling, irrigation, pools, laundries, and laboratories. Methods and best
practices to optimize water use overall and by specific end use are discussed in this
section.
Methods and Best Practices
There are many methods and best practices for optimizing water efficiency in schools,
including monitoring and managing water use, optimizing water efficiency of end uses
and systems, and using alternative water sources. Table 7 summarizes methods and
best practices for optimizing water efficiency in schools. For each method/best practice,
the table presents the approximate capital and operating costs, implementation
timeframe, and ease of implementation. See Section VI, Objective 1b for additional
narrative descriptions of each of the methods and best practices.

Barriers and Challenges
The two primary barriers and challenges to optimizing water efficiency in schools are
necessary funding and staff availability. Schools and school districts may not have
33
II. Goal 1: Achieve Green Schools

Methods, Best Practices, and Standards for Achieving Green and Healthy Schools in the Commonwealth
of Massachusetts
funding for some of the larger-scale water efficiency projects identified in this section,
but they may be able to implement the lower-cost projects more easily.
Some water efficiency methods and best practices require trained and knowledgeable
staff. For example, facility water assessments and irrigation system audits require
trained professionals to accurately and efficiently evaluate buildings and systems and
identify efficiency opportunities. Some schools may not have the resources to hire these
professionals and, further, do not have full-time facility management staff on site to do
the work themselves. Where facility management staff are present, they can be trained
on water-using systems and water efficiency to implement the methods and best
practices to optimize water efficiency identified here.
Objective 1c. Optimize Solid Waste Reduction and Diversion
Background
Virtually all human activities, including the construction, day-to-day operation, and
disposition of school facilities, generate some form of waste. Solid waste, also
commonly referred to as “trash” or “garbage,” consists of both municipal solid waste
(items that consumers dispose of after use, including food; organic materials; plastic,
glass, and aluminum containers and consumer packaging; corrugated cardboard;
furniture; electronics; and appliances)49 and non-municipal solid waste, which includes
construction and demolition debris.
Solid waste can have detrimental impacts on the environment. Municipal solid waste
landfills utilized to dispose of solid waste release methane gas as organic waste
decomposes. The release of this methane contributes to global climate change.
Landfills represent the third largest source of human-related methane emissions in the
United States.50 Landfills also produce leachate, which forms when rainwater passes
through waste materials in a landfill and leaches chemicals from the various materials. If
not properly collected and treated, leachate can find its way into and contaminate
groundwater.51 An alternative to sending solid waste to landfills, waste incineration (also
referred to as “energy recovery” or “waste-to-energy”) releases harmful pollutants such
as particulate matter (PM), lead, mercury, per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS),
and dioxins, which enter the air, water, and food supply near waste incinerators.52
In 2022, Massachusetts disposed of 6 million tons of solid waste, of which 3.4 million
tons were disposed of in-state (the remaining 2.6 tons were exported for disposal out-of-
state).53 Of the portion of solid waste disposed of in-state, nearly 86 percent of the
Commonwealth’s solid waste is incinerated in waste-to-energy facilities, while the
remaining 14 percent goes to landfills.6 In 2020, the incineration and disposal of solid
waste in landfills in Massachusetts generated 1.44 million metric tons of carbon dioxide
equivalent (MMTCO e), representing 2.2 percent of Massachusetts’ gross GHG

emissions in 2020.54 In the Commonwealth’s 2030 Solid Waste Management Plan,
MassDEP has established a goal of reducing annual solid waste disposal by 30 percent
by 2030 and by 90 percent by 2050, relative to a 2018 baseline. MassDEP has
identified food waste as the largest single material category found in the

Barriers and Challenges
Schools face several challenges in pursuing zero-waste operations. Namely, many
schools lack professional oversight over organics management. In this absence,
students often volunteer to staff smaller-scale composting programs, which, while
educational for the student, do not provide the long-term staffing that waste
management requires. Schools may not have dedicated waste diversion professionals
but rather depend on district or county-level support. Negotiations with janitorial or
custodial unions are often cited as bottlenecks that derail progress toward implementing
a compost program because janitors or custodians may view composting as an
additional responsibility outside of their agreed responsibilities. Roles and
responsibilities must be mutually agreeable, and an effectively implemented compost
program should not require significant additional labor from janitorial or custodial staff
since the total amount of waste produced does not change.
Zero-waste options are sometimes seen as being costly because of upfront capital
costs or increased labor costs. However, savings from lower procurement costs,
decreased hauling fees, and potential rebates or incentives can make zero-waste cost-
saving.
Objective 1d. Electrify School Bus Fleets
Background
Historically, the most frequent passengers of school buses are students from Black
households and low-income backgrounds.56,57 While school buses provide a crucial
service to families who may otherwise be unable to get their children to school due to
working schedules or other circumstances, these vehicles are not without their
drawbacks. Emissions from internal combustion engine (ICE) school buses have been
linked to worsening air quality, increased GHG emissions, and adverse health effects.58
Diesel exhaust, a known carcinogen, has been associated with respiratory illness, heart
disease, and low attendance rates.58,59 Furthermore, the passengers on school buses
are children, who—along with those having pre-existing conditions—are most affected
by diesel exhaust.60 The negative effects of these fossil fuel-burning buses are
experienced not only by the communities in which the buses operate but also by those
students riding the bus, where a lack of ventilation often leads to high levels of pollution
within the vehicle cabin.61
Electric school buses (ESBs) offer a zero-emission alternative to legacy ICE vehicles.
These buses not only release zero direct emissions and have a smaller carbon footprint
than traditional school buses but also generally have a lower total cost of ownership as
compared to ICE school buses.62 Despite a higher upfront price, owners of ESBs
experience lifetime savings in lower fuel and mechanical costs.63 These savings are
realized in part because of the simplicity of an electric power train. While a traditional
ICE vehicle can have more than 200 moving parts, an electric vehicle usually has only
about 17.64 With fewer parts at risk of failure, ESB owners find their vehicles spend less
time undergoing maintenance. Additionally, it is less expensive (on average) to charge
37
II. Goal 1: Achieve Green Schools

Methods, Best Practices, and Standards for Achieving Green and Healthy Schools in the Commonwealth
of Massachusetts
an ESB than it is to fully fuel an ICE vehicle. A study by school bus manufacturer Blue
Bird found that while it costs 49 cents per mile to operate a diesel school bus, it only
costs about 14 cents per mile to operate an electric school bus.65 Estimates have
determined that owners of electric school buses save around $100,000 throughout the
vehicle’s lifetime.63
Reports from ESB operators suggest that the vehicles are performing well. All ESBs
have at least 100 miles of driving range per charge, and some buses can travel up to
210 miles on a single charge.66 Drivers cite the vehicle’s smooth handling and quiet
operation as major benefits of the technology.67 Some drivers even suggest that the
reduced noise from the ESB’s electric traction motor has had positive impacts on
student behavior.67
A favorable policy environment has increased the presence of these vehicles on the
road. A December 2023 estimate found that 8,570 ESBs are either on the road, on
order, or have been awarded.68 In addition, numerous states such as New York and
California have passed mandates that all purchased or leased school buses be electric
or zero-emission in the near future.69,70 Momentum for similar legislation is growing
within Massachusetts. In February 2024, electric
school bus supporters delivered a letter signed by Multi-State ZEV Task Force

Barriers and Challenges
One of the most frequent concerns for school bus operators is the effect that cold
weather can have on vehicle performance. This concern is valid as the range of an
electric school bus can decrease in cold temperatures as the vehicle pulls energy from
the battery to heat the cabin and the vehicle battery itself.75 Districts have reported a
10–15 percent decrease in battery capacity during winter months.75 Studies of electric
transit buses have reported a 33 percent decrease in range when temperatures
dropped below 25° Fahrenheit (F).76 Despite this, ESBs are present in cold weather
climates. In fact, 49 states have electric school buses either operating or committed.68
There are even electric school buses as far north as Alaska, where Tok Transportation
has been successfully operating an ESB in temperatures as low as -40° F since 2019.77
Some districts have gone as far as to say that they prefer their ESBs in the winter since
they start more reliably and their comparatively heavier weight makes the vehicles more
stable on icy roads.78 To combat the decrease in the cold weather range, districts have
installed auxiliary diesel heaters to warm the vehicle cabins. Other districts have found
preconditioning, a process where the vehicle is warmed while still connected to the
charger, a successful strategy to avoid losing battery capacity to cold weather.
39
II. Goal 1: Achieve Green Schools

Methods, Best Practices, and Standards for Achieving Green and Healthy Schools in the Commonwealth
of Massachusetts
Extreme heat can also affect the ESB battery range to a lesser extent. A study of
electric transit buses determined that energy used by the vehicle’s HVAC and
ventilation reduced the vehicle’s range.79 While there isn’t available data to quantify this
loss for buses specifically, studies that have analyzed EVs generally found that when
temperatures climb above 95° Fahrenheit, the range decreases by around 4 percent.80
Similar strategies can be used to limit the effect of heat on the ESB range, such as
preconditioning. Furthermore, some fleets find storing their vehicles and chargers in
shaded or covered areas helpful in reducing range loss.
Some districts are hesitant to pursue ESBs due to range anxiety. Fears of electric buses
losing power and needing to be towed while on routes have slowed the adoption of the
technology. However, with careful planning, these scenarios can be avoided. All ESB
models on the market can travel at least 100 miles on a single charge, and some
models can travel 210 miles or more.66 Districts that place ESBs on routes within their
actual range or account for range loss by utilizing mid-day charging have found electric
school buses to be a reliable alternative to ICE buses.66
The costs associated with ESBs are a common deterrent to the technology. The initial
purchase price of an electric school bus can be about three times more expensive than
an ICE bus, with some models going for as much as $400,000.81 In addition, fleets that
are just beginning their electrification journey can expect $10,000 to $30,000 in
infrastructure expenses per bus.82 While initial costs may be higher for an electric
vehicle, ESB owners can expect to save $100,000 in lifetime fuel and maintenance
costs.63 Additionally, numerous tax credits and funding programs are offered by federal,
state, and local governments, as well as electrical utilities. On average, this leads to
ESBs having a lower total cost of ownership than ICE buses.63
Objective 1e. Provide Electric Vehicle Charging Stations for School
Staff and Public Use
Background
The federal government has provided record funding for electric vehicle (EV) projects in
recent years. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (2021) and the Inflation Reduction Act
(2022) offer a combined $100 billion in EV project-eligible funding.83 Generally, this
funding has been met with enthusiasm as annual EV sales surpassed 1 million for the
first time in 2023.84 To support this influx of EVs on the road, robust EV charging
infrastructure is needed. Research suggests that roughly 45 million EV charging
stations will need to be operational by 2032, with a suggested 3.7 million Level 2
chargers at public locations and workplaces alone.85
The three most common EV charger levels are level 1, level 2, and direct current (DC)
fast chargers. Level 1 and level 2 chargers deliver energy in an alternating current while
DC fast chargers deliver energy in a direct current. Level 1 chargers are usually used
for long charging sessions with light-duty vehicles (such as overnight charging). These
chargers are commonly found in residential settings for personal use. Level 2 chargers,
in turn, can charge a light-duty vehicle in 4 to 10 hours and a heavy-duty vehicle (such
40

Methods, Best Practices, and Standards for Achieving Green and Healthy Schools in the Commonwealth
of Massachusetts
as an ESB) in 6 to 11 hours.86,87 These chargers may be more common in shared
residential spaces, workplaces, or facilities housing EV fleets. Finally, DC fast chargers
offer the ability to charge a light-duty EV in 20 minutes to an hour and a heavy-duty
vehicle in 1 hour to 4.5 hours.86,88 These chargers are most common along major
roadways or with EV fleets.
Making electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE) accessible in school parking lots for
use by staff and the public presents opportunities to expand EV utilization, reduce local
air pollution, and potentially create revenue for school districts. School districts that
install EVSE will need to establish policies regarding permissible users of the charging
stations.
Some schools choose to allow only district fleet vehicles to access charging stations.
The benefit of this approach is that chargers are available when needed and are
properly maintained. Additionally, there would likely be no need to have payment
systems installed in the chargers; a digital key can be issued to eligible vehicles that will
allow them to access the charger while preventing unauthorized users.
Other schools prefer to allow their staff to access the chargers to charge their personally
owned vehicles. Doing so helps incentivize the staff to adopt EVs. Additionally, the
inclusion or exclusion of payment systems can make the chargers either a revenue
creator for the school or a free perk for district employees.
Finally, some districts may choose to make the chargers accessible to the general
public. Doing so presents the opportunity to create revenue through payment systems
and incentivizes the presence of EVs on campus.
As EVs become more common near schools, there will likely be local air quality
improvements. According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), vehicle
emissions have been linked to certain cancers, as well as “neurological, cardiovascular,
respiratory, reproductive and/or immune system damage.”89
Recognizing the benefits of EVSE at workplaces, the Massachusetts government has
offered numerous incentive programs to encourage their deployment. Most of these
funding opportunities are offered through the Massachusetts Electric Vehicle Incentive
Program (MassEVIP). The following are recent MassEVIP opportunities that school
districts might qualify for:
• MassEVIP Public Access Charging
• MassEVIP Multi-Unit Dwelling & Educational Campus Charging
• MassEVIP Workplace and Fleet Charging Program Requirements
• MassEVIP Direct Current Fast Charging
41

These programs offer various funding amounts and have different eligibility
requirements. Prior to applying to any program, it is important that projects meet all
eligibility requirements.

II. Goal 1: Achieve Green Schools

Methods, Best Practices, and Standards for Achieving Green and Healthy Schools in the Commonwealth

Barriers and Challenges
When procuring new EVSE, an important first step in the commissioning process is
testing the compatibility of an EV and the charger together. If the technologies have an
issue, the fix can require a range of actions. The resolution could involve quick on-site
adjustments or could require sending the charger back to the original equipment
manufacturer (OEM) for a repair. To avoid this scenario, schools should consult the
OEM of the charger and the OEM of the primary vehicle it will be charging (if applicable)
to ensure compatibility.
Depending on the charger type, EVSE can have a high upfront cost. While there are
grant programs to help defray these costs, not every school district may qualify. In
particular, DC fast chargers can be expensive from both an acquisition and operational
standpoint. To address this, some EVSE owners choose to install payment platforms on
their chargers as a means of collecting revenue to help offset operational costs. This
may be a suitable strategy for reducing some of the upfront cost barriers.
A common concern for EVSE owners is how their monthly energy bill will be impacted
by vehicle charging. This is an especially important consideration for districts that plan
to charge vehicles during peak energy demand hours when many utilities will use
dynamic pricing and increase the rate at which they are charging for electricity. While
peak electrical demand hours will vary by location, the grid is typically the busiest
anywhere from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m.90 Many school districts have found managed charging to
be a helpful strategy to reduce the impact of vehicle charging on monthly utility
expenditures. This technology allows vehicle owners to schedule their vehicle charging
sessions to occur at times when electricity is comparatively cheaper, such as in the
middle of the night. While managed charging is not a feasible solution for every district
(such as those that need to utilize mid-day charging), it can help minimize charging
costs when implemented.
Because EVSE is high-voltage equipment, some charger owners run into issues finding
electricians who are certified to service them. Many EVSE funding programs require
that electricians performing work on chargers purchased with grant funding be certified
through the EVITP. Because this is a newer certification, many electricians may not yet
be certified to work on EV charging stations. Service contracts and warranties can help
connect EVSE owners to qualified technicians.
EV chargers that are left exposed in winter conditions may experience issues such as
the charger handle freezing to the charger body or a vehicle. The process of removing a
frozen charger handle can be difficult and time consuming. Districts in especially cold
weather climates should consider installing EVSE in covered areas.
Another concern for EVSE located in public areas is vandalism. The vandalism of EV
charging stations can include anything from graffiti, the theft of charger cables (likely for
the copper inside), or purposefully short-circuiting the charger.91 There can also be
issues with users not treating the equipment well, such as someone who charges their
vehicle but then leaves the cord on the ground when they leave. Solutions to curbing
43

vandalism include protecting chargers behind cages and the use of retractable cables,
bollards, and security cameras.92
Objective 1f. Enhance Climate Resilience
Background
Resilience refers to “the capacity of individuals, communities, businesses, institutions,
and governments to adapt to changing conditions and prepare for, withstand, and
rapidly recover from disruptions to everyday life, such as hazard events.”93 Nationwide,
schools are faced with increases in lost learning time from closures due to extreme
heat, wildfires, flooding, and other extreme weather events that are exacerbated by
climate change.94 Aging facilities and infrastructure, building conditions, and lack of
sufficient long-term maintenance and investments have forced school districts to make
difficult decisions regarding learning disruption to protect students and staff from
unhealthy conditions related to hazards. In addition to providing critical education
facilities, schools serve the broader community in times of need as emergency shelters,
food and aid distribution sites, cooling centers, and resilience hubs. These roles
servicing the broader community require close coordination between schools and local
municipal programs working on climate resilience. To reduce educational disruptions
associated with natural hazards, an increasing number of school districts have passed
climate resilience resolutions to encourage comprehensive planning and associated
infrastructure improvements.
ResilientMass is the statewide initiative led by the Massachusetts Emergency
Management Agency (MEMA) in conjunction with EEA; it covers resilience and climate
adaptation programs, policies, and initiatives. BCEH provided data metrics on negative
health impacts associated with climate change

Figure 4 presents a framework from the ResilientMass Plan for ranking the magnitude
of consequences for various hazards as informed by the risk assessment. While this
framework is a helpful reference at the statewide level, individual school districts and
schools may face hazards at differing magnitudes of consequences depending upon
their geographic location and adaptation capacity and, thus, are encouraged to evaluate
risk at the local or facility level using the methods described below. At a minimum, the
hazards associated with extreme heat should be a priority consideration for planning
purposes. The 2022 Massachusetts Climate Change Assessment notes that
researchers estimated that “at least 40 percent and as much as 100 percent of
classrooms in Massachusetts counties lack air conditioning, compared to 0 to 20
percent of classrooms in southeastern U.S. states that are better adapted to extreme
heat.” These same researchers estimated that—on a national scale—each 1⁰F increase
in school year temperature without air conditioning reduced the amount learned that
year by one percent, as measured by test performance.22

Barriers and Challenges
While larger school districts may have the capacity to perform vulnerability assessments
and develop climate action plans, smaller school districts may be more resource-
constrained. Where planning efforts do move forward, this can lead to a more limited
engagement process with environmental justice and other priority populations, which
can have disproportional negative impacts on these underserved communities.95 In the
absence of planning, school districts may only begin to consider implementing resilience
strategies after a hazard event damages assets or otherwise disrupts school operations,
as opposed to proactively developing plans and strategies to mitigate impacts from
hazards. Some projects described in this section have significant capital costs and may
not result in operating cost savings, hampering the ability to use some alternative
financing options such as Energy Management Services (EMS. This can make the
upfront investment challenging, even while school districts may recognize the potential
for avoided costs from a partial or total loss of assets or operational disruptions.
Assessing the exposure to certain hazards can also be challenging due to limitations in
available data. As an example, the Metropolitan Area Planning Council (MAPC)
released a report analyzing data on the 2010 flood event in the Greater Boston area
46

and found that the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Flood Maps did
not reflect where stormwater flooding occurred during the event.96
47
II. Goal 1: Achieve Green Schools

Methods, Best Practices, and Standards for Achieving Green and Healthy Schools in the Commonwealth

III. Goal 2: Achieve Healthy Schools
Children, teachers, and other school staff spend approximately 1,000 hours inside
schools each year and possibly more for extracurricular activities. Children are exposed
to building conditions—both healthful and hazardous—for much of their lives and are
biologically more susceptible to certain environmental hazards than adults because of
their smaller size and developmental stage. Many students also have asthma, which
increases their susceptibility to respiratory irritants. During the 2022–2023 school year,
9.9 percent of all enrolled students in Massachusetts had confirmed instances of
asthma.97 Given children’s constant exposure to school buildings and their
susceptibility, achieving a healthy school free of hazardous substances and with clean
air and water is essential.
New buildings are not always free from environmental hazards. In recent years, newer
environmental health concerns have arisen in schools, such as exposure to airborne
infectious diseases and possible exposures from the use of artificial turf fields. Not only
should schools be free from hazards, but schools should also strive for proactively
healthy environments, which includes maintaining a comfortable learning environment
and properly designing spaces. Both existing and future buildings can be retrofitted or
designed to achieve a healthy and productive learning environment for all.

standards, and relevant resources across each of the 10 objectives.
Objective 2a. Improve Air Quality
Improving air quality is a key aspect of achieving a healthy school. Exposure to many
environmental hazards occurs through the air, and children breathe more air relative to
their size than adults. This section presents background information and a high-level
summary of methods and best practices for mitigating the following seven indoor air
quality exposure hazards:
1. Airborne transmission of disease
2. Asbestos
3. Carbon monoxide
4. Mold and moisture
5. PCBs
6. Radon

7. Outdoor air pollutants
Addressing this range of airborne hazards can help improve air quality in schools and
reduce acute and chronic illnesses among children and school staff.
2a(1) Reduce Airborne Transmission of Disease
Background
Infections can spread in schools through numerous pathways, such as physical contact,
touching shared objects, or breathing air with infectious particles.98 While different
diseases are spread by different transmission pathways, this section focuses on
reducing transmission of diseases that can spread via airborne transmission. SARS-
CoV-2 (which causes COVID-19), influenza viruses, and respiratory syncytial virus are
some of the major pathogens that spread in schools through airborne transmission.
Reducing airborne transmission of disease can reduce illness among students and staff,
as well as illness-related absenteeism.98
Methods and Best Practices
The first category of recommendations are practices that schools can use in their daily
operations to reduce the airborne transmission of disease. The second category is
steps for when an individual is sick or when rates of disease are high in a school
community. Table 12 summarizes the methods and best practices for reducing airborne
transmission of disease/illness in schools. For each method and best practice, the table
presents the approximate capital and operating costs, implementation timeframe, and
ease of implementation. See Section VII, Objective 2a(1) for additional narrative
descriptions of each of the methods and best practices.

Barriers and Challenges
One major barrier to reducing airborne transmission of infectious diseases through
ventilation and air filtration is the costs associated with updating many school ventilation
systems and purchasing and maintaining portable air filters. While lower in cost, moving
large events outdoors can create a logistical challenge, depending on the space
available at a given school, and the feasibility of outdoor events may not be possible
due to weather, particularly in the winter when rates of respiratory infections are
generally highest. Another challenge may be implementing more rigorous infection
control measures during outbreaks or epidemics. For example, very young children
often have difficulty wearing masks properly, and modifying class size, establishing
cohorts, or changing schedules may be constrained by the size of school buildings.

2a(2) Prevent Exposure to Asbestos
Background
Asbestos is a group of naturally occurring minerals. Historically, asbestos was used
extensively in diverse products due to its strength, flexibility, and resistance to heat and
chemicals. Asbestos-containing material (ACM) can be found in most primary,
secondary, and charter schools, with building materials and insulation often being the
most common ACMs.99,100 Building materials are considered ACMs if they are made of
over 1 percent asbestos.100 When ACMs deteriorate over time or are disturbed, they
can release asbestos fibers, which can stay suspended in the air for hours or even
days, posing an exposure risk.99–101 Exposure to asbestos fibers can cause serious
health problems, including lung cancer, mesothelioma, and asbestosis.99,101 Generally,
materials containing asbestos do not pose a health risk if they are maintained intact and
undisturbed.101
Methods and Best Practices
Table 13 summarizes the methods and best practices for preventing asbestos exposure
in schools across three areas: preparation; continual monitoring and exposure
mitigation; and exposure mitigation during renovations or abatement. For each method
and best practice, the table presents the approximate capital and operating costs,
implementation timeframe, and ease of implementation. See Section VII, Objective
2a(2) for additional narrative descriptions of each of the methods and best practices.

Barriers and Challenges
Challenges to asbestos abatement can be both financial and logistical. Schools often
lack funding to inspect for, test, and remove ACM.102 Asbestos abatement can be
disruptive to normal school activities since asbestos must be removed by professionals
and must comply with safety measures required by state and federal regulations.102

III.Goal 2: Achieve Healthy Schools

Methods, Best Practices, and Standards for Achieving Green and Healthy Schools in the Commonwealth
of Massachusetts
Considerations for Renovations
Massachusetts has many older school buildings that periodically need renovations to
maintain functionality. Older buildings are also likely to have harmful substances
contained within legacy building materials, such as asbestos, PCBs, lead, and
mercury. In addition, mold may be revealed by renovation projects, and renovations
that change air flow or the building envelope may impact radon levels. Many of these
materials only become a health risk when they are disturbed, which includes
renovation projects. When disturbed, these substances can become airborne and
accumulate in dust. Without proper renovation controls, school occupants can
become exposed to these materials through inhalation and ingestion pathways.
There are several steps that schools can take to mitigate these risks:
1. Schools should create and maintain an inventory of materials that contain
asbestos, PCBs, lead, and mercury along with where they are found within
the school.
2. Do not disturb any of these materials unnecessarily. Many building
components which contain these chemicals only become dangerous to health
when they are exposed or moved. For example, building occupants will not
be exposed to asbestos within insulation until a wall is opened and the
insulation is disturbed.
3. Use the inventory of materials to routinely check to make sure that building
components containing these materials are in good condition. If they need
repair, it is more likely that these substances will be released into the
environment. If building components need repair, plan to do so with the
proper controls in place.
4. When renovating, consider the risks of disrupting any of these materials
before starting the project. Plan to implement mitigation strategies to protect
building occupants. Mitigation strategies are specific to the contaminant of
concern, but cordoning off the area under renovation, keeping renovation
areas clean, and planning renovation projects for times when the building has
fewer occupants (i.e., summer) are good practices.
5. Before a renovation project starts, create a communication plan for informing
staff, parents, students, and other involved community members. The plan
should provide details about the extent of the health risks posed by the
project, as well as an outline of the mitigation procedures that will be used to
protect those on the school campus. The communication plan should also
include contact information and can direct interested parties to further
resources explaining the risk posed by legacy building materials.

2a(3) Reduce Exposure to Carbon Monoxide
Background
Carbon monoxide is a colorless, odorless, tasteless gas that can be deadly at high
concentrations. Exposure to carbon monoxide can also produce symptoms such as
headache, nausea, dizziness, confusion, fainting, and unconsciousness, or can mimic
flu symptoms.103 Carbon monoxide is one of the leading causes of poisoning deaths in
the United States.103 It is produced through incomplete combustion of fuels such as gas,
oil, kerosene, or wood. Older or poorly maintained combustion-based appliances are
more likely to produce excess carbon monoxide. Proper ventilation can prevent the
accumulation of carbon monoxide in enclosed spaces.101,104 Carbon monoxide should
not be detectable in a typical indoor environment unless detected outdoors, in which
case indoor levels should be less than or equal to those measured outdoors.
Methods and Best Practices
Table 14 summarizes the methods and best practices for reducing carbon monoxide
exposure in schools in two areas: planning and management; and technical
interventions. For each method/best practice, the table presents the approximate capital
and operating costs, implementation timeframe, and ease of implementation. See
Section VII, Objective 2a(3) for additional narrative descriptions of each of the methods
and best practices.

Ease of Implementation: 1= easier to implement; 3 = more difficult to implement
Barriers and Challenges
Because carbon monoxide is a colorless, odorless gas, it is difficult to detect without
alarms. Prevention of carbon monoxide exposure in school buildings relies on
monitoring carbon monoxide levels and proper ventilation. Potential barriers to
preventing carbon monoxide exposure include a lack of financial resources to install or
maintain a carbon monoxide monitoring and alarm system or a lack of financial
resources or expertise to maintain one properly. The biggest challenge to reducing
carbon monoxide exposure in schools is the location of schools, as proximity to major
roadways will increase the likelihood of elevated carbon monoxide.
2a(4) Reduce Exposure to Mold and Moisture
Background
All types of molds have the potential to cause health effects, although some are more
harmful than others. Health effects can include irritation of the eyes, skin, and
respiratory system.101 Many people are allergic to mold, and mold can exacerbate
asthma.101 Molds can be found almost everywhere, and they thrive in moist areas.101
56
III.Goal 2: Achieve Healthy Schools

The key to controlling mold exposure is to prevent excessive moisture, repair leaks,
address condensation promptly, and use the appropriate cleaning methods and
products.

Barriers and Challenges
Mold can present significant challenges in school buildings in Massachusetts.
Massachusetts has months with high humidity and temperatures, and precipitation year-
round. Climate change and an increase in extreme heat and humidity will inevitably
exacerbate mold problems for schools. Many of the schools in Massachusetts are older
buildings with systems that are inadequate for removing humidity and need repair to
prevent leaks and water intrusion. These repairs and system updates carry significant
costs, which is one of the greatest challenges in preventing mold in Massachusetts

schools. There is also significant misinformation about the need for or efficacy of mold
testing or sampling that can potentially result in spending unnecessary resources for
sampling that should have instead been directed towards mitigation.
2a(5) Reduce Exposure to Polychlorinated Biphenyls (PCBs)
Background
PCBs are a class of human-made organic chemicals that consist of over 200 unique
compounds (commonly referred to as congeners) that make up numerous mixtures.105
At certain levels, PCBs can be hazardous to human health.106 Numerous U.S. and
international health agencies have determined that PCBs are a probable human
carcinogen.105 Research in humans has found that PCBs are also associated with
immune system suppression, reproductive effects, neurological effects in children
exposed in utero, altered thyroid hormone levels, and cardiovascular effects.105
PCB exposure can be an issue in school buildings, as PCBs were widely used in
building materials found in construction and renovations circa 1950 to 1979.106,107 PCBs
have been widely detected in schools in the northeast region, leading to legislation in
Vermont, for example, requiring all schools in the state built or renovated prior to 1980
to have their air tested for PCBs by 2027.108 PCBs are most commonly found in
fluorescent light ballasts (FLBs), caulking, and mastic (plant-based resin); it was also
used in tiles or carpets, window glazing, and some adhesives and paints.106,109 Although
PCB production was banned in 1979, they are still in the building materials that were
installed before 1979 and represent potential sources of PCB exposure in schools.106,110
If caulking with PCBs is deteriorating, or light ballasts with PCBs are in disrepair, they
may release PCBs into the air, which could be directly inhaled or may settle onto dust.
Dust poses both an inhalation risk (when recirculated back into the air) and an ingestion
risk (when people touch dusty surfaces then touch their mouth or food). 106,109
Methods and Best Practices
Table 16 summarizes the methods and best practices for reducing exposure to PCBs in
schools across three areas: identifying and removing PCBs from schools;
considerations during renovations and repairs; and simple steps to reduce exposure to
PCBs found in air and dust. For each method and best practice, the table presents the
approximate capital and operating costs, implementation timeframe, and ease of
implementation. See Section VII, Objective 2a(5) for additional narrative descriptions of
each of the methods and best practices.

Barriers and Challenges
Even before remediation, one challenge to reducing PCB exposure is pinpointing the
exact sources of PCBs.111 Locating PCB sources can require lengthy and expensive
testing; alternatively, the building manager can assume all materials suspected to
contain PCBs do contain PCBs and treat them as such. However, a survey found that a
lack of awareness of what PCBs are was the most commonly cited impediment to PCB
testing in school buildings.111
60
III.Goal 2: Achieve Healthy Schools

Methods, Best Practices, and Standards for Achieving Green and Healthy Schools in the Commonwealth
of Massachusetts
Two major barriers to PCB remediation in schools are logistics and cost. PCB
remediation requires, at a minimum, cordoning off portions of a school building.111 At
most, it can require temporarily shutting down or completely razing a school building.111
Both the moving of students and staff within a building or to another location and paying
for remediation and renovations can become extremely expensive.111,112 As a result,
school districts with greater financial resources tend to take steps to mitigate PCB
exposure, while school districts with limited financial resources are often unable to
undertake the necessary renovations, exacerbating health inequities and perpetuating
structural racism. 112
2a(6) Reduce Exposure to Radon
Background
Radon is a naturally occurring radioactive element that is released when rocks and soil
break down. During that process, this colorless, odorless, tasteless gas can migrate
through the soil to the ground surface.113 Radon can enter buildings such as schools
through cracks, joints, and gaps in basement flooring and walls. Long-term inhalation of
radon can increase the risk of lung cancer, making radon the second leading cause of
lung cancer after smoking. Among smokers, lung cancer risk from radon exposure is
even greater, as exposure to tobacco and radon interact synergistically.113 Smoking and
radon exposure can increase risk of lung cancer up to 10-fold compared to radon
exposure alone.113 Radon is a relevant issue across all of Massachusetts.113 An
estimated 650,000 homes in Massachusetts have radon levels that exceed EPA’s
action guideline of 4 picocuries per liter (pCi/L).114
Methods and Best Practices
Table 17 summarizes methods and best practices for reducing radon exposure in
schools related to planning and management and technical interventions. For each
method/best practice, the table presents the approximate capital and operating costs,

Barriers and Challenges
The greatest barrier to addressing radon in schools is the cost of mitigation. The cost of
mitigation, or fear of a potentially high cost, can discourage school administrators from
testing for the presence of radon because if they were to detect it, they would face
pressure to install a mitigation system. Because testing is not required, radon testing
may be more likely to be deprioritized. Another barrier is the associated cost of radon
testing equipment and its routine maintenance, as well as maintaining and operating the
HVAC system to reduce radon exposure, which may also pose a challenge for some
school districts.

Mitigating Occurrences of Vapor Intrusion
Vapor intrusion occurs when vapor-forming chemicals from a subsurface source
migrate into a building. Basements are more prone to higher levels of chemicals
from vapor intrusion given that they are underground and have more entry points.
Some substances that enter a building through vapor intrusion have harmful health
effects, including volatile organic compounds (VOCs) such as trichloroethylene and
benzine, semi-volatile organic compounds (SVOCs) such as naphthalene, some
PCBs and pesticides, and elemental mercury. However, not all buildings are likely
to be affected by vapor intrusion of harmful substances.
Existing schools located near (<100 yards) past or present industrial or commercial
facilities may consider testing indoor air for VOCs using EPA Method TO-15. Since
the vapor intrusion pathway relies on chemicals coming up from the subsurface,
floor drains, particularly in bathrooms, are common subsurface vapor entry points.
In the siting and construction phase of building a new school in an urban area or
any area with historical use of VOCs, school districts should conduct a thorough
subsurface and groundwater investigation to identify potentially harmful chemicals
that may enter through vapor intrusion. This information is used to determine the
appropriate design elements to include as part of a vapor barrier and potential sub-
slab soil vapor collection system. If school districts are utilizing state funding for new
construction projects (e.g., via a grant from the MSBA), the project will be subject to
the Massachusetts Environmental Protection Act, which requires that state agencies
use all practicable means and measures to minimize a proposed project’s potential
damage to the environment.

2a(7) Reduce Exposure to Outdoor Air Pollutants
Background
Students and staff are exposed to outdoor air pollution at schools during outdoor
activities such as recess and during pickup and drop-off times. It can also impact the
quality of indoor air at the school as HVAC systems draw in outdoor air to ventilate
indoor spaces. The quality of outdoor air near schools is greatly impacted by proximity
to roadways and industrial areas. While air quality impacts everyone, children with
developing respiratory systems are particularly susceptible to the impacts of poor air
quality. 101
A major source of outdoor air pollution is emissions from motor vehicles; vehicle
emissions having harmful health effects include fine particulate matter (PM ), carbon
2.5
monoxide, nitrogen oxides, and benzene, among other substances.117,118 Idling school
buses can be a major source of vehicle emissions near schools, particularly when
buses have older engines. In addition to upgrading vehicle fleets, exposure to exhaust
63
III.Goal 2: Achieve Healthy Schools

Methods, Best Practices, and Standards for Achieving Green and Healthy Schools in the Commonwealth
of Massachusetts
can be reduced by parking idling vehicles where exhaust is less likely to enter the
school and by reducing idling time for all vehicles in close proximity to the school.
Vehicle emissions will also be higher if a school is located in a busy urban area or sited
near a major roadway or highway.
Another source of outdoor air pollution that is of increasing concern in Massachusetts is
wildfire smoke.119 This type of smoke consists of a mix of gasses and PM that is
2.5
unhealthy to breathe and can be dangerous for vulnerable populations, including
children.119 In Massachusetts, wildfire smoke events are sporadic and intermittent.
These events are, however, expected to increase in frequency as a result of climate
change.22 There are several measures that schools should take to prepare for providing
a safe and healthy learning environment for students during these events.
Methods and Best Practices
Table 18 summarizes the methods and best practices for reducing exposure to outdoor
air pollution in schools across two areas: policy and education; and infrastructure. For
each method and best practice, the table presents the approximate capital and
operating costs, implementation timeframe, and ease of implementation. See Section
VII, Objective 2a(7) for additional narrative descriptions of each of the methods and best
practices.

Barriers and Challenges
Schools must be aware of the many sources of outdoor air pollution that could impact
the health of those learning and working at the school. Certain interventions are easier
than others; for example, the cost of electrifying or upgrading school bus fleets can be a
significant challenge for many school districts. While electric school buses have lower
maintenance costs, the price of new electric buses is significantly higher than new
diesel buses. Reconfiguring pickup and drop-off zones at existing schools can also pose
design challenges.
In addition, wildfire smoke events have historically been relatively uncommon in
Massachusetts, and schools may not have experience preparing for and reacting to
them. Creating a wildfire smoke plan may be new to school administration, as may
routinely checking outdoor air quality

Objective 2b. Improve Water Quality
2b(1) Reduce Exposure to Lead in Drinking Water
Background
Since clean drinking water is essential for the health and well-being of all people, water
with levels of heavy metals such as lead and copper can be particularly damaging. Lead
and other metals can leach into drinking water from pipes, solder, and even the interior
components of drinking fountains.99,101 Further, improper treatment of public water
systems and poor maintenance of or malfunctioning plumbing systems can also lead to
detectable lead levels in drinking water.120 There is no safe level of lead in drinking
water. Lead can have long lasting impacts to health, including damage to the brain,
nervous system, kidneys, and more.99 Exposure to lead in drinking water can cause
serious health effects in all age groups, but children are most vulnerable to health
effects from lead exposure since their growing bodies can absorb more lead than the
average adult.101 Lead can be especially harmful to children’s cognitive function due to
its neurotoxic effects; reduced attention span, verbal skills, and overall IQ can be
attributed to lead exposure.120 Thus, it is essential to provide children with access to
water without detectable levels of lead, especially in schools, by conducting testing,
issuing awareness statements, and implementing remediation efforts.
Many schools are supplied by public water systems; others have their own water supply
and are themselves classified as public water systems under the Safe Drinking Water
Act (SDWA). 121,122 In both cases, they are regulated by MassDEP for lead under the
Lead and Copper Rule and are required to do varying amounts of limited testing.
However, there is no federal or state requirement to test every outlet in schools nor is
there a federal or state regulatory standard for lead in school drinking water. MassDEP
regulations require that community public water systems test two outlets at two schools
or EECFs every six months, annually, or every three years depending on the required
monitoring schedule of the public water system. In addition, MassDEP has established
a guideline level of lead in school and EECF drinking water of 1 part per billion (ppb),
which is the laboratory detection limit. When levels above 1 ppb are detected,
MassDEP recommends taking remediation actions and provides guidance and
resources on methods to reducing levels.
MassDEP’s Water-Smart Program (formerly called the Lead in Schools Assistance
Program) offers a free comprehensive approach to testing for lead in schools (and
EECFs) and provides resources to take action when lead is detected above 1 ppb. The
Program is funded by EPA’s Water Infrastructure Improvements for the Nation grants.
The Water-Smart Program is a component of the Lead Contamination Control Act
(LCCA) Program, which offers additional ongoing support to schools concerning
addressing lead in drinking water.

*MassDEP’s Water-Smart Program, LCCA Program, and SWIG Program offer many of these services.
Barriers and Challenges
The most significant barriers to improving water quality by reducing lead levels are the
mostly voluntary nature of testing and the cost associated with remediation actions.
Schools should prepare to develop communication, sampling, and testing plans over
time and to work with community organizations and state agencies to identify the
necessary resources to act.

Barriers and Challenges
There are many challenges related to reducing exposure to PFAS, as these are
widespread chemicals. All public water suppliers in Massachusetts are required to test
for PFAS, whether the supplier is a community system or a school with its own well. If
schools are part of a larger community public water system, it is the responsibility of the
public water system to test for PFAS. Thus, schools must build local partnerships to
assess potential contamination, address exceedances of drinking water standards, and
reduce sources of PFAS where feasible.
Objective 2c. Maintain Thermal Comfort
Background
Massachusetts school buildings experience a wide range of temperatures making
maintaining thermal comfort for students and staff both challenging and necessary. All
school buildings in Massachusetts have heating, though the system may not always
operate consistently throughout classrooms. However, many schools do not have air
69

conditioning, which is becoming a concern for student and staff health, given the
increase in hot and humid days during the school year resulting from climate
change.128,129 Schools may also lack other strategies to keep classrooms cool, such as
windows that can open and window shades.130 Extreme heat in schools with no cooling
can harm human health and academic attainment. Specifically, effects include reduced
cognitive function, learning, and academic performance; exacerbation of asthma,
bronchitis, and other respiratory conditions; increased incidence of heat stroke and heat
exhaustion; and loss of school time due to school closures or early dismissals.104,129–131
One analysis estimates that, since 1970, the number of days above 80°F, the threshold
identified as requiring air conditioning, has increased by nine to 13 days per school
year, depending on the Massachusetts school district.128
Methods and Best Practices
Table 21 summarizes the methods and best practices for improving thermal comfort in
schools. For each method and best practice, the table presents the approximate capital

Barriers and Challenges
The major challenges to maintaining thermal comfort in schools are the age of school
buildings and HVAC systems in Massachusetts and the cost of installing or updating air
conditioning systems. Massachusetts public school buildings, some over 100 years old,
were built when there were fewer extreme heat days during the school year.128,132
Objective 2d. Use Integrated Pest Management
Background
Pest management in schools is important because certain pests can trigger allergies
(e.g., cockroach dust) and may contaminate food and transmit disease. Integrated pest
management (IPM) is a sustainable approach to managing pests that combines
biological, cultural, physical, and chemical tools to minimize economic, health, and
environmental risks. IPM strategies focus on long-term prevention and suppression of
71
III.Goal 2: Achieve Healthy Schools

Methods, Best Practices, and Standards for Achieving Green and Healthy Schools in the Commonwealth
of Massachusetts
pests, ultimately reducing the use of potentially hazardous chemical pesticides. IPM
approaches prioritize reducing or mitigating conditions that make facilities vulnerable to
pests through pest-preventive building design and repairs, building occupant education,
and proactive pest population monitoring. The Massachusetts Pesticide Control Act
(M.G.L., c.132B) restricts the use of most pesticides in schools.
Methods and Best Practices
Table 22 summarizes methods and best practices for implementing IPM in schools. For
each method/best practice, the table presents the approximate capital and operating
costs, implementation timeframe, and ease of implementation. See Section VII,

Barriers and Challenges
Perceived pest threats often do not align with the real threats that pests pose. For
instance, many families are worried about lice transfer at school, whereas mosquito
bites are far more prevalent and pose more significant risks. Building occupants may
have varying levels of tolerance for pest presence. Education and communication are
critical to establishing shared expectations and clarifying the important role that students
and staff play in maintaining pest-free facilities.

Objective 2e. Procure and Use Green Cleaning Supplies and
Chemicals
Background
Thousands of chemicals are used as part of daily practices in schools, including those
used in laboratory settings or as art supplies, cleaning agents, and tools for building
O&M.99 Students and staff can be exposed to unnecessary risks when hazardous or
mismanaged chemicals are present in schools.101 Further, exposure to certain
chemicals can lead to serious health effects, including cancer, reproductive disorders,
organ damage, and irritation to the eyes, nose, and throat.99,101 Thus, it is essential that
schools have a robust chemical management system to prevent the improper use,
storage, and disposal of chemicals. Additionally, schools should procure green
chemicals to reduce the amount of hazardous and toxic chemicals stored onsite.
Methods and Best Practices
Table 23 summarizes the methods and best practices for procuring and using green
cleaning supplies/chemicals in schools across two areas: implementing a chemical
management system; and utilizing green chemicals to protect the health and safety of
staff and students using chemicals in schools. For each method and best practice, the

Barriers and Challenges
Schools may face challenges when trying to implement a chemical management system
or procure green chemicals. Some notable challenges in regard to school chemical
management systems may be the lack of environmental, health, and safety staff onsite
or protective systems such as personal protective equipment (PPE), medical
monitoring, control mechanisms for hazardous chemical releases, etc.133 Additionally,
challenges regarding the procurement of green chemicals may include lack of
knowledge on which chemicals are considered hazardous and which are considered
safer alternatives, as well as limited financial resources to purchase such
alternatives.133,134 Thus, it is essential that schools build a team of partners and a long-
term plan that can assist in working towards these goals.

Objective 2f. Reduce Exposure to Hazardous Substances
2f(1) Reduce Exposure to Lead in Paint and Soil
Background
Lead is a naturally occurring metal once used in various products, including paints and
primers.100 Lead is considered highly toxic and is associated with adverse effects for
both children and adults.101 Outside of lead in drinking water, people can be exposed by
inhaling dust or ingesting particles via hand-to-mouth contact, where lead-based paint is
one of the most common sources of contamination.100 There is no safe level of lead
exposure, with associated health effects including anemia, decreased kidney function,
high blood pressure, reproductive harm, and damage to the brain and nervous
system.99,100 Children under the age of six are the most vulnerable to long-lasting
damage from lead exposure due to its neurotoxic capabilities, where health effects such
as behavioral and learning problems, low IQ, hyperactivity, slowed growth, hearing
issues, and more have been identified.99–101
Methods and Best Practices
Table 24 summarizes the methods and best practices for reducing exposure to lead in
paint and soil at schools. For each method and best practice, the table presents the

75
III.Goal 2: Achieve Healthy Schools

Methods, Best Practices, and Standards for Achieving Green and Healthy Schools in the Commonwealth

Barriers and Challenges
A major barrier to minimizing exposure to lead from paint is the need for renovations.
Renovating buildings with lead-based paint can be challenging since it is not only a
costly venture but may also require that the building remain unoccupied throughout the
renovation process. As a result, schools must be prepared to handle these issues if
lead-based paint is identified.
2f(2) Reduce Exposure to Mercury
Background
Mercury is a naturally occurring element traditionally used in many products due to its
advantageous properties, such as high density, liquid state at room temperature, ability
to conduct electricity, and more.135 While mercury can be a helpful substance, exposure
to high levels by breathing in vapors, touching mercury in its liquid state, or eating
contaminated food sources is associated with damage to the brain, heart, kidney, lungs,
and immune system.99,136 Further, it is considered a neurotoxic substance that can be
particularly harmful to children.101
Methods and Best Practices

III.Goal 2: Achieve Healthy Schools

Methods, Best Practices, and Standards for Achieving Green and Healthy Schools in the Commonwealth
of Massachusetts
Barriers and Challenges
The greatest barrier to reducing exposure to mercury in schools is replacing mercury-
containing products; however, replacing products is more cost-effective than paying to
clean up a mercury incident. One challenge is that, despite the best efforts of school
leaders, students may bring an item containing mercury to school. As a result, schools
must be prepared to address mercury incidents, even if they do not use or maintain an
inventory of mercury-containing products on-site.
Objective 2g. Safely Procure, Use, and Dispose of Crumb Rubber
Background
Artificial turf fields (ATFs) for school sports are popular alternatives to natural grass.137
ATFs are often cheaper—or perceived as cheaper—to maintain, and can be used
during and immediately after rain, which enables more playing time.138,139 ATFs
commonly comprise three core components: padding and backing materials at the
bottom, infill in the middle, and artificial grass blades at the top. The grass blades are
made of plastic, and the infill layer is typically composed of a mixture of sand and what
is referred to as “crumb rubber,” often made from recycled car and truck tires.137
Alternatives to recycled tires for crumb rubber include ethylene propylene diene
terpolymer, thermoplastic elastomer, and waste athletic shoe materials, among many
other materials.138 Mineral-based and plant-derived materials such as sand, cork,
coconut hulls, and walnut shells can also be used and may provide lower chemical
alternatives to crumb rubber.138
While DPH has found that scientific research generally concludes that adverse health
effects from ATFs are unlikely, there are no existing studies that have specifically
examined the relationship between exposure to crumb rubber and disease outcomes. 137
Communities have raised concerns about potential exposure to chemicals that may be
found in the crumb rubber infill layer, which include PFAS, VOCs, SVOCs, and metals
such as lead.137,140 Exposure to chemicals in ATFs could occur through inhalation of
VOCs or particles released by the ATF during use, swallowing crumb rubber while
playing on fields, and skin contact with crumb rubber and plastic blades.137 138 137,138
In response to concerns about ATFs, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC)/Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, EPA, and the
Consumer Product Safety Commission conducted a multi-year research effort to
understand the constituent chemicals in tire crumb rubber and how people may be
exposed while playing on ATFs. 141 Only small amounts of chemicals were found to be
released into the air from tire crumb. For many chemicals measured, concentrations
measured near ATFs were no different than background levels; for some chemicals,
however, measured concentrations were higher near the ATF. Less than 1 to 3 percent
of metals were released from tire crumb rubber into simulated biological fluids.
Concentrations of metals in the blood of people who played on ATFs were similar to
those of the general population. There was no difference in polycyclic aromatic
77
III.Goal 2: Achieve Healthy Schools

Methods, Best Practices, and Standards for Achieving Green and Healthy Schools in the Commonwealth
of Massachusetts
hydrocarbon metabolites found between people playing on ATFs and those playing on
grass.141
Beyond possible exposure to hazardous chemicals, there are additional health-related
concerns about using ATFs as an alternative to natural grass fields, including more
frequent skin abrasions, higher risk of heat-related illness during exercise, higher
incidence of joint injuries, and potentially more significant risk of head injuries.137,139
Various studies have found ATFs to be anywhere from 35°F to 86°F hotter than natural
grass, which can contribute to heat-related illness and burns.138 Heat can also lead to
increased emissions of VOCs and SVOCs from the plastic and rubber materials that
make up ATFs.138
ATFs have a limited lifespan, and they can become unsafe to play on beyond that
timeframe.139 Disposal and replacement of fields represent additional costs that schools
often overlook when deciding whether or not to install an ATF. While some cities in
Massachusetts have developed rules related to the use of ATFs, there are currently no
state regulations related to ATFs. 140 When considering the installation of ATFs or when
playing on an ATF, school leaders can take numerous steps to weigh their options and
reduce children’s exposure to chemicals or particles from ATFs while playing sports.
Methods and Best Practices

Barriers and Challenges
One particular challenge regarding the use of ATF is the lack of definitive research on
the safety or health effects of playing on ATFs. While research suggests that chemical
exposure while playing on an ATF is not much greater than background exposure, not
all chemicals in ATFs are always known and characterized, and numerous routes of
exposure exist. Both ATF and natural grass fields cost money to maintain; disposal
costs and methods for ATF at the end of their useful life span will need to be accounted
for in school district budgets.

Methods, Best Practices, and Standards for Achieving Green and Healthy Schools in the Commonwealth
of Massachusetts
Objective 2h. Create a Safe Environment for Students with Life-
Threatening Food Allergies
Background
Food allergies affect about 8 percent of children in the United States.142 People can be
allergic to any food, but the nine most common food allergens in the United States are
milk, eggs, fish, shellfish, wheat, soy, peanuts, tree nuts, and sesame.142 Food allergies
can be life-threatening, and some people with severe reactions may not have
experienced them in the past. Avoidance is the best way to keep children safe.
Individuals with life-threatening food allergies may be prescribed epinephrine auto-
injecting pens in the event of exposure to allergens. During the 2021–2022 school year
in Massachusetts, 259 students and 27 other individuals were treated for anaphylaxis at
school, and 39.5 percent of these anaphylactic shock events were among individuals
with no history of anaphylaxis.143 Most of these reactions (65.7 percent) were caused by
food, and in 159 of the 188 food allergen anaphylactic events, the reaction was caused
by ingesting a food allergen.143
Schools can help students avoid food allergens by creating allergy- or food-free spaces
outside of designated eating areas, keeping and understanding ingredients in each of
the food items being served (especially if the items are prepared and do not have visible
labels), ensuring proper food preparation practices, and avoiding cross-contact in food
preparation and service areas, including in kitchens and eating areas. Schools must
also be able to respond to anaphylactic shock events in the case of cross-contact or in
the case of previously unknown allergies.
In Massachusetts, public and private schools, educational institutions, summer camps,
childcare facilities, and other childcare programs approved to participate in U.S.
Department of Agriculture (USDA) Child Nutrition Programs are exempt from DPH
regulations 105 CMR 590.000 regarding food allergens, provided that they have written
policies and procedures for identifying, documenting, and accommodating students with
food allergies. Documentation is also required to verify participation in food allergen
training recognized by DESE and DPH. These institutions must also train their
employees in food allergy awareness as it relates to their assigned duties.
Methods and Best Practices
Table 27 summarizes the methods and best practices for creating a safe environment
for students with life-threatening food allergies in schools related to developing written
protocols, ensuring preparedness, and implementing prevention measures. For each
method and best practice, the table presents the approximate capital and operating
costs, implementation timeframe, and ease of implementation. See Section VII,
Objective 2h for additional narrative descriptions of each of the methods and best
practices.

Barriers and Challenges
By the time children are in elementary or secondary school, many life-threatening
allergens are already known. A significant percentage of school epinephrine
administrations, however, involve individuals who did not have a previously recognized
allergy. For example, between 2004 and 2010, 23 percent of epinephrine
administrations in Massachusetts schools were to individuals without a previously
recognized allergy.144 This means that regardless of prevention efforts, schools will
always need to be prepared to respond to serious allergic reactions. Additionally, while
food is not typically an asthma trigger, children with both food allergies and asthma are
at greater risk of a serious reaction.
Maintaining allergy-free zones can be difficult when physical space is limited, such as in
cafeterias and kitchens. This is especially true for existing older buildings, though it can
and should be done regardless of the space limitations.

III.Goal 2: Achieve Healthy Schools

Methods, Best Practices, and Standards for Achieving Green and Healthy Schools in the Commonwealth
of Massachusetts
Objective 2i. Create a Productive Learning Environment for All
Students
2i(1) Optimize Lighting
Background
Students are engaged in various visual tasks throughout the day, from reading printed
materials up close to blackboards at a distance.145 Studies show that children are
sensitive to light exposure and that low levels of light indoors can be associated with an
increased risk of nearsightedness.120 Further, bright lighting is associated with greater
alertness and can enhance a student’s performance at school.120 Thus, school
classrooms with high-quality lighting promote effective learning and teaching.
Methods and Best Practices
Table 28 summarizes the methods and best practices for optimizing lighting in schools.
For each method and best practice, the table presents the approximate capital and
operating costs, implementation timeframe, and ease of implementation. See Section

Barriers and Challenges
Barriers associated with lighting as a means of creating a productive learning
environment may include the cost of artificial lighting with appropriate illuminance and
color temperature and building-specific constraints that may limit available natural light.
Schools should strive to balance artificial and natural lighting based on their current
lighting system and available resources.

2i(2) Optimize Acoustic Performance
Background
Ensuring that classrooms have appropriate noise levels and listening conditions is
essential for students to clearly understand the instruction delivered by teachers.146
Children younger than 15 years old are more sensitive to disruptive listening conditions,
where excessive noise can cause cognitive distress and reduced performance in
school.145,146 Thus, schools should focus on improving the acoustic environment in the
classroom to enhance the learning experience for all students.
Methods and Best Practices
Table 29 summarizes the methods and best practices for optimizing acoustic
performance in schools. For each method and best practice, the table presents the
approximate capital and operating costs, implementation timeframe, and ease of
implementation. See Section VII, Objective 2i(2) for additional narrative descriptions of
each of the methods and best practices.

Ease of Implementation: 1= easier to implement; 3 = more difficult to implement
Barriers and Challenges
The main barrier to creating a productive learning environment by enhancing acoustic
performance is ensuring that building materials have good sound-absorbing capabilities.
While new construction and modernization projects can seamlessly incorporate these
materials into the design and construction, this can require more work to implement as a
retrofit measure in an existing building. Further, background noise from sources outside
of the school (e.g., vehicular traffic from nearby roadways) can also impact student
learning yet are challenging to control. Thus, schools should focus on minimizing noise
from sources they can control, such as HVAC systems, and invest in materials that
effectively reduce sound reverberation times.

III.Goal 2: Achieve Healthy Schools

Methods, Best Practices, and Standards for Achieving Green and Healthy Schools in the Commonwealth
of Massachusetts
Objective 2j. Design the Built Environment to Foster a Peaceful
School Community
Background
In Massachusetts, students and staff spend long days in school buildings. The design of
these buildings can play an important role in creating conditions that foster a peaceful
school community. High-traffic areas that force crowding and jostling can lead to stress
and increased violence, whereas specific and intentional design elements can support
positive mindsets and interactions.
Methods and Best Practices
Table 30 summarizes the methods and best practices for designing the built
environment to foster a peaceful school community across three categories: reducing
stressors resulting from the built environment; designing spaces in school buildings to
promote overall well-being; and designing spaces that facilitate positive social
interactions at school. For each method and best practice, the table presents the
approximate capital and operating costs, implementation timeframe, and ease of
implementation. See Section VII, Objective 2j for additional narrative descriptions of
each of the methods and best practices.

Ease of Implementation: 1= easier to implement; 3 = more difficult to implement
Barriers and Challenges
The greatest challenge to designing schools that foster a peaceful school community
lies in the existing infrastructure of Massachusetts school buildings. School building
layouts tend to be static. Changing built environment features such as room and hallway
layouts to reduce crowding and facilitate easy movement of students and staff may only
be possible with costly renovations. Additionally, many schools face crowding
challenges and might not have the physical space to provide students with options for
calming and activation without extensive renovations. Environmental stressors can also
be a challenge for older school buildings to address. See Objective 2a. Improve Air
Quality, Objective 2c. Maintain Thermal Comfort, and Objective 2i. Create a Productive
Learning Environment for All Students for additional relevant barriers and challenges.
85
III.Goal 2: Achieve Healthy Schools

Methods, Best Practices, and Standards for Achieving Green and Healthy Schools in the Commonwealth
of Massachusetts
IV. Goal 3: Achieve Equitable Outcomes for All Students
Achieving equitable outcomes for all students is essential to accomplishing the goal of
having green and healthy schools throughout the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. For
too long, inequitable distribution of funding and resources has led to inequitable
outcomes for marginalized students, including those with special education needs.
These inequities are the result of intentional choices that have been made by
policymakers and school districts since public schools first entered the
Commonwealth.147–149 To mitigate the inequities previously inherent in school systems,
policymakers and school districts must be intentional about centering equity when
dispersing funding and resources for capital improvement projects.
Segregation of Black and Latino students is a growing issue throughout
Massachusetts.148 This is evident in the number of schools experiencing racial isolation
and in the over-placement of Black and Latino students in more restrictive learning
environments.148,149 As school districts move toward a more green and healthy school
model, it is their responsibility to provide students with equitable access to inclusive and
healthy learning environments—regardless of race, gender, disability, or any other
identity. Just as every student has the right to receive an education in the least
restrictive learning environment, every student has a right to attend accessible, inclusive
schools free of environmental and health hazards.
86
IV. Goal 3: Achieve Equitable Outcomes for All Students

Methods, Best Practices, and Standards for Achieving Green and Healthy Schools in the Commonwealth
of Massachusetts
This section presents a tabular summary of the methods and best practices that can
help school districts across the Commonwealth achieve equitable outcomes for all
students and a brief discussion of notable barriers and challenges that schools are likely
to face. Content is provided across the following three objectives:
a. Optimize space to equitably meet special education needs
b. Prioritize universal accessibility
c. Use available data to identify and equitably prioritize schools of greatest need
and advocate for additional funding opportunities
Section VIII provides a more detailed narrative description of the methods and best
practices, details related to the relevant statutory/regulatory framework and notable
standards, and relevant resources across each of the three objectives.
Objective 3a. Optimize Space to Equitably Meet Special Education
Needs
Background
Federal and state regulations guarantee all students in the Commonwealth of
Massachusetts access to a free and appropriate public education (FAPE) in the least
restrictive environment (LRE), regardless of disability.150–152 This guarantee is especially
important for historically excluded students from underserved and marginalized
communities. Integrating students with disabilities into school communities is essential
for their behavioral, social, and academic well-being. Optimizing learning spaces to
meet the needs of all learners equitably must be a top priority for schools and school
districts to guarantee students’ access to FAPE in the least restrictive learning
environment possible.
A review of special education in Massachusetts examined the identification, placement,
and performance of students with disabilities throughout Massachusetts’ school
districts.149 The study developed four key findings:
• Low-income and non-low-income students with disabilities experience substantial
differences in identification, placement, and performance.
• Students with disabilities placed in full inclusion settings outperformed peers with
similar disabilities who spent less time in the general education setting.
• Secondary schools offer limited inclusive options for students with disabilities.
• Special education identification, placement, and performance varied significantly
from district to district.
In addition to the four key findings, the study also found that Black and Latino students
were disproportionately excluded from the general education setting.149 This was
especially evident in secondary schools where Black students were twice as likely as
their White peers to be placed in a substantially separate setting, even though Black
87
IV. Goal 3: Achieve Equitable Outcomes for All Students

Methods, Best Practices, and Standards for Achieving Green and Healthy Schools in the Commonwealth
of Massachusetts
and White students have similar rates of inclusion at the elementary level.149 These
disparities are a result of historical and systemic practices limiting access to special
education services in underserved and marginalized communities. Student placement
should always be based on individual needs rather than available space. 153 To
accomplish this, schools and school districts must evaluate the availability of and
access to special education services and inclusion classrooms.
There is no one-size-fits-all solution to educating students with disabilities. However, in
Massachusetts, students with disabilities placed in inclusion settings are five times more
likely to graduate in five years or less than peers of similar ability excluded from the
general education setting.149 Adequately placing students in the least restrictive
environment, most appropriate to serve their individual needs, is paramount to their
success. Schools and school districts across Massachusetts must deploy a wide variety
of strategies to mitigate the disparities found in special education services. Optimizing
learning spaces to meet the needs of all students equitably requires existing schools to
rethink and revise their current classroom compositions. In contrast, schools undergoing
new construction and/or renovations can integrate universal design (UD) and other
design principles to plan for a more inclusive environment from the start. Sufficiently
designing spaces to meet the programmatic needs of all students receiving special
education takes thoughtful consideration and intentional planning.
Methods and Best Practices
Table 31 summarizes methods and best practices for optimizing space to meet special
education needs equitably in schools. For each method/best practice, the table presents
the approximate capital and operating costs, implementation timeframe, and ease of
implementation. See Section VIII, Objective 3a for additional narrative descriptions of
each of the methods and best practices.

Barriers and Challenges
Optimizing space to meet special education needs more equitably is essential; however,
optimizing space alone will not fix the special education disparities in Massachusetts
schools. Proper identification of students and adequate staffing are also essential
elements in equitably meeting special education needs. This document addresses how
schools and school districts can optimize space while assuming appropriate
identification and staffing.
Not every school and school district are able to meet the individual needs of every
student. Out-of-district placements and Education Collaboratives can help ease the
challenges that come with serving students with the greatest educational needs. School
districts in urban and suburban areas have a greater concentration of resources,
allowing them to place most students in an appropriate setting within a reasonable
distance from their home. Rural districts are more likely to face challenges placing
students in the proper settings because resources are more dispersed than in urban
and suburban areas. For this reason and many others highlighted earlier in the report,
rural districts face more challenges when trying to meet the needs of every student.
Transportation can be an issue for students in urban and rural areas. Though students
with transportation listed on their Individualized Education Plan (IEP) are entitled to
transportation to out-of-district placements, this transportation can be unreliable.
Students without transportation on their IEP and placed out of district will face even
greater challenges since transportation falls on the parents. Parents that work long
hours, have other children, lack transportation, or in many other circumstances may
struggle or be unable to transport their child to a school out of their district, further
89
IV. Goal 3: Achieve Equitable Outcomes for All Students

Methods, Best Practices, and Standards for Achieving Green and Healthy Schools in the Commonwealth
of Massachusetts
exacerbating inequities. Teachers, parents, and everyone on a student’s IEP team
should consider potential transportation barriers before placing a student.
Objective 3b. Prioritize Universal Accessibility
Background
Massachusetts is home to some of the oldest schools in the country, with many school
buildings more than 70 years old.154 Historically, schools were not designed to
guarantee access for disabled students and were not welcoming to students of all
genders or races. Black and Latino students are more likely to attend older, out-of-date
schools. Schools are mandated to protect students from discrimination based on
disability, gender identity, sexual orientation, and race by state and federal laws and
regulations.155,156 To accomplish this, school facilities need to adopt more inclusive and
accessible policies. Disabilities are only disabling if they limit people from achieving
what they want and need to do. Increasing the accessibility of school facilities and
learning environments creates more opportunities for students to thrive in their school
communities.
Methods and Best Practices
Table 32 summarizes methods and best practices for universal accessibility in schools.
For each method/best practice, the table presents the approximate capital and
operating costs, implementation timeframe, and ease of implementation. See Section
VIII, Objective 3b for additional narrative descriptions of each of the methods and best
practices.

Barriers and Challenges
Schools and school districts must constantly decide how to best utilize limited funds and
resources. This often means that funding is directed to the most pressing needs that
impact the most students. For older buildings, this means that structural and safety fixes
take priority. Prioritizing universal accessibility is important and, in some cases, required
by law; however, deciding which aspects of improving accessibility to address first can
be difficult. Each school faces different challenges and serves students with a wide
range of needs. In many cases, schools and school districts will have to use discretion
when deciding which elements of accessibility to prioritize.
91
IV. Goal 3: Achieve Equitable Outcomes for All Students

Methods, Best Practices, and Standards for Achieving Green and Healthy Schools in the Commonwealth
of Massachusetts
Another challenge in prioritizing universal accessibility is the impact of segregation and
the inequitable distribution of resources throughout schools in the Commonwealth.
White, affluent communities have more resources, receive more funding, and often
contain more updated, accessible schools.154 This results in inequalities that must be
addressed beyond the three categories of methods and best practices outlined in Table
32. School districts that serve low-income, Black and Latino, and rural students face
greater challenges.23,148 Systemic changes to funding and school placement must be a
part of the conversation around prioritizing universal accessibility.
Existing schools may face challenges when providing gender-neutral bathrooms to
students. If the nurse’s office or a staff bathroom is the best option for a student, the
student may have to spend more time out of class to access the bathroom. This can
also result in students feeling “othered” or isolated, especially if they are facing the issue
alone. Schools should enable students to access gender-neutral bathrooms with ease
to minimize time out of class and create an inclusive environment. This will be less of a
barrier for new schools and schools undergoing renovations, as they will typically have
greater flexibility to determine the placement of gender-neutral bathrooms.
Objective 3c. Use Available Data to Identify and Equitably Prioritize
Schools of Greatest Need and Advocate for Additional Funding
Priorities
Many of the best practices outlined in this report require little or no funding; therefore,
school districts can readily adopt many of these strategies across all schools in their
respective district. There are also many best practices that can be very costly to
implement; for these best practices, school districts will need to determine which
school(s) in their respective district have the greatest need. There is no “one-size-fits-
all” approach for a school district to identify those schools having the greatest need and
to develop a corresponding prioritized plan for project funding and implementation
across its portfolio of schools. As noted in prior sections, the many school districts within
the Commonwealth of Massachusetts vary across many characteristics, including
geographic location, facility portfolio (number, size, and type of buildings), student
enrollment, racial and demographic composition of the student body, student
performance, annual capital and operating budgets, and amount of annual state aid
received. A small rural school district with one elementary school will likely take a very
different approach to selecting and prioritizing projects as compared to a large urban
school district with dozens of elementary, middle, and high schools in its portfolio.
The objective of this section is to call attention to a collection of readily available data
sources that school districts can consider when thinking about how to identify the
schools having the greatest needs. School districts can then prioritize projects in an
equitable manner to advocate for and work towards green and healthy schools across
their district. Districts can also use this data to demonstrate need and potential health
co-benefits as part of grant applications.
This section presents data sets across the following two categories:
92
IV. Goal 3: Achieve Equitable Outcomes for All Students

Methods, Best Practices, and Standards for Achieving Green and Healthy Schools in the Commonwealth
of Massachusetts
• Tier 1 represents the primary data that school districts should evaluate to identify
schools of greatest need.
• Tier 2 represents additional data for school districts that have additional
time/resources available
and are interested in
examining data at a
deeper level.
Within each Tier 1/Tier 2
category, this section presents
data sets pertaining to the
following four categories:
• Physical infrastructure
• Environmental health
• Learning environment and
outcomes
• Additional demographics
Tier 1 Data Sets
Physical Infrastructure
Perhaps the most obvious factor to consider when identifying schools having the
greatest need is the existing condition of a school’s physical infrastructure. School
districts should consider evaluating the following three data sources from the MSBA to
evaluate the physical infrastructure of the schools in their portfolio:
• MSBA School Survey Report
• MSBA School-Level Summary Reports
• MSBA District-Level Summary Reports
MSBA School Survey Report
As noted in the Introduction, the MSBA has thus far performed School Surveys in 2005,
2010, and 2016, and expects to complete its next survey and publish the accompanying
report by the end of 2025. The information outlined in this section is based on the
MSBA’s most recently completed and published 2016 School Survey Report (see the
“School Summaries” section on page 44). Table 33 outlines notable details and
recommendations for school districts to evaluate the schools in their district having the

Environmental Health
Beyond consideration of the physical infrastructure of each district’s portfolio of school
buildings, DPH suggests that school districts also evaluate publicly available
environmental health and disease data for communities where their students live. This
will help districts identify schools that may experience disproportionally high rates of
childhood lead poisoning and/or pediatric asthma. Both of these health outcomes are
directly linked to future school performance, increased learning disabilities, and,
consequently, an increased burden on schools. School districts should consider
evaluating the following two sources from DPH to evaluate relevant environmental
health indicators that will help increase awareness of and identify schools having the
greatest needs:
• DPH Annual Childhood Lead Poisoning Surveillance Reports
• Massachusetts Environmental Public Health Tracking Tool
DPH Annual Childhood Lead Poisoning Surveillance Reports
DPH’s Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention Program publishes an Annual Childhood
Lead Poisoning Surveillance Report. In each of these reports, DPH identifies a list of
communities within the Commonwealth that DPH has determined to be at high risk of
having childhood lead poisoning based on the following factors:
• Rates of newly poisoned children
• Age of housing
• Income levels
• At least 15 cases of lead poisoning in the previous five years
Figure 11 presents the list of 16 communities that DPH identified in 2023 as having a
high risk of childhood lead poisoning. In addition, for rural communities that may not
meet the 15-case threshold but may exhibit high prevalence of childhood lead exposure,
the report provides special analyses and mapping to identify areas of high risk. In
particular, many rural areas in the central and western parts of the state have a higher
prevalence of elevated blood lead levels compared to the state overall and children in
rural level 2 communities are twice as likely to have elevated blood lead levels. While
the Annual Childhood Lead Poisoning Surveillance Report does not provide a school
district the means to differentiate levels of risk between specific schools within its
district, the annual list of high-risk communities contributes to general awareness of the
prevalence of this health indicator within a community.

Massachusetts Environmental Public Health Tracking Tool
DPH maintains the Massachusetts Environmental Public Health Tracking Tool (EPHT),
which includes a wealth of environmental and health data for communities across the
Commonwealth. The EPHT enables users to query comprehensive health data sets and
produce custom map overlays with vulnerability criteria to identify areas where public
health mitigation actions should be implemented. DPH encourages school districts to
evaluate the following two particular areas within the tool, each of which is covered in
more detail in this section:
• Prevalence of pediatric asthma
• Community profiles
Prevalence of Pediatric Asthma
Since 2003, DPH has tracked the occurrence of pediatric asthma using health record
data reported by school nurses from all public and private K-8 schools. Within the
EPHT’s Health Module, school districts can explore pediatric asthma maps and data
tables from the 2009–2010 school year to the present. Table 36 outlines notable details
supporting the evaluation of the EPHT’s pediatric asthma prevalence data to assist
school districts in identifying schools of greatest need.

Community Profiles
Within the Planning and Tools Module of the EPHT, school districts can view
Community Profiles, which present a comprehensive synopsis of community-specific
health, demographic, and environmental data, including how each pertains to climate
change, all in a single, easy-to-use report. Figure 17 illustrates a screenshot of a
sample Community Profile in the EPHT. The Community Profiles in the EPHT do not
provide a school district the means to differentiate health indicators between specific
schools within its district; however, the Community Profiles in the EPHT further
contribute to general awareness of environmental health indicators within a community.

Learning Environment and Outcomes
In addition to considering the physical infrastructure of each district’s portfolio of school
buildings and environmental health data from DPH, school districts should also evaluate
109
IV. Goal 3: Achieve Equitable Outcomes for All Students

Methods, Best Practices, and Standards for Achieving Green and Healthy Schools in the Commonwealth

data from DESE’s School and District Profiles, which provide insights into individual
school learning environments and outcomes. This will help districts identify schools
having greater percentages of non-white students, who have been historically
marginalized; schools that have greater percentages of students with disabilities, high
needs, low-income backgrounds, and for whom English is not their first language; and
schools that have lower graduation rates relative to other schools. School districts
should consider evaluating the following three reports in DESE’s School and District
Profiles to evaluate relevant learning environment and outcome indicators that will help
increase awareness of and identify schools having the greatest needs:
• Enrollment by Race/Gender
• Selected Populations
• Graduation Rate
Enrollment by Race/Gender Report

Additional Demographic Data
DPH’s geographic information system-based Massachusetts Health Data Tool
supplements the school-specific learning environment data in DESE’s School and
District Profiles. The Tool provides school districts a means of visually evaluating
additional community-specific demographic data and overlaying the locations of
individual schools. These additional demographic data will help school districts better
understand the broader community context influencing student health and education
outcomes and further prioritize schools having the greatest needs.
The Massachusetts Health Data Tool is a suite of reporting and mapping platforms
designed to help visitors find community- and state-specific data quickly and easily.
With access to more than 100 indicators, the Community and State Reporting tools
provide access to up-to-date data on SDOH, as well as health behaviors, health
outcomes, and healthcare delivery.
When viewing data from the Massachusetts Health Data Tool, users may see
differences among population groups. The differences are especially noticeable
between white people and people of color. These differences exist because of structural
racism. These differences are not because of an individual’s choices, behaviors, or
identity. Systems of oppression, such as racism, cause harm to everyone. They also
influence the SDOH, which impact health outcomes (see Figure 21.)

Figure 21. Health Equity Framework
Source: Massachusetts Health Data Tool
If sharing these data, it is important to use racial equity context and framing. The DPH
Racial Equity Data Road Map is one resource that can help.
Additionally, the datasets from the Massachusetts Health Data Tool currently have
limited (or no) data broken down by sexual orientation, gender identity, and intersex
status. Many of the indicators in the State Health Assessment report data by gender;
however, the data made available reflects gender as the sex assigned by birth
(male/female). This binary framework of reporting does not capture the full spectrum of
gender identity. Gender is a multi-dimensional construct that includes identity and
expression. By maintaining binary language, data sources can be exclusionary and
render transgender and non-binary populations invisible. By gathering information
around gender identity, sex assigned at birth, and sexual orientation, DPH can provide
opportunities to monitor population health and the impact of policies and other macro-
level changes and interventions on population health and health inequities.
As described in the beginning of this report, DPH’s Strategic Plan to Advance Racial
Equity acknowledges that, to advance health equity, DPH must use an intersectional,
equity-centered lens to focus on addressing the persistent racial inequities impacting
the health access, treatment, outcomes, and overall well-being of people across the
Commonwealth, specifically those who identify as Black, Indigenous, Hispanic/Latino,
and/or Asian/Pacific Islander. The COVID-19 pandemic brought into painful, undeniable,
public view the clear, present, and ongoing health inequities perpetuated by systemic
racial inequities across public health infrastructure, health care delivery systems, and
SDOH in Massachusetts. Understanding the ways that systems of oppression create
and perpetuate structural inequities supports DPH in making systems-level changes to
114
IV. Goal 3: Achieve Equitable Outcomes for All Students

Methods, Best Practices, and Standards for Achieving Green and Healthy Schools in the Commonwealth
of Massachusetts
advance health equity. DPH seeks to understand the ways that the structures it designs,
operates, and builds perpetuate inequities. By embracing an understanding of the ways
that state and national public service systems have been built upon racialized policies,
practices, and institutions, DPH aims to lead health equity efforts across the agency, the
secretariat, and the Commonwealth using a structural analysis of how systemic racism
works. In leading racial-equity-centered change, DPH notes the imperative for a shared
approach to equity across all public agencies as racial inequities are also replicated in
educational systems, housing and built environments, carceral systems, economic
systems, climate response, and public workforce systems

V. Funding Strategies
Among other things, the Massachusetts Education Reform Act of 1993 increased the
Commonwealth’s role in funding public education.157 Most notably, it introduced the
concept of an annual “foundation budget” — a unique minimum budget for each school
district in the Commonwealth required to provide constitutionally adequate education.
Each school district’s foundation budget is calculated annually based on a collection of
factors, including enrollment size and demographic data.158 School districts fund their
annual foundation budgets using a combination of state education aid (commonly
referred to as “Chapter 70” aid) and local dollars.158 State funding for local aid and K-12
education represents the second largest category of investment in the Commonwealth’s
budget.159
School districts often plan, track, and account for annual budgets and expenditures
across two separate categories:
• Operating budgets/expenses include the expenses required for day-to-day
school operations, including salaries, utilities, administrative costs, and
maintenance expenses.
• Capital budgets/expenditures cover longer-term investments in the
infrastructure, facilities, and equipment for a district’s schools.
131
V. Funding Strategies

Both operating and capital funding are necessary to implement the collection of
strategies included in this report.
Schools often operate in funding constrained environments
Schools across the
and compete against other schools for grant funding and
Commonwealth have
other limited resources. Among other impacts, this limitation
an estimated capital
of financial resources can result in significant deferred
expenditure gap of
maintenance of school buildings. A 2021 report by the
$1.39 billion.
Office of the State Auditor noted that schools across the
Commonwealth have an estimated capital expenditure gap of $1.39 billion.160
Organizations often use lifecycle cost analyses to understand the relationship between
upfront capital costs and expected operational savings over the life of a project. While
many schools strive to implement lifecycle cost-effective projects to meet their fiduciary
duty, limited capital funding at the time of project implementation often results in
projects that do not realize the full benefit of ongoing operational savings.
This section provides an overview of the following categories of funding sources and
strategies that help Massachusetts school districts achieve green and healthy schools:
• Local contribution to municipality’s foundation budget
• Chapter 70 state aid
• Rural school aid

ocal Contribution to Municipality’s oundation Budget
As previously noted, each Massachusetts school district has its foundation budget
calculated annually. This annual foundation budget is then funded by a combination of
local contributions by the municipality and Chapter 70 aid from the Commonwealth.
Each community’s local contribution is unique and based on the community’s respective
property values and resident incomes.161 Annual local contributions are calculated using
a progressive formula whereby municipalities having greater fiscal resources contribute
a larger share of their foundation budgets, while municipalities having fewer fiscal
resources contribute a smaller share. The maximum local contribution is set at 82.5
percent of the foundation budget.
132
V. Funding Strategies

Chapter 70 State Aid
Chapter 70 state aid represents the quantity of annual funding that the Commonwealth
provides to each school district to make up the difference between each district’s annual
foundation budget and the local contribution provided from the community.
Rural School Aid
The state legislature has appropriated rural school aid since fiscal year 2020.162 DESE
determines funding to eligible school districts based on each district’s student density
and per capita income. School districts are permitted to use rural school aid for a variety
of purposes to support district operations, including increasing regional collaboration,
consolidation, and improving long-term operational efficiency and effectiveness.163

Grants
There are numerous state and federal competitive grant programs that can help
Massachusetts school districts across a range of initiatives, including new construction,
renovations and repairs, energy audits, building decarbonization planning, climate
hazard identification and resilience planning, and lead mitigation in drinking water.
Below are some high-level details for a sampling of current grant programs.
• The MSBA Core Program offers grant funding for new construction, additions,
and major renovation projects. Funding levels are based on a reimbursement
rate calculation that considers community income, property wealth, poverty,
along with project-specific incentive points. See the Introduction for additional
details about the MSBA grant award process and determination of funding levels.
• The MSBA Repair Program funds retrofits of building systems. Projects are
categorized as either major repairs, which cover a broad scope and follow a
similar process to the Core Program, or accelerated repairs, which cover
buildings in need of roof and/or window/door replacements, but that are

otherwise structurally sound. Boiler replacements were last included for invitation
in 2022. The MSBA is completing a study with a consultant in anticipation of
adding heat pump conversions to the Accelerated Repair Program beginning in
2025.
• The EEA Municipal Vulnerability Preparedness (MVP) Program provides grant
support to define climate-related hazards, identify existing and future
vulnerabilities, and develop and prioritize community-level actions to reduce risk
and build resilience.
• The DOER Green Communities Grant Program funds energy efficiency
measures, clean energy projects, and other decarbonization strategies in
qualifying communities.
• The MA Clean Energy Center’s (MassCEC’s) Green School Works provides
wraparound services including bridge loans, grant funding, and strategic
technical assistance to schools for decarbonization projects, make-ready
projects, portfolio decarbonization planning, and project planning.164 Preference
is given to schools serving low-income and environmental justice populations.
• The MassDEP School Water Improvement Grants (SWIG) Program provides
funding to schools for lead mitigation in drinking water by installing filtered water
bottle filling stations. SWIG builds on the Lead in School Drinking Water
assistance program that pays for schools to test their drinking water.165
• The Massachusetts Federals Funds & Infrastructure Office tracks federal
opportunities and supports successful applications for Massachusetts projects.
• DOE’s Renew America’s Schools Program is a highly competitive grant program
to promote clean energy improvements in schools. Districts can apply for funding
and technical assistance for strategic planning, energy audits, and project
implementation.
• EPA’s Clean School Bus Program provides grant funding to replace existing
school buses with zero emission and clean school buses
No-cost Technical Support
In addition to grant funding, there are also state programs that provide no-cost technical
support to school districts, including the following examples:
• DOER’s Green Communities Division awards Municipal Energy Technical
Assistance grants to school districts to support decarbonization and energy
resilience of public facilities. Projects can include feasibility studies, auditing, and
assistance with solar development.
• The MassDEP Water-Smart Program offers schools no-cost drinking water lead
sampling, post-sampling analysis, and development of outreach materials.
134
V. Funding Strategies

• MassSave Building Energy Assessments offers no-cost in-person or virtual
assessments for schools, where energy consultants will perform assessments
and provide a customized energy savings report.
Incentives/Rebates/Tax Credits
There are numerous incentives, rebates, and tax credits that are also available to
Massachusetts school districts that can greatly improve the cost-effectiveness of the
many of the best practices outlined in this report. Below is a brief summary of options in
this category of funding sources.
• MassSave offers a variety of incentives to schools, including decarbonization
roadmap services and project implementation for component retrofits up to new
construction and modernizations. Retrofit incentives include building insulation
and weatherization, abatement of hazardous materials (asbestos, vermiculite,
knob and tube wiring), HVAC, lighting and controls, building automation systems
(BAS), specialty equipment, water heating, and pipe insulation. New construction
and modernization incentives offer multiple pathways based on establishing
aggressive energy use intensity (EUI) targets.
• MassSave’s ConnectedSolutions Active Demand Reduction Initiative can further
improve project economics by allowing for compensation from demand response
activities. School districts can contact a curtailment service provider to determine
school- or district-level potential for reducing electricity demand at peak times.
This provides additional grid resilience benefits to the surrounding community.
• The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) Investment Tax Credit (ITC) provides taxable
entities non-competitive cash reimbursements with no funding limit. The IRA ITC
is established by law and extends through 2032-2035. The IRA added a direct
pay (also referred to as elective pay) option, which allows non-taxable entities
(e.g., school districts) to receive the ITC as cash payments. The ITC provides
school districts with the ability to plan over a long-time horizon to install eligible
clean energy technologies—often at lower costs than the conventional
alternative. Eligible technologies include ground-source heat pumps (GSHP),
wastewater energy recovery, solar, battery energy storage systems, ESBs, light
duty battery electric vehicles, and EVSE. MassCEC Green School Works bridge
loans can cover the initial project costs, or municipalities may be able to issue
Federal and State Aid Anticipation Notes.166 Below are some additional points
regarding the IRA ITC:
o ITC funds are intended to be stacked with other funding sources discussed in
this section; however, the use of tax-exempt bonds (e.g., general obligation
bonds) to finance an energy project reduces the ITC by 15 percent. Districts
can consider using cash on hand to finance discrete energy projects while
using tax-exempt bonds to finance the balance of the project.
o Taking advantage of the full value of the ITC requires upfront coordination
with a variety of project stakeholders, including general council, a municipal
tax advisor, capital construction project managers, contracts and
135
V. Funding Strategies

procurement, and an energy services company (ESCO), if applicable. The
project team should review and incorporate all applicable ITC requirements
into the project requirements, including domestic content, prevailing wage,
and apprenticeship requirements. While stakeholders may offer input or
support, the school district is the tax filing entity and has ultimate
responsibility to comply with ITC requirements.
Third-Party Financing
Energy management services (EMS), also referred to as energy savings performance
contracts (ESPC), allow for third-party investment by an energy services company
(ESCO) in school buildings with no upfront cost to the school district. The ESCO will
bring in energy professionals to conduct an investment-grade assessment of the facility
and propose cost-effective retrofit measures that meet the school district’s stated goals.
Once the retrofit measures are agreed upon, the ESCO will install and commission the
systems. The ESCO performs measurement and verification throughout the life of the
contract to ensure that the systems operate as intended and that utility savings are
maintained. The ESCO’s upfront investment is paid back over the life of the contract (up
to 20 years) through a portion of the savings that the school realizes on its utility bills,
making the project budget-neutral. Given that EMS are based on utility cost savings as
opposed to emission reductions, the initial statement of objectives should specify the
school district’s decarbonization goals, environmental health goals, and school program
needs.
EMS projects can include a variety of energy and water conservation measures and
often seek to bundle measures that have short and long paybacks to allow for a larger
overall investment. For example, light-emitting diode (LED) retrofits with quick payback
periods will help offset the costs of larger capital equipment, such as a new HVAC
system. Bundling multiple buildings in a single EMS contract can improve the overall
project economics and allow for deeper emission reductions. School districts can
identify candidate buildings for an EMS through the emissions reduction plan (ERP) and
facility condition assessment (FCA) processes (see Objective 1a. Decarbonize
Buildings for more details). Good candidates are often buildings that are in good
condition (e.g., envelope, finishes) with modern electrical, HVAC, and plumbing
distribution systems but with mechanical equipment that is nearing the end of useful life.
EMS contracts can also incorporate third-party O&M services for newly installed
systems, which can be helpful when existing staff and resources are at capacity or do
not have expertise on the new systems.
The Massachusetts DOER Green Communities Division provides information and
assistance to local jurisdictions on the use of EMS, including draft request for proposals
(RFPs) and request for quotes with language that includes guarantees of savings,
maximum cost, and energy generation (where applicable for onsite clean energy). The
MSBA has issued guidance to clarify that EMS costs are separate from any
reimbursable MSBA project costs. An EMS project will not result in the school being
eliminated from consideration for an MSBA grant award, and schools can still submit an
SOI for buildings undergoing an EMS for any projects that are not covered by the EMS.

Objective 1a. Decarbonize Buildings
Methods and Best Practices
There are a number of methods and best practices that have been implemented to
successfully decarbonize schools across Massachusetts. These are organized in the
following sections in order of implementation, starting with analysis and planning
activities and followed by implementation strategies, operational best practices, and
procurement strategies for decarbonized electricity.
Conduct Analysis and Planning
Analysis and planning provide the foundation for successfully decarbonizing schools by
gathering data to understand the current conditions, establishing goals, developing
interim milestones, and prioritizing strategies at both the school district portfolio level
and for individual schools. This is especially important given the variability in school
conditions and the high capital cost of many decarbonization strategies. Some
strategies can be completed via low-cost desktop analysis, while others require more
time-intensive on-site analysis. To conduct analysis and planning, schools should
compile and analyze facility energy data, perform facility condition assessments and
energy/emissions audits, and prepare and routinely update an Emissions Reduction
Plan.
(1) Compile and analyze facility energy data
The ability to quickly capture energy data and reliably generate actionable insights to
manage building energy use is key to building decarbonization. There are many
different types of systems and commercial off-the-shelf software options that vary in
utility and value based on the size and complexity of a school district’s portfolio. The
U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) broadly refers to this suite of technologies as energy
management information systems (EMIS).167
Utility bill management systems are some of the most common types of EMIS and allow
users to view, validate, and track various metrics related to energy consumption and
corresponding utility payments. Increasingly, municipal and state energy disclosure
ordinances require building owners to compile, document, and report energy data
annually. Among other end goals, the resulting comprehensive data set allows an
organization to compare or “benchmark” the energy performance of its buildings to other
buildings of similar type (see text box below for more details about statewide building
energy disclosure requirements in Massachusetts).
139
VI. Additional Details Related to Goal 1: Achieve Green Schools

Statewide Building Energy Disclosure Requirements
Chapter 179 of the Acts of 2022 requires the annual reporting of energy use data for
all buildings in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts larger than 20,000 square feet.
Electric, natural gas, and steam utility providers are required to report this information
to DOER; individual building owners must report annual usage data for all delivered
fuels (e.g., fuel oil, propane). DOER is developing draft regulations and intends to
finalize them in preparation for the first disclosure period in 2025. Similar ordinances
have already been implemented by some municipalities, including Boston and
Cambridge.
Source: DOER168
Benchmarking is commonly done via free, government-provided platforms such as
EPA’s ENERGY STAR Portfolio Manager (ESPM). In Massachusetts, Green
Communities share data with DOER via the MassEnergyInsight Platform (MEI). Many of
these systems enable automatic data transfers to allow seamless and efficient reporting
by an energy manager, sustainability manager, utility billing specialist, or other school
district staff charged with tracking and analyzing building energy use and cost data.
In addition to meeting benchmarking requirements, ESPM and MEI offer other powerful
tools, including:
• ENERGY STAR Score for K–12 Schools provides a 1 to 100 score that
accounts for and normalizes numerous factors such as weather, number of
building staff, standard operating hours, the presence of cooking facilities, school
type, and the percent of floor area that is heated and cooled. A higher score
indicates better energy performance.169
• MEI Buildings to Target Report allows users to compare energy use intensity
(EUI), total energy consumption, cost, and total emissions by fuel type for all of
their schools (see Figure 28).

VI. Additional Details Related to Goal 1: Achieve Green Schools

Additional EMIS functionality can include interval metering, weather data, BAS, and
other connected devices. Some more advanced functions are discussed in greater
detail in the O&M section below (methods and best practices 10–12).
The availability of building energy use and other data in an EMIS can greatly benefit
project implementation (methods and best practices 4–9) by allowing A/E firms to use
real-world operational data (e.g., utility billing, equipment run time/load, occupancy,
equipment submetering) to inform project concepts and designs.
(2) Perform facility condition assessments (FCAs) and energy/emissions audits
FCAs are commonly used across industries and building types to better understand the
attributes and condition of an organization’s assets for planning and budgeting for O&M
and capital expenditures. The MSBA shall conduct a periodic needs survey of schools
across the Commonwealth and may ascertain the capital construction, reconstruction,
maintenance, and other capital needs. The MSBA School Survey can be generally
understood as an FCA with the supplemental inclusion of school-specific programs,
security, and information technology infrastructure data.
ASTM International (formerly known as American Society for Testing and Materials)
Standard E2018-15 provides a Standard Guide for Property Condition Assessments:
Baseline Property Condition Assessment Process for commercial real estate, which
includes schools. Organizations often expand the scope of FCAs beyond base building
systems to include additional audits and assessments. This approach takes advantage
of having an assessment professional onsite. Examples of additional assessments
include energy audits, building floor plan mapping, analytical measurements (e.g.,
indoor air quality, blower door testing, functional testing), environmental compliance
audits, and health and safety audits. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration
and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) Standard 211 establishes the scope of a
level two energy audit.
To maximize the benefit of FCAs and facility energy audits, schools and school districts
should engage staff to understand their objectives and goals for using the outputs from
these activities. Boston Public Schools publishes an FCA Dashboard to transparently
display data resulting from completed FCAs, which will inform decision making for
repairs, replacements, and renovations. DOER’s MEI Blueprint module offers FCA
database functionality in a tool that many Massachusetts communities already use
regularly.
School district staff may already perform informal auditing as part of their daily duties.
Anecdotal information that district staff members routinely observe and document can
help identify buildings to prioritize for a more focused audit. Common examples of
anecdotal information that staff might notice include:

corrected.
• Abnormal window air conditioning unit operations. Window air conditioning
units that operate loudly and/or during the heating season are likely an indication
of performance degradation and/or inefficient simultaneous heating and cooling
loads that can be corrected.
(3) Prepare and routinely update an emissions reduction plan (ERP)
An ERP helps organizations establish an actionable and phased roadmap to identify,
prioritize, plan, and implement emissions reduction measures (ERMs)—discrete or
bundled projects resulting in GHG emissions reductions.170 School districts,
municipalities, and other regional entities can make use of the ERP framework to:

Figure 29 offers an example of categorizing an organization’s buildings by HVAC
system type and GHG intensity (a means of normalizing GHG emissions on a per-
square-foot basis). In viewing this example, a school district may decide to prioritize
a single high-impact project to retrofit a district system or establish a program to
address the distributed emissions via less disruptive retrofits to individual packaged
units.

3. Complete audits (method and best practice 2, Figure 29) and select ERMs. Schools
can combine multiple ERMs into a more comprehensive project to more
aggressively reduce GHG emissions. Numerous examples of ERMs are provided in
the following sections.

and phased across the organization’s portfolio. Scenarios illustrate the potential
emissions reductions relative to the targets that an organization has established.
5. Summarize the results of the above four steps, outline an implementation plan, and
identify possible funding sources in a comprehensive ERP document. As resources
permit, school districts should update ERPs periodically to reflect implementation
progress, changes to the building portfolio, and external trends (e.g., new legislative
and/or regulatory requirements that might influence the scope and/or prioritization of
ERMs).
143
VI. Additional Details Related to Goal 1: Achieve Green Schools

Implement Strategies to Achieve Energy Efficiency and Building Decarbonization
Once districts complete the initial analysis and planning, they can turn towards
implementation using the strategies covered in this section. While new construction and
major modernization projects have demonstrated a clear path to deliver NZE schools,
many district buildings that exist today will still be in operation in 2050.171 As a general
best practice for all project types, districts should consider projects that optimize energy
efficiency first and then seek to electrify the remaining building loads. As with any
program, the results of implemented projects should be tied back to ongoing planning
efforts and inform future projects. For example, energy efficiency projects may include
make-ready infrastructure or design drawings for future electrification projects to show a
clear path forward for building decarbonization.
(4) Implement NZE new construction and major modernizations
The process of building a new school or modernizing an existing one is a major
undertaking for a community that often spans multiple years. The MSBA provides
modules that outline the process for districts seeking grant funding and the collaborative
process following an invitation to the MSBA’s capital pipeline. The Northeast Energy
Efficiency Partnership (NEEP) Zero Energy Schools Toolkit outlines a general process
for building a new school or modernizing an existing one:172
1. Pre-Design: Establish educational specifications and conduct community
engagement.
2. Design: Select an architect, complete the schematic design, and select a general
contractor to lead construction.
3. Construction: Complete site work, building construction, and landscaping.
4. Occupancy: Conduct occupant engagement and training before the school’s
opening and on an ongoing basis.
The comprehensive nature of new construction and modernizations allows districts to
establish decarbonization goals at the pre-design project phase. Most commonly, these
goals are communicated to project teams by establishing site EUI (energy consumption
measured at the meter) and source EUI (includes the fuel required to generate and
deliver the energy) targets. The targets in
Table 44 are included as a 2019 reference based on MA’s location in climate zone
5A.173 It is important to understand the current market landscape as targets are being
set, given that efficiencies improve over time. These EUI targets are more aggressive
than others defined for K–12 schools in Massachusetts.174 Other new construction and
modernization goals should consider the environmental health, sustainability, and equity
programs discussed in more detail in other sections.
144
VI. Additional Details Related to Goal 1: Achieve Green Schools

Table 44. EUI Targets for Massachusetts Schools
Site EUI173 Source EUI
Primary Secondary Primary Secondary
School School School School
19.2 19.1 57.1 56.9
For new construction and modernization projects, a DOE study found that net zero
schools have comparable capital costs to traditional school projects, and there is no
correlation between project capital costs and EUI. Instead, a fixed budget and target
EUI were found to be key determinants for a successful, cost-effective project by
providing firm boundaries that allow project teams to find creative solutions.43
While both new construction and modernization projects decrease operational
emissions, they differ in their relative embodied carbon intensities, which impacts a
building’s overall carbon footprint. In this context, embodied carbon refers to the
emissions generated during the resource extraction, manufacturing, transportation,
replacement, and disposal of building materials. Construction projects result in a
significant generation of emissions from embodied carbon, separate from the
operational emissions that result from using a school over the building’s useful life.
Reducing a project’s embodied carbon results in immediate climate mitigation benefits
in the present. Modernization projects generally have lower embodied carbon intensities
because they reuse structural components that include the majority of the high carbon
intensity materials, like concrete and steel. Modernization projects also retain school
resources in the existing community and require less land disturbance. The MSBA
incentivizes building reuse with up to five

(5) Implement deep energy retrofits
145
VI. Additional Details Related to Goal 1: Achieve Green Schools

Deep energy retrofits achieve 40 percent or greater reductions in an existing building’s
site EUI through a comprehensive design process that considers improvements to all
building systems.
Deep energy retrofits can be achieved as part of a larger modernization project that also
includes updates to finishes, school programming, site work, and other non-energy
areas. Later sections address individual building systems and retrofit strategies in more
detail.
In addition to optimizing a building’s energy efficiency, deep energy retrofits also help
enable the electrification of building heating systems. A critical step to efficient
electrification is understanding a building’s heating requirements and identifying
opportunities to reduce heating loads to more effectively maintain occupant comfort
while right-sizing new, all-electric equipment. For example, designing a system based
on the total capacity of all existing fan coil units (FCUs) in a building may result in a
heating system size that is challenging to electrify cost-effectively. By looking at trend
data for the actual heating load of all FCUs over a range of conditions, designers may
find that all but the FCUs serving the coldest zones operate at 35 percent capacity.
Thus, the central system capacity can be reduced while still providing supplemental
heat to the coldest zones when needed.
Critically, gaining a better understanding of and reducing heating loads can lower supply
hot water temperatures and expand the options of available, efficient, all-electric
systems.175
(6) Improve building envelopes
The building envelope refers to the windows, walls, and roofs that provide a barrier
between indoor and outdoor spaces and accounts for approximately 30 percent of the
primary energy consumed in typical commercial buildings.176 Improving the building
envelope can reduce the building’s overall heating and cooling loads, reducing the
necessary size and cost of the HVAC system. For example, a Virginia elementary
school invested an additional $200,000 in the school’s envelope, resulting in savings of
about $500,000 in HVAC first costs.43 Building envelopes serve the following purposes:
• Maintain thermal comfort by reducing radiant heat and drafts. In the case of a
power outage, a well-designed envelope can help a building maintain indoor
temperatures over a more extended period; this is referred to as “passive
survivability.” With lower heating and cooling loads, it is increasingly important to
confirm that sufficient ventilation is provided to all spaces. See Goal 2: Achieve
Healthy Schools, Objective 2c. Maintain Thermal Comfort for additional details.
• Air and vapor barriers maintain indoor air quality (IAQ) and appropriate
humidity levels and prevent moisture damage to building materials. Tighter
envelopes allow the HVAC system to supply only filtered and conditioned outdoor
air, addressing the concern of outdoor air pollutants resulting in degraded IAQ
(see the Reduced Exposure to Outdoor Air Pollutants section for more details),

(7) Optimize and electrify component retrofits
Component retrofits refer to the replacement of individual pieces of equipment, some of
which may be part of a larger system, or equipment that operates independently of a
central plant. In all retrofits, schools should strive to improve upon energy efficiency and
electrify any existing components that currently combust fossil fuel. DOE’s
Decarbonizing HVAC and Water Heating in Commercial Buildings provides building
owners and facilities engineers with a valuable resource when conducting the technical,
economic, and feasibility assessment for converting to all-electric solutions.175 The DOE
report demonstrates how building owners can retrofit a variety of existing system types
to alternative systems that rely on electric heat pump (HP) technology. These systems
are often classified by their heat source (e.g., air-, water-, and ground-source) and
thermal distribution method in the building (e.g., air for packaged rooftop units, water for
hydronic heat pumps, and refrigerant for variable refrigerant flow solutions). Examples
of component retrofits are outlined below.
• Rooftop units (RTUs) are individual pieces of equipment that are often used to
provide heating and cooling to large open spaces, including a school’s
gymnasium, cafeteria, auditorium, and library. Conventional RTUs that combust
fossil fuel (typically natural gas) to provide space heating can often be replaced
in-kind by a HP RTU that uses the existing electrical service to provide both
heating and cooling. Furthermore, if there is an existing supply line for natural
gas, a school can use this natural gas service to provide second-stage heating to
supplement heating from the HP RTU on the coldest days. This can result in
147
VI. Additional Details Related to Goal 1: Achieve Green Schools

greater than 80 percent electrification of heating for the given zone. The retrofit
project requires a crane to move equipment to and from the roof and can be
completed during school breaks.
• Water heaters provide domestic hot water for small applications such as
bathrooms and locker rooms. Heat pump water heaters (HPWHs) are available in
sizes ranging from 40 to 120 gallons and some available models can operate
using a standard 110V wall outlet, reducing the need for electrical work ahead of
the installation. HPWHs extract heat from the air in the room in which they are
located, which has the added benefit of dehumidifying the room.
• Lighting retrofits frequently install LED fixtures in existing fluorescent lighting
troffers and in space types where the existing lighting fixture may need to be
replaced (gymnasiums, outdoor site lighting). Schools should consider keeping
lighting controls simple so that untrained users can quickly and easily use
them.177 Lighting retrofits often provide quick financial paybacks, making them a
good candidate to bundle with other ERMs to improve overall project economics.
Existing FLBs that contain PCBs should be properly handled and disposed of as
part of a retrofit. See Goal 2: Achieve Healthy Schools, Objective 2a. Improve
Indoor Air Quality for additional details about reducing exposure to PCBs.
Realizing Indoor Air Quality Co-benefits
Updated HVAC equipment (e.g., RTUs) can provide numerous IAQ co-benefits,
including:
• The installation of air filters that have a minimum efficiency reporting value
(MERV) of 13 or higher.
• The use of demand control ventilation increases ventilation rates when a
setpoint (e.g., 800 parts per million [ppm] carbon dioxide) is reached. This
ensures that both a crowded gymnasium with high school physical education
classes and an elementary school library are appropriately ventilated based
on occupancy levels and activity types.
• The installation and use of carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, and PM
sensors that can help building engineers monitor and quickly resolve any
identified air quality issues. See the Reduce Exposure to Mold and Moisture
section for additional details about the use of sensor technology to monitor
IAQ parameters.
(8) Electrify whole system retrofits
Whole system retrofits most often refer to HVAC retrofits that include the central plant
equipment, the terminal equipment serving individual classrooms and zones, and in
some cases, the distribution system connecting the two. A key use case in
Massachusetts, as climate change is expected to increase the number of high-heat
days, is to add air conditioning to buildings that currently only provide heating or use
148
VI. Additional Details Related to Goal 1: Achieve Green Schools

window air conditioning units. The more comprehensive nature of these projects allows
engineers to consider a wider range of available technologies, including:
• Variable refrigerant flow (VRF) systems use heat pumps in each zone to
provide heating and cooling by modulating the amount of refrigerant sent to each
unit and moving heat between rooms. VRF systems are a common retrofit option
in buildings that use window air conditioning units or provide only heat. These
projects require significant redesign since the refrigerant-distribution system is
fundamentally different compared to an
existing hydronic or steam boiler.175 Networked Geothermal in

of the stable year-round ground temperature to provide heating and cooling at 3
to 6 times the efficiencies of legacy fossil fuel systems, even in cold climates.178
GSHP systems require an appropriately sized wellfield that houses the vertical
bores, which circulate a fluid before returning to the building. Wellfields can be
installed under parking lots, athletic fields, or other adjoining open spaces.
GSHPs are a well-established technology that have compelling lifecycle costs. A
study conducted by the Town of Arlington, MA, across six schools found that
GSHP systems have lower first cost and lifecycle costs when accounting for
federal and state incentives.179
• Wastewater energy recovery, another established technology, uses sanitary
sewer infrastructure as a heat source/sink. Wastewater is diverted to a heat
exchanger, which transfers energy to a heat pump system that serves the
building. This technology can support electrification in space-constrained urban
environments that may not be able to support a GSHP wellfield.
The co-benefits described in the component retrofit section also apply to the above
technologies but across a larger portion of the school.
(9) Electrify cafeteria kitchens
After space and water heating, cafeteria kitchens are often the next largest consumer of
fossil fuels in schools. In addition to the kitchen equipment that combusts fossil fuels
(e.g., ovens, cooktops, fryers), the combustion activity releases toxic chemicals into the
air and requires significant ventilation, which contributes to electricity consumption
149
VI. Additional Details Related to Goal 1: Achieve Green Schools

through exhaust fan power and conditioning the outdoor makeup air. Traditional
kitchens are loud (ventilation) and hot (open combustion inefficiently transferring heat)
environments that can provide significant workplace improvements by electrifying
equipment. Another co-benefit of all-electric kitchens is the reduction of asthma triggers.
Like space heating systems, a variety of options are available to efficiently electrify
kitchen operations. The type of kitchen operations occurring at a given school (full-
service kitchen, commissary serving multiple schools, reheat kitchen) and the food
program (food served, single use vs. reusable service ware, lunch seatings and
throughput) will determine the requirements for an all-electric alternative design. It is
important to engage with the district’s food and nutrition group to understand and
document kitchen requirements.
All-electric kitchens have been demonstrated to meet or exceed the throughput of
traditional kitchen lines and can often do so using a smaller footprint. Where there are
concerns about equipment performance or power availability, installing an induction
cooktop is a good entry point to demonstrate proof of concept. Schools can install
additional electric kitchen equipment as they replace existing fossil fuel-fired
equipment.180
Operate and Maintain Schools
O&M refers to all the daily and ongoing tasks performed by school staff and contractors
to prioritize that schools continue to operate as they are intended to. Staff members
with a deep understanding of the school facility are critical to schools achieving the
goals of any of the implementation methods and best practices described above, from
project inception through the end of life of the school. When conducting O&M, schools

VI. Additional Details Related to Goal 1: Achieve Green Schools

• Preventive maintenance, which helps support reliable operation of equipment.
A preventive maintenance plan outlines the frequency of maintenance tasks for
all pieces of equipment. A lack of preventive maintenance can lead to an
increase in emergency replacements, which often necessitate in-kind
replacements with equipment available from existing inventory. This often results
in a project missing a critical opportunity to thoughtfully electrify systems.
Re-commissioning/retro-commissioning (RCx), which involves a process of
examining and recalibrating an existing building’s equipment and systems to better
meet the building’s operational needs. The term “re-commission” is used for
buildings that were properly commissioned following original construction; the term
“retro-commission” is used for existing buildings that were never properly
commissioned following original construction. Schools should conduct RCx every
five years or when there are significant changes in operations (e.g., a change of
occupancy greater than 20 percent). This practice confirms that equipment is
performing according to the original design intent and can include the recalibration or
replacement of sensors and other minor repairs to control systems.
Computerized maintenance management systems, which help manage all
maintenance activities across a portfolio of buildings. Larger school districts
responsible for maintaining a greater number of buildings should consider using
these systems to more efficiently manage and coordinate maintenance activities
across facilities staff and contractors.
Engaging O&M staff in capital projects, which prioritizes their expertise in
operating building systems and addressing existing pain points so they are
appropriately accounted for in the design phase. O&M staff often provide a unique
perspective regarding the feasibility of proposed design options, including an
awareness of zones that have trouble maintaining setpoints and knowledge of
system access points that enable preventative maintenance without disrupting
classrooms.
(11) Utilize BAS to optimize building performance and energy efficiency
A BAS provides automatic controls, visualizations, and trend data for the operation of
various building systems. BAS support reliable building operations while also reducing
energy and water consumption. ASHRAE Guideline 36-2021 outlines best-in-class
HVAC control sequences and should be used to establish requirements for new BAS or
to conduct RCx for existing systems. Examples of BAS best practices follow.
• Setpoints and schedules helps to balances the thermal comfort of building
occupants (see Goal 2: Achieve Healthy Schools, Objective 2c. Maintain
Thermal Comfort for additional details) and energy-efficient operations by
reducing system runtime during unoccupied periods. Both should be established
by district policy and allow for room-level adjustments by occupants (rooms with
southern exposure may feel warmer) and special events (after-school uses of
specific spaces).
151
VI. Additional Details Related to Goal 1: Achieve Green Schools

• Demand Controlled ventilation is a best practice for ensuring sufficient
ventilation is provided in an energy-efficient manner.
• Optimal start and stop refers to the use of trend data to understand how long
the building takes to warm up or cool down based on weather conditions and
schedules the HVAC system to turn on at a specific time based on current
conditions. The alternative is using a static startup time that is often overly
conservative (resulting in excessive equipment run time and energy waste) and
may not be updated to account for sporadic, extreme conditions.
• Central monitoring and control of BAS can be a beneficial strategy for larger
districts. Trained operators can remotely monitor building conditions across
multiple schools, perform fault detection and diagnostics, and find energy
savings (e.g., utility load curtailment or demand response programs).181
• Preventive maintenance such as front-end software updates (what the user
interacts with), controller firmware updates, and sensor calibration all help
support the proper operation of and interpretation of the data from the BAS.
Co-benefits of improved building performance via BAS optimizations include controlling
humidity and excess moisture in schools, which in turn can decrease mold growth,
reducing allergens and asthma triggers. See the Reduce Exposure to Mold and
Moisture section for additional information.
(12) Establish and train an NZE workforce
Massachusetts has identified expanding the clean energy sector workforce as a key
strategy to achieving the Commonwealth’s climate goals. This includes trades relevant
to school O&M staff, including HVAC and smart building technicians, as well as other
trade partners with whom schools are likely to contract.182 While Massachusetts
continues to build out equitable pathways to bring more people into the clean energy
trades, districts can consider the following for existing staff and new hires:
• The existing workforce benefits from continued investment in job training such
as those offered by MassCEC through the Clean Energy Careers Training and
Education Directory, Massachusetts’ 15 community colleges, and Building
Operator Certification (discounted rates available to registrants served by
Eversource Massachusetts or National Grid).182
• Evaluate the job descriptions and required licensing/certifications of new
hires. For example, as districts electrify schools, roles that traditionally required
boiler plant operator licenses will require an HVAC technician skillset to
understand the vapor compression refrigerant cycle used by heat pumps. There
is also an increasing need for computer skills so that BAS-connected systems
run automatically based on the original design intent and are only overridden for
manual operation briefly and when necessary.
152
VI. Additional Details Related to Goal 1: Achieve Green Schools

Procure Decarbonized Electricity
The procurement and use of decarbonized electricity is the final pillar of decarbonization
following efficiency improvements and electrification projects. Using decarbonized
electricity is a key step to decarbonization, especially as more building systems are
electrified and building electricity consumption increases. By nature, decarbonized
electricity also keeps district money in the regional community as a school’s utility
budget transitions from being spent on fuels that are most often brought in from outside
of the community to electricity that is generated within the region. To pursue
decarbonized electricity, schools should consider both the installation and use of onsite
renewable energy systems and the procurement of bundled renewable electricity from
the grid.
(13) Install and use onsite renewable energy systems
Onsite renewable energy systems allow schools to generate and consume their own
electricity, while still being connected to the broader electrical grid to support reliable
operations and to export power when it is not needed. Solar photovoltaic (PV) arrays
are the most common onsite renewable energy systems and can take advantage of the
large flat roofs installed on many schools. Districts can use DOER’s Technical Solar
Potential Map to help prioritize schools with the greatest solar potential. To the
maximum extent possible, schools should coordinate the installation of onsite solar PV
arrays to coincide with roof replacements to help make certain 20 to 25 years of
uninterrupted generation from the array. Other project types (such as roof
replacements) can include PV make-ready infrastructure (home run conduit from the
roof to the electrical room) to lower the cost of future installation. Systems that require
dedicated structures (carports) are more costly to install but can offer additional benefits
such as shading and supporting electric vehicle charging. See Objective 1e. Provide
Electric Vehicle Charging Stations for School Staff and Public Use for additional
information about electric vehicle charging infrastructure and Objective 1f. Enhance
Climate Resilience for additional information for how solar PV arrays can incorporate
battery energy storage systems (BESS) to optimize a school’s resilience to climate
change.
NE-CHPS defines zero energy capable design as having PV generation equal to or
greater than 100 percent of annual electricity consumption, covering a minimum of 65
percent of the roof area. This highlights the benefit of project designs that minimize
rooftop equipment to maximize PV capacity.183
(14) Procure bundled renewable electricity from the grid
Massachusetts is a retail choice electricity market served by ISO New England—the
independent regional transmission organization that oversees the operation of the grid
in New England. In a retail choice market, organizations can participate in competitive
procurements and select their own electricity supply, which is delivered to facilities by
the serving distribution utility (the company that owns the wires to the building, owns the
meter, and bills the customer). Massachusetts’ Renewable Energy Portfolio Standard
153
VI. Additional Details Related to Goal 1: Achieve Green Schools

(RPS) ensures that the amount of grid-supplied clean electricity that a facility receives
by default increases over time.
Bundled renewable electricity (also known as “delivered green power”) refers to a
customer’s purchase of physical electricity flowing from the grid to the customer’s site
paired with the underlying environmental attributes associated with the electricity
generated from a renewable source, for which the customer pays a premium. These
attributes are commonly referred to as renewable energy credits or energy attribute
certificates. PowerOptions is an organization that manages competitive utility
procurements for non-profit and public sector entities in Massachusetts, Connecticut,
and Rhode Island, helping schools in these states meet their goals and reduce utility
price volatility by locking in stable long-term electricity rates.

Objective 1b. Optimize Water Efficiency
Methods and Best Practices
There are many methods and best practices for optimizing water efficiency in schools,
including monitoring and managing water use, optimizing water efficiency of end uses
and systems, and using alternative water sources. Each of these methods and best
practices are described in more detail below.
Resources to Jump Start Water Efficiency in Schools
Schools can begin optimizing water efficiency by reviewing WaterSense’s Best
Management Practices, the Massachusetts Water Conservation Standards, and the
Schools, Recreation and Facilities Managers web page offered by the
Commonwealth’s Water Resources Commission.
158
VI. Additional Details Related to Goal 1: Achieve Green Schools

In general, schools should consider reviewing the EPA WaterSense® program’s best
management practices, collectively known as WaterSense at Work.199 WaterSense at
Work is a comprehensive guide developed to help commercial and institutional facility
owners and managers understand and better manage their water use. It is designed to
provide guidance to help establish an effective facility water management program and
identify projects and practices that can reduce facility water use and associated
operating costs. It includes best practices and O&M, retrofit, and replacement
recommendations for most if not all water end uses that may be found in Massachusetts
schools, and provides a compilation of additional resources on each topic.
In addition, Massachusetts Water Conservation Standards provides best practices and
recommendations for optimizing water efficiency for water suppliers and water users,
including schools.200 Specifically, schools should consider reviewing Section 7.0, which
provides recommendations for schools, and Section 9.0, which provides
recommendations on outdoor water use. Recommendations for schools are also
summarized on the School, Recreation, and Facilities Managers web page offered by
the Water Resources Commission.201
Monitor and Manage Water Use
When monitoring and managing water use, schools should consider metering and
tracking water use, benchmarking water use against other schools, and conducting
individual facility water assessments.
(1) Meter and track water use
Metering and tracking water use can help schools identify leaks and other abnormalities
in water use, identify areas for targeted reductions, help measure progress from
implementing water efficiency best practices, and allow for benchmarking.
At a minimum, schools should consider regularly tracking their building- or campus-level
metered water consumption using bills provided by their water utility. Schools should
strive to meter all water uses, including all indoor and outdoor water use, as well as
both utility-supplied sources and onsite alternative water sources (e.g., rainwater,
graywater).200 Schools should consider entering data into ESPM or another similar utility
management program.202 ESPM is a free, interactive tool for managing energy, water,
waste, and GHG emissions of any building type. ESPM has tools to help understand
metrics, monitor trends, and generate reports of metered data. Schools should use
graphs of water use data to help identify potential leaks or other water use abnormalities
and fix them immediately.203
Some schools may be able to access advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) data from
their water utility, if their utility uses advanced meters. Advanced water meters record
water meter data at least hourly and automatically transmit data regularly to a central
collection point. School facility managers can learn more about how to use AMI data by
reviewing WaterSense’s Improving Water Management Using Advanced Metering
Infrastructure Data: A Guide for Facility Managers.204
159
VI. Additional Details Related to Goal 1: Achieve Green Schools

In addition to metering and tracking building- or campus-level water use data, schools
should consider submetering high water end uses, including cooling towers, steam
boilers, single-pass cooling systems, irrigation systems, pools, and any product, system,
or process predicted use 1,000 gallons of water or more per day or 100,000 gallons of
water or more per year. 205
For more information about how to optimize water efficiency by metering and tracking
water use, schools should review WaterSense at Work Section 2.1: Metering and
Submetering. 199
(2) Benchmark water use
To further optimize water efficiency, Massachusetts schools should consider
benchmarking school water use. Benchmarking is the process of measuring a building’s
water use and comparing it to its own historical usage, the water use of similar facilities,
or a reference performance level. Similar to metering and tracking water use,
benchmarking can be as simple as measuring and comparing one school’s water
consumption over time (e.g., gallons per year). However, benchmarking can be more
powerful when water use data is normalized so that it can be compared across similar
facilities of the same type.206
Normalizing Water Consumption Data
To compare schools of all sizes and populations to one another, water use data
should be normalized. To normalize water use data, schools can select a metric to
help best compare water use data among schools, such as by facility size (e.g.,
gallons per square foot per year) or by population served (e.g., gallons per student per
year).
Massachusetts schools can benchmark building water consumption by:
• Metering and tracking water use (as described in best practice 1)
• Selecting a metric to normalize water use data, such as gallons per square foot
per year (also known as water use intensity [WUI]) or gallons used per student
per year
• Comparing normalized water use data across schools within individual school
districts or municipalities
Individual school districts or municipalities throughout the Commonwealth could use
normalized water use data to compare schools within their district to one another to
identify the schools in greatest need of efforts to increase water efficiency. School
districts/municipalities could choose to focus efforts on the highest water-using schools,
potentially deciding to conduct water assessments (as described in best practice 3) on
those schools first.
160
VI. Additional Details Related to Goal 1: Achieve Green Schools

In addition to comparing schools within a municipality or across the state, schools might
also compare building water performance to other schools across the nation. EPA has
developed a technical reference on median WUI values and other metrics observed in a
variety of facility types based on water use data entered into ESPM, which schools
could review to compare themselves against other schools in the United States.207 For
select building types in ESPM, there is an EPA Water Score (from 1 to 100) that allows
a facility to compare itself relative to the national population of buildings with similar
characteristics. For example, a building receiving a score of 75 indicates the building
performs better than 75 percent of similar buildings nationwide. While this EPA Water
Score rating system is not yet available for schools in ESPM, schools should continue to
report water use data into it to support this functionality in the future.
Some Massachusetts municipalities, including Boston208 and Lexington,209 currently
require large commercial buildings such as schools to report energy and water use data
annually using ESPM. Schools and school districts should be sure to report water use
where required and should consider tracking and reporting water data in ESPM, even if
not required.
For more detailed information on optimizing water efficiency by benchmarking water
use, review WaterSense at Work Section 2.3: Benchmarking.199
(3) Conduct water assessments
Understanding how water is used in each school individually is critical to optimizing
water efficiency across the portfolio of schools in Massachusetts. An individual facility
water assessment can:210
• Provide a comprehensive account of all water end uses at a school
• Identify leaks and potential simple operations and maintenance changes (unique
to each school) that could reduce water use
• Establish a school’s water use baseline
• Prioritize a list of water efficiency projects and improvements at a school,
including potential water and energy savings, project cost, and return on
investment
Schools should consider hiring water efficiency professionals with specific water
assessment experience to conduct school building water assessments. Alternatively,
existing facility management staff can educate themselves to conduct water
assessments using tools and resources developed by EPA’s WaterSense program and
other organizations. School facility managers can begin to train themselves to assess
their schools by reviewing WaterSense at Work Section 1.2 Water Management
Planning, 199 watching EPA’s latest “Conducting a Water Assessment from Start to
Finish” webinar,211 and familiarizing themselves with additional tools and resources
available to help conduct a water assessment.212
161
VI. Additional Details Related to Goal 1: Achieve Green Schools

WaterSense recommends that facilities conduct water assessments every four years to
continue to identify O&M practices, retrofits, and replacements that may optimize water
efficiency at a facility.210
Optimize Water Efficiency of End Uses and Systems
To optimize water efficiency of end uses and systems, schools should consider
installing WaterSense® labeled, ENERGY STAR® certified, and other high-efficiency
products in restrooms and cafeterias; implementing water-efficient O&M and user
education in restrooms and cafeterias; eliminating non-functional irrigated turf and
installing water-efficient landscaping; optimizing irrigation systems and installing
WaterSense labeled irrigation products; eliminating single-pass cooling; optimizing
cooling towers and steam boilers; and optimizing the water efficiency of other
uncommon end uses where applicable.
(4) Install WaterSense labeled, ENERGY STAR certified, and other high-efficiency
products in restrooms and cafeterias
Whenever possible, schools should install WaterSense labeled, ENERGY STAR
certified, and other high-efficiency water-using products in restrooms and cafeterias.
248 CMR 10.00 Uniform State Plumbing Code specifies maximum flow rate
requirements for residential and non-residential lavatory faucets; residential kitchen or
bar faucets; and non-residential sink faucets, showerheads, tank-type toilets,
flushometer-valve-type toilets, and urinals that align with current WaterSense
specifications, where applicable.213 Further, 225 CMR 9.00 Appliance Energy-Efficiency
Standards, Testing and Certification Program requires that commercial dishwashers
and steam cookers sold in Massachusetts be ENERGY STAR certified.
WaterSense labeled restroom products use at least 20 percent less water than standard
models and are independently certified for efficiency and performance. Because
WaterSense labeled products have maximum flow rates aligned with Massachusetts
plumbing code and are independently tested and certified, Massachusetts schools
should use the WaterSense Product Search Tool to look for WaterSense labeled
products specifically when replacing or purchasing new bathroom fixtures and fittings.214
These products include:
• WaterSense labeled flushometer-valve and tank-type toilets
• WaterSense labeled urinals
• WaterSense labeled showerheads
• WaterSense labeled private lavatory faucets (intended for private bathrooms not
available to walk-in traffic)
WaterSense does not label public lavatory faucets (i.e., those installed in public
restrooms open to walk-in traffic). New lavatory faucets in public restrooms should
162
VI. Additional Details Related to Goal 1: Achieve Green Schools

either be 0.5 gallons per minute (gpm) public-use lavatory faucets or 0.25 gallons per
cycle metering faucets to align with Massachusetts plumbing code.213
Similarly, WaterSense does not label kitchen faucets. Instead, schools should install 1.8
gpm kitchen sink faucets with a 2.2 gpm maximum temporary override for classrooms
and other areas with residential-style kitchen sinks to align with requirements in 225
CMR 9.00 Appliance Energy-Efficiency Standards, Testing and Certification Program. 215
ENERGY STAR specifies energy- and water-efficiency criteria for several water-using
commercial kitchen products and appliances. Massachusetts regulations require that
commercial dishwashers and steam cookers sold in the Commonwealth be ENERGY
STAR certified.215 To align with these regulations and to save energy and water across
all water-using cafeteria equipment, Massachusetts schools should use the ENERGY
STAR Product Finder to look for ENERGY STAR certified commercial kitchen products,
specifically when replacing or purchasing new water-using kitchen equipment.216 These
products include:
• ENERGY STAR certified commercial ice makers
• ENERGY STAR certified dishwashers
• ENERGY STAR certified combination ovens
• ENERGY STAR certified steam cookers
WaterSense and ENERGY STAR do not label commercial pre-rinse spray valves used
for rinsing dishes prior to dishwashing in cafeterias. Instead, schools should install 1.28
gpm commercial pre-rinse spray valves to align with the final rule that DOE published in
the Federal Register in 2016.217
In addition, schools should consider retrofit and replacement options for steam kettles,
dipper wells, wash-down sprayers, food disposals, and other commercial kitchen
equipment, where applicable, as described in WaterSense at Work Section 4.0. 199
(5) Implement water-efficient operations, maintenance, and user education in
restrooms and cafeterias
When schools do not replace or have a need to install new restroom and cafeteria
equipment (per the recommendations outlined in best practice 4), schools should
consider implementing O&M and user education recommendations for restroom fitting
and fixtures and cafeteria equipment as described in WaterSense at Work Section 3:
Sanitary Fixtures and Equipment and WaterSense at Work Section 4.0 Commercial
Kitchen Equipment. 199 These best practices provide simple, often low-cost operational
and user-focused changes that can help schools use existing fittings, fixtures, and
equipment as efficiently as possible.
163
VI. Additional Details Related to Goal 1: Achieve Green Schools

(6) Eliminate irrigated non-functional turf and install water-efficient landscaping
In general, water-efficient landscaped plant beds require less water than turfgrass.
Where possible, schools should consider eliminating irrigated non-functional turf and
replacing it with water-efficient landscaping—ideally, landscaping that does not require
supplemental irrigation. In addition to reducing a school’s water consumption, this
practice can also create additional outdoor spaces with shade that provide relief for
students and staff participating in outdoor activities. Non-functional turf includes turf
areas that are decorative and have no other functions. Functional use includes—but is
not limited to—turf for sports fields, picnic areas, and outdoor classrooms.
Schools should review WaterSense at Work Section 5.1: Landscaping for further O&M
and user education best practices and retrofit and replacement options to optimize the
water efficiency of landscaping.199
(7) Optimize irrigation systems and install WaterSense labeled irrigation products
Where supplemental irrigation is needed to maintain school landscapes, schools should
confirm that irrigation systems are optimized and should consider using WaterSense
labeled irrigation products.
EPA recommends a full audit of an irrigation system every three years by a qualified
irrigation auditor certified by a WaterSense labeled program, if possible.218 An irrigation
system audit evaluates the irrigation system’s performance and schedule, identifies
deficiencies, and provides suggestions for water efficiency improvements. Schools can
identify irrigation professionals certified by a WaterSense labeled program using
WaterSense’s Find a Pro tool.219 For schools that would prefer to use in-house staff for
this purpose, existing facility managers can
begin training themselves to conduct an Finding an Irrigation

guidelines for conducting an irrigation audit.220
Following an irrigation audit, schools should implement recommended improvements to
the irrigation system. If a full irrigation audit isn’t performed, schools should consider
reviewing WaterSense at Work Section 5.2: Irrigation and implementing the
recommended O&M and user education best practices and/or retrofit and replacement
options to optimize the water efficiency of irrigation systems.199
When possible, schools should consider installing WaterSense labeled irrigation
products, which can be found using the WaterSense Product Search Tool, including:214
164
VI. Additional Details Related to Goal 1: Achieve Green Schools

• WaterSense labeled irrigation controllers, which include weather- or soil-
moisture-based control technology
• WaterSense labeled spray sprinkler bodies where spray irrigation is used, as
required by 225 CMR 9.00 Appliance Energy-Efficiency Standards, Testing and
Certification Program
Further, schools should ensure that all newly installed or renovated irrigation systems
override and suspend programmed operation during periods of sufficient moisture.
Schools should also inspect system interruption devices at least every three years by an
irrigation contractor as required in M.G.L c 21, § 67: System Interruption Devices
Requirement for New Irrigation Systems.221 Schools can meet this requirement by using
WaterSense labeled irrigation controllers or otherwise installing rain sensors that
suspend irrigation upon the detection of rain.
Schools with irrigation systems should consider the water-smart irrigation principles
outlined in Massachusetts Water Conservation Standards Section 9.0 Outdoor Water
Use.200 In addition, schools should follow state guidance for limiting nonessential
outdoor water use during droughts as outlined in the Guidance on Nonessential Outdoor
Water Use Amended Water Resources Management Program Regulations 310 CMR
36.00 and the Massachusetts Drought Management Plan Preparedness &
Response. 222,46
(8) Eliminate single-pass cooling
Single-pass cooling systems use approximately 40 times more water to remove the
same heat load than a cooling tower operating at five cycles of concentration (see best
practice 9 for more details about cycles of concentration).223 Many types of equipment
cooled with single-pass cooling can be replaced with air-cooled systems.
Schools should identify any instances of single-pass cooling and minimize or eliminate
them where possible. Types of equipment that may use single-pass cooling and may be
present in Massachusetts schools include:
• Ice makers
• Point-of-use chillers for HVAC and other refrigeration systems
• Air compressors
• Welding machines
• Vacuum pumps
Ice makers are likely the most common type of single-pass cooled equipment found in
schools. Schools should consider replacing water-cooled ice makers with ENERGY
STAR certified commercial ice makers using the ENERGY STAR Product Finder.216
165
VI. Additional Details Related to Goal 1: Achieve Green Schools

For recommendations on how to minimize or eliminate single-pass cooling identified
elsewhere, schools should review WaterSense at Work Section 6.2: Single-Pass
Cooling.199
(9) Optimize cooling towers and steam boilers
Some schools may use cooling towers to dissipate heat from recirculating water that is
used to cool chillers, air conditioning equipment, or other process equipment. By design,
cooling towers consume large volumes of water, as the cooling towers use evaporation
to remove heat from the recirculated water loop. The operation of cooling towers can,
however, be optimized for water efficiency.
When water evaporates from a tower, dissolved solids are left behind. Eventually the
total dissolved solids (TDS) concentration gets too high for optimal performance and
some water must be removed, or blown down, from the system. Make-up water is
added to the system to replace the blowdown and decrease the concentration of TDS.
The ratio of make-up to blow down is known as cycles of concentration.
To optimize a cooling tower’s water use, a facility should maximize the tower’s cycles of
concentration without increasing TDS such that it impacts the tower’s water quality and
performance. A school’s BAS can offer visibility and help optimize cooling tower
performance both by monitoring TDS and by implementing control strategies described
in best practice 11 of the “Objective 1a. Decarbonize Buildings” section. Schools with
cooling towers may have water chemistry vendors that can help optimize their tower’s
cycles of concentration. Otherwise, a school’s facility manager can review WaterSense
at Work Section 6.3: Cooling Towers for more information on how to monitor and
optimize water efficiency in cooling towers.199
Some schools may use steam boilers in building heating systems. As water is converted
to steam, TDS increases. Similar to cooling towers, steam boilers require blow down to
control TDS and the addition of make-up water to replace water lost during blow down.
In addition, when steam is distributed, its heat is transferred to the ambient
environment, and it recondenses to water. From a water efficiency standpoint, schools
should consider capturing steam condensate and returning it to the boiler for reuse
since this will decrease the amount of make-up water needed and reduce the frequency
of blowdown. Steam boiler systems without condensate capture may need to add cold
water to the hot steam condensate before it can be discharged to the sewer system, so
steam condensate capture systems eliminate the need for this tempering water, as well.
For further information on how to optimize steam boiler water use, schools should
review WaterSense at Work Section 6.5 Boiler and Steam Systems.199
As schools work to electrify HVAC systems (following the best practices outlined in the
“Objective 1a. Decarbonize Buildings” section), some boilers and cooling towers may be
replaced with alternative heat pump technologies. Many of these all-electric alternatives
can significantly lower water demand by using closed-loop systems in the case of
GSHPs or by using refrigerants to transfer heat in place of water.
166
VI. Additional Details Related to Goal 1: Achieve Green Schools

(10) Optimize water efficiency of uncommon end uses, where applicable (pools,
laundries, laboratories)
Although not as ubiquitous as water use in restrooms and cafeterias, some schools may
have swimming pools; laundry equipment supporting athletics, family, and consumer
science classrooms, or daycares; and/or water-using laboratory equipment. Schools
should consider all end uses of water that may be present and estimate the total water
use of each end use when conducting a water assessment (as described in best
practice 3). Schools can then determine if these uncommon end uses are significant
and the extent to which they can optimize the efficiency of these end uses.
Where applicable, schools should consult appropriate sections in WaterSense at Work
for recommendations on O&M and user education, retrofit options, and replacement
options for uncommon end uses like swimming pools, laundries, and laboratories.199
Use Alternative Water Sources
Schools should also consider using onsite alternative water sources for some end uses,
where feasible as discussed below.
(11) Use onsite alternative water sources for irrigation, cooling towers, and toilet
and urinal flushing
Where potential water sources meet needs, schools should consider collecting and
reusing water on site. For example, existing schools with irrigation systems could
consider collecting and using rainwater for irrigation. Some treatment may be needed to
confirm the water is safe for landscape application, but water doesn’t need to be
potable-level quality for irrigation system use. In addition, existing schools with cooling
towers could consider collecting and reusing air handler condensate for cooling tower
make-up water. Air handler condensate is typically produced during hot, humid months
when cooling towers are operating closest to peak and need the most make-up water.
This is an example of an alternative water source that matches the need well.
It is likely not cost-effective for existing school buildings to be re-plumbed to use
graywater or rainwater for toilet and urinal flushing, but schools undergoing major
renovations or new schools could be designed to implement these systems. Newly
designed schools could consider water sources including graywater from lavatory sinks,
laundries, and showers; rainwater; and air handler condensate. Newly designed schools
should also consider reusing onsite alternative water for irrigation systems and cooling
towers as described previously.
For more information on collecting and using onsite alternative water sources, schools
should review WaterSense at Work Section 8.0: Onsite Alternative Water Sources and
the Federal Energy Management Program’s (FEMP’s) Alternative Water Sources web
page, which provides tools for determining the viability of rainwater harvesting and air
handler condensate capture.199,224

Objective 1c. Optimize Solid Waste Reduction and Diversion
Methods and Best Practices
This section offers a discussion of methods and best practices for optimizing solid waste
reduction and diversion in schools across two categories. First, this section summarizes
methods and best practices for reducing the generation of waste. These are important
practices, as they ultimately reduce the total volume of waste that schools need to
expend resources to properly manage. Next, this section summarizes methods and best
practices for effectively managing the solid waste that schools generate through routine
operations.
Reduce Solid Waste Generation
To reduce the generation of solid waste as part of routine operations, schools should
consider strategies for reducing cafeteria waste, educating staff and students to
transform habits, and implementing item exchange opportunities.
171
VI. Additional Details Related to Goal 1: Achieve Green Schools

(1) Reduce cafeteria waste
Across the nation, K–12 school cafeteria waste amounts to approximately 530,000 tons,
representing one of the largest waste streams coming out of K–12 schools.235 The
following practices can be adopted to minimize the amount of waste and money lost to
food waste and disposables in the cafeteria.
(1a) Practice offer versus serve
The concept of Offer versus Serve (OVS) allows students to decline select food items
offered by the National School Lunch Program and School Breakfast Program if they
choose not to eat these items. OVS is a mandatory practice for Massachusetts high
schools during lunch but is optional for elementary and middle schools in the
Commonwealth.236 Elementary schools that practice OVS waste significantly fewer
calories, fruits, and vegetables than schools that practice the “serve-only” model.237
While few studies have quantified the reduction of food waste in school cafeterias
associated with OVS, it is a commonly accepted best practice for food waste reduction.
According to the USDA, upwards of 81 percent of middle schools and elementary
schools practice OVS during lunch.238
Elementary and middle schools interested in implementing OVS to reduce food waste in
their cafeteria should see additional guidance from the USDA for implementing OVS for
the National School Lunch Program and School Breakfast Program.239
(1b) Serve grab-and-go meals
Grab-and-go style meals can allow students more time and flexibility to eat their food.240
This practice has increased in popularity under the School Breakfast Program in
particular—in 2014, only 7 percent of schools served grab-and-go meals, while in 2019,
this figure increased to 23 percent.241 Pre-packaged, grab-and-go style meals are
allowed to be served to all grade levels and ages.
(1c) Offer student-informed meal options
Students produce less food waste at school when they find the meals served more
palatable. Taste tests offer an opportunity to receive student feedback on meal
preferences and have been shown to reduce the amount of wasted food.242 Schools
should consider surveying and/or interviewing the student population to determine the
cultural backgrounds and dietary preferences of their students.243
(1d) Extend the lunch period
Many studies have shown that extending the lunch period decreases the amount of food
that students throw away.244–246 Students require a minimum of 20 minutes of sitting
time to eat and socialize. Students with longer lunch periods are more likely to consume
at least 10 percent more of their food.244 A minimum 30-minute lunch period is
recommended to allow students enough time to grab food, eat, socialize with peers, and
tidy up.
172
VI. Additional Details Related to Goal 1: Achieve Green Schools

(1e) Schedule recess before lunch
Scheduling recess before lunch in elementary schools can reduce food waste
generated by students.242 Taking recess before lunch results in students consuming a
greater variety of foods that they may not typically favor.242
(1f) Use reusable and washable trays and utensils
Schools can reduce waste by limiting their use of disposable trays and utensils.
New Bedford Public Schools Goes Green with Grant
In 2019, New Bedford Public Schools received a School Recycling Assistance Grant
through MassDEP’s Sustainable Materials Recovery Program to purchase and install
10 school dishwasher systems. The grant has enabled the school district to
completely eliminate Styrofoam trays (the district purchased 1,627,980 Styrofoam
trays in the 2018-2019 school year) and use paper trays when a disposable option is
needed. Despite the initial capital costs of dishwashers and the additional labor
needed to clean reusable trays, the recurring costs associated with disposable and
recyclable trays exceed those of reusable trays and utensils.
Source: MassDEP 247
If schools must use disposable trays and cutlery, compostable options are preferred to
divert waste from the landfill. Where possible, schools should strive to procure cutlery
that is not wrapped in plastic packets since these packets are typically not recyclable or
compostable.
(1g) Install and use milk dispensers as an alternative to milk cartons
The installation and use of milk dispensers can reduce milk waste by as much as 40
percent, increase cost savings, and decrease vulnerability to supply chain instability.248
Milk cartons are a major waste product from schools, with some waste audits estimating
that milk cartons represent upwards of 17 percent of a school district’s waste stream.248
In 2023, schools around the nation faced milk shortages due to carton supply chain
issues.249,250 In King County, Washington, school districts that switched from milk
cartons to milk dispensers realized (1) a reduction in milk waste, (2) increased cost
savings resulting from reduced garbage and recycling collection costs, and (3) lower
supply costs due to reduced milk waste and the phaseout of purchased milk cartons.251
K–12 schools are widely adopting milk dispensers, and they are already widely
implemented in college cafeterias.
(1h) Install and use water bottle fillers
Water bottle fillers are widely implemented across educational buildings to reduce
plastic waste. Many students and staff carry and customize reusable water bottles.
While studies at the K–12 level are limited, one mid-sized university reported that the
173
VI. Additional Details Related to Goal 1: Achieve Green Schools

implementation of water bottle fillers reduced their annual use of disposable single-use
plastic water bottles by approximately 400,000.252
(1i) Establish and use food share tables
Based on federal guidance from USDA,253 DESE encourages and outlines guidance for
the use of food share tables in schools in its Massachusetts School Meal Programs
Share Table Guidance. Students use share tables to exchange whole and
uncontaminated food items (e.g., whole fruit, chip bags). Schools can elect to manage
these tables in different ways: (1) food can be exchanged with no costs, (2) students
can be reimbursed for later meals, or (3) food can be donated to local institutions.253
Share tables must be in compliance with federal food safety regulations [7 CFR 210.13,
220.7, 226.20, and 225.16(a)] and the local School Food Authority’s food safety plan.
Schools should contact and obtain written approval from their respective local board of
health prior to establishing and using share tables.
(2) Educate staff and students to transform habits
Waste education is essential to encourage the adoption of new waste-reducing
infrastructure and practices and to increase awareness of the consequences of waste.
Schools can educate their staff and students on why waste matters (e.g., circular
economy, systems-thinking), how they can reduce the amount of waste they produce,
and how to properly sort their waste. Education should take place both in and out of the
classroom. Waste audits combined with field trips to waste processing facilities help
schools better understand their waste stream and are effective hands-on learning
experiences for students to learn the life cycle of waste. In Massachusetts, MassDEP’s
Green Team offers many waste lesson plans for teachers and awareness campaign
materials for administrators.
Implementing sustainable infrastructure often requires participants to disrupt their
current habits and adopt new ones. For example, a student may normally throw their
entire lunch tray into one trash bin. That student may find it inconvenient to adopt a
school’s transition to sustainable practices, which could require them to scrape food off
their reusable tray, recycle a fruit cup, and then place the tray in a designated location.
Interventions can be used to discourage old habits, and actions that encourage
repetition can reinforce the formation of new habits. Life changes make people more
likely to break their old habits; as such, when a student starts a new grade or begins at
a new school, they are especially able to accept new sustainable behaviors.254
Penalties for bad behavior (e.g., throwing trash in recycling) can be effective in
moderation but can often result in defensiveness and no behavioral changes.255 New
habits can be encouraged by making it easy to adopt them, using reminder prompts,
providing feedback, and creating incentives.254
(3) Institute item exchange opportunities
Schools can use item exchange opportunities to recirculate items in good condition that
are often discarded and replaced (e.g., backpacks, pencil boxes, and folders). Large
174
VI. Additional Details Related to Goal 1: Achieve Green Schools

events, such as school-sponsored yard sales or end-of-year exchanges, are effective at
diverting large amounts of waste, but may require substantial effort to organize. Schools
can supplement these large events with smaller, passive, easier-to-implement solutions,
such as swap tables or “good-on-one-side” paper swap boxes. Schools may also
choose to partner with faith-based organizations, thrift stores, food pantries, or donation
centers to transfer school-community resources into the broader community. Item
exchange opportunities have the co-benefit of supporting students from lower-resourced
backgrounds in obtaining essential school items.
Effectively Manage Generated Solid Waste
To effectively manage generated solid waste, schools should consider establishing an
effective electronic waste (“e-waste”) recycling program, designating staff and students
to manage and implement the school’s waste program, maximizing the collection of
divertible solid waste, optimizing collection bin location and labeling, processing organic
waste onsite, composting or leaving lawn clippings in place, and using smart waste
monitoring technology.
(4) Establish an electronic waste recycling plan for electronic learning tools
Prompted by the COVID-19 pandemic, many school districts have adopted electronic
learning tools (e.g., laptops and tablets) to facilitate remote learning and enhance in-
school instruction. According to some surveys, 90 percent of middle and high schools
and 84 percent of elementary schools provide electronic devices to their students.256
While this transition has contributed to a reduction of paper waste, the increased
prevalence of electronic learning tools has resulted in greater quantities of e-waste. If
not responsibly recycled (e.g., through a certified electronics recycling vendor), e-waste
can end up in the landfill or shipped to another country for unregulated, informal e-waste
recycling that often presents numerous human health risks, including increased lead
exposure for children.257 Typical K–12 laptops last an average of four years without
repairs, and the cost of simple repairs can often be equivalent to approximately half the
price of a new replacement laptop.256 School districts providing personal devices to
students should develop and routinely update an e-waste recycling plan that details the
district’s protocols for repair and sustainable, responsible disposal to maximize
diversion from landfills. In addition to reducing the amount of e-waste sent to landfills,
the effective and responsible management of e-waste also reduces the harmful
exposures that communities practicing informal e-waste recycling may face.257
(5) Designate staff members and students to implement and manage waste
programs
Improving waste management programs often requires redistributing responsibilities
across existing roles or hiring new staff to support the increased level of effort. In
schools, these responsibilities are often voluntarily assumed by students rather than
paid staff, leading to long-term staffing instability. To avoid this, schools can hold
conversations proactively, and include important stakeholders such as the custodial
union, cafeteria staff, and grounds workers.
175

management program. Student engagement
should be encouraged. It is recommended that To ensure school maintenance staff

professionally, but smaller waste programs waste management program,
(e.g., TerraCycle®) can be run effectively by schools should formally document
student volunteers. roles and responsibilities in all job
duty descriptions.
(6) Collect divertible waste
The first step to diverting waste from the landfill is to collect it separately from waste
intended for the landfill. Schools can collect recycling (paper, corrugated cardboard,
glass, plastics, and metals), compost (organics), and e-waste to meet zero-waste facility
and operations standards set by LEED v4.258 This standard also outlines how divertible
waste should also be collected during the construction of a new facility.258 Schools
registered as Green Team members through MassDEP can submit an application form
to receive single-stream recycling and composting equipment to collect these items.
(7) Optimize bin location and labeling
The thoughtful location and consistent labeling of bins can influence how students and
staff sort and dispose of various waste streams. To maximize the diversion of material
from the landfill, schools should locate bins as close as possible to the point of waste
generation. For example, schools implementing a compost collection program should
place compost bins in close proximity to food preparation (i.e., the kitchen) and
consumption (cafeteria). Where possible, the selection of bin color and labeling should
intuitively reflect the waste stream being collected. To avoid confusion and reduce
contamination, schools should implement a consistent approach to bin color and
labeling across all bins to the maximum extent possible. Table 49 provides an example
of effective bin color and labeling selections.
Table 49. Example of Effective Bin Color and Label Selection
Waste Stream Bin Color Label
Trash Brown, Black, or Grey “Landfill”
Recycling Blue “Recycling”
Organics Green “Compost” or “Organics”
E-Waste Orange “E-Waste”
Other Depends on collected item Depends on collected item
(8) Process organic waste on site
Some schools may be capable of processing organic waste on site. Onsite organics
waste processing can decrease hauling costs by reducing pickup frequency or
eliminating the need for organic waste haulers. Advanced technological options (e.g.,
176
VI. Additional Details Related to Goal 1: Achieve Green Schools

dehydrators, pulpers, and anaerobic digestors) have high up-front capital costs and
some ongoing operational costs. These machines suit facilities with sufficient outdoor
area for composting or limited hauler access and would likely be inefficient for most
schools; however, smaller-scale composting is appropriate in most schools. Schools
with agricultural or environmental programs may especially benefit from composting on
site with organic waste from the cafeteria, lawns or landscaping, livestock, agricultural
plots, or classrooms. The remaining compost should be hauled off-site for processing.
Schools that implement onsite composting must notify MassDEP.
(9) Leave lawn clippings in place or compost
Lawn clippings are often bagged and sent to the landfill, adding to a school’s total waste
stream. If it does not interfere with the purpose of the lawn, short clippings (~1 inch)
should be left in place to decompose after mowing to reduce nitrogen fertilizer
requirements (by as much as 75 percent) and increase soil organic matter content.259,260
Longer clippings could smother the grass and instead should be collected and
composted on-site or sent for off-site composting.
(10) Use smart waste monitoring technology
Smart waste monitoring technologies are used to provide real-time insights into waste
generation, composition, and collection. They are relatively inexpensive and can be
used to track a bin’s location and, when it is nearing capacity, allow for optimized
collection schedules that can reduce hauling fees. Schools can also leverage the data
collected from bin sensors to better understand their waste stream.

Objective 1d. Electrify School Bus Fleets
Methods and Best Practices
This section offers a discussion of methods and best practices for electrifying school
bus fleets related to planning, acquisition, and operations. Each of these methods and
best practices are described in more detail below.
Planning Considerations
When planning the electrification of a fleet of school buses, schools should consider
engaging with electric utility providers, utilizing microgrids for charging, and exploring
V2G and/or V2L technology. These three best practices are discussed in more detail
below.
(1) Engage electrical utility provider early and often
A school district’s successful deployment of ESBs requires careful planning and
coordination with the district’s electrical utility provider. ESBs have a larger battery than
light-duty electric vehicles. Therefore, the vehicles will draw larger amounts of electricity
from the grid when charging. Consistent communication with the electric utility provider
will assist with the timely completion of ESB projects by identifying and addressing
potential issues (e.g., necessary infrastructure upgrades) early in the electrification
process. Additionally, some electrical utilities may offer funding or technical assistance
to fleets that are in the process of converting their vehicles to electric.
(2) Utilize microgrids for charging
A microgrid usually uses a local power generation unit and an energy storage system
such as a battery to create an isolated electrical network. Microgrids can help
simultaneously reduce charging costs and improve operational resiliency. Districts that
operate their own fleets often choose to utilize on-site power generation units such as
solar PV panels/canopies to charge their vehicles. This improves the environmental
benefit of the vehicle by ensuring that it is powered (at least partially) by clean energy.
Power from solar panels also offers a charging option for ESBs, even during periods of
local electrical grid outages.
182
VI. Additional Details Related to Goal 1: Achieve Green Schools

(3) Explore V2G and/or V2L technology
V2G and V2L are areas of growing interest for ESB owners. Districts that procure both
V2G-/V2L-capable vehicles and chargers can essentially turn their ESBs into “batteries
on wheels.” This process involves a bus sending power back to either a load that
requires power (e.g., a school building) or to

Cajon Valley School District in California.
Electric School Bus Acquisition
When acquiring ESBs, schools should consider leveraging available funding, working
with a local vehicle dealer, and purchasing vehicle warranties. These three best
practices are discussed in more detail below.
(4) Leverage available funding programs
There are currently numerous federal-, local-, and utility-level funding programs
available to school districts interested in purchasing ESBs. Historically, EPA programs
such as the Clean School Bus (CSB) Program, the Diesel Emission Reduction Act
(DERA), and the Clean Heavy Duty Vehicle (CHDV) Program have funded the
replacement of ICE school buses with electric alternatives. Additionally, in 2022, the
Inflation Reduction Act made tax-exempt entities eligible for certain tax credits. Of note,
the Commercial Clean Vehicle Credit (Section 45W) provides up to $40,000 for certain
eligible vehicles weighing over 14,000 lbs. At the state level, MassCEC has provided
funding and technical assistance to districts through its ACT Program. The
Commonwealth has also encouraged EV adoption through its MOR-EV Program, which
provides rebates for a number of electric vehicles, including ESBs. Finally, it is also
crucial to determine if the local electrical utility provides financial assistance. Common
utility funding programs include time-of-use rates or make-ready programs. Time-of-use
rates incentivize the charging of electric vehicles at times when electricity demand is low
183
VI. Additional Details Related to Goal 1: Achieve Green Schools

through decreased billing rates. Make-ready funding subsidizes or entirely covers the
cost of preparing a charging site to handle the increased demand of school bus
charging. The Alternative Fuels Data Center’s Laws and Incentives Tool is a great way
to determine what local programs are available to fund an ESB deployment.
(5) Work with a local vehicle dealer
Many districts have found it beneficial to work with a vehicle dealer who has a local
presence, whether it be a dealership or service network. If a school district requires
significant repairs for an ESB, working with a local dealer can help districts avoid
incurring the cost and headache associated with shipping a bus out of state for repairs.
(6) Purchase vehicle warranties
While it is true that ESBs have comparatively fewer mechanical issues, in large part
because of the fewer moving pieces, when an ESB component does break, it can be
expensive to replace. This is partly due to the materials used to manufacture EV parts
and the complexity of the parts.264 Furthermore, the high-voltage systems in an EV can
make repairs more complicated as personnel must be properly trained and equipped to
work with high-voltage parts. For this reason, some districts chose to purchase an
extended warranty or a service contract on their vehicle.
Electric School Bus Operations
To optimize and maximize the safety of ESB operations, schools should consider
deploying telematics and implement operator training. Both of these best practices are
discussed in more detail below.
(7) Deploy telematics
A great way to track the performance of electric school buses is to utilize telematics.
While some manufacturers build telematics devices into their vehicles, there are also
third-party telematics devices that can be easily installed in any vehicle. Usually, third-
party telematics devices are connected to the vehicles through the onboard diagnostics-
II port. This allows the device to collect a variety of data. Most devices can measure the
speed of the vehicle, the time it takes to complete a route, the vehicle’s idling time,
internal temperatures, state of charge, and GPS location of the vehicle. The major
benefits of telematics include monitoring the vehicle’s battery life, aiding drivers and
vehicle monitor timecards, and quickly locating vehicles that have been in an accident
or have run out of battery. Many districts have also found telematics useful in
quantifying the environmental and financial impact of their ESBs. Some funding
programs, such as New Jersey’s Electric School Bus Program, require that telematics
be installed in ESBs purchased with awards.
184
VI. Additional Details Related to Goal 1: Achieve Green Schools

(8) Implement operator training
Crucial to the success of an ESB deployment is ensuring that drivers are trained on the
unique features of an electric vehicle. One of the most important skills for drivers to
learn is how to effectively use regenerative braking. Regenerative braking occurs when
an electric vehicle’s motor reverses while decelerating. As the motor reverses, energy is
captured and sent back to the battery, effectively extending the vehicle’s range. These
courses often also teach basic skills, such as how to plug a vehicle in and perform
simple troubleshooting. Operator training is often offered by the vehicle’s OEM or
dealer. Alternatively, many third-party, non-profit, and for-profit organizations offer driver
training courses and resources.
Statutes, Regulations, and Standards
Statutes, regulations, and standards that include a focus on school bus electrification
are detailed below.
Relevant Statutes
M.G.L. c. 30B and c. 30, § 39M concerns the procurement of electric vehicles and their
charging infrastructure in Massachusetts. Under current Commonwealth law, the
procurement of school buses falls under the jurisdiction of M.G.L. c. 30B.265 Conversely,
the procurement of charging infrastructure is considered a construction project under
M.G.L. c. 30, § 39M.265 This means that districts looking to procure ESBs must have
separate procurement processes for both the vehicles and the associated equipment.
Massachusetts does offer a state contract, but this contract currently has only one bus
vendor under contract.265
M.G.L. Part 1, Title XIV, c. 90, §7B determines the necessary features for a legal
school bus in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. The comprehensive list of
requirements includes everything from the necessary physical features such as the
word “School Bus” being painted on the vehicle to driver and operation requirements.221
Relevant Regulations
310-7.40 CMR adopts California’s vehicle emissions standards and compliance
requirements under the Massachusetts Low Emission Vehicle Standard. All new
passenger cars, light-duty trucks, medium- and heavy-duty vehicles and engines sold
and registered in Massachusetts must meet these requirements.266 Additionally, by
2035 all new passenger vehicles sold in Massachusetts must be zero-emission
vehicles.266
Relevant Standards and Other Requirements
Additional Funding for ADA-Compliant Buses: Some federal programs will provide
additional funding to school districts that procure ESBs compliant with the Americans
with Disabilities Act (ADA). For example, the CSB and CHDV funding programs each
offer an additional $20,000 for ESBs that are ADA-compliant.
185
VI. Additional Details Related to Goal 1: Achieve Green Schools

Leasing Exclusions for ESBs: The most popular school bus funding programs such
as EPA’s CSB Program, CHDV Program, DERA Program, and the Internal Revenue
Service’s (IRS’s) Section 45W Tax Credit, do not allow applicants to lease electric
school buses. All vehicles procured or reimbursed with funding from these programs
must be purchased.
Qualified Manufacturers for Certain Funding Programs concerns the qualified
vehicle manufacturers under Internal Revenue Code 30D(d)(1)(C). This is particularly
relevant for those interested in receiving tax credits under IRS Section 45W. It is
important to note that while this standard also applies to IRS Section 30D, school buses
and school districts do not qualify for the 30D credit. The IRS provides an index of
qualified manufacturers for clean vehicle credits.
Scrapping Requirement for ESB Programs: Most federal programs (including the
CSB Program, the CHDV Program, and the DERA Program) and many local programs
that fund the replacement of existing ICE school buses with ESBs include scrapping
requirements. These requirements involve some variation of cutting the frame rails and
drilling a hole in the engine block of the ICE vehicle to be replaced.

Objective 1e. Provide Electric Vehicle Charging Stations for School
Staff and Public Use
Methods and Best Practices
This section offers a discussion of methods and best practices for providing EV
charging stations for school staff and public use related to planning, acquisition, and
operations. Each of these methods and best practices are described in more detail
below.
Planning Considerations
When planning the electrification of a fleet of school buses, schools should consider
engaging with electric utility providers, confirming the onboard charger capacity of fleet
vehicles, determining the charger rating needs of vehicles, exploring V2G and V2L
technology, utilizing networked and managed charging, evaluating parking locations of
EVs, and exploring potential liability concerns. These best practices are discussed in
more detail below.
(1) Engage with the utility provider early and often
The electric utility provider is a key stakeholder in the EVSE installation process. It is
best practice to reach out to a potential site’s utility provider before beginning the
installation of the EV chargers. Communication with the electrical utility throughout the
project period can increase the likelihood that permitting, construction, and
commissioning deadlines are met. The utility provider should also be able to provide
information on necessary site upgrades and whether or not there are any incentive
programs offered by the utility.
(2) Confirm the onboard charger capacity of fleet vehicles
If an EV charger is being purchased to serve a particular vehicle or fleet, be sure that
the vehicle’s onboard chargers can accept the energy output of the charger. If the
187
VI. Additional Details Related to Goal 1: Achieve Green Schools

output of the charger is greater than the capacity of the onboard charger, it is possible
that the vehicle could encounter charging issues. The vehicle and charger OEMs may
be able to confirm compatibility.
(3) Determine the charger rating needs of vehicles
After deciding what vehicles will be using the EVSE, determine how much charging time
the vehicles will need. It is important to match the charger power rating to the vehicle
battery and vehicle downtime. In other words, do not default to DC fast chargers
because they are faster if level 2 or even level 1 chargers can meet the charging needs.
This is because higher-level chargers, especially DC fast chargers, are more expensive
to procure, operate, and maintain than lower-level chargers.
(4) Explore V2G and/or V2L technology
Consider whether your district will ever want to utilize V2G or V2L. V2G is the process
of hooking up an electric vehicle’s battery to the electrical grid, presumably in an
emergency scenario or when the grid cannot meet its demand. Some utility providers
may pay for energy dispensed to the grid. Similarly, V2L involves connecting an EV
battery to a load, such as a district building, and sending energy from the battery to the
load.
(5) Utilize networked and managed charging
Networked chargers are EVSE that can connect (wirelessly or through a wired
connection) to the internet. Networked chargers usually provide several unique benefits,
such as the ability to collect charger data, see when a charger is down and what the
issue is, schedule charging sessions, and easily contact the manufacturer. Included in
the benefits of a networked charger is managed charging, which allows operators to
schedule stop and end times for charging sessions without staff having to be on site to
plug in and unplug the vehicle. Many use this feature to schedule charging sessions
when electricity is comparatively cheaper, usually at night or in the early morning.
Networked chargers require the purchase of an additional subscription.
(6) Evaluate parking locations of EVs
Place the charger in a location accessible to different vehicles without interrupting the
flow of traffic. If the main use of the EVSE is to charge EVs owned by school staff
members and the general public, be sure that parking spots in which EVSE is installed
can comfortably fit a variety of light-duty vehicles. If the charger will mainly serve ESBs,
situate the charger in a location that buses can easily access. Make a note of where the
charge port is on the vehicle and place the charger in a location where the charging
cable can reach the port.
(7) Explore potential liability concerns
Some EV charger owners mandate that any vehicle using their equipment does so at
their own risk and is liable for any issues that may arise from connecting to the charger.
188
VI. Additional Details Related to Goal 1: Achieve Green Schools

This is particularly common with chargers that are made accessible at the workplace for
staff members’ personal vehicles. Districts should consider how to reduce their liability
as charger owners.
EVSE Acquisition and Installation
When acquiring EVSE, schools should consider leveraging available funding, planning
for long lead times, deploying charger retractors, and purchasing charger warranties.
These best practices are discussed in more detail below.
(8) Leverage available funding programs
Take advantage of existing funding programs. Many funding opportunities for electric
vehicles account for EVSE costs such as EPA’s Clean School Bus Program and the
Clean Heavy Duty Vehicle Program. Additionally, there are many EVSE-specific funding
programs on the federal level such as the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI)
Formula Program and the Charging and Fueling Infrastructure (CFI) Grant Program.
Locally, Massachusetts offers several EVSE incentive programs through the
Massachusetts Electric Vehicle Incentive Program (MassEVIP). Look into these
programs early in the EVSE exploration process to verify that any district project can
meet these program’s requirements. Finally, many electrical utility providers offer EVSE
financing programs such as reduced electricity rates for EV charging and make-ready
funding (funding devoted to upgrading site equipment and getting it ready to handle EV
charging).
(9) Plan for long lead times
Lead times for EV chargers and their associated equipment can be unpredictable.
Some Massachusetts-based projects have seen lead times for crucial equipment take
six months.267 This is why it is important to reach out to manufacturers early in the
process and prepare for components to take a while to be delivered.
(10) Deploy charger retractors
As previously mentioned, it is important to replace a charger cord at the end of the
charging session. Failing to do so may lead to a vehicle unknowingly running over the
charger’s cord or head. This, in turn, can damage the charger and potentially put it out
of service. To address this issue, many EVSE owners opt for cord retractors, which
automatically pull the cord and head back to the charger body after it has been
unplugged from a vehicle.
(11) Purchase charger warranties
EV chargers can be, at times, expensive or burdensome to repair. Warranties can help
alleviate some of the cost. Districts should consider warranties with a high percentage
uptime guarantee. An uptime guarantee is when the manufacturer guarantees that a
charger will be operational a certain percentage of the time. While charger warranties
vary by charger and warranty type, estimates suggest that an extended warranty for a
189
VI. Additional Details Related to Goal 1: Achieve Green Schools

DC fast charger can be over $800 a year.268 It is important that after a warranty is
purchased, proper documentation is kept to confirm all warranty requirements are met
so that the manufacturer honors the warranty.
Operations and Maintenance
To optimize EV charging operations, schools should consider developing a
maintenance plan and creating expectations for charger use etiquette. Both of these
best practices are discussed in more detail below.
(12) Develop a maintenance plan
Before purchasing a charger, verify that the OEM or an associated entity can provide
service to it locally. There are limits to what an OEM can do to troubleshoot a charger
over the phone or over the internet. If the charger OEM cannot provide service, it is
important to explore other maintenance options, such as local electricians who have
been certified to work on EVSE. It is crucial to develop a maintenance plan since having
access to an in-person technician can significantly reduce the downtime of a broken
charger.
(13) Create expectations for charger use etiquette
If charger usage is granted to district staff and the public, it will be important to create
expectations for its usage. This includes replacing the charger cord at the end of a
charging session and not occupying the charger beyond the time it takes to charge a
vehicle. Creating these expectations will help keep the charger cord from being
damaged and allow for more people to access the charger. Additionally, many charger
operators choose to limit charger availability to certain times of the day. This allows the
district to avoid charger usage during times of high electrical demand.
Statutes, Regulations, and Standards
Statutes, regulations, and standards that include a focus on EVSE are detailed below.
Relevant Statutes
Act of 2021, Chapter 8, Section 49, 2021 requires that all EV charging stations meet
certain energy efficiency requirements that are set by DOER.225
M.G.L. c. 25A, Section 16B-16E determines that the owners and operators of public
EV charging stations that require payment must allow for publicly accessible payment
options.269 This means that the charger cannot require a subscription fee or a
membership. Information on the charger (including the location, payment methods,
hours of access, etc.) must be shared with the DOE’s Alternative Fuels Data Center.
Build America Buy America (BABA) Act governs certain purchases made with
federal funding. Enacted in 2021, the BABA Act requires that federally funded
infrastructure projects use domestically produced iron, steel, manufactured products,
190
VI. Additional Details Related to Goal 1: Achieve Green Schools

and construction materials.270 Previously, EPA had issued a waiver for EV chargers that
were assembled in the United States.119 On July 1, 2024, however, this waiver expired,
and EV chargers are once again subject to BABA Act requirements.
Relevant Standards and Other Requirements
Data Collection Requirements: Some EVSE funding programs include requirements
for the recipient to collect and report data. When applying to an EVSE funding program,
schools should verify if the program requires the charger to collect and submit data. For
example, the Department of Transportation’s NEVI Formula Program lists the collection
of data from a national network of chargers as a primary program objective.271 Chargers
will need to be networked to collect data. Districts should be informed of the additional
costs and benefits of networked chargers.
The EVITP established a 20-hour training program provided exclusively to certified
electricians.272 This training program has become an industry standard with many
federal and state funding programs. For example, the NEVI Formula Program requires
that all electricians who work on program-funded projects be certified under EVITP.273
MassEVIP Availability Requirements: EVSE installed using funding from MassEVIP
must be publicly available for at least 12 hours a day.274 There are similar requirements
for the federal CFI Grant Program, which mandates that all chargers must be publicly
accessible. This is notable for districts who want to access EVSE funding but do not
want to make charger use available to the general public.
Open Charge Point Protocol (OCPP): This protocol is growing in popularity and
governs “networked” chargers. EV chargers that are considered networked can connect
to the internet and other chargers on the same network. Typically, these chargers can
share information that non-networked chargers cannot track, such as error codes and
usage data. A networked charger will usually require a subscription to a charger
network provider. OCPP-compliant chargers allow charger owners to easily change
charging network providers without having to replace the equipment itself.275 Prominent
federal and state funding programs such as the NEVI Formula Program and CFI Grant
Program require EVSE funded through their programs to be OCPP-compliant.276,277

School districts can build on state-level efforts presented in the ResilientMass Plan by
conducting planning activities and implementing school-level resilience projects by
implementing the methods and best practices described below.
192
VI. Additional Details Related to Goal 1: Achieve Green Schools

(1) Conduct vulnerability assessments
Vulnerability assessments determine the exposure, vulnerability, and consequence of
climate hazards to a school district’s students, workforce, and assets, as well as the
utilities, infrastructure, and services upon which the school district relies to successfully
execute its mission. A school district should begin an assessment by organizing a team
of key partners and establishing the assessment goals, timeframe, and scope of the
hazards and school district operations it intends to analyze. After scoping the hazards
analysis, the school district should perform community and stakeholder outreach to
confirm that hazards appropriately reflect the concerns of the community. Once the
scope is established, a school district should identify existing local hazard mitigation
plans and data sources for the existing condition of assets, geospatial data, climate
hazard data, health data (e.g., asthma and heat stress), school district capabilities and
capacity, and any existing adaptation and risk reduction strategies. This data can be
applied to the site and asset level using a combination of surveys of key site staff and
site visits. There can be overlap with other assessment activities, such as FCAs, which
are also concerned with asset existing conditions, maintenance and replacement
schedules, past hazard events and associated damage, disruption, and loss.
The collected data is combined to score assets based on their hazard exposure,
sensitivity, vulnerability, and consequence. The final step of the vulnerability
assessment is to develop actions, adaptation, and hazard mitigation strategies to
reduce vulnerabilities. Additional details on the planning process are offered by the MVP
Program.
(2) Prepare a comprehensive climate action plan
A comprehensive climate action plan (CAP) uses the results of the vulnerability
assessment to establish an integrated strategic plan for the implementation of identified
strategies. At this stage, a district should:
• Prioritize strategies to address the most critical vulnerabilities to human health
and infrastructure resulting from the earliest hazard exposures and those that
have the highest consequence from a potential disruption.
• Summarize the high priority and high consequence assets for each school.
• Revise strategies to incorporate key issues such as equity and environmental
justice, feasibility, and economic benefits.
• Identify overlapping or integrated vulnerabilities and adaptation strategies
across schools. For example, multiple schools may be served by the same local
electricity distribution network that has proven to be unreliable in past hazard
events and would benefit from district coordination with the electric transmission
and distribution utility. This is the stage at which strategies should be
incorporated into existing capital planning processes.
193
VI. Additional Details Related to Goal 1: Achieve Green Schools

• Document key progress indicators, status, progress made, roles and
responsibilities for seeing it to completion, working timeline for completion, and
potential funding sources for each strategy.
• Develop and share resources, technical support, curriculum, and other guidance
to aid individual schools in implementation.
(3) Incorporate resilience into new construction and modernization projects
Districts should include resilience strategies and goals identified during the vulnerability
assessment in project requirements and other relevant procurement documents. For
projects that occur prior to a vulnerability assessment taking place, there are a number
of building code requirements and best practices included in other standards used by
schools that address resilient design. For example, the ResilientMass Climate
Resilience Design Standards Tool allows users to input project information to generate
recommended standards.278 Additionally, NE-CHPS awards points to projects that
conduct a vulnerability assessment, incorporate all feasible adaptation measures for top
hazards and include passive survivability in the design.183 For new construction, site
selection offers a significant opportunity to mitigate vulnerabilities, whereas hardening of
existing infrastructure may be necessary for modernization projects.
Many building decarbonization best practices also offer resilience benefits, including a
well-insulated and airtight building envelope; HVAC systems that provide sufficient
cooling, ventilation, and filtration; natural ventilation via operable windows; and
daylighting. In particular, investing in a high-performance envelope can support passive
survivability, where the building can maintain a habitable indoor environment without
active systems during disruptions to utilities or HVAC systems.279
(4) Implement retrofit projects targeting resilience
Some discrete resilience strategies that apply to new construction and modernizations
can be implemented as individual retrofits or a phased series of retrofits. Specific types
of retrofits that address Massachusetts’ highest consequence hazards (extreme
temperatures, flooding, hurricanes, severe winter storms, and tsunamis) include
installing central air conditioning and increased cooling capacity, wind-resistant roofs
and windows, and green infrastructure for flood mitigation and shading. Districts should
work with project teams to identify HVAC and envelope retrofits that achieve health co-
benefits from improvements to indoor air quality.
Backup power generation to cover critical building services is one of the most commonly
considered resilience projects. While backup power has traditionally been provided by
diesel and natural gas generators, there are increasing options for non-GHG emitting
backup power in the form of onsite solar PV, BESS, and even V2L-enabled electric
school buses (see Objective 1a. Install and Use Onsite Renewable Energy Systems
and Objective 1d. Electrify School Bus Fleets for additional details). It is important to
note there are specific electrical infrastructure and permitting requirements to allow
schools to safely “island” themselves from the electrical grid in the event of an outage.
194
VI. Additional Details Related to Goal 1: Achieve Green Schools

BESS and other forms of energy storage also support Massachusetts’ Energy Storage
Initiative goas and targets.
(5) Perform resilient O&M
Knowledgeable O&M staff are critical to school operations and increasingly important in
the event of a disruption. A strong preventive maintenance program can decrease the
risk of system failures due to a hazard event. Emergency preparedness plans can
establish procedures for response to hazard events and prepare staff to execute plans.
This can range from O&M staff being knowledgeable about transferring from grid-
supplied electricity to backup power systems to district staff expanding community
support services at a school following a hazard event. Establishing mutual aid
agreements with other government and community organizations can provide a
framework for a coordinated response to hazard events.
Statutes, Regulations, and Standards
Statutes, regulations, and standards that include a focus on climate resilience are
detailed below.
Relevant Regulations
Massachusetts State Building Code (MSBC) 780 CMR is a statewide mandated
construction code that “includes most of the federal construction requirements listed in
the U.S. Code of Federal Regulations Title 44, Section 60.3 for floodplains as defined
by FEMA Flood Insurance Rate Maps.”95 Other hazards included in the MSBC include
wind, snow, and earthquakes.
Relevant Standards
LEED v4.1: Resilient Design Pilot Credit awards up to five points for projects that
perform a vulnerability assessment, implement mitigation strategies for two of the top
three identified hazards, and incorporate passive survivability and backup power in the
design.279
NE-CHPS: Design for Adaptation and Resilience awards points to projects that
perform vulnerability assessments covering the lifespan of the asset, incorporate all
feasible adaptation measures for top hazards, and include passive survivability in the
design.183

Objective 2a. Improve Air Quality
2a(1) Reduce Airborne Transmission of Disease
Methods and Best Practices
The first category of recommendations are practices that schools can use in their daily
operations to reduce the airborne transmission of disease. The second category is
steps for when an individual is sick or when rates of disease are high in a school
community.
In Everyday Operations
These recommendations are steps that schools can take in their everyday operations to
reduce the airborne transmission of diseases. Schools may want to increase these
practices during winter months when respiratory virus transmission is typically highest.
(1) Increase ventilation to bring more outdoor air to indoor spaces
Improving indoor air quality can reduce the concentration of pathogens and, therefore,
reduce airborne transmission of diseases.280,281 One major way to improve air quality for
this purpose is to bring more outdoor air indoors, which dilutes the concentration of
pathogens released by anyone who may be sick. HVAC systems should meet the
minimum outdoor air ventilation requirements in accordance with design codes and
consider enhancements to ventilation systems when remodeling or planning new
construction.280,281 HVAC systems that mix outdoor air with recirculated indoor air
should be set to maximize outdoor air, within manufacturer’s recommendations, during
periods of high disease transmission.281 Note that in conditions of high humidity when
the HVAC system is providing chilled air, there are more opportunities for condensation
and mold growth if the system and building are not designed to accommodate 100
percent fresh air. In these conditions, check for condensation more frequently to avoid
mold growth.
Opening windows can help bring more outdoor air to indoor spaces without mechanical
ventilation, such as rooms with low airflow, schools without ventilation systems, or
school buses.280,281 This is a short-term solution when mechanical ventilation systems
are not available and is not an energy efficient solution to outdated building heating
systems. Even cracking a few windows open is better than keeping all shut.280 Using
fans to draw in outdoor air can help increase the effectiveness of open windows.280,281
However, opening windows may not always be possible on very hot summer days, very
cold winter days, days when outdoor air pollution is high, or in areas with outdoor safety
concerns.281 Schools should keep windows closed during periods of elevated relative
humidity (>60 percent) and when air conditioning is operating so as to prevent
condensation and mold growth. See the Reduce Exposure to Mold and Moisture section
for additional details about the use of sensor technology to monitor indoor relative
humidity and other air quality parameters.
199
VII. Additional Details Related to Goal 2: Achieve Healthy Schools

(2) Filter indoor air
For buildings with ventilation systems that recirculate air, schools should increase the
level of their air filter to MERV 13 or higher, if appropriate for the system.281 In addition,
whoever manages the air filtration system should check that the filters are installed
correctly and fit well, check that sufficient airflow is maintained across the filter, and
maintain and change filters based on the manufacturer’s recommendation.281 For
spaces with low ventilation or to supplement ventilation, schools can filter the air with
portable air cleaners with high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters.280,281 When
selecting a portable air cleaner with a HEPA filter, school staff should consider the size
of the room, the clean air delivery rate of the unit, the airflow pattern of the room, the
distribution of people in the room, and decibel or sound rating of the device.281
(3) Move large gatherings to outdoor spaces
Holding large gatherings of students and staff outdoors can greatly reduce the risk of
airborne disease transmission.280 This may include assemblies, lunch, certain classes
(e.g., physical education, music, theater), and recess or social periods.280,281 New
construction can include shaded outdoor green space to accommodate outdoor
gatherings in warmer weather in accordance with climate model projections indicating
warmer temperatures and more frequent heat waves in Massachusetts throughout the
21st century in Massachusetts.22
(4) Teach and reinforce respiratory etiquette
Schools should teach and reinforce respiratory etiquette to reduce the amount of
airborne pathogens expelled by individuals who may be sick.280 CDC recommends
covering the mouth and nose with a tissue when coughing or sneezing, throwing the
used tissue in the trash, and then washing hands. If a tissue is not available, coughing
or sneezing into the elbow is better than into the hands. Teachers should provide
tissues in easily accessible areas around the classroom.280 Encourage students and
staff to wash hands frequently, especially after coughing, sneezing, or blowing their
nose. Good hygiene practices, such as hand-washing, help to prevent the spread of
illness as well as ingestion of contaminants like PCBs or lead that may end up on hands
(see best practice (10) Teach and reinforce good hand-washing etiquette, particularly
before eating and drinking in the Reduce Exposure to Polychlorinated Biphenyls [PCBs]
section).
During Times of Illness
The last two recommendations here apply during times of illness, whether for a sick
individual or for a school community at large.
(5) Encourage students and staff to stay home when sick
When students or staff members are sick, school administrators should encourage them
to stay home while they are contagious.281 105 CMR 300.00 provides minimum periods
200
VII. Additional Details Related to Goal 2: Achieve Healthy Schools

of isolation, which includes staying home from school, for some illnesses transmissible
through air, such as measles and pertussis.282
(6) Take additional steps to minimize transmission during times of elevated rates
of illness
During periods of increased illness in a school, as indicated by high rates of
absenteeism, or during an epidemic, pandemic, or public health emergency, the CDC or
the DPH may recommend additional steps to reduce airborne transmission of disease in
schools.283 These could include wearing masks or respiratory protection, physically
distancing students and staff within classrooms, and grouping students in cohorts to
minimize the spread of disease throughout the community, monitoring for signs and
symptoms of illness, testing if available, and creating spaces where sick students can
isolate while waiting to leave school.283 Other strategies to reduce airborne transmission
of disease in schools may include staggering arrival/dismissal times, transition times,
and lunch times; holding staff or parent-teacher meetings via videoconferencing; and
providing additional protections for people at higher risk of severe disease.281
Statutes, Regulations, and Standards
Statutes, regulations, and standards that include a focus on airborne transmission of
respiratory disease and illness are detailed below.
Relevant Regulations
105 CMR 300.00: Reportable Diseases, Surveillance, and Isolation and Quarantine
Requirements describes isolation and quarantine requirements for certain infectious
diseases, which would apply to schools. Any students or staff with diseases listed here
with isolation or quarantine requirements would need to comply by staying home as
required by this law. Infections transmitted through the air that have isolation and
quarantine requirements include measles and pertussis.282

2a(2) Prevent Exposure to Asbestos
Methods and Best Practices
This section summarizes methods and best practices for preventing exposure to
asbestos across three areas: preparation; continual monitoring and exposure mitigation;
and exposure mitigation during renovations or abatement.
202
VII. Additional Details Related to Goal 2: Achieve Healthy Schools

Preparation (Education and Planning)
(1) Develop an Asbestos Management Plan (AMP) in accordance with the
Asbestos Hazard Emergency Response Act and 454 CMR 28.00
As required by the Asbestos Hazard Emergency Response Act (AHERA) and 454 CMR
28.00, districts must have school buildings, porticos, and roof mounted ventilation
components inspected for ACM, then prepare an AMP to prevent and reduce asbestos
hazards in school buildings.99,101,284,285 The MA Department of Labor Standards (DLS)
uses EPA’s model AMP for schools, which is available for schools to use on the DLS
and EPA websites (see list of resources in Table 61).286 In accordance with AHERA and
454 CMR 28.00, the AMP should specify a “designated person” to oversee asbestos-
related activities in the school.286 Table 30 includes Massachusetts resources that may
be helpful for the designated person. Once developed, schools should store the AMP on
site and keep it up to date. The plan should also include records of relevant events such
as response actions, training, and inspections.287
(2) Provide easy access to and training for the effective implementation of the
AMP
School leaders should confirm that all O&M staff thoroughly understand the AMP and
how to minimize asbestos exposure. This may require training on the AMP, review, and
frequently sharing the AMP. The AMP should be available to anyone who is interested
without restricitons.101,287
Continual Monitoring and Exposure Mitigation
(3) Inspect schools for ACM every three years
Schools should be inspected for ACM by licensed asbestos inspectors in compliance
with 454 CMR 28.00. A licensed inspector should re-inspect ACM at least every six
months, as required by 454 CMR 28.00, to look for any changes in the condition of the
materials and any suspected ACM not previously identified.100,284,287
(4) Label all ACM
All ACM should be prominently labeled.287 They typically do not need to be removed
unless severely damaged or disturbed, but should be identifiable.101
(5) Train staff to report any asbestos exposure risks to the building administrator
Train staff about common locations of and procedures for identifying ACM. Urge staff to
report any concerns about damage or deterioration of ACM to the school building
administrator.101
203
VII. Additional Details Related to Goal 2: Achieve Healthy Schools

(6) Conduct asbestos response actions to reduce exposure risk in accordance
with AHERA and 454 CMR 28.00
In accordance with 454 CMR 28.00, response actions must be consistent with the
assessment.288 Minimizing the risks of asbestos, as mandated by AHERA, is based on
the principle of “in-place” management. The goal of this approach is to teach people to
recognize and monitor ACM, then manage it as necessary without removing it. Removal
is not usually necessary unless the ACM is severely damaged or disturbed, which may
happen during a major renovation project or during an incident such as a burst pipe or
flooding event.101,284,285 Air clearance monitoring must be conducted after a response
action.288
Exposure Mitigation During Renovations or Abatement
(7) Minimize disturbance of ACM during renovations or conduct appropriate
abatement actions
Before undertaking renovations, school personnel should review the AMP and location
of any ACM.100,287 Schools should create barriers so that ACM is not touched during
renovations or should take appropriate abatement actions. Abatement procedures
should be included in the design of the renovation project.100 All renovations must be
completed in compliance with National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants
(NESHAP), which requires that schools notify the appropriate state agency before any
demolition or renovation of buildings with a certain amount of ACM. In Massachusetts,
schools should contact MassDEP and DLS at least 10 business days before conducting
renovations that involve ACM or, in the case of an emergency project, within one
working day after the project begins.100,287
(8) Schedule renovations or asbestos abatement activities when students and
staff are not in the building
Renovations that involve ACM or asbestos abatement activities should not occur when
students or staff are in the building. Schools should schedule renovations outside the
school year or during school breaks, unless in emergency situations.100,288
(9) Confirm safe air quality sampling results prior to allowing students and staff
to return to the building
After completing renovations involving ACM or asbestos abatement activities, schools
must contract for asbestos clearance air monitoring in accordance with 454 CMR 28.00.
Students and staff should only be allowed back into the building once the air has been
cleared of asbestos.289
204
VII. Additional Details Related to Goal 2: Achieve Healthy Schools

Statutes, Regulations, and Standards
Statutes, regulations, and standards that include a focus on exposure to asbestos are
detailed below.
Relevant Regulations
310 CMR 7.15 U Asbestos applies to anyone engaged in or associated with asbestos
abatement activities, including surveys, visual inspections, and record-keeping.290 The
regulation specifies how to conduct asbestos-related activities. Prior to renovations,
facility operators are required to have an asbestos inspector identify any ACM that may
be affected and prepare the findings in a written asbestos survey report, as described in
4) Survey Requirements.290 The facility operators must remove or encapsulate ACM
during demolition or renovation. Facility operators are required to notify MassDEP of
ACM and obtain authorization before conducting any asbestos abatement activities
unless any exceptions described in 6) Notification Requirements apply.290 The
regulation includes specific requirements for working with ACM found in certain types of
materials such as asphaltic roofing, siding materials, window glaze or caulking, cement
pipes, floor tiles, and gypsum wallboard. Requirements for worker safety, packaging of
removed ACM, and labeling of ACM are also described.290
454 CMR 28.00: The Removal, Containment, Maintenance, or Encapsulation of
Asbestos protects the health and safety of workers and the public from asbestos.284 It
establishes health and safety requirements for when dealing with ACM and standards
for competency, certification, and licensure for those who work with ACM.284 All schools
subject to the Asbestos Hazard Emergency Response Act (AHERA) must comply with
section 28.13, which describes how local education agencies must:
• Develop an asbestos management plan
• Ensure that any asbestos-related activities are carried out in compliance with
these laws and regulations
• Designate a person to implement requirements
• Inspect each school building unless they have documentation of a recent
inspection compliant with AHERA
• Implement appropriate response actions
• Adhere to the law for all operation and management of buildings with ACM
• Maintain records of ACM and asbestos-related activities284
Asbestos-Containing Materials in Schools Rule requires schools to develop an
AMP, conduct inspections every three years to determine the presence of ACM, and
take steps to prevent or reduce exposure to asbestos.100,285

2a(3) Reduce Exposure to Carbon Monoxide
Methods and Best Practices
This section summarizes the methods and best practices for reducing exposure to
carbon monoxide in schools in two areas: planning and management; and technical
interventions.
Planning and Management
The following recommendations involve planning measures and interventions to monitor
carbon monoxide.
(1) Annually inventory and inspect all gas-burning appliances
Carbon monoxide is produced by appliances which use combustion to generate energy.
Incomplete combustion results in more carbon monoxide. To prevent excess carbon
monoxide from being released at schools, it is best practice to annually inspect all gas
burning appliances, including stoves, furnaces, and water heaters, to confirm they are
working properly and are ventilated to the outside.101
(2) Install carbon monoxide alarms near fossil fuel-fired appliances
Carbon monoxide alarms should be installed, at a minimum, near all appliances that
burn natural gas, oil, wood, or gas.101 Carbon monoxide alarms are devices that can
warn of excess carbon monoxide and allow schools to mitigate the carbon monoxide
before building occupants are exposed to high levels. Schools should consider carbon
monoxide alarms that can detect and store carbon monoxide levels and integrate the
warning equipment into the school’s central monitoring system. Carbon monoxide
alarms should be installed near sources of combustion, as these spaces have a greater
risk of elevated carbon monoxide due to malfunctioning equipment or inadequate
ventilation.104 DPH also recommends installing sensor technology in classrooms that
measure carbon monoxide as a best practice.
207
VII. Additional Details Related to Goal 2: Achieve Healthy Schools

(3) Restrict school buses and other vehicles from idling directly outside of the
school
Carbon monoxide is a byproduct of gas or diesel combustion in vehicles. Avoid vehicle
idling directly outside of the school, particularly where products of combustion, including
carbon monoxide, can be drawn into the school through air handling intakes, windows,
or exit doors.101,104 See the Reduce Exposure to Emissions from School Bus Idling
section for additional details about best practices on this topic.
Technical Interventions
The following methods and best practices concern school equipment and equipment
operations.
(4) Ensure negative pressure in rooms where carbon monoxide is likely to be
generated
Rooms with certain equipment, like kitchens, science laboratories, and vocational
classrooms, are more likely to contain equipment that can generate carbon monoxide.
Ventilation in these rooms should be operated at negative pressure compared to
surrounding rooms (i.e., the air is removed at a greater rate) so that carbon monoxide
does not spread to other areas in the school. This can be done by adjusting
components of the mechanical ventilation or by installing local exhaust ventilation.
Ventilation in these rooms should be maintained such that it complies with other
guidelines.104
(5) Remove or replace any unvented gas or kerosene space heaters
While uncommon in schools, removing any unvented gas or kerosene space heaters
and restricting their use by contractors is essential. Incomplete combustion of these
fuels will lead to the formation of carbon monoxide and lack of ventilation will allow
carbon monoxide to accumulate. If the heaters are used as a primary heat source,
replace them with electric or vented, code-compliant heating systems.104
Statutes, Regulations, and Standards
Statutes, regulations, and standards that include a focus on exposure to carbon
monoxide are detailed below.
Relevant Regulations
105 CMR 675 establishes a corrective action air level of 30 parts per million (ppm) for
carbon monoxide in indoor ice staking rinks with ice resurfacing machinery powered by
combustible fuels. The same regulation establishes an evacuation air level of 125 ppm
for carbon monoxide.291
NAAQS for carbon monoxide: EPA sets National Ambient Air Quality Standards
(NAAQS) for six pollutants, including carbon monoxide, to protect public health and the
208
VII. Additional Details Related to Goal 2: Achieve Healthy Schools

environment. The current NAAQS for carbon monoxide are an eight-hour time-weighted
average of 9 ppm and a one-hour time-weighted average of 35 ppm.292
Permissible Exposure Level: The Occupational Safety and Health Administration
(OSHA) has established the permissible exposure level (PEL) for carbon monoxide as
an eight-hour time-weighted average concentration of 50 ppm. This is established in
CFR Title 29, Part 1910, Subpart Z.293
Relevant Standards
American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) Threshold
Limit Values (TLVs) recommends a TLV as an eight-hour time-weighted average
concentration of 25 ppm.294
ASHRAE 62.1: ASHRAE uses EPA’s one-hour NAAQS for carbon monoxide as a
component in their guidelines for “Ventilation and Acceptable Indoor Air Quality.”295
DPH IAQ Assessment Manual states that carbon monoxide should not be present in a
typical indoor environment. If present, carbon monoxide levels should be less than or
equal to outdoor levels.296

(1) Choose materials that will control moisture
During construction or renovation projects, review the types of materials chosen and
select those that will control moisture in areas which may be prone to wetness or
humidity (e.g., insulation, sealant, basement moisture barriers). For example, use
nonporous or moisture-resistant materials in areas that are likely to become wet
frequently, like around water fountains or bathrooms.104 Use proper moisture barriers in
roofing systems and repairs and in the foundation.104 Also, below-grade space should
not be converted to occupied space if it is subject to chronic dampness.298

maintenance of school buildings.
(4) Maintain interior relative humidity levels below 60 percent
High humidity encourages mold growth. Indoor relative humidity should be maintained
at a level below 60 percent, but ideally between 30–50 percent.100,101,104 Humidity levels
can be maintained using an HVAC system or dehumidifiers. Schools can measure
indoor relative humidity with hygrometers; these devices range from low-cost handheld
instruments that can be carried from room-to-room, to devices integrated into building
systems that can transmit readings to centralized building monitoring systems and
create alerts when humidity is outside of the target range. Hygrometers are often paired
with thermometers to measure temperature. Sensors should be re-calibrated quarterly
or according to the manufacturer’s specification.

(5) Maintain a properly balanced HVAC system
A balanced, properly sealed HVAC system will maintain the indoor climate at an
appropriate temperature and humidity, thus reducing mold and moisture issues.298
Positive pressure can help reduce moisture intrusion into the building envelope.104
(6) Clean any wet or damp areas within 48 hours and promptly repair all observed
leaks
When wet or damp areas are discovered, dry and clean the area within 48
hours.100,299,300 Investigate the cause of the wet or damp spots and fix any leaks or
problems that led to the water buildup.101 This will help to prevent the growth of mold.100
(7) Perform regular checks for condensation, wet spots, and signs of mold
Routinely check the school for areas of condensation, wet spots, and signs of mold.
Proactively searching can help to prevent mold or stop moldy areas from expanding.101
Areas prone to moisture or leaks should be prioritized. BCEH recommends that schools
inspect below-grade spaces in school buildings at least quarterly, as well as after heavy
rainfall or snowmelt, for evidence of water penetration or water damage.
(8) Consider using dehumidifiers
When other ventilation systems are insufficient or for buildings without an HVAC
system, use dehumidifiers to reduce humidity to 30–60 percent.104,299 Dehumidifiers
may be necessary when HVAC systems are undergoing maintenance, outdoor heat and
humidity levels are unusually high, or after activities like carpet cleaning introduce extra
moisture into the school building.104 If sinks or drains are available, configure
dehumidifiers to empty directly into the sinks/drains to reduce maintenance and prevent
mold growth and associated odors.
Remediation
When mold has already grown in a school building, it must be properly cleaned to avoid
exposing students and staff to the mold as much as possible and to prevent recurrence.
Implement the following methods and best practices when mold is found at a school.
(9) Contain and do not disturb areas with significant mold until they can be
remediated
Disturbing mold can cause spores to become airborne and increase the likelihood of
exposure among building occupants. To prevent this, when significant amounts of mold
are found, contain the area and do not disturb the mold until proper remediation is
arranged.104 Remediate mold and damaged materials as quickly as possible. In
addition, if mold growth is severe, it should be removed outside of school hours to avoid
student exposure.100
212
VII. Additional Details Related to Goal 2: Achieve Healthy Schools

(10) Clean small areas of mold with proper cleaning supplies
Mold can be removed from hard surfaces by scrubbing with water and the appropriate
cleaning supplies.101,299 Where possible, use “green” cleaning products and dry the
surface completely after cleaning. Note that some cleaning products, such as bleach,
can trigger asthma attacks.299 Do not paint or caulk over mold without cleaning or
removing the mold and ensuring that the cause of the mold is addressed.100
(11) Repair or replace moldy ceiling tiles and carpet
Porous and slow-drying materials such as carpet or ceiling tiles with mold growth should
be replaced or repaired.299 These types of materials are difficult to rid of mold once it
has started growing, and often the most foolproof and cost effective way to address
mold in carpets or ceiling tiles is to replace them.
Statutes, Regulations, and Standards
There are currently no federal or state standards to determine a safe or unsafe amount
of mold.

2a(5) Reduce Exposure to PCBs
Methods and Best Practices
The methods and best practices described here cover identifying and removing PCBs
from schools, considerations during renovations and repairs, and simple steps to reduce
exposure to PCBs found in air and dust.
214
VII. Additional Details Related to Goal 2: Achieve Healthy Schools

Identify and Remove Sources of PCBs
This section describes how to identify and remove PCBs from schools, starting with an
inventory of potential PCB-containing materials and continuing with best practices for
removing, encapsulating, and disposing of PCBs.
(1) Conduct an inventory of possible locations of PCB-containing materials
The first step in determining whether students and staff at a school are at risk of PCB
exposure is determining where PCBs ≥50 ppm may be present in building materials.
There is no visual standard for determining whether or not PCBs are present in building
materials, but inspecting schools for potential sources of PCBs is a good place to
start.301,302 EPA recommends developing an inventory of all materials in the building that
may contain PCBs. Historical records can help identify materials, areas, or parts of the
school that were constructed or renovated between 1950 and 1979 or shortly after, and,
therefore may contain PCBs.301,302
PCBs have frequently been found in and around window and door frames, on surfaces,
within expansion joints, and in areas subject to high heat or fires, such as boiler
rooms.301,302 Potential manufactured PCB products that may be present in schools
include:
• Paint, varnishes, and lacquers
• Non-conducting materials in electrical cables (e.g., plastic and rubber)
• Rubber and felt gaskets
• Coal-tar enamel coatings (e.g., pipe coating) and rust inhibitor coatings
• Insulation materials (e.g., fiberglass, felt, foam, and cork)
• Adhesives and tapes
• Caulk, grout, and joint material (e.g., putty, silicon, and bitumen)
• Pipe hangers
• Plastic applications, including vinyl and polyvinyl chloride
• Galbestos siding
• Mastics
• Acoustic ceiling and floor tiles
• Asphalt roofing and tar paper
• Synthetic resins and floor varnish
• Sprayed-on fireproofing301
• Fluorescent light ballasts101
215
VII. Additional Details Related to Goal 2: Achieve Healthy Schools

Fluorescent light ballasts (FLBs) manufactured before 1979 are another common
source of PCBs in schools.104,303 PCBs can be found in the
FLB capacitors and interior potting material of old magnetic Check FLBs for
T12 lighting fixtures.303 FLBs manufactured between 1978 and PCBs

unless the manufacturer can confirm otherwise.104,303
(2) Conduct PCB sampling to confirm presence of PCBs
If leaders suspect that PCBs are present in school building materials, then schools
should test the air and surfaces around the potential sources of PCBs to determine
whether PCB exposure is occurring.106,301 If PCBs are present in an intact material, such
as caulking that is not deteriorating, then no appreciable PCB exposure or health effects
would be expected.106 If caulking or other PCB-containing materials are deteriorating or
damaged, then air and surface wipe testing near the source is recommended.106 Similar
testing should be conducted in an area without deteriorating caulking to use as a
comparison.106 The results of this testing can inform abatement activities, cleaning
procedures, and the implementation of other measures to reduce exposure. 106,301
Following the inventory of potential PCB-containing materials, the building operator may
choose to assume that they contain PCBs ≥ 50 ppm or test the composition of the
potential PCB-containing materials.301 If a school chooses to test materials, EPA
recommends developing a building material sampling plan that considers current and
future building use as well as remediation goals.301 When testing for PCBs present in
building materials, it is also important to consider porous materials that surround the
materials that contain PCBs.301 The EPA Technical Guidance for Determining the
Presence of Manufactured PCB Products in Buildings and Other Structures can be used
as a guide for sampling site selection, collection, and analysis.302 DPH does not
recommend disturbing intact materials for testing, as available data suggest that no
appreciable exposure is likely from intact materials containing PCBs.106 Information
about exposure can be determined through air and surface wipe testing as described
above.106 A consultant can be hired to conduct surface wipe testing or testing can be
done by school personnel and sent to an analytical laboratory. EPA’s regional office can
help identify contractors or laboratories for testing (see Table 67 for relevant contact
information for EPA Region 1, which encompasses Massachusetts).
216
VII. Additional Details Related to Goal 2: Achieve Healthy Schools

(3) Remove building materials with PCBs ≥50 ppm
The most effective way to reduce PCB exposure or risk of future exposure is to remove
materials that contain PCBs ≥ 50 ppm or that are assumed to contain the regulated
level of PCBs.109 Caulk and other building materials with PCBs should be removed by
personnel wearing appropriate PPE, following procedures

TSCA.110,304 Any oil and stains leaked from
FLBs with PCBs must also be cleaned up or
disposed of in accordance with TSCA.104,110 Schools should select an experienced
contractor or facilities staff person to remove PCB-containing FLBs and decontaminate
the surrounding area.303 In preparation for removal, the area should be isolated from the
rest of the building and ventilated separately; workers should wear proper PPE, and
furniture under the fixtures should be removed.303
(5) Consider encapsulation of PCBs to reduce exposure
Encapsulation is the practice of painting a contaminated surface with a barrier coating
that prevents the release of PCBs from the painted material.305 Encapsulation may be
helpful to reduce PCB emissions from sources contaminated by PCB-containing
materials once the PCB materials have been removed.304 For example, materials that
were touching PCB-contaminated caulking or paint could be possible sites for
encapsulation.304 Encapsulation is only suitable for building materials with low PCB
contents. Properties of the coating, properties of the source building materials,
environmental conditions, and mitigation goals must be considered when determining
whether encapsulation is appropriate.305 EPA recommends contacting your regional
PCB coordinator because the applicability of encapsulation can vary on a case-by-case
217
VII. Additional Details Related to Goal 2: Achieve Healthy Schools

basis.304 Post-encapsulation monitoring with either air or surface wipe sampling will
show whether the encapsulation was effective.305
EPA researchers tested the efficacy of ten coatings used for PCB encapsulation and
found that the three epoxy coatings performed better than the other coating materials.305
Generally, coatings that have smaller material/air partition coefficients and smaller
diffusion coefficients for PCBs are better at reducing PCB emissions.305 However, no
coatings are truly impenetrable to PCBs, so encapsulation may not meet the mitigation
goals of every situation.305
Renovations and Repairs
Schools planning renovations and repairs should consider the best practices described
here when planning for and carrying out the projects.
(6) Remove PCB-containing materials disturbed during renovations and repairs
and minimize PCB exposure
When undertaking normal renovations or repairs, school leaders and those planning for
renovations or repairs should consider whether caulk or other building materials that
contain PCBs may be disturbed.104,304 EPA recommends using planning renovations
and repairs as opportunities to remove PCB-containing materials (see Remove building
materials with PCBs ≥50 ppm in compliance with TSCA).304 Even if not removed,
renovations that affect PCB-containing
materials require additional caution. If PCBs EPA’s Steps to Safe Renovation

renovations, isolating the area undergoing
renovations, regularly wet-mopping renovation areas, modifying the HVAC system to
keep PCBs in the affected part of the building, and taking precautions to protect
workers. Once materials containing PCBs ≥50 ppm are removed, they must be handled
and discarded properly in accordance with TSCA waste disposal requirements.104,110
Schools should maintain all documentation of PCB testing results (if tested), sampling
locations, disposal measures, disposal companies used, and final destination of waste
materials.104
(7) Follow EPA recommended steps for cleanup and decontamination if a PCB-
containing FLB leaks, smokes, or catches fire
If an FLB that contains PCBs leaks, smokes, or catches fire, then the school must
properly remove and dispose of the fixture and clean up the surrounding area.303 EPA
recommends that only experienced contractors or facilities staff should remove, clean
up, and decontaminate areas around FLBs that leak, smoke, or catch fire.303 The
218
VII. Additional Details Related to Goal 2: Achieve Healthy Schools

process should begin with preparation of the space, including isolating the affected area
from the central ventilation system, ventilating the area separately, moving furniture and
other objects out from under the fixture and covering them with plastic sheets, and
turning off light switches and fuses or breakers.303 Workers should wear appropriate
PPE.303 EPA describes detailed steps for inspection of damaged FLBs, removal and
disposal of FLBs and other materials contaminated with PCBs, and cleanup of PCBs
spilled in the surrounding areas.
(8) Follow EPA recommended steps when performing a retrofit for non-leaking
PCB-containing FLBs
Even when performing a retrofit of undamaged PCB-containing FLBs, schools should
follow EPA-recommended steps.303 This applies to retrofits as part of other renovations
and repairs or in an effort to remove all PCB-containing FLBs. EPA recommends that
only experienced contractors or facilities staff should perform the lighting retrofit.303 EPA
describes detailed steps for removing and disposing of PCB-containing FLBs.
Reduce PCB Exposure Through Air and Dust
Given that it may not always be possible to identify all PCB sources or remove PCBs
immediately, it is important to take steps in ventilation and cleaning to reduce PCB
exposure through air and dust.
(9) Regularly inspect and maintain ventilation systems for proper operations
While the strategies described above can be used to reduce or remove PCB hazards,
not all schools may be ready to undertake full PCB removal, and removal may not mean
all residual PCBs are gone from school buildings. As a result, it is important to consider
strategies to reduce exposure to PCBs through air and dust.109,304 One common route of
PCB exposure is through inhalation into the lungs.109 Increasing ventilation to remove
indoor air containing PCBs and bring outdoor air into the building reduces inhalation
exposure to PCBs.109 Schools should confirm that ventilation systems are operating
properly, regularly inspected, and maintained according to system manufacturer
instructions and guidelines.109,304 EPA recommends use of ANSI/ASHRAE/Air
Conditioning Contractors of America (ACCA) Standard 180-2012—Standard Practice
for Inspection and Maintenance of Commercial Building HVAC Systems.304 If system
cleaning is needed, EPA recommends following ANSI/ACCA Standard 6–Restoring the
Cleanliness of HVAC Systems (2007).304 In addition to creating a healthy learning
environment, a well-operating HVAC system also contributes to energy efficiency and
climate resilience (see Objective 1a. Decarbonize Buildings and Objective 1f. Enhance
Climate Resilience for additional details about these co-benefits).
(10) Teach and reinforce good hand-washing etiquette, particularly before eating
and drinking
Another common route of exposure is through ingestion of PCBs in dust found on
surfaces and hands.109 Students and staff should wash hands with soap and water
frequently, particularly before eating and drinking.101,109,304 In classrooms with younger
219
VII. Additional Details Related to Goal 2: Achieve Healthy Schools

children, staff should regularly wash toys and frequently touched objects with soap and
water.101,109,304 In addition to preventing the accidental ingestion of PCBs, good hygiene
practices such as hand-washing can prevent the accidental ingestion of other
contaminants, such as lead, that may end up on hands, as well as prevent the spread of
illness (see best practice (4) Teach and reinforce respiratory etiquette under Reduce
Airborne Transmission of Disease)
(11) Reduce dust while cleaning
During some cleaning practices dust containing PCBs can be resuspended into the air.
In buildings with known or suspected PCBs, cleaning staff should help reduce PCB
exposure by using vacuums with HEPA filters and cleaning surfaces, including floors,
walls, and window sills regularly with wet microfiber mops and cloths.101,109,304 Cleaning
staff should not sweep with dry brooms or dust with dry dusters or cloths, as both can
resuspend PCBs in dust into the air.101,109,304
Statutes, Regulations, and Standards
This section summarizes the regulation that governs PCB testing and removal as well
as the standard oral reference dose (RfD) recommended for schools.
Relevant Regulations
40 CFR § 761: Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) – PCBs Manufacturing,
Processing, Distribution in Commerce, and Use Prohibitions prohibits PCB production
and establishes requirements for the manufacture, processing, distribution, use,
disposal, storage, and marking of items containing PCBs.110 Several subparts may be
relevant for schools managing, cleaning up, or disposing of PCBs:
40 CFR § 761.60: Disposal and 40 CFR § 761.62: Disposal of PCB Bulk Product
Waste describe appropriate ways to dispose of waste that contains PCBs. If schools
are undertaking renovations to remove PCBs, they are responsible for properly
disposing of PCBs whether in caulk, fluorescent light ballasts, or other sources in
accordance with 40 CFR § 761. 106,110,303
40 CFR § 761.65: Storage for Disposal describes how waste containing PCBs must
be stored while awaiting disposal.110,303
40 CFR § 761.125: Requirements for PCB Spill Cleanup pertains to all spills of PCBs
at concentrations of 50 ppm or greater.110 If such a spill were to occur at a school, for
example, from broken fluorescent light ballasts that contain PCBs, the school would
have to report, clean up, and certify clean up from the spill in compliance with 40 CFR §
761.125.110,303
Relevant Standards
Exposure Levels for Evaluating PCBs in Indoor School Air and the Oral RfD: EPA
has defined the oral RfD of PCBs as 20 ng PCB/kg body weight per day. The RfD is the
220
VII. Additional Details Related to Goal 2: Achieve Healthy Schools

estimated dose of daily exposure that is unlikely to have an appreciable risk of harmful
health effects during a lifetime.306 Considering all exposure pathways in school and non-
school settings, EPA calculated indoor air concentrations of PCBs that would result in
an estimated total PCB exposure equal to the RfD by age group, assuming other school
and non-school exposures were average background levels.306 Acceptable
concentrations in indoor air may vary by school and other background exposures.306
The exposure levels for evaluating PCBs in school indoor air are outlined in Table 65.
Table 65. Exposure Levels for Evaluating PCBs in School Indoor Air by Age
Age Exposure Levels for Evaluating PCBs
in School Indoor Air (ng/m3)
1 to <2 yr 100
2 to < 3 yr 100

12 to < 15 yr (middle school) 500
15 to <19 yr (high school) 600
19+ yr (adult) 500
EPA recommends that these indoor air concentrations be used as a guide for thoughtful
evaluation of indoor air quality in schools, not strict criteria. PCBs in indoor air should be
as low as reasonably achievable, and total exposure should remain below the RfD.306

2a(6) Reduce Exposure to Radon
Methods and Best Practices
This section covers methods and best practices for the overall radon planning, testing,
and mitigation process. Some of these steps will be carried out by school staff, others
by certified radon mitigation professionals, but all will be organized and managed by
school or district personnel. The second section describes specific technical
interventions, most of which will be performed by radon mitigation professionals, to
reduce radon exposure in schools.
Planning and Management
This section includes a series of methods and best practices for planning for and
managing radon testing and mitigation in schools in both new and existing buildings.
The best practices are arranged somewhat chronologically, beginning with
considerations for new school construction (when relevant), then moving on to testing
for radon, developing a mitigation plan, taking mitigation action, communicating with the
school community, retesting for radon, maintaining records, and ensuring continuity.
(1) Consider radon in the design and construction of new school buildings
Rather than having to mitigate radon retroactively, it is best to consider radon in the
process of constructing new schools.183 The design and construction of new schools
should follow Soil Gas Control Systems in New Construction of Multifamily, School,
Commercial and Mixed-Use Buildings – Rev. 5/23 (ANSI/American Association of
Radon Scientists and Technologists (AARST) CC-1000-2018-0523) for incorporating
radon controls into new construction.
(2) Have certified personnel test all schools for radon
EPA recommends testing all schools for radon.307 Qualified professionals certified by
either the National Radon Safety Board (NRSB) or AARST’s National Radon Proficiency
Program (NRPP) should perform radon tests.183,308

have demand-controlled ventilation
systems may require special attention
during testing, as their ventilation rates
vary with occupancy. Assume a minimum outdoor air ventilation rate based on the
minimum expected occupancy when testing these spaces.104
(3) Develop and implement a radon reduction plan
Planning where, when, and how to test and mitigate radon is a critical step before a
school takes action. If schools have a larger approach to improving indoor air quality or
environmental health, a radon reduction plan should be incorporated into that.307
Schools may want to consult with the DPH Radon Assessment Unit (RAU) on specific
steps for their school. This planning phase can include identifying possible funding
sources and planning short- and long-term steps for radon reduction.307
(4) Take action to mitigate radon if levels are above or approaching EPA action
levels
EPA’s action level for radon (described under Relevant Standards) is 4 piC/L. However,
buildings should also consider mitigation if levels are between 2 and 4 piC/L.309 The
main action to mitigate radon levels is to install a radon mitigation system, which
removes air from indoor spaces and reduces radon exposure.101 Technical strategies to
mitigate radon are described below in 9, 10, and 11.
(5) Educate and communicate information to parents, students, and staff
Schools should communicate with parents, students, and staff regarding radon in their
building and the steps they take for mitigation.100 Schools should explain the importance
of testing and the link between radon and building operations; encourage parents to test
their homes for radon; share their radon reduction plan (#2 above); include teachers in
your testing process; and encourage teachers to incorporate radon-related science
projects into the classroom.307 It is also important to educate maintenance and facilities
staff about radon and how to identify radon risks.307
224
VII. Additional Details Related to Goal 2: Achieve Healthy Schools

(6) Periodically retest areas of the school after mitigation
Even after radon mitigation interventions, radon testing continues to be important,
particularly if any renovations occur. NE-CHPS suggests that radon should be tested at
least every two years after you implement mitigation interventions.183 After any
renovation, the flow of indoor air can change, and EPA recommends retesting for
radon.100,104 Changes to the building envelope or mechanical ventilation systems, in
particular, can affect indoor radon levels.104
(7) Maintain records of ongoing radon testing and radon mitigation system
Schools should maintain records of radon testing before and after mitigation, as well as
records related to their mitigation system.100 Review records as needed. When doing
renovations, keep radon reduction methods in mind while designing the renovation, or
leave existing mitigation systems in place.100
(8) Maintain continuity of the school’s radon mitigation plan
After mitigating radon, schools should evaluate the success of their radon mitigation
plan and program and find ways to continually improve. Determine if the school needs
additional testing or mitigation and follow up with the necessary steps. Schedule future
retesting with a certified professional. Consider how ongoing HVAC maintenance or
upgrades may affect radon in the building.307
Technical Interventions
This section covers technical interventions to mitigate radon exposure, some of which
should be performed by a certified radon mitigation professional.
(9) Install a radon mitigation system
Schools should hire a certified radon mitigation contractor to install a radon mitigation
system.307 Confirm that the contractor is certified through the NRSB or NRPP.183,308 A
radon mitigation system should follow the standards of practice described above in
Relevant Standards. In general, most mitigation systems use a fan to create suction
under the building’s slab, which is called sub-slab depressurization. The radon gas is
then forced up through a pipe and released outside.308
(10) Seal cracks and joints in concrete floors
Sealing cracks and joints in concrete floors may be a key part of the radon mitigation
system to prevent radon from entering from the ground below.104,308
(11) Provide ventilation using a properly balanced HVAC system
A building’s HVAC system can be operated to help reduce indoor radon concentrations.
A properly balanced HVAC system that maintains positive pressurization indoors can
reduce the intrusion of underground contaminants such as radon into the building.104
225
VII. Additional Details Related to Goal 2: Achieve Healthy Schools

HVAC systems should be maintained regularly and balanced upon beginning
operations, when there is a problem, or when there is a change in operations (e.g.,
every five years).
Statutes, Regulations, and Standards
This section describes an EPA action level at which schools should take steps to
mitigate radon as well as building standards pertaining to radon in schools.
Relevant Standards
EPA Action Level recommends that buildings with radon levels at or above this level
take steps to mitigate radon. Because there is no known safe level of radon exposure,
EPA also recommends that building owners consider radon mitigation when radon
levels are between 2 pCi/L and 4 pCi/L.309
Protocol for Conducting Measurements of Radon and Radon Decay Products in
Multifamily, School, Commercial and Mixed-Use Buildings (ANSI/AARST MA-MFLB-
2023) specifies procedures and minimum requirements when measuring radon
concentrations in structures such as schools to determine if radon mitigation is
necessary. MA-MFLB 2023 consolidates ANSI/AARST MAMF (rev. 1/21) and
ANSI/AARST MALB (rev. 1/21) into one publication. Compliance with this standard was
effective December 1, 2023.310
Soil Gas Control Systems in New Construction of Multifamily, School, Commercial and
Mixed-Use Buildings–Rev. 5/23 (ANSI/AARST CC-1000-2018-0523) provides
prescriptive minimum requirements for new construction, including of schools, to reduce
exposure to radon and other hazardous soil gases. First published in 2017, this
standard of practice was updated in 2023 for clarity and improvements such as making
inspections during construction required rather than optional; clarifying qualified
professionals needed; clarifying products to use for creating an air barrier between soil
and indoor air; and integrating vapor intrusion design features into relevant sections.
This standard should be used in the planning and construction of new school
buildings.310
Soil Gas Mitigation Standards for Existing Multifamily, School, Commercial and
Mixed-Use Buildings (ANSI/AARST SGM-MFLB-2023) specifies minimum
requirements for methods that mitigate risks posed by radon gas and other chemical
vapors or gases in existing buildings, including schools. SGM-MFLB consolidates the
radon mitigation ANSI/AARST RMS-MF (rev. 12/20) and ANSI/AARST RMS-LB (rev.
12/20) into a single publication and harmonized it with ANSI/AARST SGM-SF (Soil Gas
Mitigation in Existing Homes) for interactive use.310

2a(7) Reduce Exposure to Outdoor Air Pollutants
Methods and Best Practices
This section summarizes methods and best practices to reduce exposure to outdoor air
pollution across two areas: policy and education; and infrastructure.
Policy and Education
Policy and education interventions describe methods or best practices for reducing
exposure to emissions, achieved through increasing awareness of the issue and
creating a policy to reinforce behaviors that reduce exposure.
(1) Educate staff about how outdoor air quality impacts indoor air quality
Educate school staff about how outdoor air pollution can enter the school through open
doorways and windows, and what causes air pollution levels to increase. Empower
school staff and students to react to poor outdoor air pollution. One way to do this is to
implement an air quality flag program to increase awareness of outdoor air quality
among school communities. Schools participating in this type of program will fly a
colored flag that corresponds to EPA’s color-coded Air Quality Index each day. This
program educates students and staff and allows schools to make informed decisions
about exposure to poor outdoor air quality during activities such as recess or sports
practice.311 Schools can use this program to decide when to reduce the impact of poor
outdoor air quality on indoor air by closing doors and windows and increasing air
filtration through a building’s HVAC system.
In addition, school bus operators should receive information about idling and pollution
exposure.183,312 Morning and afternoon traffic periods (i.e., rush hour) are times
associated with higher pollution; schools should educate staff about not opening
windows and doors during these times.313
(2) Enforce a vehicle anti-idling policy
Schools can adopt and enforce a written idling-reduction policy that applies to all
vehicles, including but not limited to school buses, cars, and delivery vehicles.101,314 The
policy should be explained and shared with the school community. Policies should
include limits on the number of minutes that vehicles can idle (i.e., no more than 3–5
minutes).183,287,312
228
VII. Additional Details Related to Goal 2: Achieve Healthy Schools

(3) Create a wildfire smoke readiness plan
A wildfire smoke readiness plan will prepare schools to take action when wildfire smoke
events occur. Plans should include routine evaluation of the HVAC systems and routine
HVAC filter maintenance so the building systems can adequately filter polluted air.
Plans should also include routine assessment of the building envelope to limit wildfire
smoke intrusion.315,316 In addition, plans should specify other ways that the school will
prepare for wildfires, including methods to monitor outdoor air quality threats,
purchasing of equipment to monitor indoor air quality (see the Indoor Air Monitoring text
box for additional details), and a backup plan to supplement HVAC systems should they
not be able to adequately clean the indoor air.315,316
Infrastructure
Infrastructure interventions include methods to reduce exposure to poor outdoor air
quality that can be achieved through physical equipment and changes to the built
environment.
(4) Replace or retrofit legacy school buses
Older school buses typically emit higher levels of PM and other pollutants. Electrifying
school bus fleets will greatly reduce near-school vehicle emissions. See Objective 1d.
Electrify School Bus Fleets for more details about electrifying school bus fleets.
Alternatively, older school busses can be retrofitted with PM filters to reduce vehicle
emissions or replaced with engines that are certified to use alternative, cleaner
fuels.101,101,117
(5) Establish anti-idling zones
Post signage indicating where vehicles are prohibited from idling.104,183,314 This can
reinforce the school’s vehicle anti-idling policy.
(6) Locate passenger pickup and drop-off areas away from air intakes and
classroom windows
If necessary, redesign school bus parking zones to minimize the potential for diesel
exhaust to enter inside the bus or the school. Bus parking areas, passenger pick-up and
drop-off lanes, and any loading docks should be located away from the school building
air intakes.101,104,117,287 Consider other design features that can help minimize exhaust
exposure, including diagonal school bus parking.314
(7) Maintain HVAC systems and filter indoor air
Ensure that HVAC systems are maintained and properly filter any air entering the
school from outside.117,287 Filter systems will clean outside air that may be impacted by
air pollution, including vehicle exhaust, to minimize exposure within the school; air
should be filtered to the highest level of high-efficiency filtration the HVAC system is
designed to handle, and filters should be inspected and replaced quarterly. HVAC
229
VII. Additional Details Related to Goal 2: Achieve Healthy Schools

systems should be run continuously while the building is occupied. In addition, HVAC
systems should be balanced before beginning operation and when there is a change in
operations so as to keep positive pressure within the school; negative pressure can
draw in outdoor contaminants through the building envelope.104,117
(8) Consider sources of outdoor air pollution when siting a new school
Significant air pollution comes from heavily trafficked roadways and can also come from
industrial areas. When deciding where to locate a new school, consider these sources
of air pollution. Air pollution is higher within 500 feet of a major roadway.313
Municipalities and school districts should avoid siting schools immediately adjacent to
highly-traveled roadways and other significant sources of air pollution to the maximum
extent possible.
(9) Consider community- and building-level design elements that mitigate
infiltration of outdoor air pollutants from roadways and industrial areas
Ideally, a school district planning to construct a new school will have the flexibility to
select a site that is removed from heavily trafficked roadways and industrial sites. There
are often circumstances when this is not possible, including school districts located in
densely developed urban areas or instances when a school elects to undergo an in-
place renovation and the existing building is located near a busy roadway and/or
industrial site. If there are limitations that necessitate the siting of a new school in a
location near heavily trafficked roadways or industrial areas, or when a school is
undergoing an in-place renovation, school districts still have options at the community
and building levels to mitigate indoor exposure to outdoor air pollutants from roadways
and industrial areas, including the following:
• Install roadside vegetation barriers (either alone or in combination with solid
noise barriers) to reduce near-road air pollution317
• Locate school building spaces often occupied by people (e.g., classrooms,
playgrounds, athletic fields) further from busy roadways and industrial sites313
See the Mitigate Occurrences of Vapor Intrusion section for additional details about
mitigation strategies for schools located near industrial sites.
Statutes, Regulations, and Standards
Statutes, regulations, and standards that include a focus on outdoor air quality around
schools are detailed below.
Relevant Statutes
M.G.L., c. 90 §16A restricts the operation of motor vehicle engines while stopped in
excess of five minutes.318
230
VII. Additional Details Related to Goal 2: Achieve Healthy Schools

unnecessary idling time and governs the time during which a motor vehicle can idle on
school grounds, in order to improve and protect school campus air quality. Vehicle
operators are not permitted to idle motor vehicles within 100 feet of known and active
school intake systems. All schools must install and maintain permanent “NO IDLING”
signage in a conspicuous location and visible from a distance of 50 feet. All school bus
companies operating within the Commonwealth must inform each of their respective
school bus drivers of the regulation’s requirements and consequences of non-
compliance.

Objective 2b. Improve Water Quality
2b(1) Reduce Exposure to Lead in Drinking Water
Methods and Best Practices
The following best practices aim to identify lead sources in drinking water, create
communication, sampling, and testing plans, and remediate lead contamination drinking
water in schools.
(1) Be familiar with the school’s water source and condition of the school’s
plumbing system
An important first step when dealing with water quality concerns is identifying the
school’s drinking water source.321 Additionally, it is essential to be aware of the condition
of the plumbing system in schools since corroded systems can leach lead.122 It is helpful
to know how water enters and flows through schools and to have documented plumbing
configurations for the building.322 A water professional, such as a qualified plumber, may
be able to assist schools in determining their plumbing configuration, ensure the system
is functioning adequately, and identify lead-based or galvanized service lines and
faucets.287,322
(2) Create a communication plan to notify stakeholders and build partnerships
The only way to know if lead is present in drinking water is to test, though before
developing a sampling plan, it is essential that schools first create a communication
plan.121 The plan should be written for stakeholders such as staff, parents, students,
public water system officials, and local elected officials. It should also detail how
stakeholders will be notified regarding the health impacts of lead in drinking water,
sources of lead in drinking water, sampling plans, and any results from testing. Further,
schools should work to build partnerships with local community organizations or state
drinking water programs to assist in communicating relevant and factual information.121
(3) Implement a water sampling plan in compliance with state guidance
It is important that all schools have a well-developed water sampling and testing plan to
comply with state guidance. The first step of this plan should be to conduct a walk-
through of the school to identify all sinks and fountains that provide water meant for
consumption and to document the presence of aerators and filters.121,323 Based on the
information collected from the walk-through, determine which drinking water sources to
sample. Multiple sources should be chosen, and they should be representative of all
potential drinking water outlets, such as drinking fountains, kitchen sinks and kettles,
classroom sinks, etc.121
Before sampling, schools should identify a Massachusetts-certified laboratory to
analyze the water samples for lead.121 Laboratories should provide details on sampling
methodology, though MassDEP also provides the following information: 1) designate a
233
VII. Additional Details Related to Goal 2: Achieve Healthy Schools

school employee to lead the sampling plan or hire an experienced consultant, 2) create
a diagram of where samples will be taken and assign an identification code to each
location, and 3) record detailed notes during sampling such as the date and time of
sampling and observations for each location (i.e., type of water source, whether an
aerator or filter is present).324,325 Some essential things to note are to always sample
taps/outlets with aerators or filters attached if water is normally obtained using such
measures and to never sample immediately after an extended closure or following a
facility flush of the plumbing system.121,322
Note that MassDEP recommends that schools conduct testing once every three years,
and that results come back under the detection limit of 1 ppb.324 If results come back
above this level, MassDEP recommends that schools notify the administrator and
include the list of sampling locations with detectable levels and the remediation efforts
the school will implement to address the contamination.324 Regardless of the results,
staff, parents, students, and other stakeholders should be notified of the testing as
detailed in the school’s communication plan.
(4) Remediate sources of contamination and establish routine practices to
minimize future contamination

water flow to remove any stagnant water in
the interior of the pipes, as stagnant water
is more likely to have higher levels of lead.122,321,322,326 Permanent control measures will
require the complete replacement of problem outlets and any upstream plumbing
components like piping, valves, and solder.121 Another option would be to reconfigure
the plumbing system to re-route water away from sections identified to contain lead-
based materials.323 Finally, the School Water Improvement Grants (SWIG) Program
offers grants for the purchase and installation of filtered water-bottle filling stations in
eligible schools and EECFs, while the Water-Smart Program offers filtered pitchers.
Other daily practices can be implemented to reduce lead in drinking water. For example,
outlets should be flushed daily for at least 30 seconds, and complete system flushing
should occur weekly, particularly after breaks.326 Additionally, only cold water should be
used for drinking and cooking, as hot water may have more dissolved lead.122 Routine
234
VII. Additional Details Related to Goal 2: Achieve Healthy Schools

maintenance should also be performed, such as cleaning faucet aerators and installing
certified low-lead materials.122
Statutes, Regulations, and Standards
The following statutes, regulations, and standards contain relevant information to lead
and copper in drinking water, including the levels of contamination which should not be
exceeded.
Relevant Statutes
Lead Contamination Control Act (LCCA) provides recommendations for identifying
and addressing lead and copper at schools and childcare facilities.324
Reduction of Lead in Drinking Water Act prohibits the use or sale of lead pipes,
solder, and flux, where ‘lead-free’ systems must demonstrate they contain less than 0.2
percent lead.327
Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) sets standards for drinking water including the
control of contaminant levels, where lead and copper are regulated through the lead
and copper rule.328
Relevant Regulations
MA Drinking Water Regulations, 310 CMR 22, control levels of various contaminants
in drinking water and requires that levels remain under certain thresholds deemed
health protective.329 Such thresholds are set to the levels identified in the MA Maximum
Contaminant Levels standard.
Lead and Copper Rule requires that drinking water is monitored for lead and copper
and that levels remain below 15 ppb for lead and 1.3 ppm for copper.330 Public water
systems that exceed these action levels must undertake various control measures and
inform stakeholders of how the contamination will be managed.
National Primary Drinking Water Regulations enforce primary standards and
treatment techniques relevant to public water systems, where the maximum
contaminant level for lead in copper are set to the federal action levels of 15 ppb and
1.3 ppm, respectively.331
Relevant Standards
MA Maximum Contaminant Levels sets levels for various contaminants in drinking
water as required under MA 310 CMR 22, where levels for both lead and copper in
public water systems are set to the federal action levels of 15 ppb and 1.3 ppm,
respectively. These standards are for the entire system and not individual outlets such
as those at schools if the school is part of a larger water system.332

National Sanitation Foundation (NSF)/ANSI/CAN 372 certifies low-lead plumbing
products to have no more than 0.25 percent lead.333

2b(2) Reduce Exposure to PFAS in Drinking Water
Methods and Best Practices
The following best practices are aimed at identifying PFAS contamination in drinking
water, remediating to reduce contamination, and eliminating sources of PFAS through
green purchasing.
(1) Identify whether the school’s drinking water source contains PFAS and
conduct additional testing to determine the source of contamination whenever
possible
An important first step in reducing exposure to PFAS in schools is to assess
contamination in drinking water. All public water suppliers in Massachusetts are
required to test for PFAS, whether the supplier is a community system or a school with
its own well. If PFAS are detected, schools should contact MassDEP to identify
appropriate next steps for addressing both long-term and short-term remediation
strategies.
237
VII. Additional Details Related to Goal 2: Achieve Healthy Schools

(2) Remediate sources of PFAS contamination and establish routine practices to
minimize future contamination (long-term mitigation)
If the school is part of a larger public water system, the public water system is
responsible for remediation actions to provide water to customers that complies with
regulatory requirements. Long-term remediation by public water suppliers may include
treatment to filter out PFAS or linking the water system to new sources of water that
does not contain PFAS.123 If the school is on well water, it is considered a public water
system and, as such, is required to comply with the same state drinking water
regulations (310 CMR 22). In such cases, schools can install activated carbon or
reverse osmosis filters to treat water onsite.124–126 The school should provide an
alternative source of drinking water while installing a treatment system.
(3) Remediate sources of contamination and establish routine practices to
minimize future contamination (short-term mitigation)
When PFAS contamination in local water sources cannot be immediately remediated,
schools can switch to the use of bottled water as a temporary alternative.124 DPH
regulates bottled water in Massachusetts and—together with MassDEP—publishes a
list of bottled water companies that have completed testing that demonstrates
compliance with drinking water standards for PFAS.126
(4) Procure certified PFAS-free items as part of the school’s green purchasing
program
In addition to reducing PFAS in drinking water, efforts can be taken to reduce PFAS
exposure in schools from everyday products. For example, New Hampshire has
identified floor waxing and refinishing products as sources of PFAS in schools.334
Schools should include PFAS as contaminants to monitor through their green
purchasing program. This would entail procuring certified PFAS-free products for any
food contact materials, cleaning products, classroom furnishings, flooring, paint, etc.125
Note that Massachusetts has set goals to require reporting of PFAS in products by
manufacturers and to phase out intentionally added PFAS in consumer products by
2030.127
Statutes, Regulations, and Standards
The following statutes, regulations, and standards control hazardous waste containing
PFAS and set limits for these chemicals in drinking water and other matrices.
Relevant Statutes
MA Oil and Hazardous Material Release Prevention and Response Act, Ch. 21E
regulates oil and hazardous waste contamination where cleanup standards set the limit
to 20 ppt for the sum of perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorooctane sulfonic acid
(PFOS), perfluorohexanesulfonic acid (PFHxS), hexafluoropropylene oxide dimer acid
238
VII. Additional Details Related to Goal 2: Achieve Healthy Schools

(HFPO-DA), perfluorobutane sulfonate (PFBS), and perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA) in
groundwater and 0.3-2 ppb in soil.127
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act
designates PFOA, PFOS, and their salts and isomers as chemicals to be monitored for
cleanup in the event of uncontrolled or abandoned hazardous waste.335
Relevant Standards and Regulations
PFAS National Primary Drinking Water Regulation sets a maximum contaminant
level (MCL) standard in drinking water for five PFAS compounds where PFOA and
PFOS are 4 ng/L and PFHxS, HFPO-DA, and PFNA are 10 ng/L.336 Further, any given
mixture of PFHxS, PFNA, HFPO-DA, and/or PFBS cannot exceed a hazard index of 1.
This regulation also sets maximum contaminant level goals (MCLGs), which are non-
enforceable health-based levels. The MCLGs were set to zero ng/L for PFOA and
PFOS and 10 ng/L for PFHxS, HFPO-DA, and PFNA.
MA PFAS Drinking Water Standard (310 CMR 22.07: Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl
Substances (PFAS) Monitoring and Analytical Requirements) has a current MCL of 20
ng/L for the sum of the concentrations of the following compounds: PFOA, PFOS,
PFHxS, PFNA, PFHpA, and perfluorodecanoic acid. 337 MassDEP must adopt the
national MCLs noted above and is considering additional information that could result in
more stringent standards.
MA Drinking Water Standard (105 CMR 500.09: Standards for Bottled Water)
requires laboratory results for source and finished water, including bottled water, to be
under the MCL of 20 ng/L for the sum of the concentrations of the following compounds:
PFOA, PFOS, PFHxS, PFNA, PFHpA, and perfluorodecanoic acid.338 With regards to
bottled water, manufacturers are to provide lab results annually showing that their
finished water products meet these requirements.

Objective 2c. Maintain Thermal Comfort
Methods and Best Practices
Methods and best practices for maintaining thermal comfort are described here, ranging
from policy implementation, major changes to building HVAC systems, steps to consider
for new construction, and steps that teachers can take within their classrooms.
(1) Establish and implement an extreme heat policy aligned with a completed
climate vulnerability assessment
Climate change is contributing to more intense heat waves across Massachusetts and
forcing schools to confront the challenge of managing an increased number of school
days experiencing extreme heat.339 Extended periods of hot weather can exacerbate
underlying health conditions such as asthma and bronchitis, and prolonged exposure to
high temperatures can impair cognitive function, learning, and academic performance.
Using the results of a completed climate vulnerability assessment (see Objective 1f:
Enhance Climate Resilience for additional details), schools should determine the need
for, establish, and implement an extreme heat policy, where appropriate. An effective
policy will outline a multi-pronged approach that considers relative humidity levels,
appropriate air circulation, classroom temperature thresholds, appropriate hydration for
students and staff, and necessary modifications to physical activities.339
(2) Keep classrooms at a comfortable temperature and humidity for learning
While no exact definition exists for “comfortable temperature,” what is typically thought
of as a “comfortable temperature” will vary seasonally. Perceived heat and thermal
comfort is also highly dependent on humidity, and as such, schools should strive to
measure both temperature and humidity. There are several guidelines that schools can
use to determine what a comfortable range of temperature and humidity is in their
facilities. DPH recommends that classrooms be kept within the range of 70°F to 78°F
and 40 to 60 percent relative humidity.340 OSHA recommends that indoor workplace
temperatures stay between 68°F and 76°F with humidity between 20 and 60 percent.341
In addition, M.G.L., c. 149, § 113, which applies to workplace temperature, including
schools, requires that workplaces be properly heated from October 15 to May 15.342
During the heating season, DLS endorses keeping classrooms between 66°F and
68°F.343 OSHA is currently developing a national standard for protecting workers during
extreme heat, and recommendations for extreme heat in schools may change as the
number of hot days increases.344,345 Overall, schools should keep classroom
241
VII. Additional Details Related to Goal 2: Achieve Healthy Schools

temperature in the approximate range of 66°F to 78°F, as seasonally appropriate, and
avoid extremely low and extremely high levels of humidity.
(3) Install air conditioning if temperatures regularly get above recommended
levels (see best practice 1 above)
Some Massachusetts schools have begun installing air conditioning, which is the best
way to reduce temperature and humidity in classrooms.128,132 Schools have cited lack of
air conditioning as driving the need for early dismissals and closures during hot
conditions. Resources such as the National Best Practices Manual For Building High
Performance Schools provide guidance for school design considering air conditioning
requirements.131,339,346
(4) Maintain mechanical HVAC systems and balance systems as needed
For both heating and cooling systems, proper maintenance is essential. Schools should
take steps to make sure their HVAC systems are operating properly, such as calibrating
thermostats for accurate temperature control, balancing the system at least every five
years using a third party specialist, and ensuring that air conditioning (AC) drip pans are
properly draining and free of debris, all pipes are free of microbial growth, and window-
mounted AC units are properly installed and maintained.104,287
(5) Proper heating and cooling in new construction
Given the increase in hot and humid days and the currently observed and anticipated
future effects of climate change, schools should carefully consider projected heating
and cooling needs, including air conditioning, when constructing a new building. School
planners could consider passive heating and cooling systems, if thermal comfort can be
maintained with these systems.346 These systems aim to maximize heat from the sun in
the winter and minimize this heat gain in the summer. Strategic window placement and
shading play a large role in passive heating and cooling, prioritizing north-facing
windows and shading those that face south.346 Another way to improve the efficiency of
heating or cooling systems in schools is to improve the building envelope (see Objective
1a. Decarbonize Buildings for additional details on building envelope improvements).
(5) Take simple steps to mitigate the effects of heat on health and learning
While established mechanical or passive cooling systems are most effective at reducing
classroom temperature, school staff can take other interim steps to mitigate the
negative effects of extreme heat on students and staff. Steps to mitigate heat include
providing cool water for students and staff; reducing physical activity; improving air
circulation (e.g., providing at least one fan per classroom); dimming or turning off lights;
switching off unused electronics; opening windows (if cooler outdoors); closing shades
to block solar radiation; and providing “cooling breaks” between instruction during which
students can use misting fans, ice packs, or other cooling items.131,339,347 Schools should
develop a plan outlining which measures they will use to mitigate the effects of heat on
health and learning during heat waves and extreme heat.

Objective 2d. Use Integrated Pest Management
Methods and Best Practices
This section summarizes the methods and best practices for using integrated pest
management in schools.
(1) Create an IPM plan
The Massachusetts Pesticide Control Act requires schools to:
• Adopt and implement an IPM plan
• File a copy of the IPM plan with the state
• Make a copy available to the public upon request
• Review the plan annually
The Massachusetts Department of Agricultural Resources (MDAR) has produced a
model IPM plan that schools may adopt. School IPM plans must contain the following:
• Description of the school’s IPM communication and training programs for staff
• List of pesticides to be used
• List of non-pesticide control techniques and preventative methods to be used
• School location where the IPM plans and records are available for viewing
Schools are encouraged to further define routine service schedules and pest thresholds
for which advanced action is taken.
244
VII. Additional Details Related to Goal 2: Achieve Healthy Schools

(2) Perform routine and proactive pest service
A certified pest professional should proactively service all school spaces regularly.
Schools may elect to hire an in-house technician or contract with a pest management
company that practices IPM. At a minimum, the technician should:
• Report their pesticide applicator certification number
• Inspect for pest activity
• Inspect for structural, sanitation, or clutter concerns
• Place, remove, and replace traps, bait stations, and insect monitors; all should be
dated
• Record the quantity, percent active ingredient, and trade name of any toxicant
applied, and the weather conditions (if outdoors)
• Inquire with building occupants about any pest concerns
• Provide recommendations for resolving pest concerns
Any actions taken above should be recorded in a central data repository that is available
to both the pest professional and administrative decision makers. It is critical that the
time and locations for all observations are recorded so that problem areas can be
identified at a later date. If a problem is identified during routine service, the technician
should regularly service the space at an enhanced frequency until resolution. If the
school has capacity, annual quality insurance inspections should be conducted to check
the quality of the pest technician’s work.
The frequency of routine service should vary by space in accordance with the risks
associated with each space. For instance, cafeterias should be serviced more
frequently than administrative offices. Foodservice and childcare spaces are typically
monitored at least weekly or biweekly, while office-like spaces are monitored quarterly
or biannually. All spaces should be serviced by a technician at least twice a year.
(3) Field pest complaints from building occupants
Staff and students should be able to report any sighted pest activity to a central point of
contact or reporting platform. A complete pest service request contains the reporter’s
email, date and time of request, general type of pest or conducive condition observed,
and a detailed location description. These details should be provided to the pest
professional conducting routine pest service so that the technician can address the
reported issue during their next scheduled visit, or if needed, during a sooner non-
routine visit. The reporter should be notified that their complaint has been received and
what action was taken to resolve their concern.
245
VII. Additional Details Related to Goal 2: Achieve Healthy Schools

(4) Physically exclude pests
Preventing pests from entering facilities is the most effective way to reduce the need for
chemical pesticide use in buildings. Physically exclude pests via the following methods:
• Seal utility entry points, cracks, and gaps in foundations, walls, and around
windows. For larger openings, insert steel wool or mesh before sealing with caulk
or foam.
• Check that windows and doors close completely.
• Install door sweeps on exterior doors. The housing and sweep should be cut on
the “inside hinged” edge of the door and not the outer edge of the door.
• Install weep covers over window weep holes.
• Install screens in windows.
• Trim vegetation so that it does not touch building exteriors (vegetation should be
3 to 6 feet away from the building foundation).
While school maintenance teams may perform these exclusions, it is recommended that
a trained pest professional performs pest exclusion.
(5) Perform pest sealing before final acceptance of new construction projects
Structural pests, such as rodents and certain insects, can migrate along utility and
plumbing lines within building interiors. Before a new construction project is completed,
a trained pest professional should perform pest sealing within building interiors to
significantly reduce opportunities for pest mobility in buildings.
(6) Conduct pest-preventative repairs
Pest-preventative repairs should be implemented to address structural issues leading to
pest proliferation. A trained pest professional may perform these repairs or in-house
maintenance staff can be trained to do them. Below is guidance for common pest-
preventative repairs:
• Clean Drains: Regularly clean drains to prevent the buildup of organic matter
that can attract pests like flies and cockroaches. Inspect drains for the presence
of standing water since drain water within otherwise “dry” areas (e.g., bathroom
floor drains, mechanical room floor drains) may evaporate from the respective
drain trap, creating an “open line” for sewer-dwelling pests such as American
cockroaches, drain flies, phorid flies and other pests to emerge. If there is
standing water present, and the drain sees a high volume of organic matter (such
as shower drains in locker rooms or within food service areas), carefully remove
drain covers, apply Biozyme enzymatic drain cleaner (or similar foaming drain
cleaner) and scrub the inner walls of the drain to remove organic matter
physically. Simply pouring hot water, bleach, or a foaming agent will not eliminate
breeding sites. Mechanical organic matter removal is the only way to eliminate
246
VII. Additional Details Related to Goal 2: Achieve Healthy Schools

these breeding sites. Electric rotary brushes may also be used; stiff nylon bristles
are preferred over steel bristles since the latter may damage older pipe walls.
• Repair Water Leaks: Fix leaks promptly to eliminate a water source that attracts
pests and creates conducive conditions for mold. Standing water (even within the
confines of a building) may invite mosquito breeding in as little as four days.
• Manage Garbage Disposals: Maintain and clean garbage disposals regularly to
reduce odors and potential food sources for pests. In the event of a non-
functioning or broken garbage disposal, it should be removed and replaced since
organic matter collection will invite filth fly breeding. If a fly infestation occurs in a
fully functioning disposal, the discharge line (from disposal to plumbing trap) as
well as plumbing p-trap should be removed and brushed out to eliminate organic
matter buildup and subsequent fly breeding sites. Biozyme enzymatic drain
cleaner (or similar drain cleaner) may also be applied to make scrubbing easier.
• Install Door Sweeps: Properly install door sweeps to seal gaps at the bottom of
doors, preventing entry for pests such as rodents and insects. Door sweeps
should be bristled with aluminum housing and cut to allow for a 1/8” reveal on
each side of the bristle sweep. Cut the housing and sweep on the “inside hinged”
edge of the door and not the outer edge of the door. This practice will reduce cut
hazards by mitigating sharp edges on the outermost edge of the door that may
contact open-toed shoes of building occupants.
(7) Inspect buildings for conducive conditions
It is crucial to conduct annual, if not more frequent, building inspections for early
detection and prevention of pest infestations. Additional inspections may be warranted
throughout the year if significant changes to a building are expected to occur (e.g.,
façade renovation). Inspectors must keep detailed records of inspection findings, noting
signs of pests, conducive conditions, or structural issues. Inspection may be conducted
by a certified pest professional or facility manager. At a minimum, the inspection should
include the elements outlined in Table 78:

(8) Educate building occupants on best practices
Student and staff behaviors have a substantial impact on pest presence within schools.
Therefore, they should be educated on how to report pest activity, what the school is
doing to address pest concerns, and what they can do to prevent pest activity. Namely,
students and staff can help by reducing food sources and clutter. The following
instructions could be placed on flyers and distributed in classrooms and break rooms:
• Avoid eating and storing food in classrooms, offices, or cubbies.
• Wipe spilled food items off surfaces.
• Do not leave dirty dishes in classrooms, offices, and cubbies.
• Store food in sealed heavy plastic, metal, or glass containers.
• Rinse recyclables before placing them in recycling containers.
• Reduce clutter by removing or storing unused items.
• Check that the soil is free of pests before bringing a plant to the school.
• Dry out potted plants completely before watering.

Pest Management in Schools
Objective 2e. Procure and Use Green Cleaning Supplies and
Chemicals
Methods and Best Practices
The methods and best practices in this section focus on implementing a chemical
management system and utilizing green chemicals to protect the health and safety of
staff and students using chemicals in schools.
250
VII. Additional Details Related to Goal 2: Achieve Healthy Schools

Chemical Management System
The following three best practices can assist in implementing a strong chemical
management system within schools. Schools must use, store, and dispose of chemicals
in a manner that minimizes the misuse of chemicals and ultimate exposure to
hazardous substances by staff and students.
(1) Develop a school chemical management program
An important first step to minimize exposure to hazardous or mismanaged chemicals in
schools is to develop a chemical management program, beginning with evaluating the
current conditions of a school’s use of chemicals and conducting an inventory of all
chemicals present onsite.133,352 A visual inspection should be performed to identify
mismanaged chemicals, which are characterized by expired chemicals or those in poor
condition (i.e., evident corrosion), unlabeled chemicals, mis-stored chemicals, and a
lack of displayed safety information on the label.101,133 A detailed chemical inventory
should be noted, and any chemicals deemed unnecessary, expired, or posing a health,
safety, or environmental risk should be appropriately disposed of.99,101,133,287
Additionally, attention should be paid to how chemicals are being physically stored and
whether safety information is available.99,101,133,287,353 Chemicals should be stored in an
appropriate cabinet depending on their properties or chemical class, where acids and
flammables are separated from other chemicals.133,287,353 The storage cabinets should
have shelving constructed to resist corrosion and include guardrails to prevent
accidental slippage.287,353 Designated chemical storage rooms should have dedicated
exhaust ventilation systems to reduce the availability of chemical vapors.133,353 Lastly,
chemicals should always be easily identifiable via proper labeling mechanisms, and
material safety data sheet (MSDS) information should be readily available.99,101,287,353
When disposing of hazardous chemicals, including electronics, follow guidance
provided by MassDEP and local hazardous waste collection facilities that have been
approved by MassDEP for collection. Massachusetts has a statewide contract
(FAC110) in place to aid with hazardous waste disposal.
These practices should be put into place regularly for long-term adequate chemical use,
storage, and disposal.
(2) Create an emergency and spill response plan
Another critical step in minimizing exposure to hazardous or mismanaged chemicals is
to create an emergency and spill response plan. This should be a written plan
describing what to do and who to contact in an emergency or spill.99 The plan should
include detailed information such as emergency response contact information, location
of necessary supplies (e.g., spill kits), diagrams of facility grounds, evacuation and
accountability plans, and communication plans or other means of alerting
individuals.99,133 Always call 911 in an emergency; however, the Massachusetts
Emergency Response Line (1-888-304-1133) may also be a useful contact for answers
251
VII. Additional Details Related to Goal 2: Achieve Healthy Schools

to technical questions or assistance in determining if non-emergency situations warrant
further action or reporting.133,353
(3) Form a chemical safety team and conduct adequate staff training
It is important to have a solid chemical safety team to oversee chemical management
programs and emergency or spill response plans. The chemical safety team should
coordinate and implement all strategic plans that minimize exposure to hazardous
substances, promote chemical safety, and retain documents for long-term institutional
memory.133 The team should include diverse areas of expertise, where leadership and
decision making roles are clearly defined.352 Further, the team should conduct proper
training for all staff and students who handle chemicals.99,101 Training on emergency or
spill response plans and MSDS and other chemical safety information should also be
available.99
Green Cleaning Supplies/Chemicals
The following two best practices can help implement a green chemical purchasing
policy and a plan effectively using such green chemicals. The goal of these practices is
to decrease the amount of toxic chemicals used in schools and provide green
alternatives.
(4) Implement a green chemical purchasing policy
A green chemical purchasing policy can help eliminate the purchase and use of
unnecessary hazardous products and thus reduce overall risks to students and staff. An
important first step may be to assess the current state of chemical purchasing to
determine the chemicals currently being purchased and how they are being used.99
Based on this information, the policy should be adapted to have defined quantities and
types of chemicals approved for purchase.99,133,287 Further, the policy should promote
the use of less toxic or non-toxic chemicals and products.99,133,134 Four top certifications
to look for include Design for the Environment, Green Seal, Safer Choice, and UL
ECOLOGO.134 The approved chemical purchasing list should be created and
maintained by the chemical safety and procurement teams and reviewed on a regular
basis.
(5) Design a plan for green cleaning, sanitizing, disinfecting, and other daily
practices plan
In addition to a green chemical purchasing policy, a plan that describes how these
green chemicals can be used effectively in daily practices such as cleaning, sanitizing,
and disinfecting will be helpful to schools. For example, some traditional cleaning
agents are also hazardous substances that can irritate the respiratory tract and lead to
unwanted side effects like triggering asthma symptoms.134,299 However, ensuring that
the alternative green cleaning agents are still effective in reducing the spread of
infectious diseases is important and some sanitizing solutions, such as using only FDA-
approved sanitizers on food preparation surfaces, may be required by regulation.134
Thus, schools should develop a routine cleaning, sanitizing, and disinfecting schedule
252
VII. Additional Details Related to Goal 2: Achieve Healthy Schools

that details the green cleaning supplies and their respective procedures for use, as well
as additional tools that can promote clean surfaces such as walk-off mats, microfiber
cleaning cloths and mops, and HEPA or high-filtration vacuums.134
Statutes, Regulations, and Standards
The following statutes and regulations focus on the use, storage, and disposal of
chemicals and provide information on chemical requirements that will be useful to
schools.
Relevant Statutes
MA Hazardous Waste Management Act, Chapter 21C provides guidelines on how
hazardous waste should be managed and requires the establishment of a hazardous
waste advisory committee for the state of Massachusetts.354 It also includes guidelines
on hazardous waste collection, transportation, storage, treatment, and disposal.
MA Right-to-Know Act, Chapter 111F provides rights to public sector employees
regarding information on toxic and hazardous substances.355 Such rights include a
labeling requirement that states that containers with toxic or hazardous substances
must be labeled, a MSDS requirement that states public employers must maintain
MSDS for all hazardous materials, required annual training for employees working with
chemical products, and required Right-to-Know notices in the workplace.
MA Toxics Use Reduction Act, Chapter 21I promotes reducing the use of toxic
chemicals to protect public health and the environment.356 It includes requirements for
reporting and planning and a fee structure for facilities that use large amounts of toxic
chemicals. It also provides services such as education, training, grant programs, and
technical assistance.

Objective 2f. Reduce Exposure to Hazardous Substances
2f(1) Reduce Exposure to Lead in Paint and Soil
Methods and Best Practices
The following best practices focus on identifying sources of lead (outside of drinking
water) in schools and implementing daily practices that can reduce student’s exposure.
(1) Examine for lead paint and conduct renovations
In 1978, the Consumer Product Safety Commission banned the use of lead in paint;
thus, if a school building was built prior to 1978, there is a chance that lead-based paint
exists onsite.99–101 The interior and exterior surfaces of the building, along with the
surrounding soil, may be contaminated with flaking paint chips or dust containing lead
particles.99 Lead-based paint may also be present under newer layers of paint.100 The
only way to establish whether lead is present is to test. An accredited analytical
laboratory or state-certified inspector should be used to test paint and soil for lead.99,100
If lead is detected, current or future renovation plans should take that into consideration.
The Department of Labor Standards regulations require that (1) renovators provide a
pre-renovation notification, (2) all individuals conducting the renovations must be trained
and certified, and (3) lead-safe work practices must be followed and well documented if
the school is considered a child occupied facility.358 It is important to note that common
renovation activities such as sanding, cutting, and demolition increase the spread of and
subsequent exposure to lead particles.100 Thus, vacating the building during renovations
will likely be necessary.
(2) Implement a hand-washing routine after recess and before eating
Outside of inhaling contaminated dust, children are most likely to be exposed to lead via
hand-to-mouth activity.99 EPA has stated that washing hands with water and soap can
effectively mitigate lead exposure.359 Thus, it is essential to implement a hand-washing
routine after playing outside and before eating to reduce the amount of accessible lead
on children’s hands.101
Statutes, Regulations, and Standards
The following regulations focus on setting requirements for removing lead paint and
later renovations of buildings.
Relevant Regulations
105 CMR 460.000 establishes a statewide program for the prevention and control of
lead poisoning. The regulation includes restrictions on the use of lead-based paints and
glazes in school buildings.360

VII. Additional Details Related to Goal 2: Achieve Healthy Schools

454 CMR 22.00 establishes regulations that require deleading and lead safe renovation
requirements for residences and child-occupied facilities.358
TSCA Section 402 requires that activities related to preventing, detecting, and
eliminating hazards associated with lead-based paint are performed by properly trained
and certified individuals.361
TSCA Section 404 includes requirements on reporting and recordkeeping as it relates
to any activities relevant to TSCA section 402.361 Additionally, subsection G also
provides guidance on grants that can be awarded to renovate buildings with lead-based
paint.
TSCA Title 40, Chapter 1, Subchapter R, Part 745, Subpart E provides guidelines for
renovations performed in residential and child-occupied facilities.362 It also describes the
requirements of pre-renovation education/notification, the certification details and

2f(2) Reduce Exposure to Mercury
Methods and Best Practices
The following best practices focus on identifying mercury sources in schools and
implementing safety plans in the event of a spill to reduce student exposure.
(1) Develop a mercury spill response plan
In schools where mercury-containing items are still in use, it is essential to minimize the
chance that students and staff become exposed.101 School administrators should create
and distribute a mercury spill response plan and train appropriate staff to implement it in
the event of a mercury spill.
Mercury is a toxic substance; if more than 2 tablespoons (approximately the size of an
adult male thumb) of mercury has spilled, this is considered an environmental
emergency.363 Call 911 or MassDEP’s 24/7

(2) Maintain a mercury spill kit
Every school where mercury items are still in use should have a mercury spill kit
available. Mercury spill kits typically include a mercury absorbent or amalgamation
powder, clean-up tools, disposal bags, and appropriate PPE, such as thick nitrile gloves
and goggles.
258
VII. Additional Details Related to Goal 2: Achieve Healthy Schools

(3) Properly dispose of all mercury-containing items and replace with alternatives
where possible
It is important to identify all mercury-containing items present in schools and to begin
replacing them with alternatives wherever possible. An essential first step will be to
conduct an inventory and locate all mercury-containing items.101,365 These items may be
located in science, art, home economics, HVAC and plumbing, automotive, or nursing
and dental vocational classrooms.366,367 Additionally, they may be used throughout the
building or in medical/nurse’s offices.367
Some of these mercury-containing items include thermometers/thermostats,
barometers, hygrometers, hydrometers, manometers, vacuum gauges, spectral tubes,
molecular motion devices, sling psychrometers, sphygmomanometers, elemental
mercury, mercury-based compound solutions or powders, mercury gas law
apparatuses, and float control switches, such as those used on sump pumps, vermillion
paints, and fluorescent lamps.366,367 Alternative products and practices can be
introduced for each of these items. For example, digital, glass bulbs, spirit-filled, or
tympanic thermometers are all effective alternatives to mercury-containing
thermometers.367
As these products are replaced with alternatives, it is important to follow the appropriate
safety steps. Mercury-containing items should always be placed in non-breakable,
sealable containers and clearly labeled as hazardous before disposal.365 It is important
to use a licensed hazardous waste facility to recycle these items.365 If needed, there are
environmental service companies that can assist with removing mercury-containing
items from schools. Contact the MassDEP’s mercury hotline at 866-9MERCURY (866-
963-7287) for assistance.136
Statutes, Regulations, and Standards
The following statutes and regulations set requirements for the use, storage, and
disposal of mercury-containing items.
Relevant Statutes
M.G.L., c. 21H, § 6G restricts school from purchasing mercury-containing items to be
used in the classroom.368 Thermometers and measuring devices may be excluded if no
adequate alternative exists.368 Section 6G does not apply to the sale of mercury-
containing lamps.368
M.G.L., c. 21H, § 6I restricts entities from knowingly disposing of mercury-containing
items in a manner other than recycling, disposing as hazardous waste, or other state-
approved methods.369 Section 6I also calls for mandatory education on proper disposal
of mercury-containing items for all citizens.369
259
VII. Additional Details Related to Goal 2: Achieve Healthy Schools

Relevant Regulations
RCRA requires that EPA manage hazardous waste, including waste generated from the
use, storage, and disposal of mercury-containing items.370 Before these items can be
disposed of, they must meet EPA’s treatment and recycling standards. Current
regulations require that low-mercury waste (<260 mg/kg total mercury) be treated to
achieve 0.025 mg/L, as measured using the Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure
(TCLP).371 Note that high-mercury waste (>260 mg/kg total mercury) must undergo
retorting or roasting where the residuals produced after thermal processing must
achieve 0.20 mg/L TCLP.371

Objective 2g. Safely Procure, Use, and Dispose of Crumb Rubber
Methods and Best Practices
This section summarizes the methods and best practices related to the procurement,
use, and disposal of ATFs containing crumb rubber. The first section presents best
practices for schools deciding whether to use an ATF and managing its use and
disposal. The second section includes best practices for students, staff members,
coaches, and families who play or attend events on ATFs.
Considerations and Practices for School Decision Makers and Field Maintenance
Staff
This section discusses practices for schools deciding on whether or not to use ATFs
and managing the use and disposal of an existing ATF.
(1) Consider the pros and cons of ATFs and natural grass when planning for field
upgrades
When considering whether to install an ATF or natural grass playing field, school
decision makers should consider the pros and cons of each. Materials in the resources
section below may be helpful. School leaders should consider the following factors:
installation and maintenance costs; individuals responsible for field maintenance;
lifespan; disposal cost of an ATF; amount of space available; the direction and flow of
runoff; whether small children will often be at this field; the typical temperatures during
the sports season; the possibility of the urban heat island effect increasing temperature;
the amount of use needed; and the availability of alternative fields if it rains. While some
municipalities have banned ATFs, no statutes or regulations address ATFs at the state
level; however, the Toxics Use Reduction Institute at UMass Lowell has identified
organically managed natural grass as a safer alternative for sports surfaces.138,372
(2) Plan for and implement routine ATF maintenance
If a school has an ATF, it is essential to plan for and maintain it to keep it safe for
students, staff members, and the environment. Maintenance may include disinfection;
seam repairs; watering to lower temperatures on hot days; and fluffing, redistributing,
shock testing, and replacing infill.372 Over time, the shock absorbency of ATFs declines,
meaning older turf can be less forgiving on joints and upon impact.139,372 Regular
maintenance and repair can help reduce the extent to which an ATF may contribute to
injuries.
(3) Plan for and conduct proper disposal of ATFs at the end of their lifespan
Any school district that has an ATF or is planning to install one should plan for end-of-
life disposal and the associated costs. Most municipalities have contractual
arrangements with waste haulers, but those contracts may have restrictions on the
types or volumes of waste. Disposal costs for ATFs will vary by waste contractor but
261
VII. Additional Details Related to Goal 2: Achieve Healthy Schools

may be substantial due to the size of an ATF. Improperly discarded ATF materials have
been found in Massachusetts and have contaminated nearby streams with crumb
rubber pellets and leached chemicals.373
Considerations and Practices for Students, Staff Members, and Families Playing
on ATFs
Best practices discussed in this section apply to students, staff members, coaches,
families, and school leaders when using ATFs for sporting events.
(4) Wear shoes on ATFs at all times
Wearing shoes eliminates dermal exposure to ATFs, which occurs when barefoot.137 It
also reduces the likelihood of getting crumb rubber stuck between the toes and tracking
it into the home. This applies to students playing on the field, friends, family, and
especially to any young children attending a sporting event.
(5) Do not swallow or allow small children to swallow crumb rubber
Students, staff members, and spectators should not swallow crumb rubber that
accidentally enters the mouth.137 If students playing on an ATF fall and get crumb
rubber or plastic grass particles in their mouths, encourage them to spit it out. Monitor
young children on ATFs to prevent them from swallowing or picking up crumb rubber
particles.
(6) Increase ventilation at indoor ATF facilities
If an ATF is located indoors, increase ventilation if possible by opening windows and
doors, turning on fans, and circulating air with outdoor air.137 Indoor use of an ATF is
generally thought to retain VOCs, SVOCs, or microplastic particles emitted by the ATF
closer to the ground level where students play compared to outdoors where emissions
are dissipated.
(7) Raise awareness of and protect against extreme heat exposure
In sunny, warm weather, the temperature of an ATF can be much hotter than the
temperature of the air on natural grass fields, causing it to act as a heat island.137,374
The hot temperature of an ATF can burn skin, damage equipment, and increase the risk
of heat-related illness.372 There are several methods to determine the temperature
around ATFs. One heat metric, wet bulb globe temperature (WBGT), accounts for
ambient air temperature, relative humidity, wind, and solar radiation, which can be
helpful given that solar radiation heats ATFs. The Massachusetts Interscholastic Athletic
Association 2019 heat policy is based on WBGT. However, WBGT does not capture the
temperature of an ATF itself, so athletic staff may also want to measure the temperature
of the ATF directly.372
Coaches and other staff should be educated about recognizing and preventing heat-
related illnesses.372 Prevention may mean providing additional water and shade breaks,
262
VII. Additional Details Related to Goal 2: Achieve Healthy Schools

monitoring for symptoms, changing practice times, and establishing a temperature and
humidity threshold above which sporting activities on ATFs are canceled. Evidence
shows that irrigating ATFs can reduce field temperatures for a short time, but
temperatures rebound quickly in sunny conditions.372,374 There is no standard approach
to mitigating the intense heat that can be observed on ATFs, so each school should
take appropriate steps to raise awareness of the ATF’s heat, reduce ATF temperature,
and prevent heat-related illness among students.
(8) Minimize passive recreation on ATFs
Minimize passive recreation on an ATF, such as laying and sitting.137 Such activities put
people physically closer to the ATF than playing sports and, unlike sporting practices
and games, they are activities that do not have to happen on sports fields.
(9) Clean hands, clothing, equipment, and turf burns after playing on ATFs
School staff, athletic staff, and coaches should encourage students to clean up properly
after playing on an ATF. Students should wash their hands after playing on an ATF and
before eating, especially younger children who may have had more contact with the
ground. When students arrive at home or go back to school, they should take off their
shoes before going indoors to prevent tracking crumb rubber indoors. Students and
parents should clean all clothes and equipment used on an ATF. If students have turf
burns from falls on an ATF, they should be cleaned with soap and water.137
Statutes, Regulations, and Standards
No federal or state regulations or standards currently exist for ATFs.4

Objective 2h. Create a Safe Environment for Students with Life-
Threatening Food Allergies
Methods and Best Practices
This section presents methods and best practices for creating a safe environment for
students with life-threatening food allergies related to developing written protocols,
ensuring preparedness, and implementing prevention measures. Each of these
methods and best practices are described in more detail below.
Develop Written Protocols
The following best practices concern creating plans for allergy planning and
management.
(1) Develop an allergy management and prevention plan
School nurses should consider leading an interdisciplinary team to develop and
implement an allergy management and prevention plan.375 If schools are claiming
exemption from other requirements of 105 CMR 590.011, schools must have written
protocols and procedures for identifying, documenting, and accommodating students
with food allergies. Allergy management and prevention plans should include cafeteria,
classroom environmental, custodial, and emergency response protocols and guidelines.
As necessary, allergen-free spaces should be designated in the cafeteria and in
classrooms. Among other components, the plan should specify cleaning products and
hand-washing protocols.144
(2) Develop and maintain individual health care plans
School nurses should maintain individual care plans for students with life-threatening
allergies, which should include the actions to take if an allergic reaction occurs. Written
504 plans (plans to give kids with disabilities the support they need at school)
personalized for each student with life-threatening allergies should also be written and
implemented as appropriate.376 As deemed necessary by school nurses, other school
personnel supervising or providing services to the student in a high-risk setting (e.g., the
cafeteria) should review and be aware of care plans.144
264
VII. Additional Details Related to Goal 2: Achieve Healthy Schools

Facilitate Food Allergy Preparedness
The following best practices help schools prepare for severe allergic reactions.
(3) Conduct training on life-threatening allergies and emergency response
All staff who supervise students must receive basic training on life-threatening allergies
and have education on the prevention and management of allergic conditions as it
relates to their assigned duties.144,375 The training must meet DESE and DPH
requirements.
(4) Maintain a supply of epinephrine auto-injectors in a secure location
Each school should maintain an unexpired supply of epinephrine auto-injectors in a
secure, unlocked location. All personnel approved to administer epinephrine to students
should know of and have access to this location.144 School bus drivers must receive
training on the administration of epinephrine.377
Implement Prevention Measures
The following best practices can be implemented to reduce the likelihood that exposure
to an allergen will cause an incident of anaphylactic shock at school.
(5) Prohibit eating food on school buses or in classrooms
To limit potential exposures, eating food on school buses should be prohibited, where
possible. In addition, eating food in classrooms should be prohibited or limited to labeled
approved foods. If food is allowed in classrooms, do not allow students to share food
and encourage hand-washing before the consumption of food.144,375
(6) Prevent cross-contact in food
Cross-contact is the transfer of food allergens from one surface or food to another
surface or food and can occur during food storage, preparation, or serving, as well as
during dish cleaning or dining. Schools must create protocols to prevent cross-contact
to protect people with food allergies. Measures to prevent cross-contact include storing
allergen-free foods in a designated space; designating an allergen-free food preparation
zone; fully cleaning and sanitizing containers, food preparation tools, and surfaces after
each use with warm, soapy water; following strict hygiene procedures; discouraging
students from sharing food; cleaning cafeteria tables after each use; and encouraging
proper hand hygiene. In addition, allergen-free foods should be prepared before any
allergen-containing foods.144,375
(7) Display a food allergen awareness poster
As required in M.G.L. c. 140, § 6B, schools must display an approved allergen
awareness poster in food preparation areas to remind food preparation personnel of the
importance of allergy-safe spaces and of common food allergens.378
265
VII. Additional Details Related to Goal 2: Achieve Healthy Schools

Statutes, Regulations, and Standards
Statutes, regulations, and standards related to creating a safe environment for students
with life-threatening food allergies are detailed below.
Relevant Statutes
M.G.L. c. 90, § 8A requires all licensed school bus drivers to complete a pre-service
school bus driver training, including a basic first aid course including instruction on the
administration of an epinephrine auto-injector.377
M.G.L. c. 71, § 55A limits the liability of public school employees who administer first
aid in good faith as a result of their actions or omissions of first aid. M.G.L c. 90, § 8A
specifically notes that this also applies to bus drivers providing first aid, including
administration of an epinephrine auto-injector.379
M.G.L. c. 140, § 6B establishes food allergy awareness protocols for licensed food
sellers. Requirements include the prominent display of a food allergy awareness poster,
notice on all menus of the customer’s obligation to inform the server about food
allergies, and manager training on food allergies. Schools approved to participate in
USDA Child Nutrition Programs may qualify for an exemption from parts of this law if
schools can demonstrate the following:380
• There are written policies and procedures for identifying, documenting, and
accommodating students with food allergies.
• There is documentation verifying participation in food allergen training that is
recognized by DESE and DPH.
Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), Title II prohibits discrimination against
qualified individuals with disabilities participating in state and local government
programs and services, including public schools. Life-threatening allergies are
considered disabilities, and all public and charter schools are covered under this act.155
Rehabilitation Act of 1973, Section 504 enables individuals with a disability to fully
participate in and receive the benefits of any program receiving federal financial
assistance. Life-threatening allergies are considered disabilities, and most public
schools will receive federal funding of some nature, including national school meal
programs. 381
Relevant Regulations
105 CMR 210.100 governs the administration of prescription medications in public and
private schools in Massachusetts. Any properly trained school personnel may
administer epinephrine in cases where the school nurse is not available, provided the
school district registers with DPH.382
266
VII. Additional Details Related to Goal 2: Achieve Healthy Schools

105 CMR 590.011 contains food allergy awareness requirements for all Massachusetts
food establishments.383 This regulation requires display of a food allergen poster, a
notice requesting a customer to make the food establishment aware of an allergen, and
mandatory training requirements. Public and private schools and educational institutions
are exempt from these requirements if they are approved to participate in USDA Child
Nutrition Programs. However, regardless of their participation in the USDA programs,
schools must train employees in food allergy awareness and provide written policies
and procedures for identifying and accommodating students with food allergies and
documentation verifying participation in food allergen training satisfying DESE and DPH
requirements.
CFR Title 10, Subtitle B, Chapter II, Subchapter A, Part 210 (National School
Lunch Program) requires schools (as a condition for receiving federal reimbursement
for school meals) to make substitutions for students whose disability restricts their diet
and for students who cannot consume the regular lunch or afterschool snack because
of medical or other special dietary needs. A physician or other recognized medical
authority must provide a signed statement to make substitutions.384

Objective 2i. Create a Productive Learning Environment for All
Students
2i(1) Optimize Lighting
Methods and Best Practices
The following best practices focus on enhancing natural and artificial lighting in schools
to promote visual comfort in the classroom.
268
VII. Additional Details Related to Goal 2: Achieve Healthy Schools

(1) Integrate both natural and artificial lighting throughout schools
High-quality lighting in the classroom should come from both natural and artificial
sources because natural light can promote health benefits while artificial light can
ensure appropriate illuminance.145,385 The direction and amount of daylight that enters a
space should be taken into account when designing the overall lighting system in the
classroom.145 Controls should be available to dim or turn off artificial lighting when
sufficient daylight is available, and window shades should be available when daylight is
excessive.145
(2) Consider illuminance, color temperature, and glare
In addition to natural and artificial lighting sources, it is important to consider factors
such as illuminance, color temperature, and glare. An illuminance level of 350 lux is
recommended for reading text in a normal-sized font with ease.120 Research suggests,
however, that 500-1,000 lux is more appropriate for the classroom.385 Additionally, color
temperature, measured as the thermal temperature of a light source, should be low to
better mimic natural daylight.120,385 Lastly, efforts should be taken to reduce or eliminate
glare by considering how light enters the classroom and where it may hit reflective
surfaces.145 Further, using shades and blinds to control the amount of natural light that
enters or modifying the brightness level of artificial light can be effective for minimizing
glare.
Statutes, Regulations, and Standards
The following standard is focused on promoting high-quality lighting in educational
facilities.
Relevant Standards
ANSI/IES RP-3-13 pertains to lighting in educational facilities and covers lighting
design, quality, equipment, and energy controls.386

2i(2) Optimize Acoustic Performance
Methods and Best Practices
The following best practice focuses on creating optimal acoustic performance in the
classroom by reducing reverberation time and background noise.
(1) Reduce Sound Reverberation Time and Minimize Background Noise in
Classrooms
Schools should reduce sound

percent of the sound waves that
strike the material is absorbed.387
270
VII. Additional Details Related to Goal 2: Achieve Healthy Schools

Further, ceiling panels should have a high ceiling attenuation class value to reduce the
noise traveling through walls.387 Walls should also be constructed with sufficient
insulation to reduce noise transmission.388 Flooring can also assist in absorbing sound
waves; for example, carpeting, in particular, can reduce overall background noise.387
Lastly, HVAC units can be one of the primary sources of background noise in a
classroom.145,387 Centralized systems have reduced noise levels as compared to window
units; thus, these systems should be employed where possible, and air handlers or any
other equipment should be installed away from classrooms and near inherently noisy
areas such as cafeterias and gymnasiums.387
Statutes, Regulations, and Standards
The following standard addresses classroom acoustics and sets limits for optimal
speech intelligibility.

Objective 2j. Design the Built Environment to Foster a Peaceful
School Community
Methods and Best Practices
Methods and best practices for designing the built environment to foster a peaceful
school community are organized into three categories. The first focuses on reducing
stressors resulting from the built environment, the second focuses on designing spaces
in school buildings to support overall well-being, and the third focuses on designing
spaces that facilitate positive social interactions at school.
271
VII. Additional Details Related to Goal 2: Achieve Healthy Schools

Reduce Stressors
Reducing stressors from the built environment reduces tension experienced by students
and school staff members, an important step to facilitate a peaceful atmosphere.
Schools can reduce stressors associated with the built environment by reducing
crowding and environmental stressors.
(1) Reduce crowding
Crowding in schools can increase stress and the likelihood of pushing/shoving, leading
to further negative outcomes. 389–391 Schools should provide building spaces that are
sufficiently wide enough to accommodate students and staff members to reduce
crowding and resulting adverse outcomes. Areas to focus on include bathrooms, locker
rooms, hallways, stairways, entrances and exits to buildings, classrooms, and other
school spaces.
(2) Reduce environmental stressors
Environmental stressors such as noise, excessive lighting, poor air quality, and
uncomfortable temperatures are, by definition, stressful to the human body. Optimizing
environmental conditions reduces these stressors and improves well-being.392–394 Best
practices include using natural lighting through windows and skylights, acoustics to
minimize stressful noises, maintaining thermal comfort, and ensuring air is free of
pollutants or unpleasant odors. See Objective 2a. Improve Air Quality, Objective 2c.
Maintain Thermal Comfort, and Objective 2i. Create a Productive Learning Environment
for All Students for additional details and best practices for mitigating this collection of
environmental stressors.
Design Spaces to Support Wellbeing
Designing spaces to support wellbeing promotes positive experiences within the school
environment and enables students and staff members to be at their best, which, in turn,
supports a peaceful school community. Schools can meet this objective by providing
spaces to support neurocognitive balance, incorporating access to both indoor and
outdoor nature, and using colors and textures that promote a peaceful environment.
(3) Provide spaces to support neurocognitive balance
Indoor and outdoor facility design can calm or activate people’s neurological and
cognitive systems in various ways—by promoting alertness, agitation, vigilance,
distraction and calmness. For schools, the design goal is two-fold: to design facilities
that support neurocognitive balance and, where possible, to provide specific spaces that
are calming (when students’ minds and nervous systems are over-activated) or
activating (when students’ minds and nervous systems are shut down).392,393 In addition,
some students benefit from indoor and outdoor spaces that satisfy their need for
physical movement. See Objective 3b. Prioritize Universal Accessibility for additional
discussion of the design of neuro-inclusive spaces.
272
VII. Additional Details Related to Goal 2: Achieve Healthy Schools

(4) Incorporate access to both indoor and outdoor nature
Schools should provide students and staff with access to nature in diverse forms (e.g.,
visual, tactile). This can include nature-related art, windows with nature views, and live
plantings—both indoors and outdoors. Access to nature has been shown to have
important stress-relieving benefits and supports overall wellbeing,389,393–395 which in turn
contributes to a peaceful community.
(5) Use colors and textures that promote a peaceful environment
Color choices and textures facilitate calming environments supportive of learning and
positive interactions.392,395 Schools should incorporate textures and colors appropriate
for each space, considering how these materials will impact students’ experiences.
Design Spaces to Facilitate Positive Social Interactions
Designing spaces to facilitate positive social interactions supports the type of
engagement that fosters a sense of community within the school. Schools can achieve
these design goals by providing diverse communal spaces and designing spaces for
students and staff members to move easily.
(6) Provide diverse communal spaces
Schools should provide diverse communal spaces to facilitate positive engagement
among students and staff members. Spaces of different shapes, sizes, and purposes
will allow students with different needs to engage with others in a safe space.
(7) Design spaces for easy movement
Feeling safe is a critical component of promoting positive social engagement. Schools
should use care in the layout of school buildings to design spaces that facilitate easy
movement of students and staff. Layouts that can trap students in a corner or nook can
make them feel less safe, given the loss of freedom of movement. While designing
space, consider traffic patterns in areas of congestion (e.g., hallways, stairwells).
Statutes, Regulations, and Standards
Statutes, regulations, and standards provide baseline requirements and expectations for
topics relevant to fostering a peaceful school community. These include fire regulations,
building code occupancy limits, and minimum standards regarding environmental
conditions such as temperature, noise, air quality, and lighting. These frameworks are
designed with a different objective than the primary objective of fostering a peaceful
school community, which goes far beyond the minimum expectations of specific statutes
and regulations. Therefore, these are not covered in detail in this section. See Objective
2a. Improve Air Quality; Objective 2c. Maintain Thermal Comfort; and Objective 2i.

VIII. Additional Details Related to Goal 3: Achieve Equitable Outcomes for All Students

Objective 3a. Optimize Space to Equitably Meet Special Education
Needs
Methods and Best Practices
This section summarizes the methods and best practices for optimizing space to meet
special education needs equitably in schools.
(1) Design inclusive classrooms
Inclusion classrooms contain students with and without disabilities, incorporating
supports for students in need of special education services. Students who receive
special education in a full inclusion setting spend 80 to 100 percent of their day in a
general education setting, while students with partial inclusion spend 40 to 80 percent of
their day in general education.396 Inclusion classrooms are often, but not always, the
least restrictive learning environment for students receiving special education. In
Massachusetts, 18 percent of students are eligible for special education services; of
those students, approximately 60 percent are placed in an inclusion classroom.397
Inclusion classrooms benefit students both with and without disabilities. A review of
special education in Massachusetts found that students with disabilities placed in
inclusion settings were five times more likely to graduate high school in five years or
fewer compared to their peers placed in substantially separate settings.149 A study
completed in 2021 found that students without disabilities also benefit from inclusion
classrooms.398 Maximizing the impact of inclusive classrooms requires designing
classrooms with diverse learning needs in mind.
Student placement should always be based on individual needs rather than available
space.153 Existing schools are somewhat limited by existing classroom space; however,
schools undergoing renovations or being newly constructed should prioritize designing
inclusive classrooms. Inclusion classrooms should be large enough to accommodate
push-in services, like small breakout groups.396 When pull-out services are required,
resource rooms, which can be smaller, should be in the vicinity of general
classrooms.396
In some cases, substantially separate classrooms are the most appropriate learning
environment to meet student needs. Inclusion practices for substantially separate
classrooms involve locating these classrooms within general education neighborhoods,
ensuring rooms are the same size as general education classrooms, and placing
students of similar ages and grade levels together.396 Additionally, gymnasiums,
auditoriums, art rooms, and any other room that might supplement general education
should be accessible to students in substantially separate settings to maximize inclusion
opportunities when appropriate.
276
VIII. Additional Details Related to Goal 3: Achieve Equitable Outcomes for All Students

(2) Avoid clustering special education spaces
Massachusetts state regulations require that all eligible students have access to the
school facilities necessary for implementing a student’s IEP.399 State regulation also
requires that steps are taken to minimize the stigmatization of students receiving special
education.399 Classrooms designed to serve students with disabilities, like resource
rooms or substantially separate classrooms, should never be clustered away from the
age-appropriate general education neighborhood.396,399 To meet the LRE mandate,
schools must ensure every student, regardless of disability, has access to the general
education curriculum and environment whenever possible. Special education
classrooms should not be identifiable by signs or other means that differentiate them
from classrooms that serve non-disabled students.399
Existing schools should evaluate how classrooms are dispersed throughout the school
to determine if special education classrooms are clustered or located outside of age-
appropriate classroom neighborhoods. This evaluation should also ensure that special
education classrooms are not identified by signs or other means that stigmatize
students.
Schools undergoing renovation and new schools should plan classroom neighborhoods
to maximize the inclusion of special education services. These schools should consult
with UD experts (see best practice 3) to develop plans that optimize the school layout
so every student can access the general education environment, where appropriate.
Gymnasiums, auditoriums, and other elective classrooms and extracurricular spaces
should be accessible to every student in the school community, including students in
substantially separate classrooms.
(3) Prioritize principles of universal design
UD challenges the typical design approach for the “average user” and focuses on
developing designs with accessibility at the forefront.400 This is accomplished by
creating designs and products that are usable, accessible, and inclusive.400 Universal
design in learning (UDL) is an instructional approach aimed at creating a more inclusive
learning environment by providing adequate accommodations and eliminating
unnecessary barriers to the learning process.401,402 Together, UD and UDL improve
accessibility by guiding the development of buildings as well as the development of
computers, computer software, curriculum, instruction, and a host of other products and
services. Schools that incorporate principles of UD and UDL are better equipped to
serve students, staff members, and visitors with and without disabilities.400,403
Existing schools are limited by their physical structure and layout; however, there are
still ways to incorporate UD and UDL without renovations, especially in classroom
settings.404,405 Classrooms can be equipped with more physically accessible furniture
and furniture layouts. This can include upgrading to larger desks and ensuring desks
and chairs are not connected. Some resources for removing existing barriers and
incorporating elements of UD are included in Table 95.
277
VIII. Additional Details Related to Goal 3: Achieve Equitable Outcomes for All Students

Schools undergoing extensive renovations and newly constructed schools should
incorporate UD from the planning stage. The construction of Danahey Park in
Cambridge, MA, is an example of a project that incorporated UD from the planning
stage—ensuring the park is physically accessible while also accommodating the
sensory, cognitive, and emotional needs of users.406
(4) Collaborate within and across districts
With adequate planning, larger school districts in urban and suburban areas can ensure
that most students receive placements in the LRE within their district. Only some
schools will be able to serve students with the highest needs; with proper planning,
however, school districts can coordinate the placement of special education services
throughout the district. These services should be dispersed across the district to ease
accessibility for all.
In some cases, districts may only be able to meet the needs of some students. This is
more common in smaller and rural districts with limited resources; however, this can
also be challenging for larger districts. Collaboration across districts can help maximize
efficiencies when serving students with the highest needs. Massachusetts has 24
Education Collaboratives across the Commonwealth designed to increase regional
capacity and resources.407 Similar coordination should occur across collaboratives to
meet every student’s needs. When out-of-district placements are determined to be the
best option for servicing a student’s IEP and transportation is a requirement on the
student’s IEP, the student is entitled to receive transportation.151
Statutes, Regulations, and Standards
Relevant Statutes
M.G.L., c.71B: Children with Special Needs guarantees all school-aged children
(ages 3 to 21) in Massachusetts a “free and appropriate public education in the least
restrictive environment” regardless of disability.152 This statute is formerly known as
M.G.L. c.766, which pre-dated federal special education legislation.152
20 U.S.C §§ 1400-1482 Individuals with Disabilities in Education Act guarantees
free and appropriate public education to all eligible children with disabilities throughout
the nation. This statute protects the rights of children with disabilities and assists states,
localities, and other entities with providing those services.150

CFR Part 300 et seq) in Massachusetts schools so students receive services designed
to develop their individual potential in the least restrictive environment.151,399
34 CFR Part 300: Assistance to States for the Education of Children requires that
children with disabilities receive educational and other services in the least restrictive
environment. Removal of a student from an inclusion setting only happens if inclusion
cannot be achieved with supplementary aids and services due to the nature or severity
of the disability.409
Relevant Standards
Continuum of alternative services and placements: School districts must provide or
arrange for the placement of each student in an educational setting appropriate for their
learning needs from the time they are three to 21 years old.410
Equal opportunity to participate in educational, nonacademic, extracurricular, and
ancillary programs, as well as participation in regular education: Students
receiving special education in both inclusion and substantially separate settings must
have equal opportunity to participate in additional programs, classes, and extra-
curricular activities offered to students in a general education setting.410
Least restrictive program selected: Students must be placed in programming with the
least restrictive environment. If a student is removed from the general education
classroom, there must be a clear explanation for why the less restrictive environment is
appropriate for the student’s needs.410
MA Local Education Agency (LEA) Special Education Determinations: DESE
determines the needs for assistance or intervention in special education for every Local
Education Agency (LEA). LEAs are scored based on performance and compliance data

Intervention.411
Special education facilities and classrooms. School districts must provide facilities
and classrooms that maximize the inclusion of special education students in the school
community. These facilities and classrooms must provide appropriate accessibility for
the implementation of each student’s IEP and must be equal in all physical respects to
the average general education setting.410

VIII. Additional Details Related to Goal 3: Achieve Equitable Outcomes for All Students

Objective 3b. Prioritize Universal Accessibility
Methods and Best Practices
This section describes the methods and best practices for prioritizing universal
accessibility in schools. Prioritizing universal accessibility is addressed in three sections:
• Physical Disabilities: Design Physically Accessible Spaces
• Transgender, Non-Binary, and Intersex Experience: Design Gender-Inclusive
Spaces
• Neurodivergence: Design Neuro-Inclusive Spaces
Physical Disabilities: Design Physically Accessible Spaces
This section describes the methods and best practices for creating accessible and safe
spaces for students with physical disabilities.
(1) Evaluate barriers to physical access
Ensuring physical accessibility in schools is necessary to meet legal requirements and
to guarantee students full access to the school community. By minimizing barriers to
physical access, school districts across Massachusetts can better serve their students.
Minimizing barriers to physical access requires understanding the barriers that exist.
Not all physical barriers are legal violations since the ADA includes certain exemptions;
however, ensuring all students have equal access to a free education in a least
restrictive environment requires school districts to minimize as many physical barriers to
learning as possible. Whether a school is planning to undergo renovations or not,
school districts, administrators, educators, and other staff members should be aware of
existing barriers to physical access and develop plans to mitigate or eliminate those
barriers.404 It’s important to note that not every solution will work for every school or
classroom; however, all schools should strive to improve physical accessibility
whenever feasible.
There are formal and informal methods to evaluate the physical accessibility of the
school. Formal audits of school accessibility can be costly. However, schools or school
districts can perform evaluations using in-house staff and resources. The “ADA
Checklist for Existing Facilities” (see Table 97) is a helpful checklist that summarizes the
accessibility requirements in the Department of Justice’s ADA Title II regulations,
28CFR Part 35.150.412 This checklist includes information on how to use the checklist
and conduct the survey, as well as post-survey activities. Since the survey was
developed for use in multiple places of public accommodation, not every section of the
survey is relevant to school facilities. Moreover, the survey does not cover classroom-
specific features, such as ensuring accessible paths through desks and lab spaces,
which schools should also consider.
281
VIII. Additional Details Related to Goal 3: Achieve Equitable Outcomes for All Students

(2) Prioritize universal access to school buildings
No two schools will have the same results following an accessibility evaluation. The
ADA Checklist covers many of the barriers to physical access that schools need to
address. A study from the U.S. Government Accountability Office on the accessibility of
school facilities found that two-thirds of school districts identified barriers that can limit
access to people with disabilities in a quarter or more of their school facilities.413 The top
five barriers found across school facilities are listed below.413
• Lack of accessible signs
• Playground barriers (e.g., mulch or other ground surface barriers)
• Door hardware that requires tight grasping, pinching, or twisting of wrist
• Assembly stages requiring steps
• Restroom barriers (e.g., lack of bathroom grab bars or exposed sink pipes)
The following are best practices schools should consider to provide universal access.
(2a) Update signage
ADA Standards call for accessible signs to identify spaces and accessibility elements in
public areas.414 Schools should update or add visual and tactile signs to identify
permanent rooms and spaces, provide directional information, indicate accessibility, and
highlight means of egress in compliance with ADA Sign Standards.
(2b) Update door handles
ADA Standards require door handles to be operable with one hand, not require tight
grasping, pinching, or twisting of the wrist, operate with five pounds of maximum force,
and be located 34-48 inches off the ground.415 Schools with non-compliant door handles
should invest in upgrades.
(2c) Update doors (i.e., remove heavy doors, add automatic door openers, etc.)
Doors and gates that provide accessible routes for user passage are required to comply
with ADA Standards. Compliance guidelines for doors and entryways cover
requirements for maneuvering clearance, thresholds, surface texture, hardware,
viewing, opening force, and closing speed.415
(2d) Add ramps and chair lifts
Ramps and chair lifts can help make entryways more accessible when modifying the
building or adding an elevator is not possible. ADA Standards define the necessary
safety elements, slope, and landing requirements for ramps,416 as well as the
requirements for lifts.417
282
VIII. Additional Details Related to Goal 3: Achieve Equitable Outcomes for All Students

(2e) Update bathroom infrastructure (i.e., sinks, stalls, etc.)
Bathrooms that do not meet ADA Standards should be altered for compliance. Existing
facilities have multiple avenues for ensuring adequate access to ADA-compliant
bathrooms.418 Bathroom updates for accessibility can also incorporate design elements
to increase gender-inclusive access to maximize the benefits of updates.
Transgender, Non-Binary, and Intersex Experience: Design Gender-Inclusive
Spaces
This section describes the methods and best practices for creating safe and inclusive
school environments for transgender, non-binary, and intersex students.
(3) Evaluate gender-based rules, policies, and practices
Students in Massachusetts are protected from discrimination based on gender identity
and sexual orientation.156,419 Schools and school districts should review their policies
and procedures to eliminate rules that perpetuate gender-based discrimination. This
includes examining policies around student records, bathroom and changing facility
access, dress codes, and any other gender-based policies.
(4) Provide access to gender-inclusive restrooms, locker rooms, and changing
facilities
All students should have access to a restroom, locker room, and changing facility that
aligns with their gender identity. If students do not feel safe accessing a facility, an
appropriate alternative should be made available. For existing facilities, this can include
changing a staff restroom to an all-gender restroom or providing access to the restroom
in the nurse’s office.
Newly constructed and renovated schools should strive to incorporate UD principles
from the planning stage forward. Restrooms, locker rooms, and changing facilities
designed around gender inclusion benefit everyone because they increase privacy,
physical accessibility, and safety.420
Neurodivergence: Design Neuro-Inclusive Spaces
This section describes the methods and best practices for creating safe and inclusive
school environments for neurodivergent students.
(5) Evaluate the school’s sensory landscape
Students spend much of their day at school. The sensory environment of a school
impacts all students; however, for some neurodivergent students, the sensory
environment has a larger impact.421,422 The sensory environment includes the school
building’s visual, auditory, and tactile stimuli. Currently, there are no readily available
sensory evaluation guides, but there is information on how to create sensory-friendly
environments that can inform how to design for the sensory experience (see Table 97).
283
VIII. Additional Details Related to Goal 3: Achieve Equitable Outcomes for All Students

(6) Design with sensory experiences in mind
Designing spaces to accommodate the sensory needs of neurodiverse students
benefits all students. Existing schools will be limited when addressing specific sensory
needs since the physical environment is somewhat set. Existing schools can prioritize
minimizing excessive visual, auditory, and tactile stimuli where possible. This can
involve replacing harsh light fixtures, installing sound-dampening materials, and
changing other elements of the environment (see Objective 2i. Create a Productive
Learning Environment for All Students for additional details about optimized lighting and
acoustics). In addition to making these changes, existing schools can create sensory
spaces designed to support the needs of neurodivergent students best.423
Newly constructed and renovated schools should consult experts on creating sensory-
friendly spaces throughout the school. From hallways to cafeterias and classrooms,
every student deserves to be in an environment designed to meet their needs.
Thoughtfully designing with neuro-inclusion can help decrease changes necessitated by
overstimulation and increase the time students spend with their peers focusing on the
task at hand, whether that is eating lunch, playing at recess, or learning in the
classroom.424

521 CMR 12.00, Architectural Access Board: Educational Facilities regulates
accessibility of public and private schools and other educational facilities across the
Commonwealth. All administrative and instructional spaces shall comply with the
regulations as well as any areas open to students or the general public.426
603 CMR 26.00, Access to Equal Educational Opportunity requires that students at
public schools of the Commonwealth have equal rights of access and opportunities
during their course of study at public schools and that public schools do not discriminate
based on race, color, sex, gender identity, religion, national origin, or sexual orientation.
This law takes precedence over any local law or rule or organization’s regulation that
discriminates on the aforementioned basis.419
28 CFR Part 35, Title II Regulations, Nondiscrimination on the Basis of Disability
in State and Local Government guarantees the rights of people with disabilities to fully
participate in all aspects of civic life by requiring all state and local governments to
follow ADA regulations regardless of municipality’s size.412
28 CFR Part 36, Title III Regulations, Nondiscrimination on the Basis of Disability
by Public Accommodations and in Commercial Facilities guarantees the rights of
people with disabilities to participate fully in all aspects of life by requiring most
businesses to follow ADA regulations regardless of the size of their business or the age
of the building.427
34 CFR Part 106, Title IX Regulations, requires the adoption of grievance procedures
to ensure complaints of sexual discrimination receive fair, prompt, and equitable
resolutions. Expands the meaning and clarifies the definition of sex discrimination to
include discrimination based on sex stereotypes, sex characteristics, pregnancy or
related conditions, sexual orientation, and gender identity.428
Relevant Standards
2010 ADA Standards for Accessible Design describes the requirements that must be
met when constructing new buildings and facilities or altering existing buildings and
facilities. Defines architectural barriers and explains how to remove them without
difficulty or expense to an existing building.429
Table 96 summarizes the statutes, regulations, and standards related to prioritizing
universal accessibility.

IX. Conclusion
Massachusetts led the nation with the creation of the oldest public school system in the
United States. While that legacy is a testament to our commitment to the betterment of
our citizens, this legacy also leads to Massachusetts having an antiquated school
infrastructure that is dispersed across a range of geographic locations including urban,
rural, and those close to industrial activity. As this report demonstrates, the complexity
and the interdependency of the types of problems these schools and districts face, as
well as the complexity and interdependencies of the short-term and long-term solutions
to address these problems is highly variable and, in some instances, require significant
resources. This document strives to provide both high-level and detailed explanations of
strategies to help Massachusetts schools incorporate sustainable design, construction,
and operations and provide a healthy environment for all staff and students.
