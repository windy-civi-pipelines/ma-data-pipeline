43 emergency situations or where proof of inability to pay is presented.
44 After the filing of the complaint, the commissioner shall cause to be issued and served in
45 the name of the commission, a written notice, together with a copy of such complaint, as the
46 same may have been amended, requiring the person, employer, labor organization, or
47 employment agency named in such complaint, hereinafter referred to as the respondent, to
48 answer the charges and state its position regarding such complaint in writing within 45 days of

52 conference within 90 days from receipt of respondent's position statement and if it is not so held
53 within 90 days, or the complainant fails to attend the investigative conference, the complaint is
54 dismissed, unless good cause is shown for the absence. If an attorney represents either the
55 complainant or the respondent, the investigative officer will also be an attorney with the
56 commission.
57 If such investigative officer shall determine after such investigation that no probable
58 cause exists for crediting the allegations of the complaint, or 365 days from receipt of the

59 complaint by the commission has passed, the commission shall dismiss the complaint, and within
60 ten days from such dismissal, cause to be issued and served upon the complainant written notice
61 of such dismissal.

63 from receipt of the complaint, that probable cause exists for crediting the allegations of any
64 complaint, the commissioner may allow for limited discovery provided that, based on traditional
65 rules of evidence, discovery orders be issued or denied within 30 days of request by the
66 investigative officer and provided that the investigative officer state in writing the reasons why
67 discovery will materially benefit resolution of the complaint, both parties will be given a 90 day
68 discovery period. Both parties will submit a pre-determination memorandum of fact and law 30

71 motions and if accepted, the commission will dismiss the complaint and notify in writing both
72 parties and their attorneys of their right to elect judicial determination of the complaint. The
73 person making such an election shall give notice of such election to the commission and to all
74 other parties and their attorneys. The commission shall establish rules of practice for removing a
75 case to federal or state court. If a motion for summary judgment is denied, the commission will

79 to attend, except where there is a showing of good cause, that party will be defaulted. The
4 of 5

80 testimony taken at hearings and conferences shall be under oath and transcribed at the request of
81 any party.
82 If, upon all the evidence at the public hearing, the commission shall find that a
83 respondent has engaged in any unlawful practice as defined above, the commission shall state its
84 findings of fact and shall issue and cause to be served on such respondent an order requiring such
