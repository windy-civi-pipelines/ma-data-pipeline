MassHealth
Introduction
submits this report to the Legislature in conformance with Section 80 of Chapter 118E of the
Massachusetts General Laws.
Under Section 265 of Chapter 224 of the Acts of 2012, the Office of Medicaid was authorized to
promulgate regulations requiring any Medicaid health plan, managed care organization (MCO)
and their health plans, and any behavioral health management firms and third-party administrators
that are under contract with a Medicaid MCO, to comply with the federal Paul Wellstone and Pete
Domenici Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act of 2008 (“the federal Act”) and
applicable state mental health parity laws, effective for contracts on or after January 1, 2013.

Section 2:
Section 80 of Chapter 118E of the Massachusetts General Laws requires MassHealth to perform a
mental health parity compliance examination of each Medicaid managed care organization,
accountable care organization or other entity contracted with the agency that manages or
administers mental health and substance use disorder benefits (collectively, “managed care
plans”) for the division at least once every 4 years. The law also requires MassHealth to collect
annual reports from its managed care plans relating to mental health parity compliance.
MassHealth is required to submit an annual report summarizing these reports to the legislature by
December 1 of each year.
State Regulations
Effective January 1, 2013, MassHealth promulgated regulations at 130 CMR 450.117(J) which
require its contracted managed care entities to comply with and implement applicable regulations
and federal guidance requiring parity between mental health or substance use disorder benefits and
medical/surgical benefits with respect to financial requirements and treatment limitations.
MassHealth then amended these regulations effective December 18, 2017, including moving them
to their own section at 130 CMR 450.123. The language of 130 CMR 450.123 can be found in the
Appendix of this report.
Federal Regulations
On March 30, 2016, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) promulgated final
federal regulations implementing federal mental health parity laws to Medicaid Managed Care
Organizations, Children’s Health Insurance Programs, and Alternative Benefit Plans. The new
regulations required compliance by October 2, 2017. MassHealth worked with its managed care
plans to ensure compliance and, on October 2, 2017, published information related to compliance
with these rules on the MassHealth website (https://www.mass.gov/service-details/mental-health-
parity-reports).
Language in Managed Care Contracts
MassHealth includes mental health parity requirements in its managed care entity contracts and
2
handbooks. Below are the mental health parity provisions that are in effect for the Accountable
Care Partnership Plans (ACPP), MCO plans, Senior Care Organizations (SCOs), and One Care
(ICO) plans.
MCO and ACPP Contract Language
All MCO and ACPP contracts include the following language:
In accordance with 130 CMR 450.123(B), the Contractor shall review its administrative and other
practices, including the administrative and other practices of any contracted Behavioral Health
organization, for the prior calendar year for compliance with the relevant provisions of the federal
Mental Health Parity Law, regulations and guidance and submit a certification to EOHHS in
accordance with 130 CMR 450.123(B)(1)-(3) and any additional instructions provided by
EOHHS.
SCO Contract Language
All SCO contracts contain the following language:
In accordance with 130 CMR 450.117(J), the Contractor shall review its administrative and other
practices, including the administrative and other practices of any contracted Behavioral Health
organization, for the prior calendar year for compliance with the relevant provisions of the
federal Mental Health Parity Law; regulations, including subpart K of 42 CFR 438; and
guidance; and submit a certification to EOHHS in accordance with 130 CMR 450.117(J) (l) and
any additional instructions provided by EOHHS.
One Care Plans (ICOs) Contract Language
All One Care plan contracts contain the following language:
The Contractor and providers must comply with the Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity
Act of 2008, including the requirements that treatment limitations applicable to mental health or
substance use disorder benefits are no more restrictive than the predominant treatment limitations
applied to substantially all medical and surgical benefits covered by the plan (or coverage), and
there are no separate treatment limitations that are applicable only with respect to mental health
or substance use disorder benefits.
Mental Health Parity Language in Managed Care Member Handbooks
MassHealth requires managed care plans to include information in their member handbooks
about mental health parity, including a description of the process for filing a grievance if a
member believes that services were not provided consistent with mental health parity
requirements. MassHealth drafted the following model language for the managed care plans to
include in their member handbooks:
3
Mental Health Parity
Federal and state laws require that all managed care organizations, including (insert Plan
name) provide behavioral health services to MassHealth members in the same way they provide
physical health services. This is what is referred to as “parity.” In general, this means that:

Section 3:
1. (insert Plan name) must provide the same level of benefits for any mental health and
substance abuse problems you may have as for other physical problems you may
have;

Section 4:
2. (insert Plan name) must have similar prior authorization requirements and treatment
limitations for mental health and substance abuse services as it does for physical health
services;

Section 5:
3. (insert Plan name) must provide you or your provider with the medical necessity criteria
used by (insert Plan name) for prior authorization upon your or your provider’s request;
and

Section 6:
4. (insert Plan name) must also provide you within a reasonable time frame the reason for
any denial of authorization for mental or substance abuse services.
If you think that (insert Plan name) is not providing parity as explained above, you have the right
to file a Grievance with (insert Plan name). For more information about Grievances and how to
file them, please see (insert section(s)) of your Member Handbook.
You may also file a grievance with MassHealth. You can do this by calling the MassHealth
Customer Service Center at 1-800-841-2900 (TTY: 1-800-497- 4648) Monday—Friday 8:00 a.m.
to 5:00 p.m.
MassHealth’s MCO, ACPP, One Care, and SCO plans have all added either the model language
or substantially similar language in their member handbooks. MassHealth continues to work with
plans, members, and advocates to address any concerns that arise related to mental health parity
and resolve any issues as quickly as possible.
Annual Managed Care Certifications of Compliance
MassHealth regulations at 130 CMR 450.123 require that contracted managed care plans review
their administrative and other practices, including those of any contracted behavioral health
organizations or third-party administrators, for compliance with the relevant provisions of the
mental health parity laws, regulations, and guidance. The regulations require the plans to submit a
report on their review of their practices and to either certify that their plans fully comply with the
4
federal mental health parity law and applicable state mental health parity laws and regulations or
identify areas of non-compliance and a corrective action plan to bring those practices into
compliance.
To effectuate this requirement, MassHealth requested that all MassHealth MCO, ACPP, One Care,
and SCO contractors submit a report and a statement from their Chief Executive Officer and their
Chief Medical Officer for Calendar Year 2024. Based upon our review of the certifications and the
supplemental information provided by the plans, MassHealth is pleased to report that all of our
contracted MCO, ACPP, One Care, and SCO managed care plans have certified their compliance
with the federal mental health parity law and applicable state mental health parity laws for calendar
year 2024. No managed care plan identified any disparities between mental health or substance use
disorder benefits and medical/surgical benefits with respect to financial requirements and treatment
limitations.
Conclusion
MassHealth continues to reinforce the implementation of parity and works with our plans to
ensure that there is parity between mental health or substance use disorder benefits and
medical/surgical benefits with respect to financial requirements and treatment limitations.
During 2024, MassHealth launched the new Office of Accountable Care and Behavioral Health
(ACBH), bringing together teams from the former Office of Behavioral Health (OBH), which
oversaw behavioral health initiatives, and the former Office of Payment and Care Delivery
Innovation (PCDI), which oversaw the Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs), Managed
Care Organizations (MCOs) and the Primary Care Clinician (PCC) Plan. The creation of the
Office of ACBH has improved how MassHealth meaningfully integrates the development and
implementation of policies across both physical and behavioral health. For example, the
integration of the two offices has brought together the contract management and operations staff
that oversee the ACO and MCO contracts and the staff that oversee the contract with
MassHealth’s behavioral health vendor, the Massachusetts Behavioral Health Partnership
(MBHP). This has helped standardize processes for key initiatives such as the review of
compliance with network adequacy standards and oversight of program areas such as member
and provider complaints.
Additionally, new in 2024, MassHealth began covering an annual behavioral health wellness
examination, which can be provided by a primary care provider in addition to licensed mental
health professionals. The BH Wellness examination includes an assessment to identify
behavioral health needs and appropriate resources for treatment. Additionally, in 2024
MassHealth continued to evaluate and develop policy related to the Children’s Behavioral
Health Initiative (CBHI), including the planned addition of a new service for members with
higher acuity needs - Family-based Intensive Treatment (FIT), updating the Community Service
Agency (CSA) Network, and enhancing provider trainings and streamlining referral processes
5
anticipated in 2025.
Also scheduled to go live in early 2025 is the Behavioral Health Treatment and Referral (TRP)
Platform. The TRP will support automation of the ED BH referral screening and evaluation
process, as well as creating a transparent view of patients seeking BH treatment for
participating organizations.
In furtherance of the Roadmap for Behavioral Health Reform, availability of Urgent Care
services has been expanded to include all Mental Health Centers regardless of their status as a
BH Urgent Care location. These innovations and initiatives will support the ability of individuals
and families to more easily access care when and where it is needed. Additional information on
the Roadmap can be found at www.mass.gov/BHRoadmap.
