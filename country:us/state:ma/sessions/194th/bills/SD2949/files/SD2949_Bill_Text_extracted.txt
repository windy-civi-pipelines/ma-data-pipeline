Re: Facility Inspection – Middlesex County Jail and House of Corrections, Billerica
Dear Sheriff Koutoujian:
The Massachusetts Department of Public Health’s, Bureau of Climate and Environmental Health (BCEH)
reorganized and consolidated its seven programs into six divisions. The Community Sanitation Program is now
the Division of Environmental Health Regulations and Standards (EHRS). Our division continues to support
correctional facilities and has added expertise for indoor air quality assessments for schools and other municipal
and state facilities. EHRS also used this opportunity to revise and update the format of the correctional bi-
annual inspection reports. This revised format clarifies new and repeat deficiencies outlined in regulation 105
CMR 451.000 and organizes deficiencies based on the 451.100, 451.200 and 451.300 series of provisions, as
well as other conditions that may constitute a threat to health and safety.
Throughout this process we understand there has been a delay in receiving your inspection report and we
appreciate your patience and understanding as we finalize the new report template. As you receive your reports,
please feel free to contact me if you have any questions or concerns.
Sincerely,
Amy Riordan, MPH
Senior Advisor, EHRS, BCEH

Re: Facility Inspection – Middlesex County Jail and House of Corrections, Billerica
Dear Sheriff Koutoujian:
The Massachusetts Department of Public Health’s, Bureau of Climate and Environmental Health (BCEH)
reorganized and consolidated its seven programs into six divisions. The Community Sanitation Program is now
the Division of Environmental Health Regulations and Standards (EHRS). Our division continues to support
correctional facilities and has added expertise for indoor air quality assessments for schools and other municipal
and state facilities. EHRS also used this opportunity to revise and update the format of the correctional bi-
annual inspection reports. This revised format clarifies new and repeat deficiencies outlined in regulation 105
CMR 451.000 and organizes deficiencies based on the 451.100, 451.200 and 451.300 series of provisions, as
well as other conditions that may constitute a threat to health and safety.
Throughout this process we understand there has been a delay in receiving your inspection report and we
appreciate your patience and understanding as we finalize the new report template. As you receive your reports,
please feel free to contact me if you have any questions or concerns.
Sincerely,
Amy Riordan, MPH
Senior Advisor, EHRS, BCEH
