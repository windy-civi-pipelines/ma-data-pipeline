CUMULATIVE IMPACT ACROSS THE COMMONWEALTH
Six dollars of impact generated by every dollar invested by PCI Members
The Property & Casualty Initiative insurance company members have invested $89 million
of capital into PCI since 1999. PCI staff have invested and re-invested that capital more
than six times, investing $549 million into affordable housing, community services, small
businesses and economic development. Additionally, every dollar that PCI invests attracts
five more dollars of public and private investment.
PCI provides the debt capital that is hardest to access
87%
financing needs of our borrowers. Securing capital for the earliest stages of real estate
projects is challenging, especially for organizations working in historically marginalized and
under-resourced communities. PCI provides this scarce financing that facilitates the
completion of critical community projects.
Affordable Housing Lending:
PCI lending has created or preserved over 8,000 units of housing
homes for our most vulnerable neighbors.
Community Services Lending:
Community service organizations provide the opportunities and services that families need
to thrive. PCI has partnered with 40 non-profit service organizations to meet their facility
needs, lending $60 million to support the following types of outcomes:
Enhanced educational opportunities for 8,000 young people annually
Culturally appropriate healthcare services to 187,000 patients annually
Emergency shelter for 1,500 unhoused individuals annually
Services for 91,000 clients ranging from medically tailored meals to affordable
fitness to violence prevention for system-involved youth.
Economic Development and Small Business Lending:
PCI invests in women and minority owned businesses to support equitable economic
development and wealth creation across the Commonwealth. We are proud to lend to
Cruz Companies, one of the oldest and largest 100% minority-owned businesses in New
England.
Cumulative Impact Across the Commonwealth 2

Our Mission & Vision
PCI works to improve the lives of our most vulnerable neighbors by investing capital and
expertise in communities to generate opportunities.
We invest in community assets that contribute to the health and well-being of all residents,
especially those with low-incomes and those who have been historically marginalized by
systemic racism. We focus investments where we can have significant impact:
Housing that is affordable and equitable and that connects residents to jobs,
schools, services and community assets that enable them to thrive and be healthy.
Quality community services such as healthcare, education, childcare and social
services that remove barriers to opportunity.
Income and wealth creating jobs and businesses, owned by people of color,
located in communities of color, that keep dollars circulating within the
neighborhood.
Economic development projects that enhance the quality of life for existing
residents in rapidly changing neighborhoods.
