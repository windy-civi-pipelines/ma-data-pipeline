MASSACHUSETTS DEPARTMENT
OF MENTAL HEALTH
MCPAP Service Report- FY23 and FY 24
Line Item 5042-5000 of Chapter 28 of the Acts of 2023, the Fiscal Year (FY) 2024 Budget, requires the Department of
Mental Health to report to the Massachusetts House and Senate Committees on Ways and Means the following
information:
1) An overview of Massachusetts Child Psychiatry Access Project (MCPAP) care coordination efforts
2) Number of psychiatric consultations, face-to-face consultations, and referrals made to specialists on behalf of
children with behavioral health needs in fiscal year 2023 and fiscal year 2024
3) Recommendations to increase the number of specialists receiving referrals through MCPAP and improve care
coordination efforts to identify specialists available and accepting new child and adolescent patients with
priority to those children and adolescents who exhibit complex conditions and experience long wait lists for
specialty psychiatry

Section 2:
1. Overview of MCPAP Care Coordination Efforts
The Massachusetts Child Psychiatry Access Program has provided resource and referral services to enrolled pediatric
practices when requested by a primary care physician (PCP) or other member of a youth’s care team such as a co-
located behavioral health clinician or care manager. These services include identifying appropriate behavioral health
treatment resources and providing contact information to the practice and/or on a limited basis to families. With the
launch of the Behavioral Health Help Line (BHHL) in January 2023 as the statewide front door to access behavioral
health services in Massachusetts, MCPAP’s resource and referral functions are now coordinated through the BHHL
starting in FY24. During the second half of FY23 MCPAP’s care coordination staff and the BHHL team participated in
training and coordination activities to establish a protocol for communication and collaboration between their services.

Section 3:
2. MCPAP Service Data and Trends-FY2023, FY2024
The following two tables present monthly, quarterly, and annual data on the number of overall MCPAP encounters,
consultations with MCPAP psychiatrists, face-to-face assessments with a MCPAP psychiatrist or a MCPAP behavioral
health clinician, resource and referral service, practice education activities, and behavioral health advocacy activities
completed in FY23 and in the first half of FY24.
MCPAP utilization in FY24 decreased by 14% (FY23 10,456 vs. FY 22 12,214). Of note, utilization increased significantly
during the pandemic compared to pre-pandemic utilization (FY 21 12,651 vs. FY19 9,999) but has declined since the
pandemic ended. Anecdotally, MCPAP consultants report that pediatricians are feeling problems returning to more like
before the pandemic. Looking at volume for after pandemic (FY23) vs before (FY(19) volume is up 5%.
The volume of MCPAP face-to -face assessments provided in FY23 increased by 8% (FY 23 3,225 vs. FY22 2,981),
continuing a trend that began during the pandemic fueled in large part by their practice of offering these assessments
via telehealth (i.e., videoconferencing). Although face-to-face assessments can again be done in person, for a statewide
program having the option of video/tele visits facilitates access for children who live at large distances from MCPAP’s
locations or who have limited access to transportation. Tele/video visits also helped with waiting times by allowing
teams to cover for each other without worrying about geography, for example a Boston team seeing someone living in
the Berkshires. Additionally, as clinicians have become more comfortable managing the more common behavioral
issues, the questions for MCPAP have become more complicated and more often require a consultation with the family
in addition to the consultation with the clinician. Again, this becomes a critical function that MCPAP can provide because
MCPAP can provide this usually within two weeks while the alternative would be a many months wait for a community
psychiatrist.
During FY23 the top three reasons for PCP calls to MCPAP were for diagnostic consultation (~27% of calls), medication
questions (~35% of calls), and medication evaluations that result in face-to-face assessments (~17% of calls).

Section 4:
3. Recommendations to increase the number of specialists receiving referrals through MCPAP and improve care
coordination efforts to identify specialists available and accepting new child and adolescent patients with priority
to those children and adolescents who exhibit complex conditions and experience long wait lists for specialty
psychiatry.
Beginning in 2017, MCPAP redesigned its resource and referral services to support PCPs and their practice teams in
becoming knowledgeable about specialist resources in their own communities. MCPAP provides the child’s PCP and/or
the PCP’s staff information on behavioral specialists, and then PCP and/or PCP staff work with the family to access the
specialty services. In the past year, MCPAP data has revealed that PCPs’ need for resource and referral support from
MCPAP teams is low relative to their other needs for MCPAP support. Only 6% of PCP calls are for resource and referral
support. This data suggests that pediatric primary care practices are increasingly providing resource and referral
support directly to their patients without needing MCPAP support. A 2019 utilization survey1 found that many could
provide resource and referral support to their patients and that 53% have a behavioral health provider on site, which
further explains the decrease in resource and referral requests to MCPAP. Another factor that may be contributing to
the reduction in requests for resource and referral services from MCPAP may be that pediatric practices as well as
caregivers may be requesting access to behavioral health services by utilizing the Behavioral Health Helpline.
These survey findings, combined with MCPAP encounter data trends from the past two years (i.e., decrease in resource
and referral encounters and an increase in face-to-face assessments), provide useful information about the overall
strengths and gaps in the Commonwealth’s children’s behavioral health system.
Over the past three years, MCPAP has partnered with the Boston Children’s Hospital Adolescent Substance Use and
Addiction Program (ASAP) to address the increasing use of substances in teens. Any pediatric primary care clinician
calling MCPAP with a substance use question receives a telephonic consultation from a member of the ASAP team. Over
the past 2 years, by billing the individual’s health insurance, ASAP has added the ability for teens and young adults
anywhere in the state to receive virtual substance use counseling visits both individual and group. In FY23, ASAP-MCPAP
delivered 1031 counseling sessions and provided 104 PCC consults for 161 youth. In the first 6 months of FY24 ASAP-
MCPAP delivered 391 counseling sessions and provided 31 PCC consults for 77 youth.
DMH maintains close collaboration with MassHealth and the Department of Public Health (DPH) on two specialized
MCPAP services that they fund. For over two years MCPAP expanded its array of services with funding from MassHealth
to address youth with Autism Spectrum Disorder and/or Intellectual Disability (MCPAP for ASD-ID) seen by the mobile
crisis teams. The patients receive a consultation from a licensed applied behavior analyst (LABA) and/or a physician
specializing in ASD/ID.
Supported by a federal Pediatric Mental Health Care Access (PMHCA) HRSA 5-year grant obtained by the Department of
Public Health that began in October 2021, MCPAP formed a team of early mental health childhood specialist
consultants to improve training to pediatric primary care clinicians in the management of children under 6 with
behavioral concerns (MCPAP for Early Childhood). Over the past year all MCPAP social workers have been trained by
the grant funded early childhood specialists to provide consultation, both to the provider and to the family, so this
service is now available throughout the state. A goal for FY24 is to increase MCPAP’s ability to assist primary care
clinicians with the diagnosis and management of youth with autism spectrum disorders. This expansion is supported by
an increase in funding from the HRSA grant.
1DMH contracted with DMA Health Strategies to conduct these interviews as part of the MCPAP Utilization Study.

Conclusion
MCPAP continues to address an important need within the continuum of behavioral health services in the
Commonwealth. By providing primary care physicians with prompt access to child psychiatrists and behavioral health
clinicians, MCPAP enables screening, assessment and if needed, prevention and/or mental health treatment to start
within primary care, supporting care integration.
A slight reduction in numbers of requests for MCPAP consultations seems to respond to the waning of the pandemic
crisis, while remaining higher than pre-pandemic numbers. As a result of DPH’s HRSA grant focusing on addressing infant
and early childhood mental health within primary care settings, the MCPAP teams have become better equipped to
respond to the particular behavioral health needs of very young children and their caregivers. During FY 24 and FY 25
this area of emphasis will expand the capacity of pediatric practices to assess and diagnose autism spectrum disorders in
young children, a service for which there are currently long waiting lists in the State.
MCPAP services continue to support the goals of the Roadmap for Behavioral Health Reform of providing access to
behavioral health treatment where and when people need it, by increasing the capacity of primary care practices to
offer more behavioral health assessment and treatment.
