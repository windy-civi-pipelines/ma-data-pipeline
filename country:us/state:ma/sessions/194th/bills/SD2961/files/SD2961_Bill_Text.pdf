Dear Members of the General Court:
I am pleased to submit this report which consolidates annual progress reports for FY23-
FY24. Each report describes the ongoing work of the Department of Elementary and
Secondary Education (Department) in supporting districts as they develop and implement
3-year plans, as detailed in Section 1S(c) of the Student Opportunity Act (Chapter 132 of
the Acts of 2019).
Districts’ 3-year plans, commonly referred to as SOA Plans, are intended to address—and
ultimately close—longstanding gaps in learning experiences, academic outcomes, and
lifetime outcomes for students from historically underserved groups. These include English
learners, students with disabilities, students from high-poverty backgrounds, as well as
other student groups.
The FY23 report focuses primarily on data collection and findings from districts’ FY23 SOA
Progress Reports, which reported on the second year of implementation of the first round
of 3-year SOA Plans. The FY24 report opens with some initial reflections on what we
learned from the first round of plans, which were implemented between FY22 and FY24.
For the first time since the pandemic, we are able to provide some early data on the
progress districts are making in meeting targets for student groups and closing gaps in
achievement. It then turns to statewide planning and data collection for districts’ second
set of 3-year plans, which were due April 1, 2024, and includes links to the FY24 SOA
Summary report, which describes in the aggregate what is contained in the second round
of SOA Plans.
The Department remains highly committed to the important work of substantially reducing
long-standing disparities in learning experiences and outcomes experienced by many of
our students. If you have any questions about the FY23 and FY24 progress updates, please
reach out to Jessica Leitz, Director of External Partnerships.
Regards,
Patrick Tutwiler, Interim Commissioner

Introduction
The Department of Elementary and Secondary Education respectfully submits this Report
to the Legislature: Student Opportunity Act Three-Year Evidence-Based Plans (2022-2023)
pursuant to Chapter 132 of the Acts of 2019, The Student Opportunity Act:
Annually, not later than December 31, the commissioner shall submit a report to the
clerks of the house of representatives and the senate and the chairs of the joint
committee on education on the progress made in addressing persistent disparities in
achievement among student subgroups in the aggregate and within subcategories on
a statewide basis; provided, however, that district and school-level data shall be
made available on the department’s website along with the report. (M.G.L. Ch. 69 §
1S (d))
The Student Opportunity Act (SOA) was enacted in 2019, infusing significant new funding
into the Commonwealth’s educational system, with the majority directed towards
chronically underfunded districts. The SOA legislation adopted the Foundation Budget
Review Commission’s October 2015 recommendations, which addressed the state’s
overall underinvestment in education and revised the Chapter 70 formula used to allocate
funds to districts by:
▪ Raising per pupil funding for English learners; more for those in high schools;
▪ Increasing special education enrollment and cost assumptions to more accurately
reflect district enrollment;
▪ Increasing funding for districts with high concentrations of poverty; and
▪ Increasing funding for healthcare costs of active employees and retirees by basing
costs on up-to-date health insurance trend data collected by the state’s Group
Insurance Commission (GIC)
By 2027, the state expects to increase Chapter 70 funding by more than $1.5 billion over
FY21 funding levels. The Department designated 25 districts that received $1.5 million or
more in additional Chapter 70 aid in FY22 as ‘high-funding’ districts (see Appendix A for the
list of high-funding districts). In FY23, 55 percent of the $494.9 million increase in Chapter

70 aid was distributed to these districts, with the remaining 45 percent distributed to the
294 remaining districts. In the academic year 2022-23, these 25 districts enrolled 32
percent of the Commonwealth’s students, served 59 percent of its English learners, almost
half (47 percent) of its low-income students, and just under one-third of students with
disabilities—groups that are explicitly addressed by the revised Chapter 70 funding
formula.
Three-year evidence-based plans to reduce disparities. Another key provision of the
SOA legislation requires every school district and charter school in the state to develop
three-year plans, referred to as SOA plans. These plans are the focus of this report to the
legislature.
The SOA legislation calls for districts’ 3-year gap-closing plans to include the following key
components:
• Based on an analysis of disaggregated analysis of state and local data, identify
which student groups are experiencing gaps in student learning experiences and
outcomes.
• The key evidence-based program areas the district is focusing on to narrow gaps for
identified student groups.
• Multi-funding stream investments districts are making in each identified evidence-
based program area.
• Metrics districts expect to use to measure progress.
• Family/caregiver engagement structures.
• Stakeholder involvement in the plan development and implementation process.
Every district, including charter school districts, is expected to develop a plan, regardless
of the amount of additional SOA funding it receives. Districts’ current SOA Plans cover
implementation years FY22-FY24. New 3-year plans covering implementation years FY25-
FY27 are due in April 2024.
Impact of the pandemic on SOA plan development and implementation. Due to the
substantial impact of the pandemic on districts and schools, the legislature granted DESE
the authority to delay the submission of districts’ first round of SOA Plans from April 2020
to January 2021. The initial infusion and distribution of additional Chapter 70 funding was
also delayed from FY21 to FY22. While the pandemic delayed the implementation of the
Student Opportunity Act, substantial funding from federal Elementary and Secondary
School Emergency Relief (ESSER) began flowing to districts in July 2020 and by the fall of
2022, districts in Massachusetts had received almost $2.6 billion in ESSER funding alone.
Because of the substantial financial impact of ESSER funding, districts were provided with
the opportunity to revisit their original SOA Plans. Districts were asked to focus their

amendments on needs that emerged during the pandemic, as well as address how they
were using SOA funds and federal Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief
funds (ESSER), as well as other funding sources, to close opportunity and outcome gaps for
underserved student groups. Each district’s amended plan is publicly posted on the
Department’s website in accordance with the SOA legislation. Plan amendment
submissions in April 2022 confirmed that districts were focusing on supporting
underserved student groups and implementing evidence-based programs outlined in the
SOA legislation, many of which are specifically targeted to pandemic recovery efforts. The
Department’s oversight of that process, the subsequent review and feedback to districts,
and lessons learned from plans are detailed in DESE’s Report to the Legislature: Student
Opportunity Act Three-Year Evidence-Based Plans (2021-2022).
The remainder of this report. The remainder of this report describes the Department’s
ongoing oversight and support for the SOA Plan development and implementation process
between July 1, 2022-June 30, 2023 (FY23). It includes:
▪ Key activities in FY23
▪ Data collected in FY23 SOA Progress Reports
▪ Key findings from SOA progress reports
▪ Looking Ahead to FY24
Key Activities in FY23
Key activities supporting SOA plan development and implementation of SOA Plans
between July 1, 2022 and June 30, 2023 included:
▪ Publicly Posting FY22 SOA Plan amendments. The SOA legislation requires DESE
to publicly post individual district plans. Amendments were posted in August 2022
on DESE’s Website on a newly developed SOA Dashboard. Development of the
dashboard in PowerBI began in FY21 and was finalized in FY22. The user-friendly
dashboard integrates information from districts’ original plans and FY22
amendments. Looking up individual plans is simple and straightforward; data are
displayed in attractive, easy-to-understand formats.
▪ Planning for SOA Progress Reports, due April 1, 2023. The SOA legislation
requires districts to provide annual updates to report progress in closing gaps for
identified student groups. During the first half of FY22, the SOA team developed a
data collection template, set up a process for collecting updates, created guidance
for districts, and identified a set of supports for districts to be delivered throughout
the data collection process. Guidance was released to districts and an
informational overview on the SOA Update template and process was delivered in
January 2023. The guidance and a recording of the webinar, as well as information
about other supports available, were all posted on DESE’s SOA District Resources
web page in January 2023.

▪ Data collection. Primary data collection took place between January 2023 and
April 1, 2023. Written resources posted on the SOA District Resources page were
complemented by opportunities for districts to request ½ hour consultations with
the Department SOA team as they prepared their updates. The SOA team
conducted consultations with 47 districts during the plan development and data
collection period. The SOA team also maintains a dedicated mailbox
(SOAPlans@mass.gov) to which districts can submit questions. SOA Progress
Reports for SOA Plan implementation for 2022-2023 were due to the Department by
April 1, 2023.
▪ Review of SOA Progress Reports. SOA Progress Reports were reviewed by
Department staff between April and June 2023. Reviewers reached out to 15 percent
of districts, where data were incomplete and in instances where the progress report
was largely unresponsive to the prompts provided in the SOA Progress Report
template.
Reviewers also reviewed plans against a set of criteria to assess the quality of plans.
The aggregated data were analyzed to help inform the Department’s understanding
of where districts may need additional supports and guidance as they develop new
SOA Plans, which were due in April 2024. Key findings from that analysis are
presented below.
▪ Ongoing Support from the Department. Ongoing supports from the Department
includes grant programs, professional development networks, and other resources.
In Spring 2022, the Department rolled out its Educational Vision, accompanied by a
Catalog of Aligned Supports.
Most districts receiving $1.5 million or more in additional Chapter 70 funding in
SY2021-22 also have one or more schools designated as in need of assistance in the
accountability system. As such, these districts are prioritized to receive direct
supports from the Department including additional funding and targeted support in
allocating resources, planning, implementation, and progress monitoring from the
Department’s Statewide System of Support team.
Data Collected in FY23 SOA Progress Reports
Districts provided the following in their FY23 SOA Progress Reports:
1. A summary of progress to date;
2. Updated implementation detail for each evidence-based practice in their plans;
3. Budget information on anticipated FY23 expenditures for each EBP; and
4. Updates on efforts to engage parents and other stakeholders

1. Summary of progress. Districts were asked to write a brief narrative providing a high-
level summary of progress to date. In their summaries, districts were asked to use
progress monitoring data to describe evidence of gap-closing for the student groups
targeted in their plans and draw connections between those outcomes and the
implementation of the evidence-based strategies in their plans. Districts were also
asked to describe any implementation successes and challenges they encountered.
2. Updated implementation details for each EBP. Districts provided updated
information on implementation in two ways:
a. By responding to a set of closed-ended implementation indicators designed to
capture the stage of implementation districts have reached for the key strategies
associated with the EBPs in their plans. Districts indicate which components are
part of their approach and characterize the current stage of implementation for
each component. In the aggregate, these data provide a snapshot of what
districts are implementing, and the stage of implementation. Indicators for each
EBP are available in the FY22 SOA Implementation Indicators Resource.
b. Districts also shared one or two sentences describing the immediate next steps
for implementation for each EBP in their plans.
3. Budget information on anticipated expenditures. Districts’ updates included budget
data describing anticipated expenditures for each EBP through the end of FY23 (i.e.,
June 30, 2023). Data were expected to reflect total spending across multiple funding
sources (i.e., all Chapter 70 funds, ESSER, and other state and federal grant funds).
DESE also piloted a new budget item that was designed to collect additional
information for districts in which the amount of total FY23 Chapter 70 funding being
used to support the implementation of the EBPs in their plans was less than the amount
of additional FY23 Chapter 70 funding districts were receiving. District responses to this
prompt varied widely, providing the Department with an inadequate data source from
which to draw conclusions. The Department does not expect to incorporate the item
into subsequent plan data collections.
4. Updates on efforts to engage parents and other stakeholders. Districts provided
brief updates on progress in improving and/or increasing family/caregiver engagement.
They were asked to focus in particular on families/caregivers of student groups targeted
for gap-closing and to incorporate data on measuring family engagement that districts
are required to include in their SOA Plans.
Districts were also asked to share information about ongoing stakeholder engagement
as SOA Plans are being implemented, including: a) the ways in which it shares updates
on plan implementation and evidence of impacts; b) ongoing efforts to collect input

and feedback from different stakeholder groups; and c) the substantive input and
feedback the district has received from different stakeholder groups, particularly what
they are hearing from stakeholders representing student groups targeted for gap-
closing.

Key Findings from SOA Progress Reports
The goal of the review process for progress reports was to learn more about the quality of
plans, with particular attention to the extent to which districts’ narrative summaries:
▪ Focused on outcomes in addition to implementation progress;
▪ Reported on disaggregated outcomes for student groups targeted in their plans—as
opposed to limiting the discussion to overall improvement for all students; and
▪ Explicitly addressed gap-closing for targeted student groups.
Summary of Progress. The majority of SOA Progress Report summaries offered useful,
clearly written descriptive updates centered around the key evidence-based programs in
their SOA Plans and self-reported progress toward meeting targets. Virtually all narrative
summaries of progress provided an update on progress in implementing the EBPs in their
plans. Districts were asked to share implementation successes as well as challenges. Not
surprisingly, many of the challenges noted were pandemic-related (e.g., difficulty hiring
qualified staff for new/vacant positions).
Districts were also asked to report on evidence of gap-closing for targeted student groups
that they attributed to the implementation of the EBPs in their SOA Plans. Districts were
encouraged to use progress monitoring data and to include information about leading
indicators of change (e.g., improvements in the % of classrooms demonstrating skilled
implementation of new high-quality instructional materials) that would need to happen
before seeing improvements in lagging indicators of change (e.g., increases in the percent
of students meeting or exceeding expectations on MCAS).
▪ Most summaries (79 percent) cited specific evidence of implementation progress
and/or student outcomes.
▪ Almost two-thirds (63 percent) of progress summaries addressed outcomes for
students; just over one-third (37 percent) focused exclusively on implementation
progress.
▪ Of those summaries that do address student outcomes:
o Most (73 percent) explicitly addressed improved outcomes (or lack thereof) for
targeted student groups; most of these also referenced gap-closing for student
groups.
o Just over a quarter of summaries (27 percent) limited their discussion to
improvement for all students, without reference to targeted student groups.
▪ Almost one-third (31 percent) included generic statements about change without
substantiating them with evidence (e.g., we saw substantial improvement in MCAS
scores), or offered anecdotal evidence of changes (e.g., teachers say they are
making changes in classroom practice).

Budget information on anticipated FY23 expenditures. Districts submitted budget
projections showing the financial expenditures allocated to each of the evidence-based
practices they selected. It is important to note that since the state does not currently
provide multi-year Chapter 70 budget projections to districts, they were not asked to
provide multi-year budget projections in their plans. Districts submitted braided
expenditures for existing and increased Chapter 70, ESSER, and other local, state, and
federal funds for each year in which plans were collected, in recognition of the fact that
districts pull from multiple sources to fund their priorities. This approach to reporting
allows the Department to see significantly greater scope of investments in the EBPs than if
it focused solely on increased Chapter 70 funding.
Almost two-thirds (66%) of all districts and over half (55%) of high-funding districts report
that they anticipated spending locally appropriated funds to support the implementation of
the EBPs in their plans in an amount equal to or larger than the amount of additional
Chapter 70 aid received in FY23.
Table 1 represents the evidence-based practices most invested in according to district
reporting in the SOA Progress Reports submitted in April 2023.
Table 1: Investments by evidence-based program
Evidence-based program area Total $ Total % of reported funds
High Quality Instructional Materials $74,195,293 22%
Co-teaching & Inclusion $68,281,163 20%
Social Emotional Learning/Mental Health $49,991,834 15%
Early Literacy $28,915,991 9%

Pre-Kindergarten/Full Kindergarten $16,136,492 5%
Acceleration Academies $13,203,185 4%
Source: FY23 SOA Progress Report data. Data are self-reported by districts and indicate the amount spent across all funding sources, e.g., ESSER I, ESSER II, ESSER III, Local funding
(including Chapter 70), Other Federal grants (e.g., Title grants), other state grants (e.g., GLEAM grants), Mass Business Authority Funds, Other
Districts’ three-year SOA Plans represent just one of many data sources the Department
will draw upon to assess the implementation and impact of the SOA. The Department
plans to use data across multiple sources (e.g., end-of-year spending reports, student
outcome data, and evidence-based program grant data) to gain a more complete
understanding of the fiscal impact of the revised Chapter 70 funding formula, as well as
assess the impact of evidence-based investments on closing learning and outcome gaps
for our students that are least well-served.

Looking Ahead
During the upcoming year, districts will be developing new 3-year SOA Plans, which are due
April 1, 2024, and will be implemented in FY25-FY27.
The Department is taking several approaches to continue strengthening the quality of the
next round of SOA Plans:
1. Aligning SOA Plans to DESE’s Educational Vision
2. Utilizing lessons learned from the first round of SOA Plans
3. Moving to a more effective and efficient data collection system
1. Aligning SOA Plans to DESE’s Educational Vision. DESE is leveraging the cross-
departmental workgroup that developed the original Educational Vision to identify a set
of evidence-based programs (EBPs) linked to its 3 strategic objectives and 10 focus
areas. The workgroup will revisit the current set of recommended EBPs in Appendix B to
ensure that they are linked to the Educational Vision and are consistent in scope.
Where appropriate, EBPs not reflected in the existing list will be added. Districts will
utilize the revised list of EBPs as they determine which evidence-based strategies are
key to reducing the most concerning disparities for student groups in their district in
their new SOA Plans.
2. Utilizing lessons learned from the first round of SOA Plans. Based on some of the
lessons learned described in this report, and the FY22 legislative report, the
Department is taking the following steps to improve plan quality:
• Improving messaging to dispel lingering misconceptions about SOA Plans. (e.g., my
district does not need to write a plan because we are not receiving much additional
Chapter 70 funding).
• Clarifying and streamlining reporting on projected budget expenditures.
• Developing additional resources and guidance to build district capacity to a)
disaggregate data, b) consider a wider array of data, and c) use data to consider the
underlying reasons for gaps in learning experiences and outcomes for different
student groups. A key new data resource under development is a student outcomes
data tool that will offer an at-a-glance dashboard highlighting which student groups
are experiencing the greatest disparities across multiple data points within a district
(i.e., chronic absenteeism, out-of-school suspension, ninth-grade passing rates,
pathways enrollment, dropout, and graduation rates, MCAS ELA and Math
achievement).

3. Moving to a more effective and efficient data collection system. Both districts
and Department staff experienced significant technical challenges in working with
the Alchemer data collection platform. Districts’ new SOA Plans will be collected via
the Department’s Grants Education Management System (GEM$). The Department
expects this shift to improve the efficiency with which data are collected, facilitate
the review and revision of SOA Plans; and result in better analytic data. The GEM$
system also makes it easy to make SOA Plans publicly available, as required by
statute.

Report to the Legislature SOA 3-Year Evidence-Based Plans 2022-2023
Introduction
The Department of Elementary and Secondary Education respectfully submits this Report to
the Legislature: SOA Three-Year Evidence-Based Plans (2023-2024) pursuant to Chapter 132
of the Acts of 2019, The Student Opportunity Act:
Annually, not later than December 31, the commissioner shall submit a report to the
clerks of the house of representatives and the senate and the chairs of the joint
committee on education on the progress made in addressing persistent disparities in
achievement among student subgroups in the aggregate and within subcategories on
a statewide basis; provided, however, that district and school-level data shall be
made available on the department’s website along with the report. (M.G.L. Ch. 69 §
1S (d))
The Student Opportunity Act (SOA) was enacted in 2019, infusing significant new funding
into the Commonwealth’s educational system, with the majority directed towards
chronically underfunded districts. The SOA legislation adopted the Foundation Budget
Review Commission’s October 2015 recommendations, which addressed the state’s
overall underinvestment in education and revised the Chapter 70 formula used to allocate
funds to districts by:
▪ Raising per pupil funding for English learners; more for those in high schools;
▪ Increasing special education enrollment and cost assumptions to more accurately
reflect district enrollment;
▪ Increasing funding for districts with high concentrations of poverty; and
▪ Increasing funding for health care costs of active employees and retirees by basing
costs on up-to-date health insurance trend data collected by the state’s Group
Insurance Commission (GIC)
Initial Reflections on the Impact of SOA Plans(FY21-FY24)
The first round of SOA Plans was developed and implemented between 2020-2024, against
the backdrop of the pandemic and its aftermath. The SOA-Pandemic-ESSER Timeline in
Appendix A traces the timeline of SOA Plan development and implementation against: a)
the timing of pandemic-related school closures and remote/hybrid learning and b) the
funding timeline for new state investments in Chapter 70 aid and federal Elementary and
Secondary School Emergency Relief (ESSER) funding.
Please note that at this point in time, it is not possible to establish a direct causal
relationship between the provisions of the Student Opportunity Act and reductions in

70 funds—as well as the substantial pandemic-era federal ESSER funding—is self-reported
by districts and is most useful for descriptive purposes.
The Department’s SOA Data Advisory Commission recently commissioned the SOA-ESSER
Spending Study, which seeks to understand how, and the extent to which, the infusions of
funding from the Massachusetts state SOA and the federal ESSER funds have impacted
public education in Massachusetts compared to the years prior to implementation of these
funds. This type of analysis is complex and labor intensive and will take time to understand
well. The research questions for the study appear in Appendix B.
The remainder of this section uses publicly available data to describe some of the
indicators of progress the Department is using to track changes over time.
Distribution of Additional Chapter 70 Aid. On July 29, 2024, Governor Healey signed a
budget that included almost $7 billion in Chapter 70 aid. The annual amount of Chapter 70
aid is now more than $1.6 billion higher than it was in FY21 when the state began phasing in
new investments in education following the passage of the Student Opportunity Act.
Additional increases in Chapter 70 aid will continue to be phased in through FY27.
In FY22, the Department designated 25 districts that received $1.5 million or more in
additional FY22 Chapter 70 aid as ‘high-funding’ districts. The new Chapter 70 funding
formula introduced in the SOA legislation, has distributed 61 percent of $1.6 billion in
additional Chapter 70 funds that have been phased in since FY22-FY25 to these 25
districts; the remaining 39 percent is distributed across the remaining 294 districts. This
distribution reflects the fact that in the academic year 2023-24, the 25 high-funding
districts served 29 percent of the Commonwealth’s students, 62 percent of its English
learners, just over half (51 percent) of its low-income students, and just under one-third (31
percent) of students with disabilities—groups that are explicitly addressed in the SOA
legislation.
Progress in meeting targets. The Student Opportunity Act requires the Department to set
and report on ambitious 3-year targets for improving student achievement for student
groups statewide. Setting those targets was delayed until recently due to pandemic-related
interruptions in MCAS testing.
The Department has opted to track statewide progress in gap-closing by tracking progress
in MCAS ELA and Math achievement over time for the lowest performing students group, as
reported via the state’s district and school accountability system. By definition, this group
includes the students who currently demonstrate the lowest levels of achievement within
their school or district and therefore need the most significant levels of support to reduce
the disparities between their performance and that of their peers. This group typically
includes substantial proportions of a district’s high-needs population, as well as other
student groups that the Student Opportunity Act intends to support (i.e., English Learners,
2

Report to the Legislature SOA 3-Year Evidence-Based Plans 2023-2024
students with disabilities, students of color, etc.) This makes it a good proxy for assessing
the progress of multiple student groups and streamlines the analysis and reporting
process. Additional detail is available in the technical document Establishing the Lowest
Performing Students Group.
Table 1 displays the state’s progress in meeting the FY24 targets set for all students and for
the state’s lowest-performing student group for MCAS English Language Arts and
Mathematics. The SOA legislation calls for the Department to track progress in meeting
targets for achievement outcomes. Data for chronic absenteeism are included in the table
below because the Department hypothesizes that the reduction in chronic absenteeism
over time will serve as a leading indicator of improvement in MCAS achievement and other
student outcomes.

➢ The results for progress in meeting FY24 achievement targets for the lowest performing
students group are more positive than for students in the aggregate.
➢ Although the lowest performing students group did not meet its achievement targets for
FY24, it saw improvement, albeit below target, in English language arts (for non-high
school and high school students) and in Mathematics (for non-high school students).
➢ The state met its target for reducing chronic absenteeism for the lowest performing
students group for non-high school students, and made improvements at the high
school level, albeit below target.

➢ Between spring 2023 and spring 2024, the lowest performing students group saw
modest improvements relative to students in the aggregate in average composite
scaled scores in English language arts for non-high school and high school students
and in Mathematics for non-high school students.
➢ The gap in the chronic absenteeism rate for non-high school students in the lowest-
performing students group increased relative to that of students in the aggregate.
Even though the lowest performing students group met its targets for reducing
chronic absenteeism, students in the aggregate exceeded the target for reducing
chronic absenteeism; as a result, the gap widened.
➢ Chronic absenteeism for high school students in the lowest performing students
group resulted in a more robust narrowing of disparities than for high school
students in the aggregate.
Tables 1 and 2 track progress for a single year and generally reflect positive progress for the
lowest-performing students group. The Department is committed to supporting and
strengthening a positive trajectory over time for all students and will continue to maintain a

focus on fostering robust improvement for students experiencing the greatest disparities in
order to foster ongoing narrowing of achievement gaps.
A closer look at progress in meeting targets for all districts and high-funding districts.
The SOA-ESSER Spending Study mentioned earlier in this report, will explore the impacts of
SOA and ESSER funding, particularly for those districts that received, and will continue to
receive via Chapter 70, substantial infusions of funding.
Table 3 offers a closer look at the distribution of districts overall and high-funding districts
that either met or exceeded targets or improved below targets. These data are shared for
illustrative purposes. Due to the small numbers of high-funding districts relative to all
districts, we urge caution in interpreting small differences in percentages between the
high-funding districts and all districts.

Report to the Legislature SOA 3-Year Evidence-Based Plans 2023-2024
Summary of Key Activities in FY24
Most activities between July 1, 2023, and June 30, 2024, centered on planning and
preparation for collecting a new round of 3-year gap-closing plans from districts, plan data
collection, and the plan review process. Key activities that will be described in greater
detail below include:
1. Publicly posting FY23 SOA Progress Reports
2. Planning and preparation for new 3-year SOA Plans covering implementation years
FY25-FY27
3. Plan data collection
4. Reviewing SOA Plans
5. Creating a SOA Summary Report
6. Supporting the ongoing implementation of evidence-based practices
1. Publicly posting FY23 SOA Progress Reports.
Districts’ FY22 SOA Plan Amendments were updated with information from their FY23 SOA
Progress Reports. The updated SOA Dashboard, along with instructions for utilizing it, was
posted on the Department’s SOA Web pages in fall 2023.
2. Planning and preparation for new 3-year SOA Plans covering implementation years
FY25-FY27.
DESE applied lessons learned from the first round of SOA Plan development and
implementation to produce new resources and improved guidance to support districts in
developing stronger and more focused plans. The timing of new SOA Plans also presented
a welcome opportunity to better align SOA plans with evolving Department priorities as the
country emerged from the pandemic. Core improvements and updates included:
a. Aligning evidence-based programs with the Department’s new Educational
Vision and Strategic Objectives. The Department’s Educational Vision,
introduced to districts in April 2023, articulated three strategic objectives:
Strategic Objective 1: Cultivate systems to support the whole student and
foster joyful, healthy, and supportive learning environments so that all
students feel valued, connected, nourished, and ready to learn;
Strategic Objective 2: Promote deeper learning so that all students engage
in grade-level work that is real-world, relevant, and interactive;
Strategic Objective 3: Develop and sustain a workforce that is diverse,
culturally responsive, well-prepared, and committed to continuous
improvement, so that all students have equitable access to effective
educators.
Each strategic objective encompasses three to four focus areas. In advance of
collecting new 3-year plans, the Department examined the research and
6

Report to the Legislature SOA 3-Year Evidence-Based Plans 2023-2024
evidence base to further identify examples of high-quality evidence-based
programs (EBPs) aligned with each of the ten focus areas. The full list of strategic
objectives, focus areas, and evidence-based programs, as well as a crosswalk of
the 2024 EBPs against the original SOA Programs in the SOA legislation, appears
in Appendix D.
The selection of EBPs that districts will use to drive improvements for selected
student groups continues to represent the core of districts’ SOA Plans. While
each of the 2024 EBPs represent strong programmatic practices, districts were
especially encouraged to consider and adopt EBPs designated as “priority EBPs”
by the Commissioner. These included: Targeted Academic Support and
Acceleration; Inclusive Curriculum Adoption Process; Supporting Curriculum
Implementation; Comprehensive Approach to Early Literacy and Early Literacy
Screening and Support; Expanded Access to Pre-K; High Quality Secondary
Pathways and Programs; and Enhanced Pathways to Increase Educator
Diversity.
Setting statewide improvement targets. As described at the beginning of this
report, the Department also sets district targets for the lowest-performing
student group. District progress for the lowest-performing student group will be
tracked over time against statewide targets. Districts also have the option of
setting other achievement targets in the aggregate and/or for additional student
groups.
Districts also identified a set of recommended metrics related to the evidence-
based programs in their plans that they would use to monitor their interim and
longer-term progress in reducing disparities for student groups. The Strategic
Objectives Table in Appendix E, which appears in the FY24 SOA Plan Guidance
Materials, provided districts with a set of recommended benchmarks for each
evidence-based program in the table.
b. New data resources to support plan development. The Department
developed a new data analytic tool, the Student Outcomes Comparison Tool, to
provide districts with an at-a-glance perspective of critical indicators across
multiple student groups to help them begin to pinpoint where disparities in
learning experiences and outcomes are most prominent. This tool is intended to
serve as a supplement to other publicly available tools and interim district
assessment data.
Where districts’ original data analyses in FY20 and FY22 leaned heavily on MCAS
outcomes, the student outcomes data tool highlights other critical indicators
including chronic absenteeism, out-of-school suspensions, ninth-grade course
passing, pathways enrollment, and data on dropout and 5-year graduation. The
tool includes a district heat map feature, which provides a graphical
7

Report to the Legislature SOA 3-Year Evidence-Based Plans 2023-2024
representation of data where values are depicted by color. Data points in dark
red note where student groups are experiencing the greatest disparities.
c. Streamlining and refining the collection of resource allocation data. In this
round of plans, the budgetary data collected is streamlined and simplified.
Districts projected the total dollar amount across all funding sources1 over the
next three years (i.e., FY25-FY27) that they expect to invest to support the
implementation of each EBP. This is in contrast with the original plans, which
collected information about anticipated expenditures for each EBP on a year-to-
year basis. Districts continue to provide summary information on the
Foundation categories in which funds will be used to support implementation.
So as not to lose the opportunity to learn more about the impact of additional
Chapter 70 funding on districts, the Department is continuing to collect more
detailed fiscal information from districts benefiting the most from new
investments in Chapter 70 and the new funding formula introduced with the SOA
legislation. Seventeen districts receiving $75 million or more in total Chapter 70
funds in FY24 were identified as priority districts. (See Appendix E for a list of
priority districts.) Note that beginning with the new round of plans, the
Department shifted its basis for identifying priority districts from the amount of
additional year-over-year funding a district receives to the total Chapter Aid
funding a district receives. Sixteen of the 17 districts now identified as priority
districts were also identified as priority districts using the previous criteria.
In addition to the SOA Plan required for all districts, the 17 priority districts
completed an SOA Plan Addendum. The SOA Plan Addendum asked districts to
reflect upon and describe how the additional Chapter 70 funds – in conjunction
with investments from other funding sources – enabled them to transform how
their district serves students who have experienced the greatest disparities in
their educational opportunities and outcomes. Districts also provided
prospective budget data on anticipated investments for all EBPs for FY25-FY27.
The SOA Plan Addendum budget data will be utilized in the SOA-ESSER spending
study described earlier in this report.
d. New Data Collection Platform. The Department moved plan data collection
from a commercial survey data collection platform to the Department’s Grants
for Education Management System (GEM$). This move resulted in a more
efficient and streamlined process that permitted data collection, review and
revision of plans, and public posting of plans within a single platform. From the
district perspective, GEM$ allowed formatted text and permitted districts to
include data tables and graphs, which makes plans more user-friendly for
1 All local funding sources, including state Chapter 70 allocations; Federal Title grants; other federal and state grants; other
resources
8

Report to the Legislature SOA 3-Year Evidence-Based Plans 2023-2024
stakeholders to read. The process of accessing plans is still user-friendly, and
the public can either read plans online within the GEM$ system or download and
print a copy of the plan directly from GEM$.
e. Stakeholder Engagement. Throughout this process, an array of internal DESE
stakeholders and external stakeholders were engaged as the Department moved
from strategy development to implementation. Members of the core SOA
implementation team engaged with internal stakeholders from the
Commissioner’s Office, the Office of Planning and Research, the Center for
Accountability, and the cross-agency Strategic Objective Working Group. At key
points in the process, external stakeholders provided valuable input that is
reflected in resulting processes and resources. The new plan template was
informed by input from the Massachusetts Association of School
Superintendents (M.A.S.S.). Input from the Massachusetts Business Alliance for
Education (MBAE) informed target setting, as well as financial data collection for
districts receiving a significant amount of Chapter 70 funding.
3. Plan Data Collection. Detailed SOA plan guidance and resources to support plan
development were released in January 2024, with a primary collection of SOA plans
taking place between January 2024 and April 1, 2024. The Department offered an
overview webinar to districts in January 2024; a recording of the webinar and
accompanying slide deck were subsequently posted on the SOA District Resources
page, along with the FY24 SOA Plan guidance and other resources. The Department
also held webinars for the Urban Superintendents Network for districts completing the
SOA Plan Addendum and for the Massachusetts Association of School Business
Officials (MASBE).
Written resources posted on the SOA District Resources page were complemented by
opportunities for districts to request ½ hour consultations with the SOA team as they
prepared their updates. The SOA team conducted consultations with 55 districts during
the course of data collection. The SOA team also maintains a dedicated mailbox
(SOAPlans@mass.gov) to which districts can submit questions.
4. Reviewing SOA plans. The bulk of SOA Plans received an initial review in the two
weeks following the April 1, 2024, due date. SOA Plans were reviewed with an eye
toward assessing whether a district’s SOA plan met the letter and the spirit of the
Student Opportunity Act.
Reviewers took part in a robust training and calibration process prior to reviewing plans
independently. Plans for priority districts were reviewed by at least two team reviewers,
including a member of the SOA leadership team. Plans for other districts had a single
9

Report to the Legislature SOA 3-Year Evidence-Based Plans 2023-2024
reviewer, and a sample of plans was spot-checked by members of the leadership team
to ensure consistency across reviewers. The SOA Plan Checklist used by the review
team appears in Appendix F. Reviewers were able to work directly in the GEM$ system
described above to flag areas requiring additional detail. Districts then made necessary
adjustments for DESE review and final approval.
5. Creating a FY24 SOA Summary Report. A summary report based on SOA Plan data
was developed after the review process was completed. Following a brief overview of
the Student Opportunity Act and the purpose of SOA Plans, the report provides a useful
descriptive summary of what districts across the Commonwealth are prioritizing in the
SOA Plans they will be implementing between FY25–FY27.
6. Supporting the ongoing implementation of evidence-based practices. The
Department provides a wide array of implementation supports aligned to its
Educational Vision. These include evidence-based grant opportunities, professional
learning opportunities, tools, and guidance and are described for districts in the
Department’s Catalog of Aligned Supports.
Areas for Further Exploration
The FY24 SOA Summary Report described above provides an overview of the content of
SOA Plans submitted by districts for implementation from SY24-25 through SY26-27. While
the summary tables are not repeated here, the areas for further exploration described
below are those that appear at the end of that report.
The Department recognizes that beyond written plans, high-quality implementation of
those plans largely determines the ultimate impact on students. To that end, we are
exploring ways to shift our focus primarily from the activity of collecting and reviewing
plans towards providing high-quality implementation support that meaningfully aids
districts in improving outcomes for historically underserved students.
Increased Focus on Implementation Support. While required by statute, SOA Plans in
and of themselves are not comprehensive district improvement plans. It is important to
remember that districts were encouraged to select a relatively small, focused number of
EBPs in their SOA Plan. As a result, a district may not have selected a given EBP as part of
their SOA Plan but work on that strategy could still be underway.
While the Department has made efforts to support districts in SOA Plan development
through enhanced guidance, new data analysis tools, and technical assistance, in several
sections of the submitted SOA Plans, the narratives varied in terms of the level of data and
detail provided. Especially for districts that received minimal increases in their Chapter 70
10

Report to the Legislature SOA 3-Year Evidence-Based Plans 2023-2024
allocation, the SOA reporting requirements were sometimes experienced as distinct from
the core, authentic planning opportunity that was intended by the guidance.
Moving forward, we are exploring how the Department can meaningfully harness the data
we have about districts' improvement efforts and put greater focus on adaptive
implementation assistance. Potentially shifting the Department's efforts more towards
implementation support could help illuminate where supports are most warranted. In
addition, aligning these efforts more tightly around districts' improvement plans could
increase the coherence and effectiveness of districts' efforts to address gaps and learning
loss.
Adapting Universal Strategies to Support Specific Student Groups. A vast majority of
districts identified students with disabilities and/or English learners as their student groups
to receive focused support. Meanwhile, several of the most selected EBPs (e.g., curriculum
adoption and implementation) are universal strategies designed to enhance the
educational experience of all students. Plan narratives varied in the extent to which they
made an explicit connection to how the EBP would improve outcomes for targeted student
groups. We believe this represents an important opportunity for the Department to curate,
develop, and disseminate resources that support districts in adapting certain EBPs to
meaningfully address the strengths and needs of specific student groups.
Building and Sustaining a Diverse and Effective Workforce. We know that district
leaders value the research that consistently shows that having a diverse and effective
workforce is one of the most influential factors in students' academic and post-academic
success. Although relatively few districts (8%) selected EBPs from this strategic objective,
we recognize that districts are investing in this priority in ways that may not be easily
observed in SOA plans.
For example, investments in sustaining a diverse and effective workforce may be reflected
in other line items of the plan (e.g., hiring highly qualified educators to support early literacy
efforts through EBP 2.1D). It is also possible that districts are using other funding sources
to support this work and their strategies are articulated in their district improvement plans.
Further examination may be warranted.
11

Report to the Legislature SOA 3-Year Evidence-Based Plans 2023-2024
Looking Forward
The Department is already in the process of developing guidance and templates for the
annual SOA Progress Reports districts will submit in April 2025. Updates will focus on the
first year of implementation for new SOA Plans and the progress they are making in
reducing disparities for student groups experiencing gaps in learning experiences and
outcomes.
In the longer term, the Department is exploring ways to better align comprehensive district
improvement and SOA planning processes in ways that are more efficient and effective in
driving outcomes for students. The goal is to have an aligned process in place well in
advance of 2027 when the next round of SOA Plans is due.
The Department is committed to leveraging the SOA Planning process alongside the
implementation resources and supports described in the Department’s Catalog of Aligned
Supports to drive ongoing progress in narrowing disparities for student groups.

Appendix B: Study of SOA and ESSER Spending in Massachusetts
RESEARCH QUESTIONS
In general, the Study of SOA and ESSER Spending in Massachusetts seeks to understand how, and
the extent to which, the infusions of funding from the Massachusetts state SOA and the federal
ESSER funds have impacted public education in Massachusetts compared to the years prior to
implementation of these funds. The research questions are as follows:
1) How did districts and schools use SOA and ESSER funds? What are the patterns of
spending? Do similar types of districts, based on characteristics like district size, and
student groups served, have similar patterns of spending (based on categories)? To what
degree were SOA and ESSER funds used for similar or divergent activities?
2) To what extent has the additional funding under the SOA and ESSER funds been targeted
to the intended populations (low-income students, ELs) in districts and schools? To what
extent have these funds been allocated and distributed to districts and schools that
disproportionately serve these student groups?
3) To what extent has the growth in required local contributions under the SOA, as well as
the state’s distribution of SOA funding to districts and schools been more equitable than the
distribution of Chapter 70 funds in the years prior to SOA?
4) What are trends in SOA and ESSER spending, separately and jointly, at the district level,
relative to district spending in the years prior to SOA and ESSER (i.e., what categories of
spending have increased, decreased, or stayed constant) in total dollars and proportionally?
5) What are trends in SOA and ESSER spending, separately and jointly, at the school level,
relative to school-level educational spending the years prior to SOA and ESSER (i.e., what
categories of spending have increased, decreased, or stayed constant, both over time and
relative to one another)?
6) To what extent did Massachusetts public school districts use these funds to build
capacity by funding investments that will continue after ESSER funding ends? Which
evidence-based practices were invested in?
7) To what extent can we quantitatively identify spending (in categories or programs) that
has had a high impact (i.e., has led to improved student outcomes, for example,
attendance, discipline, course completion, etc.? To what extent can we quantitatively
identify categories of spending that seemed to be high-impact and/or cost-effective (e.g.,
has shown a positive return on investment)?

Report to the Legislature SOA 3-Year Evidence-Based Plans 2022-2023
Appendix F: FY24 SOA Plan Rubric – GEM$ Checklist
Overall Plan
▪ The narrative throughout the plan is free of deficit-based language about students, staff,
and families.
▪ Plan addresses between 1-3 of the ten Focus Areas linked to the three Strategic Objectives
in DESE’s Educational Vision.
▪ The plan focuses on the implementation of key strategies to close gaps, rather than limiting
its scope to a description of how additional Chapter 70 funds will be spent.
▪ There is internal consistency throughout the plan (e.g., student groups, EBPs)
Section 1: Summarize Your District’s Plan
▪ The summary addresses all required elements: student groups targeted, EBPs.
Investments, changes anticipated by 2027.
▪ The narrative is accessible to a general audience.
Section 2: Analyze Your Data and Select Student Groups for Focused Support
▪ The plan prioritizes a limited set of student groups experiencing the most significant gaps.
(i.e., does not check every student group in the district)
▪ The plan describes the measures on which targeted student groups are experiencing the
most significant disparities.
▪ Analysis of disparities and deeper analysis of their underlying causes draws upon multiple
types of data (e.g., systems, observational, perspectives, outcomes)
▪ The selection of EBPs is linked to a deeper analysis of the underlying causes of disparities.
Section 3: Set Ambitious Three-Year Targets for Improving Student Achievement
▪ Additional targets are aligned to selected student groups by subject matter and grade level
and to DESE’s accountability targets.
Section 4: Engage Families/Caregivers and other Stakeholders
▪ Family/caregiver engagement strategies are clearly articulated and include approaches to
support parents in addressing their students’ needs.
▪ The section includes a description of steps the district takes (or plans to take) to engage
families/caregivers of targeted student groups.
▪ The plan for assessing progress in increasing family/caregiver engagement includes a metric
that can assess change over time and indicates how it will measure increased engagement
for families/caregivers of student groups targeted in this plan.
▪ Narrative describes ways in which different stakeholder groups provided meaningful input
that was used to inform the SOA plan AND describes how/where their perspectives are
reflected in the SOA Plan.
▪ Plans for ongoing engagement of stakeholder groups throughout the implementation of the
SOA Plan are described.
0

Section 5: Select Evidence-Based Programs to Address Disparities in Outcomes (to be
completed for each EBP selected)
▪ The district offers a clear description of 1) what is currently being implemented, 2) what
changes will be implemented/in place by June 2027, AND aligns to best practice as
articulated in guidance.
▪ The plan describes how EBP implementation will support targeted student groups and/or
improve their learning experiences and outcomes.
▪ The plan clearly indicates which schools will be impacted through the implementation of
this EBP.
▪ The budget provides clear information on budget allocation that aligns to the
implementation description and is organized by foundation category.
▪ Progress monitoring metrics are clearly defined and well-suited to monitoring early and
midterm outcomes of the implementation of this EBP.
