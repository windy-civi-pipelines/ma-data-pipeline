SUBJECT: June 2025 UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE TRUST FUND INFORMATION
The following information relates to the reporting on the Unemployment Insurance
Trust Fund (“UI Trust Fund”) for the month of May 2025.
As of May 31, 2025, the preliminary Massachusetts UI Trust Fund ending balance was
$2.36 billion.
Year-to-date through May 31, 2025, preliminary employer contributions totaled $1.02
billion.
Year-to-date through May 31, 2025, DUA paid $1.03 billion in benefits for regular UI for
393,836 initial and continuing claims.
This update contains information related only to actual dollars collected or disbursed. On
January 17, 2025, the Commonwealth and the U.S. Department of Labor entered into an
agreement that fully resolved any outstanding liability related to pandemic
unemployment insurance overdraws as a result of federal UI programs established
during the COVID-19 pandemic. The impact of this agreement is reflected in the April
2025 projections contained in the Unemployment Insurance Trust Fund Quarterly
Outlook Reports. The Commonwealth’s first payment under the agreement is due
December 1, 2025.

The UI Trust Fund data is also available at Mass.gov/UITrustFund in the form of data
visualizations spanning from May 2024 through May 2025.
