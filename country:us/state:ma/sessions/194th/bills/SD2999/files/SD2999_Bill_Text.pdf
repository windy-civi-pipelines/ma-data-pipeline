Re: Plan of Correction – Suffolk County House of Correction, Boston
Dear Sheriff Tompkins:
The Massachusetts Department of Public Health, Division of Environmental Regulations and Standards (EHRS) has
received your Plan of Correction in response to my inspection conducted on April 15, 16, and 17, 2025. After review, the
EHRS finds the plan addresses all the deficiencies noted with the following exception:
In regards to the issue of overcrowding, the EHRS appreciates the limitations of correctional facilities and the need to
accommodate the ever-increasing population; however we remain concerned with the overcrowded conditions.
Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter, should you have any questions please contact me at the address listed
above.
Sincerely,
Hannah LeBeau
Environmental Health Inspector, EHRS, BCEH
