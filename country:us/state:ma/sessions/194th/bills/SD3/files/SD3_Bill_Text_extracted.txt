Dear Members of the Joint Committee on Education, the Joint Committee on Mental
Health, Substance Use and Recovery, and House and Senate Committees on Ways and
Means:
I am pleased to submit this this report, Social Emotional Learning Grants: Fiscal Year
2023 Report on Universal Mental Health Screening Pilot, pursuant to Chapter 126 of the
Acts of 2022, line item 7061-0028, that reads in part:
“…provided further, that not later than August 31, 2023, the department shall submit
a report to the joint committee on education, the joint committee on mental health,
substance use and recovery and the house and senate committees on ways and
means that shall include: (1) a description of the participants in the pilot program;
(2) a summary of the data collected from program participants; and (3) any
recommendations to further expand the availability of mental health screenings for
students…”
This line item helps advance the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education’s
(Department) strategic priority to strengthen social emotional competencies, health, and
safety, which aims to promote systems and strategies that foster safe, positive, healthy,
culturally-responsive, and inclusive learning environments that address students’ varied
needs and improve educational outcomes for all. The funding provides critical resources to
schools, districts, charter schools and educational collaboratives as they build “systems of
integrated student supports” to “free children up to engage in the type of critical thinking
and deeper learning to which our schools and education systems aspire,” as described in
the Our Way Forward report1 and our new Educational Vision. These resources are
particularly important as we continue to see student social and emotional, behavioral, and
mental health and educator mental wellness concerns.
The efforts funded through this line item helped further the ability of communities across
the commonwealth to maximize coordination with service providers and establish more
comprehensive continuums of care. These funds helped to increase student access to

behavioral and mental health services, including grant funded services, delivered in
partnership with community-based providers, for students. In addition, professional
development coordinated by the Department and offered to school staff supported their
ability to identify students’ social and emotional and behavioral and mental health needs
as well as educators’ needs as part of comprehensive, integrated, tiered approaches to
promoting wellness for all students and educators, and to address needs of students
requiring additional supports.
The (SEL and Mental Health) grant, awarded in December 2022 provided professional
development (PD) and coaching supports to help school staff identify students in need of
services and connect those students to services as well as address the wellness needs of
staff.
If you have any questions, feel free to contact Rachelle Engler Bennett, Associate
Commissioner, Student and Family Support via RachelleEngler.Bennett@mass.gov. We
look forward to continuing to facilitate and coordinate this work and thank the Governor
and Legislature for your commitment to the students of the Commonwealth.

This report provides information about grant activities and professional development
offered through this line item and includes the required information about (1) a description
of the participants in the pilot program; (2) a summary of the data collected from program
participants; and (3) any recommendations to further expand the availability of mental
health screenings for students.
The Department continues to work collaboratively with the Executive Office of Health and
Human Services (EOHHS), including the Departments of Public Health and Mental Health
(DPH and DMH), to leverage existing and planned initiatives and to promote
complementary and supplemental activities. The Department also continues to make
efforts to coordinate and align related opportunities where helpful, and to use multiple
funding sources where needed and appropriate to support related goals. For example, the
grant program described below includes funding from both the Social Emotional Learning
line item 7061-0028 and the Student Wellness School Supports/Supporting Healthy
Alliances Reinforcing Education line item 7061-9650.
Selection of Participating Grantees
In September 2022, the Department posted the fiscal year 2023 (FY2023) Request for
Proposals (RFP) opportunity through Fund Code (FC) 311 Supporting Students' Social
Emotional Learning, Behavioral and Mental Health, and Wellness through Multi-Tiered
Systems of Support (SEL and Mental Health Grant). Massachusetts public school districts,
including charter schools, and educational collaboratives were eligible to apply. On
October 13, 2022, the Department received 40 applications requesting over $3 million.
After conducting its grant review process, the Department awarded a total of over $3
million to all forty (40) applicants to implement activities district-wide or in one or more
schools that increase student access to behavioral and mental health services.

Summary Report: Piloting Universal Mental Health
Screening
The following data was collected based on criteria in the legislative line item 7061-0028,
Social Emotional Learning:
• Number of students who received mental health screenings, delineated by
demographic group and grade level;
• Number of students requiring additional support or follow-up screenings, including
students who indicated suicidal ideation or intent to self-harm;
• Length of time between the initial screening and subsequent support services
provided;
• Number of students referred for additional support services outside of the school
district; and
• Types of screening tools used.
Background Data
In FY2023 a total of twenty-one (21) grantees out of forty (40) opted in to participate in
Piloting Universal Mental Health Screening. One district chose to opt out due to staffing
challenges, leaving twenty schools. They represent urban, suburban, and rural school
districts (referred to from this point forward as “grantees”).
In June 2023, grantees completed an end of year survey, with questions about the universal
mental health screening data they collected and their experiences piloting universal
mental health screening systems. This report presents a summary of their survey
responses, divided into two sections, with the first section focused on their data and the
second section focused on their experiences.

Section 3:
Section 1: FY2023 Universal Mental Health Screening Data
This section provides an overview of FY2023 grantees’ universal mental health screening
data, including the total number of students screened and a delineation of the number of
students screened by grade and key demographic categories.
All twenty (20) grantees were successful in their universal mental health screening efforts.
Each grantee selected at least one universal mental health screening tool and screened at
least one group of students by the end of FY2023. Upon the conclusion of June 2023,
grantees had screened a total of 11,805 students. The number of students screened
ranged from a total of 10 students for a smaller school district to a total of 3,985 for a large
school district. This district accounted for 33.8 percent of all the students screened.
Following is additional information about the number of students screened, particularly
the number of students screened by grade, demographic group, gender, and three
3
additional demographic categories (i.e., students identified as high needs, students with
disabilities, and students who are English Language Learners). Please note that there are
some discrepancies between the total number of students screened and the total number
of students screened by grade, demographic group, and gender, largely due to data
collection methods to be discussed further.

# of Students by Grade
The trend that emerges from the mental health screening data by grade is consistent with
universal mental health screening practices. Students are often screened for behavioral
4
and mental health issues, especially related to mood and/or anxiety, in middle grades and
early high school. There are fewer developmentally appropriate tools that assess similar
issues among younger children, and screening older high school students generally leaves
little time to meet their needs in a school-based setting. As the graph demonstrates,
however, there is FY2023 mental health screening data across all grades, from
kindergarten through 12th Grade.

# of Students by demographic group
The mental health screening data by demographic group shows the greatest discrepancy
between the total number of students screened and the total number broken down by
demographic group. There are two primary reasons for this discrepancy. First, a few
districts did not report demographic data about the students, for reasons that may be
related to a variety of challenges; and one district reported that the online screening
program did not include a field for capturing demographic group and they had not set up
5
another way to collect the information. In other cases, students self-identified their
demographic groups, resulting in data that cannot easily be organized into the state’s
demographic group categories. Due to difficulties with category alignment, these data
were excluded from the total number screened by demographic group in the chart above.
As the Department continues additional years of piloting screening with districts, DESE
will work closely with grantees to improve data collection related to race and ethnicity, with
the goal of having as complete demographic data as possible from districts related to
students screened in FY2024 and beyond. DESE will increase efforts to make sure districts
are clear about data collection requirements prior to participation in the screening pilot,
and have tools and methods to be collecting and then reporting on demographic data as
part of their screening and reporting practices. Additionally, DESE will communicate with
coaches at several key time periods of the initiative (e.g., before the start, mid-way
through, and during data submission time) to emphasize the importance of complete data
collection and to provide support and technical assistance to grantees to proactively
address any challenges that arise.

# of Students by Gender
Similar to students being able to self-identity their demographic group, some grantees
provided students the option to self-identify their gender identity. For the purpose of this
report, the following gender identities are included in the non-binary category: non-binary,
6
trans, gender queer, gender non-conforming, and other. In addition to this data, there is a
small amount (approximately 1 percent) of screened students for whom DESE did not
receive gender information. It is unclear if this information was not collected or if students
chose to leave the field blank (for example because there are no available categories that
affirm their gender identity.
Students Screened and Other Demographics–Figure 7
Of the 11,805 students screened, 2,403 (20.4 percent) were identified as having high
needs; 1,743 (14.8 percent) were identified as having a disability; and 830 (7.0 percent)
were identified as an English Language Learner.
Other Demographics # of Students Screened
Students Identified as High Needs 2,403
Students with Disabilities 1,743
English Language Learners 830
Students Needing Additional Support or Follow-Up Screenings
Of the 11,805 students screened, 775 (6.6 percent) were identified as needing additional
support or follow-up screenings (including students who indicated- suicidal ideation or
intent to self-harm). Of all twenty (20) grantees, eight (8) indicated that students were
typically seen for additional support services the day of screening; two (2) indicated within
a week of screening; 3 indicated within two weeks of screening; and three (3) indicated
within a month of screening.
Of the 775 students identified as needing additional support services, 99 (12.8 percent)
were referred for services outside of the school or district. Students and families were
most commonly referred to their local mobile crisis team, community-based counseling
providers or therapists, William James INTERFACE Referral Service, Care Solace, and/or
Riverside Community Care.
Mental Health Screening Tools Utilized
Grantees reported utilizing a total of 13 mental health screening tools in FY2023. Of the
twenty (20) grantees, 13 (65 percent) reported implementing one screening tool; 4 (20
percent) reported implementing two screening tools; and 3 (15 percent) reported
implementing three screening tools.

Section 4:
Section 2: FY2023 Themes and Trends in Open-Ended Responses
regarding Experiences
This section provides an overview of FY2023 grantees’ responses to open-ended questions
about their experiences piloting universal mental health screening systems, including
questions about their successes, challenges, aspects of the process they found surprising
or unexpected, plans for future universal mental health screening efforts, and their belief in
the sustainability of these efforts.
Grantees’ responses to these questions were highly informative, and a key theme emerged
almost immediately. Grantees’ self-reported successes directly align with the core
components of an effective universal mental health screening system. Conversely, their
self-reported- challenges are consistent with issues that arise when these components are
missing and/or have not yet been fully developed.
This pilot opportunity continues to inform the Department of the multiple complexities in administering screenings.
Some challenges identified by districts are time, financial, and staff training. For some districts challenges arose
around understanding the difference between a universal mental health screener and a social emotional screener. All
districts who opted in to participate in this pilot were given professional development to understand the differences
and purpose of the two types of screeners.
Following are highlights from their responses about: 1) Successes; 2) Implications and
Considerations for the Future; and 3) Benefits of Coaching and Consultation.
Successes
Grantees’ responses indicate that they experienced the greatest success implementing
universal mental health screening processes when one or more of the following
components was in place:
• Buy-in
• Infrastructure and Processes
• Plans for Follow-Up
• Student and Family Engagement
Buy-In
Grantees’ responses indicated that buy-in from stakeholders contributed greatly to the
success of their universal mental health screening efforts. Grantees identified a range of
stakeholders that made their efforts possible, including administrators, teachers, school
support staff, counseling staff, students, families, and community-based- providers.
Stakeholders such as these can increase acceptance, awareness, and sustainability of
universal mental health screening practices. For example, when asked what facilitated
their success, a grantee stated: “The actual tool itself, …was non-intrusive and helped with
buy-in from staff, admin, and parents/guardians.” Given this, the grantee is in better
positioned to implement the same tool next year, particularly as their key stakeholders
8
have a deeper understanding of the purpose of the tool, the questions asked, and the ease
with which it can be administered.
It is worth noting that the importance of buy-in cannot be overstated, especially buy-in
from senior administrators. Efforts to gain or increase buy-in must be directed at senior
administrators, in addition to others of course. Visible buy-in from senior administrators
demonstrates that universal mental health screening efforts have merit and are the
purview of a wide swath of stakeholders, not just those who oversee and implement
screening practices. Grantees who reported high levels of success piloting universal
mental health screening systems generally also reported having had buy-in from senior
administrators.
Additionally, efforts to gain or increase buy-in from teachers and families must be given
significant consideration. Several grantees reported having targeted strategies for engaging
teachers and families – partly to ensure that teachers and families understood the larger
goals of the mental health screening process, and partly to ensure that they understood
the teacher- or family-specific mental screening tools they were being asked to complete
and how the data from these tools would be stored and utilized.
With buy-in being such a strong, recurring theme in grantees’ responses, it is clear that
effective universal screening mental health efforts necessarily account for: 1) educating
and creating consensus among stakeholders regarding the value of universal mental
health screening ; 2) establishing an inclusive team-based approach to mental health
screening, with team members reflecting a range of stakeholders including administrators;
and 3) ensuring that teams have a shared vision and plan for mental health screening
logistics, communication, and follow-up.
Infrastructure and Processes
Grantees’ responses indicated that in addition to having buy-in, having a robust
infrastructure and well-defined- processes – in place prior to screening – was also critical
to the success of their universal mental health screening efforts. Grantees noted that
several key elements related to infrastructure and processes were particularly important.
For example, several grantees mentioned the following elements in their responses:
• Clearly defined purpose, goals, and objectives: Ensuring that those responsible
for coordinating universal mental health screening efforts, along with other key
stakeholders, developed and can articulate a clear understanding of the purpose,
goals, and objectives for implementing a screening process in their
school/district/collaborative.
• Collaboration and coordination: Ensuring that relevant parties were
collaboratively oriented to the selected tool, informed about and trained in their
respective roles in the screening process, and prepared to perform their
responsibilities throughout the screening process.
9
• Accessibility and inclusivity: Ensuring that selection of the tool – and
communication about the selected tool – was informed by and aligned with
overarching screening goals; students’ developmental ages, stages, and abilities;
and students’ and families’ racial, cultural, and linguistic backgrounds.
• Technology, data management, and integration: Ensuring that technology was
user friendly; cost-effective; tailored to both the tool selected and the unique needs
of the staff, students, and families; able to provide real-time data tracking,
monitoring, and analysis; designed with data protection and privacy safeguards;
and developed or configured to be integrated with student information and other
data systems.
According to many grantees, once these key elements were in place, facilitation of the
mental health screening process tended to run smoothly and resulted in a clear sense of
which students required follow-up.
Plans for Follow-Up
Grantees’ responses indicated that several schools/districts/collaboratives have routine
practices, and in some case more formal systems approaches, in place for identifying and
responding to students who may be experiencing a mental health challenge. Accordingly,
when these schools/districts/collaboratives implemented universal mental health
screening efforts, they tended to have defined plans in place to follow up with students
whose screenings suggested a need for additional screening and/or more formal follow-up.
Plans for follow-up with students, and often their families as well, included ongoing check-
ins and other personalized support, as well as referrals to school support staff and/or
community-based providers. Below are two quotes that further emphasize the importance
of having established plans that can be enacted if or when a student is identified as
needing additional support services, either in the school/district/collaborative or through
an external provider.
Speaking to their plans for follow-up, a charter school in metro Boston stated: “We were
able to use the response data to follow up with students who indicated reason for concern
and offer support services to the students and their families.” Regarding whether they
believe this approach to be sustainable, they noted: “As long as we retain our counseling
department staff, who were all heavily involved in the planning, implementation, and
follow-up, this is an initiative that our district can continue in the future.”
Also answering the question regarding sustainability, a regional high school in southeastern
MA stated: “The development of detailed protocol for pre-screening, screening, and post-
screening are critical to our ability to continue screening. Our access to [our provider entity]
for outside referrals is crucial. Adjusting the school adjustment counselor role to include
screening follow-up and group counseling intervention will be essential to the continuation
of screening.”
10
According to these comments, sustainability of future universal mental health screening
efforts is not necessarily a reflection of interest and desire to continue, but rather access to
and availability of inhouse and external practitioners who can respond to students’ unique
needs in a timely manner.
Student and Family Engagement
Another theme that emerged from grantees’ responses was how engaged students were in
the universal mental health screening process, and in turn how crucial their investment in
the process was to the schools/districts/collaboratives’ overall success. Below are a series
of quotes that demonstrate this further.
• “We were surprised with how open-minded the students were to answering
screening questions openly and honestly and how willing they were to answer
follow-up questions with counselors.” (Regional high school in southeastern MA)
• “How honest students were in their answers and how seriously they took the
screening.” (Regional high school in western MA)
• “Middle School Students 6-8 were really interested in taking the screener and
learning more about mental health. We had a huge increase in students asking
about somatic symptoms and how they relate to mental health. Teachers and admin
were all on board. Some teachers made the screener extra credit or provided raffle
tickets as an incentive – which was a huge help! The data was useful to inform
therapeutic skill building groups and community organization connections for
students/families. The [platform we used] was easy to use and delineating all the
data (gender, cohort, age, EL, disability).” (Charter school in southeastern MA)
Considerations for Future Practice
Grantees’ responses surfaced themes regarding areas of growth or improvement relative
to piloting universal mental health screening systems. These trends have been distilled
into several key areas, as they have clear implications and considerations for future
practice. These areas include:
• Timing: Initiating, Staging, and Administration
• Scaling Up Communication
• Follow-Up with Identified Students and Responsive Staffing
Timing: Initiating, Staging and Administration
A consistent theme noted by grantees was related to timing, specifically their desire to
begin piloting universal mental health screening systems as early as possible in the school
year. Starting early in the school year, grantees are better able to account for activities that
can be particularly time-intensive, such as engaging administration in mental health
screening planning efforts, developing a mental health screening communication plan,
mapping out the logistics of mental health screening administration, conducting mental
health screening in waves to reduce strain on the team and/or practitioners responsible for
11
follow-up, and conducting a thorough and meaningful follow-up process with the high
percentage of students identified as needing additional mental health screening or
supports. By allocating- sufficient time for these activities in late summer or early fall,
there are greater opportunities to be flexible and responsive if or when situations arise that
can potentially challenge the success of the overarching mental health screening process.
Related to this, several grantees indicated that a primarily challenge to the success of their
overarching mental health screening process was allocating requisite time to conduct
mental health screening and to follow up with students identified as needing follow-up.
Some grantees noted that the time of year they chose for screening had an impact on their
ability to focus on and seamlessly carry out mental health screening administration. For
example, some grantees selected a window of time during the school year to implement
mental health screening, and then found that their efforts were made more complicated by
co-occurring activities such as MCAS administration. These grantees reported that they
will be better prepared in terms of future scheduling given the key lessons they learned this
past school year.
Additionally, some grantees indicated that a challenge to the mental health screening
process was determining how best to stagger mental health screening administration. For
example, grantees that elected to screen larger cohorts of students divided students into
small groups to be screened in iterative cycles. This strategy allowed grantees to achieve
universal screening without overwhelming the follow-up team with a single wave of
referrals.
Scaling Up Communication
Some grantees that had prior experience piloting universal mental health screening
systems reported that scaling up their communication plans regarding expanded mental
health screening efforts was particularly time-intensive. While these grantees were able to
build on their original communication plans, some were surprised by the increased
amount of time needed to communicate with those who were new to mental health
screening, particularly newly impacted staff, students, and families. With that said, some
grantees noted that communication planning would be more streamlined in the future
given the amount of planning they engaged in during the past year.
All districts that opted in to participate in the universal mental health screening were given
coaching and professional development to assist in building systems around screening
practices. The Department will continue to work with districts that opt in to participate in
universal mental health screening and all districts to better understand screening practices
and implementation.
Follow-Up with Identified Students and Responsive Staffing
Several grantees reported a high prevalence of students identified as needing follow-up,
with some students able to be seen by internal staff, at least initially, and others by
community-based providers. Many grantees indicated that internal staff responsible for
12
coordinating follow-up were generally able to meet with students within a week of
screening. To make this happen, grantees reported having to make a concerted effort to
determine how best to leverage existing staff to ensure that students received timely
follow-up and were routed to appropriate services to meet their needs, while also
maintaining ongoing operations and responsibilities. These staff tended to be
school--based mental health staff, including school counselors, school social workers,
adjustment counselors, and school psychologists.
Through coaching and consultation, grantees were prompted to consider adaptations to
current school staffing models as a function of the need to follow up with and provide
services to an influx of students with identified mental health needs, including the
allocation of staff who typically have not been utilized to provide mental health-related
services. Some grantees may find it necessary to reconfigure and/or redeploy staff to
address students’ mental health needs, particularly with the ongoing shortage of
community-based mental health providers that can accept referrals for students in need of
additional services. Reasons for these shortages include a limited number of providers in
various geographic areas as well as a limited number of culturally and linguistically
competent providers;
Grantees are expected and supported to consider where needed and feasible how best to
equip and make available in-school staff that can provide mental health services – ideally
at all tiers, including tier 1/prevention.
Districts have utilized funding to support screening best practices as well as other mental
health and social emotional learning efforts. The Department will continue to work with
school districts to provide coaching and professional development to address these
challenges learned through best practices identified in this pilot.
Coaching and Consultation
Twenty grantees received funding to pilot universal mental health screening systems, and
19 (95 percent) participated in professional development and coaching and consultation
that the Department made available to support grantees’ efforts in this area.
Grantees reported several highlights from their experiences with coaching and
consultation, particularly that they were:
• Given a high-level orientation to piloting universal mental health screening systems,
including but not limited to information about essential infrastructure and
processes
• Introduced to common issues that arise during mental health screening and a
plethora of strategies that can be applied to address these issues
o Including thinking through and identifying solutions to address pinch points
and barriers to successful implementation
13
• Provided with and trained to utilize toolkits with user-friendly resources, such as
already developed templates and spreadsheets
• Provided with regularly scheduled, formal coaching sessions and other ad hoc
opportunities to:
o Share updates about pilot successes and challenges, and receive feedback
from the assigned coach and other grantees
Grantees reported that coaching offered them a comprehensive plan for piloting universal
mental health screening systems, with guidance and instructions for developing a detailed
timeline that would allow for screening to be initiated and scaled up at a comfortable pace.
Additionally, coaching enabled grantees to brainstorm, generate, and modify, as needed,
their own mental health communication plans, administration schedules and protocols,
and follow-up procedures to meet the needs of identified students. Grantees benefited
from having all of this in place prior to launching their screening efforts. More specifically,
by grantees having each of these activities clearly and thoroughly mapped out prior to
implementation, they were more likely to overcome barriers to implementation.
Grantees also reported that they found great value in the toolkits that coaches provided
and/or made accessible. For example, grantees noted that they utilized the communication
protocols and templates, as well as the readymade, already digitized screening tools (e.g.,
screening measures in Google forms). By having to place less focus on designing these
materials, grantees were able to dedicate more attention to determining how they would
use the materials, particularly to identify individuals and groups of students in need of
follow-up and more actively engage in data analysis for decision-making and reporting
purposes.
Grantees expressed gratitude for having opportunities, both formal and informal, to
connect with their coach and fellow grantees to ask questions and receive feedback
throughout their respective pilots, including during planning and implementation phases.
Grantees reported that these opportunities served to reduce stress related to executing
their respective pilots, which generally increased confidence that they had the capacity to
carry out their pilots as intended. Grantees attributed a great deal of their success to
support from their coaches and peer support from and shared learning with other grantees.
It was clear from grantees’ responses that they attributed a great deal of their mental
health screening success, and belief in the sustainability of their efforts, to the coaching
and consultation that the Department offered through this grant opportunity. Grantees’
responses further indicate that they deeply appreciated the collaborative learning
experience, and gained significant knowledge, skills, and insight thanks to their
participation.
The pilot was valuable to districts and Department learning and will inform work in FY2023
and beyond. DESE and its vendors continue to learn about challenges and needs districts
14
are experiencing around choosing and implementing universal mental health screeners
through this pilot. DESE will continue to offer support through coaching and professional
development to address these needs to support screening practices. The Department can
be contacted for more information about other aspects of the grant program if desired.

Dear Members of the Joint Committee on Education, the Joint Committee on Mental
Health, Substance Use and Recovery, and House and Senate Committees on Ways and
Means:
I am pleased to submit this this report, Social Emotional Learning Grants: Fiscal Year
2023 Report on Universal Mental Health Screening Pilot, pursuant to Chapter 126 of the
Acts of 2022, line item 7061-0028, that reads in part:
“…provided further, that not later than August 31, 2023, the department shall submit
a report to the joint committee on education, the joint committee on mental health,
substance use and recovery and the house and senate committees on ways and
means that shall include: (1) a description of the participants in the pilot program;
(2) a summary of the data collected from program participants; and (3) any
recommendations to further expand the availability of mental health screenings for
students…”
This line item helps advance the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education’s
(Department) strategic priority to strengthen social emotional competencies, health, and
safety, which aims to promote systems and strategies that foster safe, positive, healthy,
culturally-responsive, and inclusive learning environments that address students’ varied
needs and improve educational outcomes for all. The funding provides critical resources to
schools, districts, charter schools and educational collaboratives as they build “systems of
integrated student supports” to “free children up to engage in the type of critical thinking
and deeper learning to which our schools and education systems aspire,” as described in
the Our Way Forward report1 and our new Educational Vision. These resources are
particularly important as we continue to see student social and emotional, behavioral, and
mental health and educator mental wellness concerns.
The efforts funded through this line item helped further the ability of communities across
the commonwealth to maximize coordination with service providers and establish more
comprehensive continuums of care. These funds helped to increase student access to

behavioral and mental health services, including grant funded services, delivered in
partnership with community-based providers, for students. In addition, professional
development coordinated by the Department and offered to school staff supported their
ability to identify students’ social and emotional and behavioral and mental health needs
as well as educators’ needs as part of comprehensive, integrated, tiered approaches to
promoting wellness for all students and educators, and to address needs of students
requiring additional supports.
The (SEL and Mental Health) grant, awarded in December 2022 provided professional
development (PD) and coaching supports to help school staff identify students in need of
services and connect those students to services as well as address the wellness needs of
staff.
If you have any questions, feel free to contact Rachelle Engler Bennett, Associate
Commissioner, Student and Family Support via RachelleEngler.Bennett@mass.gov. We
look forward to continuing to facilitate and coordinate this work and thank the Governor
and Legislature for your commitment to the students of the Commonwealth.

senate committees on ways and means that shall include: (1) a description of the
participants in the pilot program; (2) a summary of the data collected from program
participants; and (3) any recommendations to further expand the availability of
mental health screenings for students.
This report provides information about grant activities and professional development
offered through this line item and includes the required information about (1) a description
of the participants in the pilot program; (2) a summary of the data collected from program
participants; and (3) any recommendations to further expand the availability of mental
health screenings for students.
The Department continues to work collaboratively with the Executive Office of Health and
Human Services (EOHHS), including the Departments of Public Health and Mental Health
(DPH and DMH), to leverage existing and planned initiatives and to promote
complementary and supplemental activities. The Department also continues to make
efforts to coordinate and align related opportunities where helpful, and to use multiple
funding sources where needed and appropriate to support related goals. For example, the
grant program described below includes funding from both the Social Emotional Learning
line item 7061-0028 and the Student Wellness School Supports/Supporting Healthy
Alliances Reinforcing Education line item 7061-9650.
Selection of Participating Grantees
In September 2022, the Department posted the fiscal year 2023 (FY2023) Request for
Proposals (RFP) opportunity through Fund Code (FC) 311 Supporting Students' Social
Emotional Learning, Behavioral and Mental Health, and Wellness through Multi-Tiered
Systems of Support (SEL and Mental Health Grant). Massachusetts public school districts,
including charter schools, and educational collaboratives were eligible to apply. On
October 13, 2022, the Department received 40 applications requesting over $3 million.
After conducting its grant review process, the Department awarded a total of over $3
million to all forty (40) applicants to implement activities district-wide or in one or more
schools that increase student access to behavioral and mental health services.

Summary Report: Piloting Universal Mental Health
Screening
The following data was collected based on criteria in the legislative line item 7061-0028,
Social Emotional Learning:
• Number of students who received mental health screenings, delineated by
demographic group and grade level;
• Number of students requiring additional support or follow-up screenings, including
students who indicated suicidal ideation or intent to self-harm;
• Length of time between the initial screening and subsequent support services
provided;
• Number of students referred for additional support services outside of the school
district; and
• Types of screening tools used.
Background Data
In FY2023 a total of twenty-one (21) grantees out of forty (40) opted in to participate in
Piloting Universal Mental Health Screening. One district chose to opt out due to staffing
challenges, leaving twenty schools. They represent urban, suburban, and rural school
districts (referred to from this point forward as “grantees”).
In June 2023, grantees completed an end of year survey, with questions about the universal
mental health screening data they collected and their experiences piloting universal
mental health screening systems. This report presents a summary of their survey
responses, divided into two sections, with the first section focused on their data and the
second section focused on their experiences.
Section 1: FY2023 Universal Mental Health Screening Data
This section provides an overview of FY2023 grantees’ universal mental health screening
data, including the total number of students screened and a delineation of the number of
students screened by grade and key demographic categories.
All twenty (20) grantees were successful in their universal mental health screening efforts.
Each grantee selected at least one universal mental health screening tool and screened at
least one group of students by the end of FY2023. Upon the conclusion of June 2023,
grantees had screened a total of 11,805 students. The number of students screened
ranged from a total of 10 students for a smaller school district to a total of 3,985 for a large
school district. This district accounted for 33.8 percent of all the students screened.
Following is additional information about the number of students screened, particularly
the number of students screened by grade, demographic group, gender, and three
3

additional demographic categories (i.e., students identified as high needs, students with
disabilities, and students who are English Language Learners). Please note that there are
some discrepancies between the total number of students screened and the total number
of students screened by grade, demographic group, and gender, largely due to data
collection methods to be discussed further.

# of Students by Grade
The trend that emerges from the mental health screening data by grade is consistent with
universal mental health screening practices. Students are often screened for behavioral
4

and mental health issues, especially related to mood and/or anxiety, in middle grades and
early high school. There are fewer developmentally appropriate tools that assess similar
issues among younger children, and screening older high school students generally leaves
little time to meet their needs in a school-based setting. As the graph demonstrates,
however, there is FY2023 mental health screening data across all grades, from
kindergarten through 12th Grade.

# of Students by demographic group
The mental health screening data by demographic group shows the greatest discrepancy
between the total number of students screened and the total number broken down by
demographic group. There are two primary reasons for this discrepancy. First, a few
districts did not report demographic data about the students, for reasons that may be
related to a variety of challenges; and one district reported that the online screening
program did not include a field for capturing demographic group and they had not set up
5

another way to collect the information. In other cases, students self-identified their
demographic groups, resulting in data that cannot easily be organized into the state’s
demographic group categories. Due to difficulties with category alignment, these data
were excluded from the total number screened by demographic group in the chart above.
As the Department continues additional years of piloting screening with districts, DESE
will work closely with grantees to improve data collection related to race and ethnicity, with
the goal of having as complete demographic data as possible from districts related to
students screened in FY2024 and beyond. DESE will increase efforts to make sure districts
are clear about data collection requirements prior to participation in the screening pilot,
and have tools and methods to be collecting and then reporting on demographic data as
part of their screening and reporting practices. Additionally, DESE will communicate with
coaches at several key time periods of the initiative (e.g., before the start, mid-way
through, and during data submission time) to emphasize the importance of complete data
collection and to provide support and technical assistance to grantees to proactively
address any challenges that arise.

# of Students by Gender
Similar to students being able to self-identity their demographic group, some grantees
provided students the option to self-identify their gender identity. For the purpose of this
report, the following gender identities are included in the non-binary category: non-binary,
6

trans, gender queer, gender non-conforming, and other. In addition to this data, there is a
small amount (approximately 1 percent) of screened students for whom DESE did not
receive gender information. It is unclear if this information was not collected or if students
chose to leave the field blank (for example because there are no available categories that
affirm their gender identity.
Students Screened and Other Demographics–Figure 7
Of the 11,805 students screened, 2,403 (20.4 percent) were identified as having high
needs; 1,743 (14.8 percent) were identified as having a disability; and 830 (7.0 percent)
were identified as an English Language Learner.
Other Demographics # of Students Screened
Students Identified as High Needs 2,403
Students with Disabilities 1,743
English Language Learners 830
Students Needing Additional Support or Follow-Up Screenings
Of the 11,805 students screened, 775 (6.6 percent) were identified as needing additional
support or follow-up screenings (including students who indicated- suicidal ideation or
intent to self-harm). Of all twenty (20) grantees, eight (8) indicated that students were
typically seen for additional support services the day of screening; two (2) indicated within
a week of screening; 3 indicated within two weeks of screening; and three (3) indicated
within a month of screening.
Of the 775 students identified as needing additional support services, 99 (12.8 percent)
were referred for services outside of the school or district. Students and families were
most commonly referred to their local mobile crisis team, community-based counseling
providers or therapists, William James INTERFACE Referral Service, Care Solace, and/or
Riverside Community Care.
Mental Health Screening Tools Utilized
Grantees reported utilizing a total of 13 mental health screening tools in FY2023. Of the
twenty (20) grantees, 13 (65 percent) reported implementing one screening tool; 4 (20
percent) reported implementing two screening tools; and 3 (15 percent) reported
implementing three screening tools.

Section 2: FY2023 Themes and Trends in Open-Ended Responses
regarding Experiences
This section provides an overview of FY2023 grantees’ responses to open-ended questions
about their experiences piloting universal mental health screening systems, including
questions about their successes, challenges, aspects of the process they found surprising
or unexpected, plans for future universal mental health screening efforts, and their belief in
the sustainability of these efforts.
Grantees’ responses to these questions were highly informative, and a key theme emerged
almost immediately. Grantees’ self-reported successes directly align with the core
components of an effective universal mental health screening system. Conversely, their
self-reported- challenges are consistent with issues that arise when these components are
missing and/or have not yet been fully developed.
This pilot opportunity continues to inform the Department of the multiple complexities in administering screenings.
Some challenges identified by districts are time, financial, and staff training. For some districts challenges arose
around understanding the difference between a universal mental health screener and a social emotional screener. All
districts who opted in to participate in this pilot were given professional development to understand the differences
and purpose of the two types of screeners.
Following are highlights from their responses about: 1) Successes; 2) Implications and
Considerations for the Future; and 3) Benefits of Coaching and Consultation.
Successes
Grantees’ responses indicate that they experienced the greatest success implementing
universal mental health screening processes when one or more of the following
components was in place:
• Buy-in
• Infrastructure and Processes
• Plans for Follow-Up
• Student and Family Engagement
Buy-In
Grantees’ responses indicated that buy-in from stakeholders contributed greatly to the
success of their universal mental health screening efforts. Grantees identified a range of
stakeholders that made their efforts possible, including administrators, teachers, school
support staff, counseling staff, students, families, and community-based- providers.
Stakeholders such as these can increase acceptance, awareness, and sustainability of
universal mental health screening practices. For example, when asked what facilitated
their success, a grantee stated: “The actual tool itself, …was non-intrusive and helped with
buy-in from staff, admin, and parents/guardians.” Given this, the grantee is in better
positioned to implement the same tool next year, particularly as their key stakeholders
8

have a deeper understanding of the purpose of the tool, the questions asked, and the ease
with which it can be administered.
It is worth noting that the importance of buy-in cannot be overstated, especially buy-in
from senior administrators. Efforts to gain or increase buy-in must be directed at senior
administrators, in addition to others of course. Visible buy-in from senior administrators
demonstrates that universal mental health screening efforts have merit and are the
purview of a wide swath of stakeholders, not just those who oversee and implement
screening practices. Grantees who reported high levels of success piloting universal
mental health screening systems generally also reported having had buy-in from senior
administrators.
Additionally, efforts to gain or increase buy-in from teachers and families must be given
significant consideration. Several grantees reported having targeted strategies for engaging
teachers and families – partly to ensure that teachers and families understood the larger
goals of the mental health screening process, and partly to ensure that they understood
the teacher- or family-specific mental screening tools they were being asked to complete
and how the data from these tools would be stored and utilized.
With buy-in being such a strong, recurring theme in grantees’ responses, it is clear that
effective universal screening mental health efforts necessarily account for: 1) educating
and creating consensus among stakeholders regarding the value of universal mental
health screening ; 2) establishing an inclusive team-based approach to mental health
screening, with team members reflecting a range of stakeholders including administrators;
and 3) ensuring that teams have a shared vision and plan for mental health screening
logistics, communication, and follow-up.
Infrastructure and Processes
Grantees’ responses indicated that in addition to having buy-in, having a robust
infrastructure and well-defined- processes – in place prior to screening – was also critical
to the success of their universal mental health screening efforts. Grantees noted that
several key elements related to infrastructure and processes were particularly important.
For example, several grantees mentioned the following elements in their responses:
• Clearly defined purpose, goals, and objectives: Ensuring that those responsible
for coordinating universal mental health screening efforts, along with other key
stakeholders, developed and can articulate a clear understanding of the purpose,
goals, and objectives for implementing a screening process in their
school/district/collaborative.
• Collaboration and coordination: Ensuring that relevant parties were
collaboratively oriented to the selected tool, informed about and trained in their
respective roles in the screening process, and prepared to perform their
responsibilities throughout the screening process.
9

• Accessibility and inclusivity: Ensuring that selection of the tool – and
communication about the selected tool – was informed by and aligned with
overarching screening goals; students’ developmental ages, stages, and abilities;
and students’ and families’ racial, cultural, and linguistic backgrounds.
• Technology, data management, and integration: Ensuring that technology was
user friendly; cost-effective; tailored to both the tool selected and the unique needs
of the staff, students, and families; able to provide real-time data tracking,
monitoring, and analysis; designed with data protection and privacy safeguards;
and developed or configured to be integrated with student information and other
data systems.
According to many grantees, once these key elements were in place, facilitation of the
mental health screening process tended to run smoothly and resulted in a clear sense of
which students required follow-up.
Plans for Follow-Up
Grantees’ responses indicated that several schools/districts/collaboratives have routine
practices, and in some case more formal systems approaches, in place for identifying and
responding to students who may be experiencing a mental health challenge. Accordingly,
when these schools/districts/collaboratives implemented universal mental health
screening efforts, they tended to have defined plans in place to follow up with students
whose screenings suggested a need for additional screening and/or more formal follow-up.
Plans for follow-up with students, and often their families as well, included ongoing check-
ins and other personalized support, as well as referrals to school support staff and/or
community-based providers. Below are two quotes that further emphasize the importance
of having established plans that can be enacted if or when a student is identified as
needing additional support services, either in the school/district/collaborative or through
an external provider.
Speaking to their plans for follow-up, a charter school in metro Boston stated: “We were
able to use the response data to follow up with students who indicated reason for concern
and offer support services to the students and their families.” Regarding whether they
believe this approach to be sustainable, they noted: “As long as we retain our counseling
department staff, who were all heavily involved in the planning, implementation, and
follow-up, this is an initiative that our district can continue in the future.”
Also answering the question regarding sustainability, a regional high school in southeastern
MA stated: “The development of detailed protocol for pre-screening, screening, and post-
screening are critical to our ability to continue screening. Our access to [our provider entity]
for outside referrals is crucial. Adjusting the school adjustment counselor role to include
screening follow-up and group counseling intervention will be essential to the continuation
of screening.”

According to these comments, sustainability of future universal mental health screening
efforts is not necessarily a reflection of interest and desire to continue, but rather access to
and availability of inhouse and external practitioners who can respond to students’ unique
needs in a timely manner.
Student and Family Engagement
Another theme that emerged from grantees’ responses was how engaged students were in
the universal mental health screening process, and in turn how crucial their investment in
the process was to the schools/districts/collaboratives’ overall success. Below are a series
of quotes that demonstrate this further.
• “We were surprised with how open-minded the students were to answering
screening questions openly and honestly and how willing they were to answer
follow-up questions with counselors.” (Regional high school in southeastern MA)
• “How honest students were in their answers and how seriously they took the
screening.” (Regional high school in western MA)
• “Middle School Students 6-8 were really interested in taking the screener and
learning more about mental health. We had a huge increase in students asking
about somatic symptoms and how they relate to mental health. Teachers and admin
were all on board. Some teachers made the screener extra credit or provided raffle
tickets as an incentive – which was a huge help! The data was useful to inform
therapeutic skill building groups and community organization connections for
students/families. The [platform we used] was easy to use and delineating all the
data (gender, cohort, age, EL, disability).” (Charter school in southeastern MA)
Considerations for Future Practice
Grantees’ responses surfaced themes regarding areas of growth or improvement relative
to piloting universal mental health screening systems. These trends have been distilled
into several key areas, as they have clear implications and considerations for future
practice. These areas include:
• Timing: Initiating, Staging, and Administration
• Scaling Up Communication
• Follow-Up with Identified Students and Responsive Staffing
Timing: Initiating, Staging and Administration
A consistent theme noted by grantees was related to timing, specifically their desire to
begin piloting universal mental health screening systems as early as possible in the school
year. Starting early in the school year, grantees are better able to account for activities that
can be particularly time-intensive, such as engaging administration in mental health
screening planning efforts, developing a mental health screening communication plan,
mapping out the logistics of mental health screening administration, conducting mental
health screening in waves to reduce strain on the team and/or practitioners responsible for
11

follow-up, and conducting a thorough and meaningful follow-up process with the high
percentage of students identified as needing additional mental health screening or
supports. By allocating- sufficient time for these activities in late summer or early fall,
there are greater opportunities to be flexible and responsive if or when situations arise that
can potentially challenge the success of the overarching mental health screening process.
Related to this, several grantees indicated that a primarily challenge to the success of their
overarching mental health screening process was allocating requisite time to conduct
mental health screening and to follow up with students identified as needing follow-up.
Some grantees noted that the time of year they chose for screening had an impact on their
ability to focus on and seamlessly carry out mental health screening administration. For
example, some grantees selected a window of time during the school year to implement
mental health screening, and then found that their efforts were made more complicated by
co-occurring activities such as MCAS administration. These grantees reported that they
will be better prepared in terms of future scheduling given the key lessons they learned this
past school year.
Additionally, some grantees indicated that a challenge to the mental health screening
process was determining how best to stagger mental health screening administration. For
example, grantees that elected to screen larger cohorts of students divided students into
small groups to be screened in iterative cycles. This strategy allowed grantees to achieve
universal screening without overwhelming the follow-up team with a single wave of
referrals.
Scaling Up Communication
Some grantees that had prior experience piloting universal mental health screening
systems reported that scaling up their communication plans regarding expanded mental
health screening efforts was particularly time-intensive. While these grantees were able to
build on their original communication plans, some were surprised by the increased
amount of time needed to communicate with those who were new to mental health
screening, particularly newly impacted staff, students, and families. With that said, some
grantees noted that communication planning would be more streamlined in the future
given the amount of planning they engaged in during the past year.
All districts that opted in to participate in the universal mental health screening were given
coaching and professional development to assist in building systems around screening
practices. The Department will continue to work with districts that opt in to participate in
universal mental health screening and all districts to better understand screening practices
and implementation.
Follow-Up with Identified Students and Responsive Staffing
Several grantees reported a high prevalence of students identified as needing follow-up,
with some students able to be seen by internal staff, at least initially, and others by
community-based providers. Many grantees indicated that internal staff responsible for
12

coordinating follow-up were generally able to meet with students within a week of
screening. To make this happen, grantees reported having to make a concerted effort to
determine how best to leverage existing staff to ensure that students received timely
follow-up and were routed to appropriate services to meet their needs, while also
maintaining ongoing operations and responsibilities. These staff tended to be
school--based mental health staff, including school counselors, school social workers,
adjustment counselors, and school psychologists.
Through coaching and consultation, grantees were prompted to consider adaptations to
current school staffing models as a function of the need to follow up with and provide
services to an influx of students with identified mental health needs, including the
allocation of staff who typically have not been utilized to provide mental health-related
services. Some grantees may find it necessary to reconfigure and/or redeploy staff to
address students’ mental health needs, particularly with the ongoing shortage of
community-based mental health providers that can accept referrals for students in need of
additional services. Reasons for these shortages include a limited number of providers in
various geographic areas as well as a limited number of culturally and linguistically
competent providers;
Grantees are expected and supported to consider where needed and feasible how best to
equip and make available in-school staff that can provide mental health services – ideally
at all tiers, including tier 1/prevention.
Districts have utilized funding to support screening best practices as well as other mental
health and social emotional learning efforts. The Department will continue to work with
school districts to provide coaching and professional development to address these
challenges learned through best practices identified in this pilot.
Coaching and Consultation
Twenty grantees received funding to pilot universal mental health screening systems, and
19 (95 percent) participated in professional development and coaching and consultation
that the Department made available to support grantees’ efforts in this area.
Grantees reported several highlights from their experiences with coaching and
consultation, particularly that they were:
• Given a high-level orientation to piloting universal mental health screening systems,
including but not limited to information about essential infrastructure and
processes
• Introduced to common issues that arise during mental health screening and a
plethora of strategies that can be applied to address these issues
o Including thinking through and identifying solutions to address pinch points
and barriers to successful implementation
13

• Provided with and trained to utilize toolkits with user-friendly resources, such as
already developed templates and spreadsheets
• Provided with regularly scheduled, formal coaching sessions and other ad hoc
opportunities to:
o Share updates about pilot successes and challenges, and receive feedback
from the assigned coach and other grantees
Grantees reported that coaching offered them a comprehensive plan for piloting universal
mental health screening systems, with guidance and instructions for developing a detailed
timeline that would allow for screening to be initiated and scaled up at a comfortable pace.
Additionally, coaching enabled grantees to brainstorm, generate, and modify, as needed,
their own mental health communication plans, administration schedules and protocols,
and follow-up procedures to meet the needs of identified students. Grantees benefited
from having all of this in place prior to launching their screening efforts. More specifically,
by grantees having each of these activities clearly and thoroughly mapped out prior to
implementation, they were more likely to overcome barriers to implementation.
Grantees also reported that they found great value in the toolkits that coaches provided
and/or made accessible. For example, grantees noted that they utilized the communication
protocols and templates, as well as the readymade, already digitized screening tools (e.g.,
screening measures in Google forms). By having to place less focus on designing these
materials, grantees were able to dedicate more attention to determining how they would
use the materials, particularly to identify individuals and groups of students in need of
follow-up and more actively engage in data analysis for decision-making and reporting
purposes.
Grantees expressed gratitude for having opportunities, both formal and informal, to
connect with their coach and fellow grantees to ask questions and receive feedback
throughout their respective pilots, including during planning and implementation phases.
Grantees reported that these opportunities served to reduce stress related to executing
their respective pilots, which generally increased confidence that they had the capacity to
carry out their pilots as intended. Grantees attributed a great deal of their success to
support from their coaches and peer support from and shared learning with other grantees.
It was clear from grantees’ responses that they attributed a great deal of their mental
health screening success, and belief in the sustainability of their efforts, to the coaching
and consultation that the Department offered through this grant opportunity. Grantees’
responses further indicate that they deeply appreciated the collaborative learning
experience, and gained significant knowledge, skills, and insight thanks to their
participation.
The pilot was valuable to districts and Department learning and will inform work in FY2023
and beyond. DESE and its vendors continue to learn about challenges and needs districts
14

are experiencing around choosing and implementing universal mental health screeners
through this pilot. DESE will continue to offer support through coaching and professional
development to address these needs to support screening practices. The Department can
be contacted for more information about other aspects of the grant program if desired.
