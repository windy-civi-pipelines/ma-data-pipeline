RE: Diversity in Sports Wagering and Recommendations for Future Practices in the Massachusetts
Industry
Dear Honorable Members of the General Court,
The Massachusetts Gaming Commission (Commission) is pleased to present the enclosed study on the
participation by minority business enterprises, women business enterprises and veteran business
enterprise in the sports wagering industry in the Commonwealth in accordance with Section 25 of
Chapter 173 of the Acts of 2022.
The Massachusetts Legislature tasked the Commission with conducting a study concerning diverse
participation within the sports wagering industry. The Commission contracted with the UMass Donahue
Institute Economic & Public Policy Research Group in partnership with Gemini Research to conduct this
study, which provides findings about the participation of minority, women, and veteran business
enterprises and workers in the sports wagering industry.
To better assist the Legislature in reviewing this study, included is a snapshot overview of the research.
Please note that the snapshot does not necessarily reflect the position of the Commission.

We thank the Legislature for the importance it has placed on conducting comprehensive research to
better understand this industry and its effects on the residents and businesses of the Commonwealth.
The Commission stands ready to answer any questions or discuss the findings of this study.
Respectfully submitted,
Massachusetts Gaming Commission

What you need to know
Sports wagering in Massachusetts is a relatively small industry in terms of employment and vendor spending. Across the United States,
however, the industry employs more than ten thousand well-paid workers, engages nearly 1,200 vendors, and spends nearly $1.75 billion a
year on these vendors. Overall, a significant portion of the sports wagering industry workforce comes from diverse backgrounds, both in
Massachusetts and in the U.S., and compares favorably to similar industries. The industry spent more than half a billion dollars per quarter on
vendors across the U.S., five percent of which went to Massachusetts firms. However, participation and spending on diverse firms makes up a
very small portion of engagement and spending for operators. The scarcity of certified diverse businesses generally and in the top spending

Executive Summary
The expanded gaming law, passed and signed in November 2011 directs the MGC to develop an annual
research agenda to investigate the social and economic effects of expanded gaming. The sports
wagering law signed in August 2022 expanded the scope of the agenda to include sports wagering,
requiring that the MGC build upon the existing research. The law specified several topics of concern to
include in the research agenda. This study addresses one of those mandated topics: a study of diverse
participation within the sports wagering industry. In particular, this study provides findings about the
participation of minority, women, and veteran business enterprises (MBE/WBE/VBE) and about the
participation of minority, women, and veteran workers in the sports wagering industry in the
Commonwealth.
While the term diversity can be defined more broadly, this study’s operational definition of diversity
refers to the three identities of interest specified in the legislation: racial and ethnic minority; women;
and veteran status. When referring to these groups in the aggregate, we use the terms ‘diverse.’ For
individual workers these identities are self-reported. For business enterprises, identities are officially
assigned based on ownership of the business: after an application process presenting qualifying criteria,
an enterprise can be awarded diverse certification status by one of the Commonwealth’s supplier
diversity programs.
The request for response for this study required that researchers examine conditions in the
Massachusetts sports wagering industry for three different groups: (1) the operators who offer retail
and online sports wagering activities (Category 1 and Category 3 licensees); (2) the Massachusetts
Gaming Commission in its role as a regulator of the industry; and (3) advertising, marketing, and
promotional firms that provide a range of professional goods and services to the sports wagering
industry.
This study of diverse participation reflects the mission of the MGC to “provide the greatest possible
economic development benefits and revenues to the people of the Commonwealth,” and its work to
ensure that the state’s gaming industry is inclusive and provides opportunities that reflect the diversity
of the Commonwealth. Broadly, the study aims to inform the MGC of ways to expand employee and
vendor diversity within the sports wagering sector, the newest area of gambling activity in the
Commonwealth. The work addresses specific research questions itemized and required by the request
for response and these topics are reflected in the findings below. The research finds that diversity
outcomes are different between casinos and sports wagering operators. The report attempts to make
clear how differences in operating activities as well as operator agreements shape diversity outcomes
across segments of the sports wagering industry.

SPORTS WAGERING INDUSTRY OVERVIEW
Sports Wagering in Massachusetts is a relatively small industry in terms of employment and vendor
spending. Across the United States, however, the industry employs more than ten thousand well-paid
workers, engages nearly 1,200 vendors, and spends nearly $1.75 billion a year on these vendors. The
nature and scale of sports wagering industry operations varies greatly across the two major licensee
categories and the regulator, with differing levels of hiring and contracting with businesses for goods
and services. The language of enabling legislation plays a role in these areas. Key differences are
highlighted in the table below:

WORKFORCE DIVERSITY
Overall, a significant portion of the sports wagering industry comes from diverse background, both in
Massachusetts and in the U.S., and compares favorably to similar industries. The national sports
wagering workforce, however, is more diverse. Participation of minority workers tends to be higher, and
participation of women and veterans tend to be lower. Compensation for jobs in Category 1 operations
is lower than that of Category 3 operations due to the nature of the work and the occupations involved.
Category-specific findings are as follows:
PARTICIPATION
Cat 1 A small but diverse group of Massachusetts workers are employed with opportunities
across job levels
Employment: On average, 51 workers are employed across the industry in Massachusetts
in any given quarter during 2023. All retail sports wagering employees are located in
Massachusetts, within the Commonwealth’s casinos.
Diversity: Of the 51 average employees across the industry per quarter, an average of
29.7 percent identify with racial minority groups, while 1.5 percent are veterans, and
27.2 percent identify as women.
Compensation: Minority workers and women make slightly more than the overall
average compensation for Category 1 workers per quarter, while veterans make a much
lower than the average compensation per quarter.
Job Levels: Minority workers tend to be overrepresented in entry-level positions
compared to the sports wagering industry overall while veterans are represented at this
level exclusively. Women are evenly represented between entry-level positions and
higher-level positions.
Compared to similar industries (gambling industries without hotels, travel and
accommodations): participation of diverse employees varies, depending on the major
occupations in the industry.
Cat 3 A large, diverse group of workers are employed across the U.S. with some
Massachusetts representation. Significant levels of compensation and opportunities for
equitable representation across job levels.
Employment: On average, 10,265 workers are employed across the industry in the U.S. in
any given quarter during 2023. Nearly 12 percent of those mobile sports wagering
employees, an average of 1,185 in a quarter, live in Massachusetts. However, according
to questionnaire results very few of these workers are involved in running operations
specific to Massachusetts.
Diversity (U.S.): Of all U.S. employees, about 36.1 percent of the workforce is made up of
workers who identify with racial minority groups, while 0.9 percent are veterans, and
28.3 percent identify as women.
Diversity (Massachusetts): In Massachusetts, minority workers make up a smaller share
of the workforce at 16.8 percent, while 0.6 percent are veterans, and 24.3 percent
identify as women.
UMass Donahue Institute
Economic and Public Policy Research 10

Compensation (U.S.): Across the U.S., minority workers and women make slightly less
than the overall average compensation for Category 3 workers per quarter, while
veterans make higher than the average compensation per quarter.
Compensation (Massachusetts): In Massachusetts, diverse workers fare better than the
average Category 3 worker. All three groups of diverse workers make slightly or even
well-above the overall average compensation with minority workers making above the
average, veterans making well above the average, and women making slightly above the
average
Job Levels (Massachusetts): Minority workers are slightly overrepresented at the entry
level and represented at similar levels to workers overall at the manager and supervisory
level. Women tend to be slightly underrepresented at the entry level, and slightly
overrepresented in manager or supervisory roles and at the executive level compared to
the sports wagering industry overall. Veterans are heavily overrepresented at the
manager or supervisor and executive levels.
Compared to similar industries (gambling industries without hotels, software, fintech,
advertising and marketing) participation of minority workers tends to be much higher,
and participation of women tends to be lower.
PROGRAMS AND POLICIES
We used questionnaires and stakeholder interviews to collect information on use of policies to promote
employment diversity in three areas: recruitment of a diverse workforce; the presence of training and
other programs to promote retention and development; and programs to support inclusive outcomes
for women, minority and veteran employees in the areas of compensation, benefits, career trajectory,
and turnover. Overall, all operators in both categories have workforce diversity initiatives in place.

VENDOR DIVERSITY
Overall, sports wagering industry spending is large, with relatively modest levels of spending on
Massachusetts firms. However, participation and spending with diverse firms makes up a very small
portion of engagement and spending with both Category 1 and Category 3 operators. The scarcity of
certified diverse businesses in the economy generally and in the top spending sectors for sports
wagering operators provides an explanation for the very low levels of diverse business participation in
the sports wagering industry. An additional barrier is the limited number of significant purchases, which
are typically specialized and sole-sourced. Spending on advertising and marketing firms by both
Category 1 and Category 3 operators highlights an opportunity for increased spending with diverse firms
in these sectors. Category-specific findings are as follows:
PARTICIPATION
Cat 1 Spending across the U.S. and within Massachusetts goes almost entirely to non-
diverse vendors and very few diverse vendors participate.
Category 1 spending across the U.S. is primarily to non-diverse firms and spending with
Massachusetts firms is almost entirely non-diverse.
There are no Minority Business Enterprise (MBE) or Veteran Business Enterprise (VBE)
firms in the industry’s Massachusetts contracts, and the average number of Women
Business Enterprises (WBEs) is so low it appears to be negligible, making up 4.3 percent
of all Massachusetts vendors.
Spending on advertising and marketing firms comprises about 15 percent of All U.S.
spending and about 90 percent of all spending in Massachusetts.
Cat 3 Spending across the U.S. and within Massachusetts goes primarily to non-diverse
vendors and relatively few diverse vendors participate.
Category 3 spending across the U.S. is primarily to non-diverse firms. Approximately 1.3
percent of vendors for the U.S. industry are registered as Minority Business Enterprises
(MBEs), 1.1 percent are registered as Women Business Enterprises (WBEs), and only 0.2
percent are registered as Veteran Business Enterprises (VBEs)
Although more than 12 percent of Category 3 spending in Massachusetts goes to
minority-owned firms, diverse vendor participation is very low. While MBE firms garner
proportionally more on average than other types of diverse vendors, less than five MBE
vendors participate. Average quarterly spending on other diverse vendor types is lower
than the average.
Spending on advertising and marketing firms comprises about 65 percent of All U.S.
spending and 50 percent of all spending in Massachusetts. However, no diverse vendors
are represented in this Massachusetts spending.
UMass Donahue Institute
Economic and Public Policy Research 12

PROGRAMS AND POLICIES
We used questionnaires and stakeholder interviews to catalogue the use of vendor diversity policies
in two areas: policies and practices related to solicitation of and contracting with minority, women,
and veteran business enterprises in the Commonwealth; and programs and policies to increase
levels of engagement, volume, and scale. Overall, all operators in both categories have vendor
diversity initiatives in place.
PROGRAMS
Solicitation of All Category 1 and Category 3 license holders as well as the MGC have programs,
DBEs policies, and practices in place related to solicitation of and contracting with
minority, women, and veteran-owned business enterprises.
Programs to Category 1 operators and the MGC universally have programs and policies to
increase levels of increase levels of engagement, volume, and scale with these businesses, as do
engagement, nearly all Category 3 operators. Operators emphasized that vendor spending was
volume, and scale generally limited to a few specialized companies and that there wasn’t much
opportunity to diversify their spending on diverse businesses.

goals expressed as a percentage of each organization’s discretionary budget (MBE 8%; WBE 14%;
VBE/SDVOBE 3%) which apply to all procurements for goods and services exceeding $150,000. The MGC
far exceeded their FY2023 benchmarks for contracting with women- and minority-owned businesses but
fell short on their veteran-owned business benchmark.
• Non-profit services: When it comes to spending on diverse firms by industry, Other Services,
which includes non-profit services, are the largest spending area for the MGC. This spending is
entirely concentrated in non-profit services and went to a women-owned business.
• Information services: The category of Information services is the other main area of spending
with diverse firms, concentrated among IT services and software providers, both provided by
minority- and women-owned businesses.
• Professional, scientific, and technical services and administrative and support services: The
MGC also spends in these areas. Both have a medium level of spending.

Introduction
Overview: Background to the Research Project
The expanded gaming law, passed and signed in November 2011, directs the Massachusetts Gaming
Commission (MGC) to develop an annual research agenda to investigate the social and economic effects
of expanded gaming.1 The sports wagering law, signed in August 2022, expanded the scope of the
agenda to include sports wagering-related issues.2 The sports wagering law (G.L. c.23N, section 25)
requires the MGC to build upon the existing research and specifies several studies to be carried out on
topics of particular interest. This report, commissioned by the MGC, responds to one of those mandated
topics: a study of the participation of minority, women, and veteran business enterprises
(MBE/WBE/VBE) as well as the participation of minority, women, and veteran workers in the sports
wagering industry in the Commonwealth.3
While the term diversity can be defined more broadly, this study’s operational definition of diversity
refers to the three identities of interest specified in the legislation: racial and ethnic minority; women;
and veteran status. When referring to these groups in aggregate, we use the terms ‘diverse.’ For
individual workers, these identities are self-reported within an operator’s employment data system. For
racial and ethnic minority status, the assignment is made through self-identification with racial and
ethnic categories that include Black/African American; Hispanic or Latino; Asian; American
Indian/Alaskan Native; Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander; and two or more races. For women or
gender minority status, the assignment is made for self-identified women.
For business enterprises, identities are officially assigned by a certifying entity based on the ownership
of the business. A major criterion is that the business must be at least 51 percent owned, managed, and
controlled by a qualified principal of the specified group (minority, woman, or veteran) who is also a U.S.
citizen or lawful permanent resident. The Massachusetts Supplier Diversity Office (SDO) determines
Minority Business Enterprise (MBE), Veteran Business Enterprise (VBE), and Women Business Enterprise
(WBE) according to SDO certification regulations.4 According to this document,
• A Minority Owned Business Enterprise (MBE) is defined as a business that is at least 51percent
owned, operated and controlled by one or more individuals from a traditionally
underrepresented or underserved group including African Americans, Cape Verdeans, Western
Hemisphere Hispanics, Asians, American Indians, Eskimos, and Aleuts.
• A Women Business Enterprise (WBE) is defined as a business that is at least 51 percent owned,
operated and controlled by one or more women.
1 G.L.c. 23K, section 71.
2 G.L. c. 23N, section 23.
3 When referring to these groups in aggregate, we will use the term diverse business enterprises and diverse employees.

425 CMR 2.00: Certification. https://www.mass.gov/doc/certification-regulations/download

• A Veteran Business Enterprise (VBE) is defined as a business that is at least 51 owned, operated,
and controlled by U.S. military veterans. Veteran status is conferred to a person who is a
veteran, as defined in M.G.L. c. 4 s. 7
After an application process presenting the qualifying criteria along with a range of required
documentation about the business, a business can be awarded diverse certification status by a supplier
diversity program. Supplier diversity program certifications obtained by vendors from their state
supplier diversity offices are recognized by MGC licensees and used to categorize diverse spending. The
Massachusetts Office of Supplier Diversity accepts supplier diversity certifications from other states.
DATA LIMITATIONS
The operational data obtained to measure the levels of participation of diverse workers and diverse-
owned business enterprises enabled us to answer required questions for this study. However, we
acknowledge several data limitations.
Since the diversity status of the workers and businesses studied in this report require self-declaration or
formal certification, there is a risk of underrepresentation. This is particularly true among groups who
may be hesitant to self-identify, or for businesses which do not have the resources to undertake the
necessary certification and application process. These factors could result in an undercount of actual
diverse employees and vendors and, therefore, is a limitation in this study.
An additional limitation is a lack of race and ethnicity detail for workers in Category 3 data. This obscures
information about historically under-represented racial and ethnic groups in the workforce.
Also, there is an absence of data on the recruitment origins of sports wagering employees in
Massachusetts (in-state vs out-of-state). The lack of data on whether diverse hires relocated to
Massachusetts or were drawn from within the state’s existing workforce limits insights into the
industry’s impact on local versus external recruitment of underrepresented groups. These gaps affect
the strength of the recommendations that can be made regarding employment practices in the sports
betting sector.
A data limitation related to business diversity is the potential for overlapping classification categories.
Categories for diverse ownership are not mutually exclusive. Vendors may appear in more than one
category (e.g. a firm could be counted both as woman-owned and minority-owned), although such
instances are rare and unlikely to meaningfully affect the findings.
Objectives
As required by the Request for Response, the study examines conditions in the Massachusetts sports
wagering industry among three different groups: (1) the operators who offer retail and online sports
wagering activities (Category 1 and Category 3 licensees); (2) the MGC in its role as a regulator of the
industry; and (3) advertising, marketing, and promotional firms that provide a range of services to the
sports wagering industry.
This study of diverse participation reflects the mission of the MGC to “provide the greatest possible
economic development benefits and revenues to the people of the Commonwealth,” and its work to
UMass Donahue Institute
Economic and Public Policy Research 16

ensure that the state’s gaming industry is inclusive and provides opportunities that reflect the diversity
of the Commonwealth. Broadly, the study aims to inform the MGC of ways to expand employee and
vendor diversity within the sports wagering sector, the newest area of gambling activity in the
Commonwealth. To this end, the work addresses specific research questions as itemized and required by
the Request for Response:
• Participation of diverse business enterprises supplying goods and services to the sports
wagering industry: relative participation levels; proportions of supplier spending; contract sizes;
comparisons to similar industries; and the use of policies and programs to expand participation
of and contracting with diverse businesses.
• Participation of diverse employees working within sports wagering: information on relative
participation levels overall, as well as at various levels of employment within the organization;
comparisons with participation levels in similar industries; and policies and practices in place
related to recruit, retain, and support the development of these workers.
• Identification of barriers to attracting and contracting with diverse business enterprises, and
barriers to recruiting and hiring diverse employees in the sports wagering industry. The
discussion also provides examples of successful policies and practices which can increase racial
and gender diversity.
• Finally, the study provides recommendations to increase the involvement of racial, gender and
veteran-owned business enterprises in the sports wagering business and racial, gender, and
veteran diversity in the sports wagering workforce.
Research activities and methods
To answer the research questions for this study several activities were undertaken. In Task One—
Industry Definition and Methodology Development, the team researched the industry to clearly define
its sectors, therefore creating a structure for data collection and analysis. In Task Two—Landscape
Analysis, the team collected and analyzed data to enable us to measure the sports wagering industry
against comparison industries and conditions in the broader economy. We also reviewed relevant policy
reports and other literature to identify practices used to assess and set goals for employment and
vendor diversity programs. In Task Three—Collection of Operator Data, data collection activities were
designed to gather quantitative and qualitative information from the operators running the new sports
wagering activities and from the MGC as the regulator. In Task Four—Key Informant Interviews were
conducted to obtain recommendations from knowledgeable stakeholders about ways to ensure and
improve employment and vendor diversity. Task Five involved data cleaning, coding and analysis,
including operator data. The last task, Task Six, involved writing a summary report of findings and a final
presentation.
TASKS ONE AND TWO: INDUSTRY DEFINITION AND LANDSCAPE ANALYSIS
Tasks One and Two involved literature scans and secondary data analysis to accomplish the following
goals: 1) to define the sports wagering industry and the sectors involved using industry codes thus
enabling it to be measured and compared; 2) to enable an understanding of the presence of diverse
employees and vendor suppliers within the Massachusetts gaming industry, in the broader economy,
and in related sectors; 3) to review practices for setting reasonable and appropriate goals and
procedures for employment and vendor diversity programs.
UMass Donahue Institute
Economic and Public Policy Research 17

Literature Review and Secondary Data Analysis
To better understand the sports wagering industry, characterize it using measurable industry codes, and
to enable comparisons of the industry relative to other industries, we conducted scans of online reports,
articles, and other materials which provided information about business activities across segments of
the industry. Following from that literature scan, to better understand the occupational needs of sports
wagering companies – and further characterize it as a sector - we assessed jobs postings data from
Lightcast, a proprietary labor market analytics tool. To describe diverse employment levels in U.S.
industries we used U.S. Bureau of the Census, Quarterly workforce indicators (QWI) data.
To study Massachusetts conditions related to supplier diversity, we adopted methodologies used for
similar projects to assess spending on diverse businesses in the supply chain. We reviewed recent
studies, reports and findings in that area. We also collected and analyzed public, secondary data to
provide information about comparison industries and levels of diverse business ownership by sector in
the broader economy. These data sets included U.S. Bureau of the Census Annual Business Survey data;
Massachusetts Supplier Diversity Office business certification data; and Massachusetts Executive Office
of Labor and Workforce Development ES-202 employment and wage data.
TASK THREE: COLLECTION OF OPERATOR DATA
Task Three involved collecting operating data for the four business segments to be considered in the
sports wagering industry. The four areas included retail operations; online/mobile operations; the
regulatory and licensing operation; and promotions and marketing companies. To collect data for this
assessment, we submitted data requests to the MGC and to casinos and online operators
(encompassing sports wagering licensees and employers). It was not possible to submit requests for
data from businesses providing promotion and marketing as these companies are not organized as a
group of licensees. Instead, we asked operators and the regulator to provide data about spending to
promotional and marketing businesses involved in providing goods and services to the industry along
with diversity certification information about these companies.
Collection of operating data
We requested aggregated operational data to measure levels of participation of minority-, women- and
veteran workers and minority-, woman-, and veteran-owned business enterprises and other required
questions of this study. The study team coordinated with the regular collection of casino data to collect
Category 1 information for the project. The MGC has long collected operating data from casino licenses
to research social and economic impacts including measures of diversity to describe workers and
vendors. Data collection from Category 3 companies has been more limited, so a more extensive data
collection process was initiated for this group. For the Category 3 licensees, the goal was to develop an
operator data request to be aligned as much as possible with MGC’s quarterly collection of aggregated
operator data which includes diversity statistics. This would enable the analysis to be parallel to the
quarterly reports while containing more detail. A data dictionary was used to specify definitions and
parameters for reporting each measure along with a template providing a structure for providing the
data.
Data collection parameters established with the group of sports wagering licensees require the research
team to anonymize and aggregate all operator data into licensee groups, prohibiting the reporting of
disaggregated results, or releasing original data sets in any way.
UMass Donahue Institute
Economic and Public Policy Research 18

Written questionnaires
In addition to the initiatives to collect quantitative data, the research team created tools to gather
qualitative information to enable us to understand more about hiring and spending decisions and about
licensee practices to enhance diversity. We designed and distributed a set of nine questionnaires (one
each for the three Category 1 and six Category 3 licensees) customized to the type of licensee (retail or
mobile) to collect this additional information, including policies and programs to support and expand
diversity. Questionnaires were sent to compliance officers for them to collect responses from staff data
providers as needed. We then aggregated this data into multiple sets of anonymized tables which can be
found in Appendices D and K.
TASK FOUR: KEY STAKEHOLDER INTERVIEWS
To obtain perspectives about successes and challenges related to the use of practices to support and
expand diversity, we conducted 11 separate interviews with 10 organizations. Participating
organizations included all three Category 1 licensees, a cross section of Category 3 licensees (five
licensees representing both tethered and untethered types), and the MGC. For the interviews, we
sought the participation of professionals who could provide a deeper and more informed perspective
about the involvement of diverse employees and diverse business enterprises in the sports wagering
industry, and how to strengthen conditions for these groups within the industry. In total, 22sports
wagering industry professionals participated in the interviews, 16 working for operators, and six
employees of the regulator. For the interviews, we sought professionals with extensive familiarity with
employment and vendor diversity-related practices. Those who participated in the interview sessions
typically included a human resources or diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) officer, along with a
compliance officer, legal counsel, or communications representative. Executives involved with finance,
budgeting, and procurement also participated in the interview sessions.
Participants discussed conditions in the industry relative to diverse participation of vendors and
workers; barriers to expanding diversity; successful approaches to improving conditions; and suggested
recommendations. We hope that insights from the industry itself will help to inform the MGC about
feasible ways to increase participation and better support conditions and prospects for diverse workers
and business enterprises in the industry.5
TASK FIVE: OPERATOR DATA CLEANING, CODING AND ANALYSIS
Task Five involved data cleaning, coding and analysis of operator data collected for this project. Upon
receipt of data submission packages, data are stored in a secure folder system according to their
respective sports betting category (Category 1 and Category 3), the timeframe of the data, and the
operator to whom the data belongs. These original datasets are referred to as raw data by the research
team. In the same secure folder system, copies of the raw data are made and cleaned in terms of
formatting to be integrated into the data analysis system, effectively known as working datasets. The
working datasets are then combined into a single dataset, with the operator identity and timeframes
preserved while the research team harmonizes variables across operators. This clean dataset is then

used to calculate counts, shares, and averages of employees, employee diversity categories, employee
job levels, compensation6 for each group, vendors, vendor diversity categories, vendor industry
categories, spending for each group, and other necessary variables for analysis. The final step in analysis
is to aggregate these measures from each operator within their respective licensee category by quarter
for the entire industry to maintain anonymity. Quarterly averages, and totals where appropriate, are
then produced for report tables and figures.
TASK SIX: REPORT AND PRESENTATION
The last task involved preparing the deliverables required by the project. The preparation of the final
report involved a series of internal reviews by the project team, followed by reviews by sports wagering
operators to ensure data accuracy and anonymity. These steps were followed by a series of report
reviews and revisions by the Research Review Committee of the MGC.
6 Category 3 operators reported Total Compensation, defined as (the total of wages, bonuses, etc.) paid to employees in each location, level,
and category over the course of a quarter. Category 1 operators reported Wages, defined as the wages paid to that employee in that pay
period, not including tips, gratuities, or bonuses, and Tips, defined as any tips or other gratuities that the employee received from
customers in that pay period, which are combined to reflect total compensation.

Background: Massachusetts Sports Wagering Industry
This section provides a brief history of the legalization of sports wagering in Massachusetts and
describes the industry based on the forms of sports wagering reflected in Massachusetts license
categories. The potential for legalized sports wagering across the United States became possible in 2018
when the Supreme Court declared the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act of 1992 (PASPA)
unconstitutional. This opened the door for individual states to pass legislation to introduce sports
wagering, which 38 states and Washington, DC have done in the six years since the PASPA decision.
Building on the 2011 Massachusetts Expanded Gaming Act, G.L c.23K, the Commonwealth legalized
sports wagering activities in 2022 through an Act to Regulate Sports Wagering (House Bill No. 5164). The
MGC was tasked with overseeing the promulgation of the sports wagering industry in the state.
Figure 1: Timeline of Sports Wagering Legalization in Massachusetts
Current Operators
Massachusetts General Laws c.23N creates license categories for three distinct types of sports wagering
operators based on modes of play: in-person gambling at casinos; in-person wagering at establishments
that either conduct live horse racing or simulcast wagering on horse or greyhound racing; and online or
mobile wagering.
Mass. General Laws c.23N categories of sports wagering licensees include:
• Category 1 for licensed casinos to offer in-person sports wagering
o The sports wagering operator licensing fee for a 5-year license is $5 million. Category 1
Sports Wagering Licensees are taxed on 15 percent of gross sports wagering revenue.
• Category 2 for racetracks and/or simulcast centers
o Category 2 licenses are for in-person wagering at certain horse and greyhound racing
sites. The Category 2 license also allows those racing facilities to host up to one

Economic and Public Policy Research 21

individually branded app or digital platform that obtains a Category 3 license. Category 2
Sports Wagering Licensees are taxed on 15 percent of gross sports wagering revenue.
• Category 3 for online/mobile operators to offer online/mobile sports wagering
o Tethered licensees contract with a Category 1 licensee to provide an online sports
wagering platform. Untethered licensees run independent online sports wagering
platforms.
o The sports wagering operator licensing fee for a 1-year license is $1 million. Category 3
Sports Wagering Licensees are taxed on 20 percent of gross sports wagering revenue.
More than 30 companies seeking to be prospective operators submitted requested documents and
other pertinent materials to the MGC during the application process. The three licensed casinos in
Massachusetts, Encore Boston Harbor, MGM Springfield, and Plainridge Park Casino were granted
Category 1 licenses to offer in-person sports wagering. Category 1 licenses became effective at the end
of January 2023. Eight operators were granted Category 3 licenses to offer mobile or online sports
wagering. With licenses that rolled out starting in March 2023, the list initially included virtually all the
major operators in the U.S. industry:
• BetMGM
• Caesars Sportsbook
• Fanatics Betting & Gaming
• Penn Sports Interactive
• DraftKings
• FanDuel
• Betr
• WynnBet
All Category 3 sports wagering operators who renewed their licenses in 2024—coinciding with the start
of the data collection period for this study—were included in the analysis. The list of six licensees
included BetMGM; Caesars Sportsbook; Fanatics Betting & Gaming; Penn Sports Interactive; DraftKings
and FanDuel. Betr and WynnBet were not included in this study because these companies did not renew
their Category 3 licenses in 2024 and no longer operate mobile sports wagering platforms in
Massachusetts. Despite Betr and WynnBet not renewing their licenses in 2024, the six participating
licensees accounted for over 90 percent of the national industry, making like for like comparison
between the state and nation possible.7 Bally Bet was not included in the analysis for this study because
the company opened its Massachusetts sportsbook on July 1, 2024, after data collection was completed.
As of 2024, no Category 2 licenses had been awarded.
Policy Priorities for the Legalization of Sports Wagering
This section touches on the policy background that shapes expectations for sports betting industry
operations in Massachusetts. Given the recent introduction of legal sports wagering in the gambling
landscape of the U.S., and the speed with which this form of gambling has become available to
consumers, the MGC has been keenly interested in research to monitor social and economic impacts
7 https://www.casinoreports.com/us-sports-betting-market-stats-database/
UMass Donahue Institute
Economic and Public Policy Research 22

occurring with the introduction of legal sports wagering to Massachusetts. The MGC has been
stewarding research on special topics of concern which were defined by the legislature in 2022 through
Mass. General Laws c.23N § 23. These research interests included a study of participation by minority
business enterprises, women business enterprises and veteran business enterprises in the sports
wagering industry in the Commonwealth, the topic of this report.
Economic development goals
Sports betting was enabled for economic reasons. Lawmakers were concerned that Massachusetts was
losing out on $35-65 million8 in tax revenue per year as Massachusetts residents gambled on sports in
neighboring states.9 Indeed, over the first 18 months of legalized sports wagering, almost $160 million
was collected in taxes by the Commonwealth. However, when it comes to expectations regarding
economic impacts, there are major differences between the enabling legislation for casino gaming and
for sports wagering in the Commonwealth. The 2011 Expanded Gaming Act established parameters to
ensure that casino operations would generate positive employment impacts and broader economic
benefits to the Commonwealth, including the hiring of a diverse workforce and a commitment to
supplier diversity. However, these types of measures were not specified in the language of the 2022
enabling legislation for sports wagering operators.10
These differences have resulted in varying levels of expectation and monitoring of the two operator
categories during the study period. Based on priorities outlined in the 2011 Expanded Gaming Act,
casinos are required to establish goals and track outcomes for vendor spending, including local and
diverse business enterprises. Similarly, they also have targets and track outcomes related to hiring a
diverse and local workforce. Casino operators maintain policies and procedures to support their goals:
to promote contracting with businesses and hiring of workers located in the surrounding region and to
increase supplier diversity and workforce diversity. To reinforce the process, gaming establishments
engage with the MGC on a regular basis, providing monitoring reports and data. Chapter 23K also
outlines the role of the MGC in promoting diversity within the casino sector, which includes initiatives
like the Vendor Advisory Committee and close collaboration with casinos to achieve diversity goals.
In contrast to the mandates for casinos, Chapter 23N did not outline economic development-related
parameters for sports wagering operators nor did it direct the MGC to foster diversity initiatives or
monitor them. Mobile/online operators are responsible for setting their own diversity goals within their
businesses and are required only to report their diversity data to the Commission. On a quarterly basis,
the MGC requires sports wagering operators to report statistics related to workforce diversity and
spending on diverse business enterprises.
Despite the legislative differences, as discussed later in this report, there is widespread adoption of
diversity policies and programs among Massachusetts sports wagering operators. Figures 3 and 4 in this
report illustrate that all sports wagering licensees operating in Massachusetts maintain policies and

programs to promote workforce diversity and to promote supplier diversity. However, casino and sports
wagering industry outcomes are different, driven in many cases by very different operating activities.
The following section discusses how differences in business activities result in major differences in the
hiring of workers and spending on goods and services across licensee types.
Sports Wagering Industry Segments: Hiring and Vendor Spending
This section discusses how the nature and scale of operations varies across the segments of the industry
resulting in differing levels of hiring, and spending on goods and services. The language of enabling
legislation also plays a role, with differing implications for the hiring of workers and contracting with
businesses for goods and services.
Category 1 Operators: Casinos
Category 1 operators are gaming establishments which run retail sportsbooks in their facilities located in
Massachusetts. Their operations are designed to be patron destinations, offering recreational activities
and sometimes hotels and/or conference facilities. Depending on the presence of a hotel, they can be
categorized as Casinos NAICS 713210 or Casino Hotels NAICS 721120. These operations contain many
different departments and offer several types of gambling across the facility: table games, slot machines
and in-person or ‘retail’ sportsbooks.
EMPLOYMENT
Very few workers are hired to work at retail sportsbooks and they are a part of a much larger workforce
of casino employees. Overall, in 2023 there are approximately 7,400 people working in Massachusetts
based casinos, with 85 percent of those jobs being held by Massachusetts residents.11 Job opportunities
at the casinos are plentiful with positions across a large spectrum of occupations, and many jobs are
accessible to workers regardless of educational background or experience in the industry. Research on
new casino hires in Massachusetts found between 76 and 86 percent of new hires had no previous
experience in the industry.12 On-the-job training is often provided with opportunities for cross-training
and there is some opportunity for mobility across departments.
As one part of these large operations, a small group of employees is needed to run the sportsbook at the
casino. Positions include clerks, cashiers, and writers as well as a few managers and supervisors. Casinos
offer related amenities like sports bars and restaurants to serve sportsbook patrons. For the most part,
however, employees in these retail operations are considered casino employees rather than sportsbook
employees alone. As such, the number of workers employed by Category 1 licensees who are dedicated
to retail sports-wagering activities is small, typically less than one percent of all employees. As of 2023,
retail sportsbooks employed approximately 44 Massachusetts residents.13
11 This number is based on total aggregate employment across the casino industry in 2023 rather than quarterly average employment which is
used later in the study. From Peake et al., The Early Economic Impacts of Sports Wagering in Massachusetts. SEIGMA.2024.

SPENDING ON GOODS AND SERVICES
Spending on vendors serving retail sportsbooks individually is minimal relative to total vendor spending
at the casino. Spending during the first year of sportsbook operations tended to be concentrated in the
opening period of the sportsbook, when new equipment needed to be purchased. Also, to help establish
the new gambling activities professional and technical services firms were contracted for legal,
marketing, and other services. In-state firms patronized for retail sports wagering operations included
performing arts and spectator sports firms, and professional and technical services firms. Out-of-state
purchases were made from companies selling gaming machines, financial services, and legal and
consulting services, among others.14
Category 3 Operators: Sports-Tech Companies and Divisions
Category 3 operators can be categorized in the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) as
gambling companies (Other Gambling Industries NAICS 713290). However, operators of mobile and
online sports wagering are very also tech operations. Category 3 operators develop and manage digital
products, services, and platforms to engage patrons in online and mobile sportsbooks.
EMPLOYMENT
In 2023, mobile sports betting operators employed an average of 10,265 employees across the industry
in a quarter. Nearly 12 percent of those employees, an average of 1,185 in a quarter, are employed in
Massachusetts. Massachusetts is known as a strong location for technology firms in the U.S. so it is not
surprising that more than 10 percent of the workforce in this technology-intensive industry is in
Massachusetts. However, most of that employment either existed in Massachusetts prior to the
legalization of sports betting or represented remote work that was not necessarily tied to the expansion
of gambling in Massachusetts.
Mobile or online operators hire far fewer workers in Massachusetts than casinos because a dedicated
physical presence is not required to offer mobile sports wagering in that state. Employees work on
operations that are running in multiple states. Most Category 3 operators responded that they use a
centralized team to manage new states, adding to existing employees’ portfolios rather than hiring new
people to work in a particular state. However, respondents indicated that in some cases they did hire
new people when necessary to manage new high-value players in a state. The work of these companies
requires highly trained employees with specialized skills in technology and business-related areas. Large
numbers of software developers, marketing specialists, and customer service representatives are hired
as a result. Operations that are similar in nature to those of software development companies and
fintech firms running digital platforms.
SPENDING ON GOODS AND SERVICES
According to Category 3 licensee responses in the study questionnaire, when entering a new state
market, spending tends to go for specialized suppliers and providers of information technology
14 Findings from the Early Impacts of Sports Wagering Report, 2023.
UMass Donahue Institute
Economic and Public Policy Research 25

equipment and information services, and a range of professional technical services including legal,
operational, and advertising, marketing and promotional services needed to enter the new market.15
Regulatory Activities: The Massachusetts Gaming Commission
As the regulatory agency which monitors casino gambling, sports wagering and horse racing in the
Commonwealth, the MGC is categorized in the industry coding system as public administration,
specifically as an administrator of economic programs (NAICS 926150 - Regulation, Licensing, and
Inspection of Miscellaneous Commercial Sectors). Although the MGC is a sports wagering regulator, the
data and activities discussed in this report reflect all its regulatory activities, not just those related to
sports wagering.
EMPLOYMENT
The MGC runs an operation of 970 employees under contract including part-time, part-time seasonal
racing employees, and full-time agency employees. Like other state government agencies, the MGC
hires a range of workers across departments, including Massachusetts residents. The MGC’s regular
activities include running licensing programs for gaming employees; licensing and registering vendors
who conduct business with gaming establishments and sports wagering operators; licensing for all
participants in the Massachusetts horse racing industry; and monitoring and regulating these industries
according to Massachusetts rules and regulations.
SPENDING ON GOODS AND SERVICES
The involvement of diverse vendors with the MGC is shaped by the types of goods and services needed
by the Commission and the availability of diverse vendors in those areas.16 Diverse businesses are most
plentiful and engaged with the MGC to provide professional technical services and operations-related
goods and services such as office supplies and furnishings, IT hardware infrastructure and systems
integration, and software.17 For fiscal year 2023, the MGC met all of its benchmarks for spending on
diverse vendors except for spending on veteran-owned businesses. Commission staff note that many of
the vendors that are certified Veteran-owned provide services not currently utilized by the MGC such as
construction services. The MGC reports that while adopting new benchmarks and goals has taken more
time and costs, supplier relationships are growing.
As this overview shows, the various segments of the sports wagering industry offer quite different
opportunities for workers and vendors based on the nature of their business activities. Additionally,
aside from the regulator and one operator based in Massachusetts, sports wagering is a small industry
relative to the number of employees that work within the Commonwealth, the number of vendors
contracted for Massachusetts operations, and the amount of money spent on vendors located in the
Commonwealth. In the following sections, we discuss findings based on operating data which distinguish
the different segments of the industry. We first address employee diversity within the sports wagering
industry. Next, we address diversity among vendors and other businesses that contract with sports

Employee Diversity
Overview
This chapter presents data about employee diversity—specifically minority, women, and veteran
workers—in the sports wagering industry segments in Massachusetts. Overall, a significant portion of
the sports wagering industry comes from diverse background, both in Massachusetts and in the U.S.,
and compares favorably to similar industries. Minority workers are well represented compared to similar
industries while women are slightly underrepresented. Veterans work in the industry, but data are
limited for this population. Diverse Massachusetts employees tend to be compensated more than the
industry average. However, compensation for jobs in Category 1 operations is lower than that of
Category 3 operations due to the nature of the work and the different occupations involved.
The first part of the chapter analyzes diverse employees as a percentage of total employment and at
various job levels within the organizations using quantitative operator data provided by Massachusetts
licensees. Next, using data from similar industries, we compare workforce diversity in Massachusetts
sports wagering companies to workforce diversity in comparison industries. Finally in this section, we
discuss the use of organizational policies and practices to promote and enhance employee diversity
using data from an operator questionnaire and in-depth interviews with operators. Barriers and
examples of success are also presented.
Participation
This section assesses the level of participation of minority, women, and veteran employees working for
sports wagering licensees and employers as a percentage of employees overall and at various job levels
within the organizations. For this section, we analyze aggregated operator data provided by Category 1
and Category 3 licensees to discuss the participation of workers for both types of sports wagering
operations.
Operator Data
The collection of employment data was specified to include only workers involved in sports wagering
operations.18 On the retail side, the employment data includes workers staffing sports wagering retail
operations, or sportsbooks, at the three Massachusetts casinos. On the mobile/online side, the data
includes U.S. employees of sports-tech companies (Fanatics, FanDuel, DraftKings) and digital sports
wagering divisions that are a part of larger gambling enterprises (Caesars Sportsbook; BetMGM; Penn
Interactive). Defined this way, retail operators employ an average of 51 workers per quarter who are
dedicated to retail sports wagering operations. Mobile operators licensed in Massachusetts employ an
average of 10,265 workers across the U.S. and nearly 12 percent of these workers live in Massachusetts.
18 To obtain consistency between the industry data provided to the MGC on a regular basis, we asked operators to provide the same data
provided to the MGC on a quarterly basis.

WORKFORCE DIVERSITY
As Table 1 shows, Category 3 sports wagering operators employ an average of 10,265 employees across
the industry in a quarter. Nearly 12 percent of those employees, an average of 1,185 in a quarter, are
employed in Massachusetts.19 Looking at diversity for all U.S. employees, about 36.1 percent of the
Category 3 workforce is made up of workers who identify with racial minority groups, while 0.9 percent
are veterans, and 28.3 percent identify as women. In Massachusetts, minority workers make up a
smaller share of the workforce at 16.8 percent, while 0.6 percent are veterans, and 24.3 percent identify
as women.
In terms of compensation, the average compensation per employee for Category 3 operators across the
US is about $34,000 per quarter. Minority workers and women make slightly less than the average at
about $32,000 and $30,000 per quarter, while veterans make higher than average compensation at
about $38,000 per quarter. In Massachusetts, the average compensation per employee is just over
$36,000 per quarter. All diversity groups make above the overall average with minority workers making
about $45,000 per quarter and women making $40,000 per quarter.

Category 1 operators function differently than Category 3 operators primarily because of the nature of
retail versus mobile/online sports wagering, and due to the operation being tethered to the casino
operators. For Category 1 operators, the integration of sportsbooks looks more like the opening of a
new department within the casino as operator data show that most of the sportsbook employees have
19 The following analysis will refer to quarterly averages across the industry, created by summing employment across the industry in a single
quarter and averaging across the four quarters to get to a quarterly average.
UMass Donahue Institute
Economic and Public Policy Research 29

been reassigned from other departments. Category 1 employment occurs in Massachusetts alone due to
the physical location of the retail sportsbooks. Some casino employees have historically commuted from
other states in New England, but the subset of casino workers who work at Category 1 sportsbook
operations is from Massachusetts alone.
In Massachusetts, Category 1 sports wagering operators employ an average of fifty-one employees
across the industry in a quarter. Of those employees, an average of 29.7 percent identify with racial
minority groups, while 1.5 percent are veterans, and 27.2 percent identify as women.
In terms of compensation, the average compensation per employee for Category 1 operators in
Massachusetts is about $9,400 per quarter. Minority workers and women make slightly more than the
average at about $9,700 and $10,100 per quarter. Due to the small number of veteran employees at
Category 1 operators, the values for average quarterly compensation per employee have been
suppressed. It is important to note that the compensation for jobs in Category 1 operations is expected
to be lower than that of Category 3 operations due to the nature and level of job positions. At Category
1 operators, most employees are entry-level workers who work floor jobs at the casino, these jobs
typically do not require a college degree and focus on customer service. At Category 3 operators, most
jobs require a college degree and a certain level of experience in the tech industry as the job duties of
many are like those of occupations in computer science and information technology, accounting and
marketing. For comparison and evaluation purposes, the presence of diversity is compared to similar
industries later in this report.
Overall, the Category 1 industry workforce is smaller and not as well compensated as the Category 3
industry. Both industries are made up of diverse workers at proportions that are not insignificant.
Minority workers are well represented compared to similar industries while women are slightly under-
represented. Diverse Massachusetts employees tend to be compensated more than the overall average.
However, minority and women workers in the U.S. industry overall are compensated at lower rates than
the overall average. While few in number, veteran workers in the U.S. industry are compensated at
higher rates than the overall average.

Note: analysis is limited to operators who provided employment counts by level.
To contextualize the diversity discussion above, Figure 2 above displays the share of workers in each
diversity category who are employed in jobs at various levels of hierarchy. For comparison purposes, this
analysis includes only Massachusetts employees. Level 1 refers to entry-level workers, while level 2
refers to managers and supervisors, and level 3 are executive positions. The shares in this figure refer to
the number of workers in each diversity category who are employed at that level out of all employees in
the same diversity category employed across all levels. Note that these numbers are based on
percentages of average quarterly employment across the industry.
For all workers in Category 3 operations, 66 percent of employees on average hold entry-level positions,
while 27 percent hold level 2 positions, and 7 percent hold top level positions. For all workers in
Category 1 operations, half of the employees on average hold entry-level positions, and the other half
hold manager or supervisor roles. There are no executives present in the Category 1 data, which is not
surprising due to the nature of the department within casinos.
Looking at the population of minority workers in Category 3 operations, 70 percent hold entry level
positions, while 27 percent are employed at level 2, and 3 percent are employed at level 3, similar
proportions to that of all employees. At Category 1 operations, 73 percent of minority workers hold
entry-level positions compared to 50 percent of the full population, while the remaining 27 percent hold
level 2 positions.
For women in the Category 3 industry, 61 percent are employed in entry-level positions, just lower than
the overall workforce, while 30 percent hold level 2 positions and 8 percent are employed at executive
positions, slightly higher at both levels than the overall workforce. At Category 1 operations, just over
UMass Donahue Institute
Economic and Public Policy Research 31

half of the women are employed in entry-level positions, while just under half are employed at level 2
positions, similar to the workforce overall.
The veteran population at Category 3 operations are employed at very low rates in entry-level positions,
just 11 percent of all veterans, and 59 percent are employed at the second level. A sizable percentage of
veterans are employed at the executive level, making up 30 percent of all veterans employed. At
Category 1 operations, all veterans are employed at entry-level positions.
When compared to workers overall, Massachusetts minority workers tend to be overrepresented in
entry-level positions at both Category 1 and Category 3 operations. Category 3 minority workers are
represented similarly in manager/supervisor roles and slightly underrepresented as executives.
Compared to Massachusetts industry workers overall, women are slightly underrepresented in entry
level and slightly overrepresented in manager or supervisory roles and at the executive level. Veterans
in Category 3 operations are heavily overrepresented at the manager or supervisor and executive levels,
while in Category 1 they are exclusively represented at the entry level.
EMPLOYMENT DIVERSITY: COMPARISONS WITH SIMILAR INDUSTRIES
One of the requirements of the RFR is to compare levels of diverse workforce participation in the sports
wagering industry with these populations in similar industries. To select comparison industries for
Category 1 and Category 3 operators, we chose industries with similar business activities. We also
examined job postings to choose industries with similar occupational compositions. Workforce diversity
data for minority and female casino workers is available from casino operator data, and workforce
diversity data for comparison industries is available from the U.S. Bureau of the Census.
Category 1
Category 1 operators primarily exist as casino and hotel operators, with retail sports wagering a small
slice of their overall operations. The number of workers affiliated with retail sports wagering is very
small when compared to the Massachusetts casino workforce overall. Furthermore, many of these
workers also staff other casino departments so there is overlap with the rest of the casino workforce.
Employees affiliated with retail sports wagering are not as racially and ethnically diverse as the casino
workforce overall (30% minority workers versus 56% in the Massachusetts casino workforce) and
women represent 27 percent of the retail sports wagering workforce in contrast to 44 percent in the
broader casino workforce. There are very low numbers of veteran employees on the retail side.
For Category 1 operators, we also include Gambling Industries as a comparison industry, which includes
casinos without hotels, as seen in Table 2. When comparing Massachusetts retail operations with
Gambling Industries without hotels, racial and ethnic diversity levels are higher (30% versus 19%) but
there is a similar level of female workers (27% versus 33%). These rough comparisons suggest that
Massachusetts retail operators are more successful at hiring minority workers but have slightly lower
success rates hiring women than their gambling industries counterparts.
Outside of gambling industries, the Massachusetts retail sports wagering workforce has proportionally
fewer minority and female workers than the Travel Accommodations industry (30% versus 49%; and
27% versus 53%). This is likely because workers are working in gaming departments rather than working
across the facility in multiple occupations in the hotel, in restaurants and other types of services.

Category 3
Mobile operators can be compared with the broader gambling industry of which they are a part, as seen
in Table 2. The racial and ethnic diversity of these operators is much higher when compared to Gambling
Industries without hotels (36% compared to 19%) and the proportion of women in the industry is slightly
lower (28% compared to 33%).
In contrast to many other gambling enterprises in that NAICS sector, Category 3 operators develop and
manage digital products and services on online platforms while also managing associated revenues.
These operations primarily do business through a mobile app.
We use Lightcast data to look at their hiring practices to further characterize these companies.20 Mobile
sports wagering companies hiring in Massachusetts post primarily software development roles,
representing more than half of all job postings. This, combined with the fact that app development is so
crucial to their day-to-day operations, led us to use Software Publishers as one of our comparison
industries. Mobile operators with business in Massachusetts employ a much higher proportion of
minority workers (36% versus 26%) and a slightly lower proportion of female employees (28% versus
35%) compared to the software industry.
To cover the financial side of their business operations, also a major activity, we use the NAICS sector
called ‘Activities Related to Credit Intermediation’ which primarily represents fintech21 companies. As
Category 3 operators managed nearly all of the almost $9 billion worth of bets placed in Massachusetts
during the first 18 months of sports wagering legalization, we wanted to capture industries that similarly

handle financial activities digitally. Mobile operators with business in Massachusetts employ a much
higher proportion of minority workers (36% versus 26%) and a much lower percentage of female
employees (28% versus 44%) than the fintech industry.
Finally for Category 3 operators, we can choose Advertising, Public Relations, and Related Services as a
comparison industry. Marketing jobs are the second most posted position for Category 3 operators in
our scan of job postings, and all companies have been running non-stop national advertising campaigns
since the Supreme Court struck down restrictions on sports wagering. We chose this industry as a
comparison primarily to complement software publishers and fintech, which, combined with
advertising, cover a large proportion of the Category 3 workforce. Mobile operators with business in
Massachusetts employ a much higher proportion of minority workers (36% versus 18%) and a much
lower percentage of female employees (28% versus 57%) than the advertising and marketing industry.
In conclusion, when it comes to similar (comparison) industries, Massachusetts retail and mobile sports
wagering operators are more successful at hiring minority employees compared to comparison
industries. At the same time, these operators have been less successful than their comparison industry
counterparts in employing women. A discussion of specific challenges and potential approaches to
expanding the presence of female workers appears later in this chapter in the industry perspectives
section.
Programs and Policies for Employment Diversity
In addition to analyzing operator data, we collected organizational data to determine the kinds of
policies and practices in place in the industry to promote workforce diversity. We collected information
through customized surveys sent to licensed operators and the MGC. We also conducted a stakeholder
interview process, gathering information from industry professionals on the use of programs and
policies to increase diversity; barriers to success; approaches that work; and recommendations.
As specified by the RFR, we collected information on the use of policies to promote employment
diversity in three areas: recruitment of a diverse workforce; programs to support inclusive outcomes for
women, minority and veteran employees in the areas of compensation, benefits, career trajectory, and
turnover; and the presence of training programs to promote retention and development.
Operator Questionnaire
Through operator questionnaires, we found that all license holders as well as the MGC have programs,
policies, and practices in place related to recruitment, and all operators also have training programs to
promote retention and development of a diverse workforce. The third category, “inclusive impact”
programs, are widely adopted but interpreted in various ways. Operators universally offer programs to
support career paths and monitor turnover of diverse employees, but they do not offer targeted
compensation or benefits policies. The MGC reported that it runs inclusive impact programs22 and a
majority of both retail and mobile operators reported the same. However, two operators expressed that
giving special consideration towards specific groups would not meet their goal of being an equal
opportunity employer. While we do not report individually on operators in this report, we can say that
22 “Inclusive impact” refers to Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) programs in any number of areas.
UMass Donahue Institute
Economic and Public Policy Research 34

we did not notice any difference in outcomes between these two operators and the rest in terms of the
diversity of their workforce. Also, we noted that in some cases programs categorized by operators in the
areas of recruitment and retainment nevertheless could be categorized as ‘inclusive impact’ programs.

Each operation related to sports wagering in Massachusetts uses different strategies to accomplish their
goals of increasing workforce diversity.23 The MGC prioritizes equity and inclusion in recruitment by
implementing diverse interview panels and slates, ensuring equitable hiring practices at each
recruitment stage and hiring a dedicated employee to focus on advancing equity within the organization
through initiatives like pay equity reviews, inclusive benefits, and career growth programs to foster a
supportive work environment. Additionally, the MGC incorporates diversity training, leadership
development, and employee-led groups aimed at retention and professional growth, enhancing internal
mobility.
Category 1 operators work to increase recruitment of diverse employees by setting specific hiring
targets to achieve gender parity and represent local veteran and minority populations, creating
platforms and career resources to facilitate inclusive recruitment. Hiring managers are instructed to
prioritize skills over credentials, and some employers provide free English for Speakers of Other
Languages (ESOL), GED, and citizenship programs to increase accessibility. To retain their workforce,
Category 1 operators offer growth-oriented programs, including women’s leadership development,
diversity scholarships, and veteran ambassador roles, and integrate DEI training across development
initiatives.
To boost workforce diversity during recruiting, Category 3 operators focus on early engagement with
diverse candidates through partnerships with diverse organizations and recruitment events, using
Employee Resource Groups (ERGs) and sponsoring conferences to attract talent from historically
23 See Appendix D - Sports Wagering Operators Diversity Policies and Programs for additional details about programs used in the industry.

underrepresented groups. They retain employees through DEI-focused onboarding, D&I Committees,
the Employee Resource Groups, and mentorship programs that foster community and skill-building.
To obtain a better understanding of the use of programs and policies to promote diversity and equitable
workforce development, the study conducted In-depth interviews with a subset of professionals
employed by the licensees and the regulator.24 Twenty-two professionals involved with diversity
programs and policies were interviewed, 16 working for operators, and 6 employees of the regulator.
We sought the participation of professionals who could provide a deeper and more informed
perspective about the involvement of diverse employees and diverse business enterprises in the sports
wagering industry, and how to strengthen conditions for these groups within the industry. Participation
in the interview sessions typically included a human resources or diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI)
officer, along with a compliance officer, legal counsel, or communications representative. Executives
involved with finance, budgeting, and procurement also participated in the interview sessions. Their
perspectives on the benefits and limitations of these programs based on their work in the industry are
reflected in the following section of the report.
Industry Perspectives: Workforce Diversity
Respondents in the interview group noted that sports wagering is a new industry in the United States,
particularly in Massachusetts, where legal operations began in 2023. Additionally, it is a small industry in
terms of the number of employees that work within the Commonwealth, the number of vendors with
which they contract, and the amount of money they spend on purchases in the Commonwealth. Thus,
licensees are limited in the number of diversity initiatives and policies they can have at the employee
and vendor level.
OVERVIEW
Compared with casino gambling, sports wagering does not employ many people in Massachusetts, and a
few interviewees said that sports wagering is slightly less diverse than the casino industry. For Category
1 licensees, sports wagering employees represent a small fraction of the casino workforce. Most sports
wagering occurs online, and only a few employees are needed to interact with customers directly. In
many cases, employees working in sportsbooks are casino employees on assignment from the existing
casino workforce. There are no specific policies to ensure diversity among sportsbook employees.
However, diversity is an overall goal for casinos, with targets for hiring diverse applicants and applicants
from the surrounding communities in their agreements with the MGC, host community, and often
within their organization. These affect casino hiring strategies and inform HR's recommendations for
hiring an employee. In our interviews with representatives, we were told that the percentage of women,
minorities, and veteran employees tracked roughly with that of the entire casino.
In the case of tethered and untethered Category 3 licensees, most employees are based outside of
Massachusetts. Much of the workforce is in technology, sales and marketing, or customer service - all
24 In-depth interviews were conducted with industry representatives during the spring and summer of 2024. For more detail, see the
methodology overview in Appendix A.

optionally situated in Massachusetts. Some interviewees mentioned that they may have several
customer service representatives within the Commonwealth.
“Massachusetts resident employees represent a very small fraction for us in terms of
[the total number of sports wagering employees].”
- Category 3 tethered licensee representative
“Our [Massachusetts] numbers aren't that large. But we do have individuals who are
Massachusetts residents who work for the company.”
- Category 3 untethered licensee representative
Some roles are outsourced to other companies, often in different countries. For Category 3 licensees,
the exception is DraftKings, which has a large footprint in Massachusetts, although it also has principal
offices in other states. Despite their size, many of the Category 3 licensees’ policies and approaches to
diversity are similar to those of their peers based in different states. The MGC has policies and practices
related to diversity for Category 3 licensees similar to those for Category 1 licensees, setting a goal for
25 percent ethnic diversity in their workforce.
All interviewees mentioned that diversity is an important principle in their organizations and that they
were taking steps to increase diversity within their workforce. One Category 3 tethered interviewee said
that the customer and employee base in sports wagering has become more racially diverse but is still
predominantly male. Two Category 1 licensee representatives mentioned that they had substantially
increased women's participation in the workforce at all levels. Category 1 licensees suggested that the
proportional involvement of women, minorities, and veterans in sports wagering usually aligned with
the proportion participating in the casino business overall, which was in line with that seen in other
companies.
“If we look at our sports wagering team and compare it to the workforce as a whole,
we’re along pretty similar lines, although it is a smaller sample size.”
- Category 1 licensee representative
“The industry is probably dominated by White males… in terms of the type of industry
that we are, and the customers and the people who engage with our products. History
has been more of White males who have dominated this workforce.”

INDUSTRY POLICIES
Programs, policies, and practices in place related to recruitment
According to operator data in the questionnaire, we note that all operators in the Massachusetts
industry run programs to increase the recruitment of a diverse workforce. According to the operator
questionnaire and industry representatives interviewed, the most significant effort by licensees to
increase diversity in their workforce is through recruitment. Most interviewees mentioned engaging and
participating in job fairs and using search firms, recruitment platforms, and websites (e.g., job boards)
designed for specific categories of diverse applicants, such as job fairs for African Americans, women, or
veterans. Some operators host diversity-focused recruitment job fairs (e.g., for veterans), and partner
with diverse owned business and professional development organizations to attract a more diverse slate
of applicants for open positions. Interviewees from Category 1 and Category 3 licensees pointed out that
they partner with colleges and universities with a diverse student body (e.g., Historically Black Colleges
and Universities) to recruit employees from diverse backgrounds.
Several interviewees mentioned that they actively encourage people from historically underrepresented
groups to apply, as many potential employees often see sports wagering as a White male-dominated
business. Some Category 1 licensees tried to recruit from diverse populations in the surrounding
communities by recruiting through local organizations such as educational institutions or partnering
with them to get referrals. Additionally, several interviewees mentioned internal referral programs that
encourage and compensate veterans, minorities, and female employees for referring new employees,
and multiple respondents in the operator questionnaire indicated that they encourage internal
Employee Resource Groups (ERGs)25 to attract and recruit applicants with similar life experiences to
their own. Some operators have ambassadors in these programs who serve as liaisons to recruit diverse
employees.
“We could probably say that the sportsbook industry mainly gets people through
referrals. And so, with the referral-based system, most people in that industry are
probably referring their friends, who are also excited about sports. So, the employee
profiles kind of match up with our patrons.”
“Sports wagering industry employees reflect the people on the other side of the counter.
Our employees reflect our guest base. We tend to have a larger population of non-
diverse bettors in our marketplace. Our female, veteran, and diverse population mirrors
the population working for us.”
- Category 1 licensee representatives
Category 1 licensees as a group have specific policies, measurable targets, and reporting requirements
to provide accountability that they are committed to diversity in their industry. These policies and
targets are in place because of requirements placed by the MGC on casino operators, which have been
implemented throughout the organizations, including the sports wagering branch. The MGC has
established its own goal as an organization of 25 percent for ethnic diversity but has not established
25 Internal communities of workers with shared identities and interests.
UMass Donahue Institute
Economic and Public Policy Research 38

specific objectives for hiring women and veterans. Even so, the fraction of female employees and
veterans is similar to that of Category 1 licensees. Category 3 licensees, on the other hand, tended to
have their own practices geared towards increasing diversity and mostly directed us to general
statements of intent or corporate social responsibility reports. For example, one untethered Category 3
licensee noted that the recruitment team incorporates diversity and inclusion into their digital
recruitment marketing tools, but they do not have specific guidelines. Most sports wagering operators'
employee footprint in Massachusetts was small, which was used to explain the absence of policies and
targets. Representatives from the MGC mentioned requiring all sports wagering licensees to report on
diversity numbers in their quarterly reports. Still, they had no authority to compel non-casino licensees
to foster diversity initiatives.
“We changed our job descriptions, ensuring they're more neutral in language… In the
sports wagering field, many people think that either I have to be a sports fanatic or I
have to be a male, and then it's wagering… So we've consciously tried to change our
sourcing and hiring efforts.”
- Category 3 untethered licensee representative
Inclusive impact compensation, benefits, trajectory, and turnover
The term ‘inclusive impact’ refers to initiatives and practices that promote diversity, equity, and
inclusion. The study sought to document the use of inclusive impact programs in worker compensation,
benefits, work trajectory and turnover. According to operator data in the questionnaire, we note that
the majority of Category 1 and Category 3 operators in the Massachusetts sports wagering industry run
inclusive impact programs for workers, but they design these programs in implicit ways. These programs
include skills-based rather than credentials-based recruiting, DEI and anti-harassment training for all
employees, mentorship programs for ERG members, and leadership tracks for lower-level employees,
who tend to be more diverse, to increase representation at higher levels of the organization.
None of the interviewees mentioned programs to support inclusive outcomes in the areas of
compensation and benefits. Much of this was grounded in not wanting discriminatory or preferential
policies for employees based on their background. Some of these practices are interpreted by
companies to be unlawful. In general, the approach is to offer benefits that may be particularly useful to
certain underrepresented employees but to offer them to everyone. For example, flexible working hours
benefit families with young children. Another Category 1 licensee mentioned an ESOL training program
that principally benefits recent immigrants who are often racial minorities.
Category 1 and Category 3 licensees often had employee mentoring programs and Employee Resource
Groups (ERGs) to benefit minority employees, women, and veterans, and the MGC is also setting up
such groups. Mentors, usually in middle management, were asked to participate in ERGs, where they
could encourage and guide employees from historically underrepresented demographic groups to
succeed and advance in their careers within the organization. Mentoring and ERGs are the operators'
primary mechanisms to encourage staff retention and promote diverse employee career development.
“We are surveying and looking at the career progression of those individuals that have
gone through those programs. Are they getting promoted? Are they considering top

talent? Are they getting the stretch assignments and making sure that the investment in
these individuals is taken seriously, and the company acknowledges that these are the
individuals we're invested in?”
- Category 3 untethered licensee representative
Interviewees noted that the industry has a relatively high turnover rate, which makes career
advancement difficult. Operators are providing more benefits and flexibility to employees, using
mentoring, training programs, and support groups to encourage employees to stay in the organization
and advance within it. Representatives from the MGC also mentioned the importance of having
mechanisms for regular employee feedback to better understand the specific challenges that diverse
employees face and devise strategies for addressing them.
The MGC and some licensee representatives noted the importance of conducting pay audits and having
transparent pay structures that would allow a team member involved in equity to see where more
significant intervention is needed and where to direct their efforts. Many interviewees remarked on the
importance of collecting data to evaluate performance, and as the MGC pointed out, that needs to be
followed by transparency in the results and a dedicated effort by a person or group of people in the
organization to address any shortcomings.
“We've got a transparent pay policy. We identify pay ranges for different roles, so
there's no discrepancy in who's getting paid and what versus what. This allows for
equity, visibility, or knowledge of what people are getting paid and where you fall. We're
very conscious of ensuring that things are equitable and that those in underrepresented
communities are not treated differently from others.”
- Category 3 untethered licensee representative
Programs to promote retention and development
Programs to retain and develop a diverse workforce can be divided into two broad categories. On the
one hand, there are programs to promote a more inclusive environment by creating a better work
culture. These training programs are meant to reduce implicit bias, educate employees on non-
discrimination, and foster tolerance and inclusivity. The bigger licensees often require all employees to
attend these short sessions and may require managers to participate when entering that role. Most of
these are one-off events offered when employees begin working with an operator, although some
licensees mentioned that they encourage employees to take them more than once. More effort is
needed to quantify the impact of these programs on employees.
“We have conscious inclusion training and general unbiased interview practices.
Conscious inclusion training is completed by all managers and above and focuses on
helping managers understand their unconscious bias and how they can move from
unconscious bias to conscious inclusion.”
- Category 3 tethered licensee representatives

The other category of training programs is professional development programs, which are meant to
benefit employees and promote their advancement within the organization. These programs are usually
open to all employees, but they may be sponsored by Employee Resource Groups (ERGs) so that most
attendees are diverse members of the ERGs. In addition to the benefits of learning in the training
programs, these often provide opportunities for diverse employees to find mentors and network within
the organization. A few training programs target specific demographic groups, such as training programs
designed for veterans or leadership programs for women. In this same category of programs are training
programs geared towards diverse employees, such as the ESOL programs mentioned previously, and
cross-functional training in operational areas with predominantly diverse employees. One example
provided was training employees in the food and beverage sectors to learn sportsbook operational skills.
One Category 1 operator mentioned that they have twelve-week programs to train emerging leaders to
move into management roles. Managers are encouraged to select diverse employees to participate in
this program. After completing those programs, they are placed in development plans to get promoted
and advance within the company. Additionally, they have leadership programs geared towards students
that provide internships and encourage them to apply for organizational roles once they graduate.
Most interviewees pointed to Employee Resource Groups (ERG) as significant programs that promote a
diverse workforce and encourage diverse employees to climb the corporate ladder. Managers were
often encouraged to mentor and guide employees from diverse backgrounds to advance within the
organization. The most common ERGs organized within sports wagering operators are those for women,
people of color, and LGBTQI+ employees. Although there are programs that are designed specifically for
veterans, there were fewer mentions of ERGs for them, although this may be due to the small fraction of
the organization's employees represented by veterans. The success of ERGs in retaining diverse
employees or promoting their advancement needs to be clarified. Although the researchers asked for
contact information for participants in ERGs, none of the interviewees provided it.
Outside of dedicated training programs, examples of retainment and development practices given in the
operator questionnaire include administrative work like regular reviews of employee engagement
survey data and compensation by sex and race to ensure that employees feel valued and are not facing
wage discrimination.
In the next sections, we present stakeholder perspectives on barriers to the employment of women,
minorities and veterans in the sports wagering industry, examples of successful practices, and
recommendations.
BARRIERS TO DIVERSE EMPLOYMENT
Various interviewees stated that the main barrier to diverse employment in the sports wagering
industry is at the recruitment stage. Most applicants tend to be White males, possibly due to a
perception that the sports wagering industry shares the demographic profile of its largest audience.
Despite efforts to increase the recruitment of diverse employees by using targeted strategies mentioned
above (e.g., job fairs for veterans), these are only sometimes successful as there is a small pool of
candidates. Despite investment in diverse job fairs, most interviewees noted that there is still room to
increase the proportion of diverse employees within their organizations.
UMass Donahue Institute
Economic and Public Policy Research 41

“We spend a lot of time and finances looking for diverse candidates. But sometimes
those arenas don’t give us results. So, we may spend $3,000 for corporate sponsorship to
be at a veteran’s job fair at Gillette Stadium, and we might only speak to four
candidates. Of the four candidates, we may only have one to pass on to someone in our
organization or team. So many folks are looking for diversity, veterans, and females, and
there aren’t enough candidates for all of us from a recruitment perspective. The other
piece is that because so many people are looking for diversity, females, and veterans, we
may have a higher turnover rate because they’re often being recruited or snatched by
other organizations.”
- Category 1 licensee representative
An additional barrier is the high turnover rate. Most diverse employees are recruited at lower-paying
entry-level positions with the highest turnover. Often, there are structural barriers that limit the
recruitment and retention of diverse employees. These include language barriers, the need for childcare
and flexible work schedules, and State requirements of no previous criminal record for MGC and
gambling employees. This last requirement entails a costly background check, which creates an
additional financial barrier for diverse applicants. Representatives from the MGC and Category 3
licensees mentioned that many offered positions require specialized skills or degrees, such as computer
programming expertise or law degrees. The proportion of diverse applicants to those positions is smaller
than entry-level positions because the pool of diverse applicants is smaller in relative and absolute
terms. Many people also have negative associations with gambling, which may deter them from
applying to work in the industry.
“The sports wagering industry is very much technical. Those skills or roles were heavily
male dominated for many years. And so, as with other underrepresented groups, it takes
time to find those with the aptitude and get the skills development training to get them
up to par for the positions.”
- Category 3 tethered licensee representative
“We do a lot of job fairs, and there’s a kind of stigma for the casino industry… that we
are a bad industry… a seedy industry. That there is high crime in our industry.”
- Category 1 licensee representative
Category 1 licensees are more motivated to address these barriers and increase diversity within their
workforce because these numbers are monitored by the MGC. Category 3 licensees, on the other hand,
do not have that statutory obligation, and their efforts to ensure greater diversity are not easily
monitored, though almost all Category 3 operators self-reported that they engage in a wide range of
employee diversity practices.
UMass Donahue Institute
Economic and Public Policy Research 42

SUCCESS EXAMPLES
As mentioned above, because they regularly report these numbers to the MGC and are compelled
through legislation to implement diversity initiatives, Category 1 licensees have been more successful at
recruiting a diverse workforce. As part of operations with intensive diversity programs, they are meeting
or exceeding some of their targets for diverse employees, which has the additional benefit of creating a
more varied pool of referrals. Some operators have succeeded in hiring and promoting more women,
partly due to having more women in managerial positions. Seeing themselves represented at higher
levels within the organization and being encouraged by female managers has increased the proportion
of women working there.
“One of the most interesting anecdotes was when we trained people to work at the
sports wagering windows. We were having problems training, so we administered a test.
It was a test of the ability to take bets. It wasn't a test of sports knowledge. We found
overwhelmingly that the women scored far higher on the test, and we ended up with a
much larger percentage of women working in the sportsbook… and so when we opened
the sports windows, I'd say 80 percent were women.”
- Category 1 licensee representative
“40 percent of our executive leadership team are women. This is something that is taken
very seriously in terms of driving diversity.”
- Category 3 untethered licensee representative
Various interviewees mentioned that their efforts recruiting at job fairs for women, people of color, and
veterans had yielded some success in hiring more diverse employees. Some Category 1 licensees
mentioned that by working with the surrounding communities, they have built stronger relationships,
which have motivated locals to apply for work there.
“From our external partnerships, one of the benefits is understanding best practices from
other companies and what they are doing in that DEI space. One of the things we are
very focused on with our external partners, and some of our other corporate partners, is
sharing best practices and being heavily focused on collaboration.”
- Category 3 tethered licensee representative
Category 1 licensees readily shared their Corporate Social Responsibility reports, which show workforce
diversity increasing over time, both overall and at the leadership level (managerial and above). Some
organizations employed roughly the same number of men and women, although this did not hold for
leadership positions. Larger and more established organizations have software and other tools to
measure the diversity of their applicant pool and workforce, which would be helpful for all sports
wagering organizations.
UMass Donahue Institute
Economic and Public Policy Research 43

Interviewees from Category 1 and Category 3 licensees displayed pride in Employee Resource Groups,
citing them often as one of the most important programs that supported diverse employees. ERGs
provide professional development and mentoring opportunities that benefit people from historically
underrepresented groups. These programs also encourage diverse employees to stay in their
organization and reduce turnover.
RECOMMENDATIONS
When asked for recommendations on increasing diversity within the sports wagering industry, most
interviewees said the biggest challenge is getting diverse employees to apply to positions within these
organizations. Nonetheless, sports bettors are increasingly diverse, and there are now more women and
minorities participating, which also translates into more diverse candidates applying for positions in the
sports wagering industry. There is an assumption that engagement with sports wagering by diverse
groups increases familiarity with the industry, making employment opportunities more visible. From this
perspective, one Category 1 interviewee mentioned that they are focusing on new sports that may be
more interesting to women or minorities, such as women’s basketball and soccer. The idea is that with a
more diverse clientele, they are more likely to have a more varied employee applicant pool. The MGC
also noted that they are revising their recruitment strategy to include diverse interview panels and
candidate slates when recruiting for new positions.
“When you have a situation where 80 percent of eligible candidates are all White males,
it's easy to close the requisition and say, I have a candidate here that can serve the job.
The process might be longer in terms of making sure that we are following the diverse
slate philosophy. So, often, jobs might have to stay open longer than they would have.”
- Category 3 untethered licensee representative
Comparing the responses between Category 1 and Category 3 licensees shows that requiring licensees
to quantify their progress, implement diversity initiatives, and report these results to the MGC
effectively motivates licensees to adopt more robust and more effective programs, policies, and
practices. These programs, policies, and practices help as well as the types and sheer volume of jobs
offered by casinos explain why Category 1 licensees have a diverse workforce. Representatives from the
MGC noted that there needs to be a formal, structured recruitment strategy and mechanisms for
measuring these approaches' effectiveness. Asking this of all licensees would increase workforce
diversity across the sports wagering industry.

Vendor Diversity
Overview
This chapter discusses vendor diversity—specifically, the participation of minority-owned, veteran-
owned, and women-owned businesses—among the firms providing goods and services to the sports
wagering industry. It is important for diverse firms to establish business-to-business supplier
relationships with large operators and government agencies such as those found in the sports wagering
industry as these can be important stabilizing factors for a business. Suppliers for large operators and
agencies can enjoy predictable, regular purchases and long-term business relationships with their
customers.
Compared to national vendor spending, spending on Massachusetts firms is relatively modest given the
strong presence of tech, financial services, and professional services firms in the state. During 2023,
Category 3 operators contracted with nearly 1,200 vendors across the U.S, with whom they spent an
average of $558 million per quarter overall. More than 100 Massachusetts vendors were involved,
averaging nearly $30 million in sales each quarter. However, participation and spending on diverse firms
makes up only a very small portion of engagement and spending for both Category 1 and Category 3
operators. In interviews, both Category 1 and 3 licensees emphasized that vendor spending was
generally limited to a few specialized companies and that there wasn’t much opportunity to diversify
their spending on diverse businesses. The scarcity of certified diverse businesses in the economy
generally and in the top spending sectors for sports wagering operators provides one explanation for the
very low levels of diverse business participation in the sports wagering industry. Spending on advertising
and marketing firms by both Category 1 and Category 3 operators highlights an opportunity for
increased spending with diverse firms in these sectors.
Participation
This section uses operator spending data to assess the level of involvement of minority-, female-, and
veteran-owned businesses providing services and supplies to the industry. Using the spending data, we
analyze diverse businesses as a percentage of total participation, proportion of dollars spent on vendors,
and mean and median annual spending on diverse vendors compared to all vendors. As specified by the
RFR, in this analysis we isolate and discuss the involvement of firms that offer advertising, marketing and
public relations services.

VENDOR DIVERSITY
The analysis in this section aims to measure the participation of diverse vendors among the spending or
contracting practices of Category 1 and Category 3 operators.26 The table below shows average
quarterly counts and shares of vendors in each diversity category along with the average quarterly
spending for each group.

During 2023, Category 3 operators contracted with an average of 1,187 vendors per quarter, with whom
they spent an average of $558 million per quarter. Of those vendors, 103 (8.6%) are Massachusetts
firms, with whom the industry spent an average of $28.8 million per quarter.
Looking at spending across the U.S., about 1.3 percent of contracted vendors are registered as Minority
Business Enterprises (MBEs), while only 0.2 percent are registered as Veteran Business Enterprises
(VBEs), and 1.1 percent are registered as Women Business Enterprises (WBEs). Though the 15 MBEs
represent 1.3 percent of all vendors contracted, spending with MBEs represents even less, at 0.8
percent of all spending on average in a quarter. For the two VBEs making up 0.2 percent of vendors, less
than 0.1 percent of overall spending goes to these firms. Finally, for the 13 WBEs making up 1.1 percent
of vendors, only 0.2 percent of overall spending occurs in this category.
In Massachusetts, MBEs make up 4.1 percent of Massachusetts firms interacting with Category 3
operators. There are no contracts with VBE firms in 2023, and five or fewer WBE firms make up 0.7
26 Given the data collected are provided in quarterly increments, this analysis was done by totaling vendors and spending across diversity
categories and locations to get industry level averages for both Category 1 and Category 3 operators. These numbers are averages and also
rounded, which may be misleading in some cases where the average is not a whole number or is less than 0.

percent of all Massachusetts firms. Spending to the five or fewer MBEs, however, makes up 12.7 percent
of spending in Massachusetts. Less than a 0.1 percent of spending goes to Massachusetts WBEs.
Throughout 2023, Category 1 operators contracted with an average of 26 vendors per quarter, with
whom they spent an average of $780,000 per quarter. Six of those vendors, about 23 percent, are
Massachusetts firms, with whom they spent an average of $123,500 per quarter.
Spending across the U.S. at Category 1 operators is made up primarily of non-diverse firms, with 7.8
percent of vendors registered as MBEs, 3.9 percent as VBEs, and 5.9 percent as WBEs. Though five or
fewer MBEs represent 7.8 percent of all vendors contracted, spending with MBEs represents only 0.1
percent of all spending on average in a quarter. For the five or fewer VBEs making up 3.9 percent of all
vendors, 1.1 percent of overall spending went to these firms. Finally, for the five or fewer WBEs making
up 5.9 percent of vendors, only 0.2 percent of overall spending is done in this category.
Category 1 spending with Massachusetts firms is almost entirely non-diverse. There is no presence of
MBE or VBE firms in the industry’s Massachusetts contracts, and the average number of WBEs is so low
it appears negligible, making up 4.3 percent of all Massachusetts vendors. About 0.3 percent of
Massachusetts vendor spending goes to these WBE firms, and the remainder is spent on non-diverse
firms.
Overall, participation and spending with diverse firms makes up a very small portion of engagement and
spending with both Category 1 and Category 3 operators. In Massachusetts, the participation of diverse
firms is also low. Although more than 12 percent of Category 3 spending in Massachusetts goes to
minority-owned firms, diverse vendor participation is very low. Only five diverse vendors of all
categories in Massachusetts participate across both industries on average in a quarter.
To further understand the extent to which Category 1 and Category 3 operators contract with diverse
firms, contract counts and sizes (dollar amounts) were requested in the data collection process.
However, very few operators were able to provide contract data. As a substitute, this section analyzes
quarterly average spending per vendor as a proxy for contract sizes.

Table 4 above shows average quarterly spending per vendor as well as average quarterly vendor counts
for Category 1 and Category 3 operators across the U.S. and Massachusetts. Due to the very small
number of average quarterly contracts with diverse firms, the values for average quarterly spending per
vendor for diversity categories with an average of five or fewer vendors per quarter have been
suppressed. The following analysis will analyze the general direction of average quarterly spending per
diverse vendor compared to the overall average quarterly spending per vendor, identifying whether the
spending sizes are larger or smaller, accompanied by a percentage to indicate how much larger or
smaller.
For Category 3 operators, average quarterly spending to the 1,187 firms across the U.S. was about
$470,000 per vendor. For MBEs, average quarterly spending per vendor is lower than the overall
average, about 37.5 percent smaller per vendor, while spending to WBEs was much lower, about 79.6
percent smaller per WBE. Average quarterly spending per vendor for VBEs across the U.S. has been
suppressed.
For Category 3 spending in Massachusetts, average quarterly spending per vendor was a bit higher than
spending per vendor throughout the U.S., with quarterly averages of about $280,000 per vendor to
about 103 firms. Average quarterly spending for MBEs and WBEs in Massachusetts have been
suppressed, and there was no spending with VBE firms in Massachusetts.
For Category 1 operators, average quarterly spending across the U.S. was about $31,000 per vendor to
about 26 firms. Spending per vendor to MBE and WBE firms have been suppressed, and there was no
spending to VBE firms. In Massachusetts, average quarterly spending per vendor was $21,500 to about 6
participating firms. Average quarterly spending per vendor for WBE’s has been suppressed, and there is
no spending to MBE and VBE firms.
Due to the very limited participation of diverse vendors in the sports betting industry, it is difficult to
infer how average quarterly spending per diverse vendor compares to the overall average quarterly
spending per vendor. For the instances in which average quarterly spending data have not been
suppressed, sports betting operators tend to spend less per vendor on diverse firms.
ADVERTISING, MARKETING AND PROMOTIONAL SPENDING
The Advertising, Marketing and Promotional sector was of particular interest in our research relative to
total spending, the participation of diverse firms, and spending to diverse firms. Through questionnaires
and operator data we found that spending on advertising and marketing firms comprises a substantial
portion of professional technical services spending in the sports wagering industry. Both Category 1
operators and Category 3 operators must invite customers to participate in their new business ventures,
so promotional and advertising material is essential. For that reason, our data request included a
breakdown of overall spending as well as spending to firms in the marketing, advertising, and
promotional sector. The following section aims to analyze the extent to which operators contract with
advertising and marketing firms, and the participation of diverse vendors in supplying these services.

Source: Operator data collected from sports betting licensees by UMDI
Category 3 operators work with an average of 358 vendors in the advertising and marketing sector per
quarter, making up just over 30 percent of all vendors on average in a quarter. Spending with these
firms is about $361 million on average in a quarter, making up nearly 65 percent of all spending in the
U.S.
In Massachusetts, 29 of the 103 firms that Category 3 operators contracted with are in the advertising
and marketing sector, making up about 28 percent of all Massachusetts vendors on average in a quarter.
Spending with marketing firms, however, makes up nearly half of all spending in Massachusetts,
accounting for about $14.3 million on average in a quarter.
Marketing firms represent a smaller share of Category 1 vendors overall, making up about 16.7 percent
of vendors engaged in an average quarter. Spending with these firms makes up a similar proportion of
spending, with about $117,200 or 15 percent of spending going to marketing firms on average in a
quarter.
In Massachusetts, five or fewer of the 6 firms that Category 1 operators engage with are in the
marketing sector, which makes up just under 40 percent of all Massachusetts vendors on average in a
quarter. Spending with these firms makes up a substantially large portion of average quarterly spending
in Massachusetts, with about $111,100 or 90 percent allocated to advertising and marketing firms on
average in a quarter.

Digging deeper to look at diverse vendor spending within the marketing sector, the levels of
participation and spending with diverse marketing firms are low and insignificant across all Category 3
and Category 1 contracts.
For Category 3 operators, MBEs account for 0.8 percent of marketing vendors on average in a quarter,
and less than 0.1 percent of average quarterly spending. WBEs account for 1.3 percent of marketing
vendors on average in a quarter and less than 0.1 percent of spending on average in a quarter. In
Massachusetts, none of the marketing vendors are diverse.
For Category 1 operators, WBEs account for 11.8 percent, or five or fewer marketing vendors on average
in a quarter, and only 0.5 of spending is done with WBE marketing firms on average in a quarter. In
Massachusetts, Category 1 operators contract with five or fewer WBE firms on average in a quarter.
Average quarterly spending with WBEs makes up only 0.3 percent of average quarterly spending in
Massachusetts to marketing firms. There is no contracting with MBE or VBE marketing firms for
Category 1 operators.
Overall, marketing, advertising, and promotional spending makes up a substantial portion of spending
by Category 1 and Category 3 operators. Spending on marketing firms comprises about 65 percent of All
U.S. spending for Category 3 operators and about 15 percent for Category 1 operators on average. In
Massachusetts, marketing spending accounts for 50 percent of all spending on average for Category 3
operators and about 90 percent for Category 1 operators (Table 5). The participation of diverse vendors
in this sector, however, is very low. Given the nature of marketing and advertising, it is expected that
these firms will continue to have a need for marketing firms. As such, there may be room for operators
in both categories to intentionally increase contracts and spending with diverse firms in these sectors,
both in and outside of Massachusetts.

The MGC follows procurement guidelines established by the Supplier Diversity Office through the
Supplier Diversity Program (SDP). The SDO sets annual benchmark goals expressed as a percentage of
each organization’s discretionary budget (MBE 8%; WBE 14%; VBE/SDVOBE27 3%)28 which apply to all
procurements for goods and services exceeding $150,000. Full participants in the SDO’s procurement
programs accept and track the benchmark goals, and report in a consistent manner. Some additional
non-executive departments and quasi-public organizations receive resources and technical assistance
from the SDO and voluntarily submit narratives to the SDO about their supplier diversity programs.
According to the SDP, participating organizations may use two types of spending to achieve program
spending goals:
• Direct spending with MBE, WBE, VBE, SDVOBE, DOBE, and LGBTBE29 prime contractors; and
• Indirect spending resulting from business partnerships between the organizations’ contractors
and MBE, WBE, VBE, SDVOBE, DOBE, or LGBTBE vendors used in the contractors’ operations.
This includes subcontracting, as well as other types of business-to-business relationships.
Through interviews, MGC staff made it clear that the approaches and tools they have adopted in
following the SDP have played a critical role in increasing the volume of MGC relationships with and
spending on diverse supplier businesses.
PARTICIPATION, BENCHMARKS, AND SPENDING
The MGC far exceeded their FY2023 benchmarks for contracting with women- and minority-owned
businesses but fell short on their veteran-owned business benchmark. The MGC’s latest spending ratio
of 34 percent on minority-owned businesses is much higher than the percentage of minority-owned
businesses in the state overall (13%), as shown in Table 11. Spending on women-owned businesses is
much the same, significantly higher at 30 percent versus 18 percent of these businesses in the state
overall. Veteran spending has room to improve, however, with 4 percent of Massachusetts businesses
owned by veterans, compared to only making up 0.4 percent of MGC vendor spending.

Spending by the MGC on minority- and women- owned businesses was relatively stable between FY2020
and FY2022, before nearly quadrupling in FY2023. This jump was concentrated in a few large contracts,
rather than representing an increase in the number of vendors, so there may be a risk of regressing to
the mean if the specific contracts are not renewed.

Note: Ranked in order of most to least spent in industry
When it comes to spending on diverse firms by industry, Other Services, particularly non-profit services,
are the largest spending area for the MGC, though this spending is entirely concentrated among
women-owned businesses.30 The category of Information is the other main area of spending with
diverse firms, concentrated among IT services and software providers, both provided by minority- and
women-owned businesses. Professional, scientific, and technical services and administrative and
support services both have a medium level of spending, mostly concentrated in advertising and
marketing and travel expenses, respectively. Advertising and marketing is a particularly significant
expenditure area, involving marketing consultants, branding, and promotional materials, making up
essentially all professional technical services spending by the MGC. The MGC spends much less in the
remaining industries, with spending spread fairly evenly between minority-owned and women-owned
businesses. The only industry in which the MGC contracted with a veteran-owned business was retail
trade, specifically for office supplies.

Vendor Diversity: Comparisons With Similar Industries
The goal of this section is to compare levels of diverse vendor participation in the sports wagering
industry with outcomes in similar industries, as a parallel to the previous section which compares
diverse employment to similar industries.31 Unlike the employment analysis, however, an analysis of
supplier diversity is limited by a lack of data sources that can be generalized to make comparisons. Data
showing the extent to which diverse suppliers are being used by an organization are typically obtainable
only through initiatives called disparity studies, which are designed to assess and advance equity within
specific government agencies or businesses. However, disparity studies are customized to particular
organizations, not to entire industries, and are typically not publicly released. For the purposes of this
report, this section will touch on vendor diversity for Category 1 operators as a subset of casinos and
ultimately focus on assessing the presence of diverse firms in the industries to which Category 3
operators spend the most.
Category 1
Because retail sports betting operations exist within casino operations, it follows that vendor spending
for these operators mostly consists of the goods and services needed beyond what the casino covers.
For example, janitorial or security expenses may be covered by the casino for the entire facility in which
the operator exists, while expenses like sports betting kiosks or advertising fall to the sports betting
operator. As a result, there are very few industries with which retail sports betting vendor participation
can be compared, and very little data with which to make comparisons. Additionally, retail operational
spending on diverse vendors is nearly non-existent, as discussed earlier in this report. Participation of
diverse vendors at casinos in FY2023, used as a proxy for participation of diverse vendors at Category 1
operators, include: 5 percent MBE spending, 7 percent WBE spending, and 2 percent VBE spending.32
Category 3
Mobile sports betting operators function similarly to software and fintech firms, though diverse business
enterprise (DBE) spending data are not available for software and fintech industry sectors. Survey data
collected from operators offer information on the primary types of products and services purchased by
sports wagering operators. Using data on largest categories of spending to identify key industries
utilized by Category 3 operators, we are able to check the availability of DBEs in those sectors and assess
the degree to which DBEs may be able participate in contracts with mobile sports betting operators.
According to the questionnaire, Category 3 operators tend to spend large amounts on professional,
scientific, and technical services (consulting, R&D, legal services; accounting and payroll, computer
systems design; advertising and marketing); information services (software publishers;
telecommunications; data processing hosting and related services); and wholesale distributors, (durable
goods - computers, electronics, technical equipment and infrastructure). Category 3 survey respondents
indicated that the two most common new areas of spending after an expansion to a new state are
advertising and marketing and legal services.
31 Our method for choosing comparison industries is discussed in the previous chapter, Employment Diversity.
32 Supplier diversity statistics are published in quarterly reports and annually in the MGC’s annual report. These reports can be found on the
MGC website.

Economic and Public Policy Research 53

With top spending sectors identified, two sources can be used to assess the participation of diverse
vendors against the availability of diverse vendors. From Annual Business Survey data, presented in
Table 11, we know that the presence of U.S. diverse businesses in these areas is significant. Looking at
professional, information, and wholesale industries, minority-owned businesses comprise 17, 15, and 20
percent, respectively. Women-owned businesses total 23, 14, and 10 percent, respectively.
However, Table 12 shows that certified diverse-owned businesses in these areas make up a much lower
percentage of their industries (1.8% at most), and operators universally look towards certified
businesses when trying to boost diverse vendor engagement, potentially missing out on the vast
majority of diverse-owned businesses. The scarcity of certified diverse businesses in the economy
provides an explanation for the very low levels of diverse business participation in the sports wagering
industry.
Some professional services subsectors like advertising and marketing have slightly higher rates of
diverse certifications, with certified women owned businesses making up four percent of the industry in
Massachusetts, more than twice the rate of the larger professional services sector. Given the relatively
high presence of WBE’s providing advertising and marketing services, it might be feasible to increase the
presence of WBE contractors in this area.

Programs and Policies for Vendor Diversity
We designed tools to identify the organizational policies and practices in place to promote supplier
diversity in the sports wagering industry. We collected information on policies and programs through
customized questionnaires sent to both types of licensed operators and the MGC. Additionally, through
an intensive stakeholder interview process we gathered in-depth perspectives from industry
professionals on the use of these programs and policies to increase diversity. We also collected
information on barriers to success, approaches that work, and recommendations going forward.
As specified by the RFR, we discuss the use of vendor diversity policies in two areas: policies and
practices related to solicitation of and contracting with minority, women, and veteran business
enterprises in the Commonwealth; and programs and policies to increase levels of engagement,
volume, and scale.
Operator Questionnaire
Through the operator questionnaires we found that all license holders as well as the MGC have
programs, policies, and practices in place related to solicitation of and contracting with minority,
women, and veteran-owned business enterprises. Category 1 operators and the MGC universally
have programs and policies to increase levels of engagement, volume, and scale with these
businesses, as do nearly all Category 3 operators.33
The main ways that Category 1 operators actively recruit diverse vendors is by partnering with
chambers of commerce and advisory groups to identify regional suppliers, providing a dedicated
vendor website for updates and registrations, and hosting supplier networking events for direct
engagement with casino departments. Some also support local economies by purchasing gift
certificates from community businesses for loyalty and reward programs and leverage diversity
databases to expand vendor partnerships with minority- and women-owned enterprises. Once
connections with businesses are established, programs that Category 1 operators use to boost their
level of engagement include mentorship and development programs with casino executives,
quarterly best-practice seminars, and constructive feedback on proposal rejections. They also
collaborate directly with certification bodies to promote RFP opportunities and encourage
certification among eligible vendors, facilitate partnerships between small and large suppliers, and
some have appointed a dedicated Procurement Diversity Manager to lead supplier diversity efforts.
Category 3 operators also prioritize diverse supplier spending and actively recruit diverse suppliers.
Approaches include, for example, dedicating procurement roles to building relationships with
historically underrepresented suppliers, partnering with diverse business organizations, and ensuring
minority, women and disadvantaged business enterprises (MWDBEs) are included in competitive bids.
These operators utilize supplier databases, integrate DEI requirements in contracts, train buyers on
supplier diversity, and track diverse vendor spending to measure and reinforce their commitment to
inclusive procurement practices. To increase volume with diverse vendors, program examples include an
internal platform that tracks spending and identifies potential diverse vendors, focusing on local and
regional relationships, along with programs to train buyers on the benefits of inclusive procurement.

Industry Perspectives: Vendor Diversity
This section provides industry perspectives on the use of programs and policies to promote vendor
diversity, through a series of in-depth interviews with a subset of licensees and the MGC. We gathered
information about the use of supplier diversity programs in two categories: policies and practices to
solicit and contract with diverse business enterprises; and programs to increase levels of engagement,
volume, and scale of contracts with these enterprises. This section provides findings, including
perspectives on barriers, examples of success, and recommendations going forward.
OVERVIEW
Retail sports wagering operators spend relatively little on outside vendors and usually contract with only
a few suppliers providing specialized products. Thus, there are few opportunities and not a large pool of
businesses for them to diversify their purchases. Few of these specialized vendors are based in
Massachusetts, and overall very few are certified as diverse businesses. While the perspectives in this
section are from operator interviews, based on our analysis of secondary data we believe that very few
diverse companies exist that can fulfill these specialized vendor roles.34 The MGC mentioned that the
most plentiful diversity-owned companies are women-owned, facilitating contracting with them.
The sports wagering purchasing needs of Category 1 licensees are usually only for specialized products,
such as a specific type of paper or kiosks for them to place bets. These are often sole-sourced from a
single specialized vendor. The companies that provide online wagering services for these licensees are
34 Analysis of data on business ownership and certifications for this study confirms that diverse firms are less represented in the sectors where
Category 3 operators make their largest purchases (see Tables 10 and 11), and on top of that very low proportions of businesses in these
sectors are certified (see Table 12).
UMass Donahue Institute
Economic and Public Policy Research 57

also sole-sourced, with an exclusivity agreement for a given casino. Many casino vendors are diverse
businesses, but these contracts are not specifically for sports wagering.
“On the vendor side, in sports wagering, there's not a ton that we spend operationally.
It's office supplies, toner, and things like that. There's not a lot of opportunity for diverse
spend in the sports wagering area.”
- Category 1 licensee representative
Category 3 licensees also have very limited suppliers, and their needs are also highly specialized.
Some of these include technological infrastructure for hosting sports wagering applications or
processing payments. Professional technical services, including advertising and marketing, also
represents a major area of spending. Since sports wagering is relatively new in the United
States, especially compared with Europe, interviewees said that foreign companies provided
some services.
One area where Category 1 and Category 3 licensees suggested there was room to increase
diversity is when contracting with advertising and marketing businesses. These do not need to
be as specialized as other gambling procurements, and there are many vendors who provide
these services. Operators have more choices, including diverse vendors. Thus, they present an
opportunity to contract with certified diverse businesses. This may also present an opportunity
for licensees to contract with Massachusetts-based companies.
“The only opportunity for discretionary spending would be office supplies and
marketing… That would be the biggest opportunity.”
- Category 1 licensee representative
INDUSTRY POLICIES
Programs, policies, and practices in place related to Solicitation and Contracting
All operators we surveyed reported that they maintain programs meant to increase diversity in
solicitation and contracting, most commonly through partnerships with local and national business
advocacy groups and building databases of diverse vendors. However, across the board Category 1 and
3 licensees emphasized that vendor spending was generally limited to a few specialized companies and
that there wasn’t much opportunity to diversify their spending on diverse businesses.
“The only vendor specific to sports wagering is a single supplier that supplies paper for
the sports wagering kiosks. When we opened up sports wagering in 2023, we didn’t
know how many paper kiosk rolls we would need. We have about five years of
inventory.”
- Category 1 licensee representative
UMass Donahue Institute
Economic and Public Policy Research 58

Category 1 licensees, despite the small size of their sports wagering spending, have agreements with the
MGC that date to the licenses given to operate a casino in Massachusetts. These agreements about
diversity are understood to extend to sports wagering and were renewed recently. The agreements
include plans that the Category 1 licensees submit to the MGC and are publicly available on the MGC
website.35 The plans include goals and targets for engaging with minority, women, and veteran-owned
businesses. They also designate teams to address diversity in procurement and hiring in their
organizations.
Operators often post statements committing to diversity on their websites and train employees who
deal with procurement on the importance of diversity. Some interviewees mentioned a written
commitment by procurement teams to seek diverse-certified businesses and that these teams also help
guide companies to certify as diverse-owned if needed. Massachusetts has a Supplier Diversity Office,
which has helped organizations find and contract diverse vendors and sets benchmarks that
organizations can try to meet. The parent companies of Category 1 licensees usually have programs to
increase supplier diversity led by a strategy team that engages with diverse trade organizations (e.g., the
National Veteran-Owned Business Association). They actively seek diverse businesses through these and
other business associations.
Programs to increase levels of engagement, volume, and scale
Even though sports wagering operators spend small amounts on diverse vendors, interviewees
demonstrated a genuine interest in fostering their relationships with diverse vendors. Questionnaire
results showed that operators have several programs in place to increase scale, most notably
mentorship and feedback programs for smaller vendors who need guidance on how to meet operator
standards. Operators often encouraged businesses to certify as diverse if they qualified and would guide
them through the process, which can be lengthy and cumbersome.
“We work with many diverse businesses that may not have received their certification
for one reason or another, and so we are very active in pushing them through the
process or the resources to get it. We're also developing some additional programs that
will help support that.”
- Category 3 tethered licensee representative
According to the operator questionnaire, all Category 1 operators and the majority of Category 3
operators maintained policies aimed at increasing levels of engagement, volume, and scale from diverse
contractors. Because of the small number of vendors engaged by Category 3 operators, it is possible the
companies that do not maintain such policies have decided it is not worth the effort as they struggle to
find diverse vendors to begin with.
However, Category 1 companies universally maintain polices to increase levels of engagement. The
parent companies of Category 1 licensees often have policies explicitly considering diverse companies
when they need a supplier. One interviewee mentioned that the procurement team is outstanding
35 Diversity plans can be found on the following page: https://massgaming.com/about/diversity/
UMass Donahue Institute
Economic and Public Policy Research 59

about contacting diverse suppliers when needed and considering diversity spending first. Nonetheless,
the same interviewee noted that finding a replacement can be challenging when they lose a diverse
supplier.
A Category 1 licensee representative mentioned that they often encourage diverse vendors to scale up,
as the casinos frequently require suppliers who can provide products on a large scale. Nonetheless, this
was usually challenging for smaller companies, as expansion requires significant capital investment.
Licensees contract with diverse vendors for minor needs but rely on big, established companies for
large, specialized purchases. The MGC noted that they have diversity benchmarks for large
procurements and are also adapting those for smaller procurements. Even small procurements require
Supplier Diversity Plans in public vendor bid proposal postings.
BARRIERS TO CONTRACTING WITH DIVERSE VENDORS
The primary barrier to contracting diverse vendors is the limited number of significant purchases, which
are usually specialized and sole-sourced. Category 1 licensees often encounter this situation, requiring
only a few specialty products, such as paper or kiosk manufacturers. Category 3 licensees have larger
contracts with vendors, but these are usually specialized products, such as digital infrastructure or
payment support, provided by few large, and specialized companies. Some vendors are not based in the
United States and do not qualify as diverse companies. The MGC mentioned that it was particularly
challenging to engage with veteran-owned businesses because very few of them provided the services
they regularly used (research and legal services).
“[We can only do business] if diverse vendors can do the type of work we need.
Otherwise, we won't be switching the vendors we have.”
- Category 3 untethered licensee representative
Very few companies are diverse-owned and provide the specialty products and services the sports
wagering industry needs. Thus, it is not easy to find and engage in business with diverse companies, and
it is challenging to replace a diverse company if it loses its contract.
“When we started, we had a veteran-owned vendor, and they were fantastic. Then, they
were purchased by a larger company with a national presence, and now they are no
longer a diverse-owned business. That’s happened three or four times now with some of
our main suppliers.”
- Category 1 licensee representative
Many interviewees mentioned an additional barrier: the cumbersome process of certifying as a diverse-
owned company in Massachusetts. Although they try to encourage, guide, and help some companies
through the process, some vendors do not find it worthwhile and do not undergo certification, even
after efforts to convince them. Additionally, Category 1 licensees require all companies to register with
the MGC as suppliers. This process is also a burden; some diverse vendors would rather not engage and
avoid contracts with casino-based operators.
UMass Donahue Institute
Economic and Public Policy Research 60

“Certification can be challenging. It can take a lot of resources that suppliers may not
have available to them or understand how to navigate that process. We also see
challenges with suppliers being able to scale up. They may be able to offer us a product
or service for the sports wagering piece of our business in Massachusetts. Still, they can't
offer that service to the entire sports wagering business… they have a product or service
they can offer us in one location, but they can't scale across the company.”
- Category 3 tethered licensee representative
SUCCESS EXAMPLES
Most operators generally state that contracting with diverse vendors amounts to a tiny fraction of their
overall spending. Nonetheless, there does seem to be great potential for an increase—at least for
Category 3 licensees. One licensee mentioned that although less than 1 percent of their spending in the
United States went to diverse businesses, that still amounted to millions of dollars spent on over one
hundred companies in one year. Other Category 3 licensees could have at least comparable spending
levels, which may provide opportunities to increase the proportion of expenditures that goes to diverse
companies.36 Further, only half of those companies were officially certified as diverse, which suggests
that this fraction could also increase if there were incentives for companies to do so. One tethered
Category 3 licensee representative said that for the parent company (which includes many land-based
casinos), 12 percent of purchases were from diverse suppliers, which suggests that Category 1 licensees
may be able to meet higher targets.
The parent companies of Category 1 licensees often have large company-wide programs to increase
their diversity spending, which have been successful. For example, one company had a 70 percent
increase in companywide diverse expenditure in three years. Tracking diverse spending is a relatively
recent phenomenon that drives increased spending on diverse vendors. A couple of licensees from
different categories mentioned having recently updated or planning on updating their tools for tracking
diverse suppliers.
Licensee representatives said purchasing from diverse companies had helped foster mutually beneficial
relationships. For Category 1 licensees, these relationships helped create rapport with the surrounding
communities and encouraged other parts of the parent organization to engage with these vendors.
Diversity is becoming increasingly important for bigger corporations, and there is a push to increase
diversity on all levels.
“On a national level, diversity is becoming more of a mindset. And it’s been pushed down
across all avenues over the past four or five years.”
- Category 1 licensee representative
36 We believe this example reflects enterprise-level spending rather than the more limited spending made by the digital group.

Economic and Public Policy Research 61

RECOMMENDATIONS
One area where licensee representatives suggested that there might be an opening to contract diverse
vendors is marketing and advertising. Some interviewees indicated that there may be increased interest
in this space, including from certified diverse-owned companies. Moreover, there may be an
opportunity to encourage companies to contract with local vendors within the Commonwealth. Another
interviewee mentioned that Massachusetts often has diverse vendors for office supplies and software
resellers. One Category 3 licensee representative suggested that requiring procurement processes to
have targets for diverse spending would help increase the volume and scale of business with diverse-
owned vendors.
Category 1 licensee representatives noted that one way to increase purchases from diverse vendors is to
lower the barriers for them to register as such and to register with the MGC. This latter process, in
particular, can be an obstacle for smaller businesses. Interviewees noted that there needs to be an
increase in the supply of diverse vendors to make it easier to engage with these companies.

Conclusions and Recommendations
Workforce Diversity
This section contains recommendations for increasing racial and gender diversity, as well as diversity in
terms of veteran status in the workforce in the sports wagering industry.
As with the rest of the country, there has been a renewed focus on increasing diversity in Massachusetts
since 2020, when national protests increased discussions around this topic. Interviewees noted that
having a more diverse workforce helps boost employee engagement and morale, promotes more varied
perspectives, and fosters innovation within their organizations.
Various operators from different categories have all increased their efforts to expand diversity in their
workforce and have been successful to varying degrees. Category 1 licensees have been especially
effective, as they were able to build upon their uniquely intensive diversity programs, which have been
in place since casinos were legally allowed to operate in Massachusetts. Interviewees and a review of
the documents shared suggest that, on the workforce side, the most significant gains over time have
been with women, who are participating in increasing numbers in gambling and the sports wagering
industry. There have been gains with other minority groups and veterans, but these have been smaller.
Nevertheless, the 2023 operator data still show lower proportions of women in this industry than in all
comparison industries.
Many of the interviewees emphasized that diversity was an essential pillar in their organizations and
that they actively tried to recruit a more diverse workforce. A few interviewees noted that declaring a
commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion and assigning one or more employees to specifically
address that within an organization was a signal to other industries and the public at large that this is an
important matter, and this has led to positive change within institutions and the industry.
Representatives from the MGC mentioned that creating a foundational work culture that supports DEI
initiatives is the most critical step to enhancing these goals within their organization.
In contrast, Category 3 operators maintain a less structured approach to growing a diverse workforce,
Most diversity commitments by Category 3 licensees are limited to statements of purpose and do not
include actual policies with targets and measurable goals. The strategies were often limited to
participating in diverse job fairs, posting on websites targeting historically underrepresented
demographic groups, or supporting Employee Resource Groups (ERG). Evaluating how successful these
strategies have been beyond anecdotal accounts is a challenge.
Recommendation #1: Encourage the development of workforce diversity goals and standardized
metrics for the MGC and for Category 3 operators
Casino programs and policies are structured towards meeting workforce diversity goals for minority,
women, and veteran participation and these programs measure progress with standardized metrics. The
MGC could expand their approach for their own policies and programs to encompass all these types and
establish helpful metrics for evaluating the success of their efforts. The MGC could recommend the
UMass Donahue Institute
Economic and Public Policy Research 63

same approach for licensed Category 3 operators, particularly for their Massachusetts-related
workforce.
A. Massachusetts Gaming Commission
As discussed in the industry perspectives section, the MGC already has specific ideas about how it can
strengthen its workforce diversity policies. This concept of establishing goals and adopting metrics is
already seen as an important step to strengthen its policies.
The Commission has established an official diversity goal of achieving 25 percent ethnic diversity. The
agency has demonstrated consistency in meeting this target. However, the Commission does not have
specific objectives for the inclusion of women or veterans and employs lower proportions of these
workers compared to the state population. There are ongoing internal discussions about setting goals in
these areas.
• Solidify target diversity goals for women and veteran workers so progress can be measured.
MGC professionals interviewed for this project also see the need to establish a clear, structured
recruitment strategy—standard operating procedures—and to implement mechanisms including data
collection for measuring the effectiveness of these strategies. According to the professionals
interviewed, this type of structured system is currently lacking.
• Establish a clear, structured recruitment strategy—standard operating procedures—and
implement mechanisms including data collection for measuring the effectiveness of these
strategies.
B. Category 3 operators
Given the less structured approach to workforce diversity programs by mobile/online operators, the
MGC could also recommend some basic, standardized approaches to promoting the workforce diversity
of these operators.
• Encourage the development of workforce diversity goals for recruitment and hiring.
• Establish and standardize metrics to allow assessments of the effectiveness of programs and
policies over time. It would be beneficial to use the same target areas and core metrics used by
casinos, with goals established by each individual Category 3 operator, as they are very different
companies compared to Category 1 operators (casinos).
• Ask operators to provide information on diversity initiatives, goals, and progress reports as with
land-based casinos. This might help ensure that sports wagering operators implement effective
strategies to increase diversity.
Supplier Diversity
This section contains recommendations for increasing the participation levels of diverse business
enterprises providing goods and services to the sports wagering industry.
UMass Donahue Institute
Economic and Public Policy Research 64

On the vendor side, Category 1 licensees had more robust programs and policies to increase purchases
from diverse-owned businesses. These include plans, reports, goals, and targets they present to the
MGC regularly. Doing business with diverse-owned vendors is seen as a valuable way for operators to
engage with the local community, particularly for Category 1 licensees. Additionally, diverse-owned
vendors can provide variety to specific sectors, such as food and beverages.
Category 3 licensees, lacking such comprehensive requirements, had fewer explicit policies and
generally could not point to specific goals. Only two tethered Category 3 licensees provided us with
documents about their institution’s diversity policies and programs. At best, they pointed out one or
two sentences on their website regarding a commitment to diversity. Untethered Category 3 licensees
had little impetus to demonstrate a commitment to diversity in Massachusetts.
Recommendation #2: Encourage operators to create structured strategies to increase the participation
of diverse vendors.
As discussed earlier, the MGC has a smaller role in regulating the sports wagering industry compared to
their regulation of casino operations, due to an absence of legislation mandating operators to establish
targets or implement diversity initiatives. Policies to increase diversity will only be implemented if the
MGC can influence Category 3 operators. Sports wagering retail operators already work within the
rubric of casino supplier diversity policies and programs. In spite of limitations, the MGC could actively
encourage Category 3 operators to adopt approaches to increase supplier diversity related to their
Massachusetts-specific operations. The MGC could offer recommendations and resources to operators
who seek to promote opportunities for diverse businesses within the industry. Suggested policies:
• Recommend that all operators establish a supplier diversity plan37 for their procurements. An
approach to adopt a supplier diversity plan would go a long way to ensuring that licensees are
making committed efforts to purchasing from diverse-owned businesses.
• Encourage operators to pursue supplier diversity goals in the same categories pursued by
casinos, measuring progress with standardized metrics. Operators could adopt their own
approaches as done by the non-executive departments and quasi-public organizations that
voluntary report each year to the SDO.38
• Establish internal requirements for procurement processes and set targets and measurable
goals for diverse spending which could help increase the volume and scale of business with
diverse-owned vendors.
• Encourage operators to set targets and measurable goals for spending on Massachusetts
businesses, including Massachusetts small business enterprises. A recommendation to promote
spending on Massachusetts businesses appear as Recommendation 8 below.
• Encourage all licensees to update their tools for tracking diverse suppliers. While a few licensees
mentioned that they are already upgrading their tools in this area, all organizations, including
the MGC, would benefit from having digital tools to measure diversity in their workforce and

among their suppliers. These tools would allow companies to compare milestones against goals
to evaluate the success of strategies used to increase diversity.
• Recommend a set of standardized data metrics to track progress towards goals, based on the
metrics used by casinos to track spending on diverse vendors.
o Company databases could store the metrics for participating vendors to enable tracking
of participation over time.
o Metrics that have been recommended for other supplier diversity initiatives39 include:
▪ Name, address, phone number, and email address
▪ Type of business/associated work
▪ Expenditures
▪ Ownership status (minority-, women-, veteran-owned)
▪ Business certification status
▪ Contractor or subcontractor status
Recommendation #3: Partner with the Massachusetts Supplier Diversity Office to extend outreach
resources to sports wagering operators who wish to reach diverse vendors in the state and promote
procurement opportunities.
Outreach efforts by sports wagering operators could be supported by resources and tools provided by
the SDO, replicating some of the SDO’s existing outreach initiatives in the state,40 The SDO offers
customized support for partner agencies and this support could be expanded to the MGC and its
licensees. For example, the SDO works with the Cannabis Control Commission “to promote procurement
opportunities to SDO-certified businesses.”41 These types of SDO initiatives to expand outreach to SDO-
certified business in the state could be extended to suppliers participating in the sports wagering
industry.
• Work with the SDO to make affirmative marketing tools and other resources available to
operators who want to reach Massachusetts diverse suppliers and encourage their participation.
Sports Wagering Taxes
An additional direction for recommendations has to do with sports wagering taxes and how they are
allocated by the Commonwealth. The funding generated by sports wagering revenue taxes already
provides significant support to Massachusetts municipalities and organizations through dedicated
allocations to five different state funds. In FY 2024 alone, $117.6 million was collected and distributed to
these funds. The largest portion of sports wagering tax revenue is designated for the General Fund, to
which 45 percent is allotted. The next biggest recipient is Local Aid to municipalities, into which 28
percent is allotted, then the Workforce Investment Trust Fund at 18 percent, an additional 9 percent is

allocated to the Public Health Trust Fund (PHTF), and 1 percent is allocated to the Youth Development
and Achievement Fund, a financial assistance program that aims to support Massachusetts students in
higher education at approved institutions.
Sports wagering tax revenues could be more intentionally focused towards programs that increase
diversity in the sports wagering industry. Some sports wagering tax revenues could be allocated to
decrease structural barriers facing the sports wagering workforce. Other funding could support the
development of the small business community, including diversely owned enterprises that want to
participate in the industry. We understand that recommendations concerning how to allocate sports
wagering taxes collected may be difficult to implement, potentially involving legislative action. Given the
current economic and fiscal climate new directions may not be feasible. Nevertheless, some ideas for
how to focus sports wagering tax revenues are discussed below.

WORKFORCE SUPPORT
Recommendation #4: Direct sports wagering tax revenue to support workforce development for the
sports wagering workforce in Massachusetts.
Through the Workforce Investment Trust Fund and the Youth Development and Achievement Fund,
sports wagering tax revenue provides much needed support for workforce development programs in the
Commonwealth. According to the legislation, money in the Workforce Investment Trust Fund “is
competitively granted to develop and strengthen workforce opportunities for low-income communities
and vulnerable youth and young adults in the commonwealth, including providing opportunities and
UMass Donahue Institute
Economic and Public Policy Research 67

strategies to promote stable employment and wage growth.” 42 We recommend that some of the
funded programs address workforce issues in the sports wagering industry that were raised in this study.
Through the interview process, stakeholders in the industry identified several structural barriers faced
by diverse employees in the industry. Often, these are barriers that limit the recruitment and retention
of diverse employees. For Category 1 operators utilizing a highly diverse workforce, these include
language barriers, the need for childcare and flexible work schedules, and State requirements of no
previous criminal record for MGC and gambling employees. This last requirement entails a costly
background check, which creates an additional financial barrier for diverse applicants.
In contrast, much of the Category 3 workforce requires specialized, higher-level education and training
in tech, sales and marketing, and other professional fields. Structural barriers to a more diverse
workforce are related to limitations and barriers for students within the educational pipeline. It takes
years of effort and tuition payments to obtain higher educational credentials.
In this context, the Commonwealth could consider better directing sports wagering tax revenue
allocations through the Workforce Investment Trust Fund and the Youth Development and Achievement
Fund to address known structural barriers limiting the sports wagering industry workforce in
Massachusetts.
• Funding could be allocated to support ESOL programs and to subsidize childcare programming,
especially in communities hosting retail sportsbooks.
• If possible, revenue tax funds could be earmarked to pay for or subsidize gaming employment
background checks to eliminate financial barriers for diverse applicants residing in
Massachusetts.
• Workforce Investment Trust Fund and Youth Development and Achievement Fund funds could
be directed to support programs directly relevant to expanding workforce diversity in the
Category 3 companies (mobile/online operators). This could include supporting students from
historically underrepresented groups to obtain technology-related training and education, as
well as business and marketing-related training.
o Given the low levels of women in the sports wagering workforce as well as in tech
occupations, special attention could be given to support female students.
o Support for students from racial and ethnic groups that are underrepresented in
technology-related fields could also be prioritized.
BUSINESS ENTERPRISE SUPPORT
Notably missing in sports wagering tax revenue allocations is any dedicated support for business
development programs. According to the stakeholder interviews, many operators struggle to locate and
engage with certified diverse vendors. We see an opportunity to use sports wagering revenue to help
develop diverse-owned businesses who want to contract with sports wagering operators but face
barriers to do so. Therefore, we recommend that in addition to the workforce funds already supported,
the state channel a significant portion of the tax revenue in a new direction: to grow and develop

business capacity in the Commonwealth, including a focus on diversely owned businesses. Specific
recommendations are presented below.
Recommendation #5: Direct sports wagering tax revenue towards organizations, programs, and
initiatives that support and grow diverse-owned businesses in the Commonwealth.
Supplier diversity programs and policies alone cannot solve the broader structural issues and
mismatches that constrain the capacity of minority-owned, woman-owned, and veteran-owned
companies to engage with the industry. As discussed in the report, larger economic factors are at work
when it comes to improving supplier diversity in the sports wagering industry. As discussed in the
industry perspectives section, operators we surveyed report that they maintain programs meant to
increase diversity in solicitation and contracting, most commonly through partnerships with local and
national business advocacy groups and building databases of diverse vendors. However, across the
board, Category 1 and 3 licensees emphasized that vendor spending was generally limited to a few
specialized companies and that there was not much opportunity to diversify their spending on diverse
businesses. This finding is especially clear in the analysis of operator vendor spending presented earlier
in the report.
As discussed in earlier sections, economic data show that diversely owned firms represent only a
fraction of companies in the broader economy. Moreover, as evidenced by Massachusetts Supplier
Diversity Office data, very few of these companies are certified to do business as diverse-owned
enterprises. The sectors represented and the smaller size of most diverse companies are also limiting
factors because the sports wagering industry tends to purchase specialized goods and services at a large
scale.
Within this broader context, programs to expand solicitation to diverse firms and policies to expand
spending—including target goals for spending on diverse vendors—could help. But other avenues that
support business development such as technical assistance training; flexible and affordable financing;
commercial district revitalization; sector-specific coaching and networking groups; and other supportive
programs and initiatives; could grow the number and strength of diverse small businesses in the
Commonwealth.
In addition to better support for diverse-owned businesses, Massachusetts small businesses more
generally need better support to grow their capacity.
Recommendation #6: Use sports wagering taxes to create a permanent and significant funding stream
for small business development technical assistance.
Results of the questionnaire show that operators have several programs in place to increase the scale of
spending with diverse businesses, most notably mentorship and feedback programs for smaller vendors
who need guidance on how to meet operator standards. Beyond these efforts by operators is a system
of organizations providing technical assistance to help small businesses grow in Massachusetts.
However, funding for these programs and services is limited and this reduces availability and access.
A recent study of diverse businesses found significant demand for business development technical
services, while at the same time funding for programs and infrastructure is stretched thin: “While there
are dozens of organizations across the Commonwealth and Boston that offer services, competition for
scarce resources, coordination, and information sharing can be barriers to ensuring that business
UMass Donahue Institute
Economic and Public Policy Research 69

owners are able to access services that are appropriate for their size, stage of development, industry,
cultural background, and neighborhood.”43
Given the significant need to expand the capacity of diverse businesses to participate, known needs for
technical assistance, and ongoing limitations of funding to support these services, it is important to
consider how sports wagering tax revenue could be directed in new ways to support small business
development services in a permanent and significant way. Recommendations include:
• Create a permanent and generous funding stream for existing small business development
training and coaching programs offered by neighborhood development corporations, chambers
of commerce, business associations, larger cities, and others.
• Ensure that funded programs reflect current needs of diverse-owned small businesses including:
business technical assistance; coaching for obtaining business certification; sector-specific
technical assistance in sectors most likely to obtain large contracts from government, large
institutions, and the private sector; low-interest loans for businesses that have the required
technical expertise but lack the capital to meet the scale required by sports wagering contracts;
and others.44
• Ensure that there is funding for regular surveys of the small business community, including
diverse small businesses, to provide ongoing assessments of needs.45
Massachusetts Gaming Commission Procedures
A final direction for recommendations has to do with ways the MGC could evolve its procedures and
processes to make participation in the industry more accessible, including facilitating the participation of
diverse-owned businesses.
Recommendation #7: Provide support for businesses to apply for SDO diverse business certification
while registering as suppliers in the gaming industry.
Stakeholders interviewed noted that there needs to be an increase in the supply of certified diverse
vendors to make it easier to engage with these companies. But for businesses to be counted as diverse,
they must first be certified by the Supplier Diversity Office. The requirements for the process make this
an involved and time-consuming process. Additionally, every non-gaming vendor wanting to work for a
Massachusetts gaming licensee must register with the MGC prior to conducting business.
According to interviews, unfortunately, both requirements present hurdles for many diverse businesses.
Both operators and the MGC have difficulties making sure that vendors get certified. According to the
MGC, “some businesses may be diverse owned but if they are not certified as such the MGC does not
receive credit for that spend. Also, businesses must be 51 percent owned in a particular category to get
43 Kerry Spitzer et.al. Supporting Diverse Small Business Owners in Boston. UMass Donahue Institute. May 2024, p 18.

44 Spitzer, et. al.
45 Statewide diverse small business surveys are regularly commissioned by Coalition for an Equitable Economy in partnership with The MassINC
Polling Group and Mass Growth Capital Corporation. The latest poll results can be found here - https://www.massincpolling.com/our-
work/small-business-owners-report-challenges-hiring-seeking-capital

the SDO Certification which can sometimes be a challenge.” According to stakeholder interviews,
operators often encourage businesses to certify as diverse if they qualify and guide them through the
process, which is lengthy and cumbersome. On top of that, the process of registering with the MGC to
do business within the industry was named as a particular obstacle for smaller businesses.
Given the challenges presented by both procedures, the MGC could evolve its process to provide better
support. The process could allow businesses to obtain technical assistance to become SDO certified and
to become registered for participation in the sports wagering industry. Offering more support could
assist in increasing the number of certified diverse suppliers available to contract with the industry.
• Create a streamlined process for businesses to obtain both SDO certification and registration to
do business in the industry.
• Facilitate the provision of technical assistance services to aid businesses who have the capacity
to obtain SDO certification as they obtain MGC registration to work within the gaming and
sports wagering industries.
• Utilize technical assistance services from the Massachusetts Supplier Diversity Office which
already provides these types of services to companies involved with the Cannabis Control
Commission, and also to Third-Party Certification Partners.
However, even with technical assistance, many diverse-owned businesses will still find the process of
becoming SDO-certified too complicated, labor-intensive, and expensive to undertake. Given the
prohibitive obstacles for many small businesses, the MGC could consider new ways to enhance access
for participation in the sports wagering industry.
Recommendation #8: Provide support for businesses to register for the SDO’s Small Business
Purchasing Program (SBPP) while registering as suppliers in the gaming industry.
To enhance marketing opportunities, The MGC could support Massachusetts small businesses to register
for the SBPP, while they register to become suppliers to the sports wagering industry. SBPP membership
could serve as an accessible entry point to better marketing for diverse-owned businesses who do not
have the capacity to become immediately SDO certified. Membership in the SBPP could become an
additional marketing tool for businesses in addition to supplier diversity certification. New businesses
interested in supplying the industry, as well as local suppliers already working with casinos, could be
invited to register for SBPP membership. The MGC could maintain a database containing all suppliers
and their various certifications and make it available to operators for marketing purposes. As a way to
encourage contracting with Massachusetts small businesses, Category 3 operators could be encouraged
to partner with companies who are SBPP members if an appropriate SDO-certified firm cannot be found.
• Encourage diverse-owned businesses that do not have the capacity to obtain SDO certification
to apply for SBPP membership while registering with the MGC.
• SBPP membership could serve as an additional entry point to expanded marketing for diverse-
owned businesses who do not have the capacity to become fully SDO certified.
• If appropriate, businesses could be encouraged and supported to work towards full SDO
certification.

Recommendation #9: Create and maintain a marketing directory to provide broader exposure for
businesses with relationships to the industry, including those that have diverse ownership.
The MGC registration process could gather information from industry suppliers to provide expanded
marketing services. Businesses who elect to participate could provide information on business
specialties, formal certifications, diverse business characteristics, and other criteria. Access to the
directory could help operators identify appropriate businesses. The process could also help the MGC
identify potential technical services needed by the applicants.
The directory could be used for marketing and solicitation of diverse vendors, whether or not they are
SDO certified. One example of this strategy in use is the City of Worcester’s Diverse Business Directory
which was developed to expand information on diverse-owned businesses, regardless of SDO
certification status.46 The business directory includes businesses which are majority-owned in one of six
diversity categories, and who elect to be listed.
Recommendation #10: Broaden diversity requirements to accept alternative types of diverse
ownership certification.
New types of supplier diversity certifications are being developed to enable the business community to
reach and purchase from certified diverse suppliers. One commonly mentioned example is Supplier
Gateway’s enhanced digital certification (EDC) service.47 Articles about this certification describe the
benefits of a faster, more affordable supplier certification process for eligible businesses.48 The MGC
could consider an alternative supplier diversity certification as an appropriate substitution for
businesses who do not have the resources or capacity to become SDO-certified. If accepted, operator
outreach efforts could be extended to EDC certified businesses in addition to SDO-certified suppliers.
EDC certified businesses could be considered to provide goods and services in instances where SDO-
certified suppliers cannot be found, including for smaller-scale spending on goods and services. In the
benchmarking towards goals, operators could, ideally, obtain credit for purchasing from suppliers with
EDC certification in addition to purchasing from SDO-certified suppliers.
• Adopt a third-party supplier diversity certification option for eligible diverse-owned businesses
who do not have the capacity to apply for SDO certification.
• Choose an alternative supplier diversity certification option with an application process that is
affordable, easy to accomplish, and can be combined with the process to register with the MGC
to do business with the industry.
• Allow operators to benchmark progress towards supplier diversity goals through purchasing
from suppliers with an alternative / EDC certification in addition to purchasing from SDO-
certified suppliers.

Appendices
Appendix A – Massachusetts Sports Wagering Diversity Key
Stakeholder Interviews
Methodology
As outlined in the research proposal’s six core tasks, Task Four involved conducting key stakeholder
interviews to understand diversity within the sports wagering industry. Specifically, during these
interviews, our research team sought to speak with industry professionals about minorities, veterans,
and women who participate in the industry as employees, vendors, and business owners and the
barriers they face.
We set up a stakeholder research group, which established the categories of people to be interviewed
and the questions that should be asked during the interviews. We determined that the team should
interview representatives from the three major casinos in Massachusetts (Category 1 licensees),
representatives from Category 3 licensees, including tethered and untethered licensees, and
representatives from the MGC. Additionally, we tried to interview representatives from diverse vendor
companies who interfaced with operators and with members of an employee representative group.
Contact information for the latter two categories proved challenging to obtain, even though we asked all
stakeholders for contact suggestions. The stakeholder research group developed an initial contact list of
potential interviewees. Subsequently, an interview guide was created including questions covering the
topics under study, an informed consent form for participants to sign before each interview, and an
outreach letter and email to be sent for initial contact.
The researchers shared these documents with the MGC Research Division for review and received
feedback and contact information for additional representatives. The research team then submitted
these documents to the University of Massachusetts Amherst Institutional Review Board to approve this
social/behavioral human subjects research protocol.49 Upon approval, the research team contacted
representatives from all the categories mentioned previously and scheduled and conducted interviews
with representatives from various organizations.
Stakeholders' responsiveness varied significantly, and some contacts had to be frequently reminded of
the request. Nonetheless, ultimately, all organizations that were invited participated in an interview or
submitted a written response. Many of the original contacts redirected us to other people. We usually
asked to speak with the person responsible for diversity programs internally (HR) and
externally (purchases), but the company essentially decided who would participate. Altogether, thirty-
six people were contacted, of which twenty-two people representing ten different organizations were
interviewed for this section, with names, organizations, and interview dates are listed below. We tried

Board, none of the materials from this process can be accessed through a FOIA request.

to use snowball sampling to interview diverse vendor companies or employee representative groups,
but this was mostly unsuccessful (the interviewees never provided the contact information).
Before conducting an interview, the interview guide and informed consent form were shared with the
participants, and all participants were required to read and sign the form before beginning an interview.
By sending the questions in advance, the researchers hoped that interviewees would be better prepared
to answer the questions with data from their organization. All but two interviews were conducted via
Zoom and lasted 45-60 minutes. The interviews were audio and video recorded, and the interviews were
automatically transcribed. The MGC representatives asked to submit written responses to the questions,
as they required various persons to provide input for different sections. All interviews and responses
were received and recorded between May and August 2024. A summary of the interviews and excerpts
from some are found in the main report.
The stakeholders who participated in the interviews were directly involved in the sports wagering
industry. Other than the MGC representatives, all interviewees were employees of operators involved in
sports wagering (licensees). Most participants were either executives or subject matter specialists.
Participation usually involved a Human Resources or Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) officer, and
the other was usually a Compliance Manager, Legal Counsel, or Communications Representative.
Executives involved with Finance, Budgeting, and Procurement also participated.

Interview Themes and Findings
The stakeholders who participated in the interviews were directly involved in the sports wagering
industry. Other than the MGC representatives, all interviewees were employees of operators involved in
sports wagering (licensees). Most of the interviews with sports wagering licensees involved two
participants. One of the two participants was usually a Human Resources or Diversity, Equity, and
Inclusion (DEI) Specialist, and the other was usually a Compliance Manager, Legal Counsel, or
Communications Representative.
Respondents noted that sports wagering is a relatively new industry in the United States, particularly in
Massachusetts, where legal operations began in 2023. Additionally, except for one operator based in
Massachusetts, it is a small industry in terms of the number of employees that work within the
Commonwealth, the number of vendors with which they contract, and the amount of money they spend
on purchases in the Commonwealth. Thus, licensees are limited in the number of diversity initiatives and
policies they can have at the employee and vendor level. In the following sections, we first address
employee diversity within the sports wagering industry and then address diversity among vendors and
other businesses that contract with sports wagering operators. Finally, we provide recommendations for
improving diversity in the sports wagering industry.

Employee Diversity
OVERVIEW
Compared with casino gambling, sports wagering does not employ many people in Massachusetts, and a
few interviewees said that sports wagering is slightly less diverse than the casino industry. For Category
1 licensees, sports wagering employees represent a small fraction of the casino workforce. Most sports
wagering occurs online, and only a few employees are needed to interact with customers directly. In the
case of tethered and untethered Category 3 licensees, most employees are based outside of
Massachusetts. Much of the workforce is in technology, sales and marketing, or customer service - all
optionally situated in Massachusetts. Some interviewees mentioned they may have several customer
service representatives within the Commonwealth.
“Massachusetts resident employees represent a very small fraction for us in terms of
[the total number of sports wagering employees].”
- Category 3 tethered licensee representative
“Our [Massachusetts] numbers aren't that large. But we do have individuals who are
Massachusetts residents who work for the company.”
- Category 3 untethered licensee representative
Some roles are outsourced to other companies, often in different countries. For example, one large
Category 3 untethered licensee had more employees in total outside the United States than female
employees in the United States. For Category 3 licensees, the exception is DraftKings, which has a large
footprint in Massachusetts, although it also has principal offices in other states. Despite their size, many
of the Category 3 licensees’ policies and approaches to diversity are similar to those of their peers based
in different states. The MGC has policies and practices related to diversity for Category 3 licensees
similar to those for Category 1 licensees, setting policies and targets on diversity within the organization.
However, these are less ambitious than the policies and targets set by the casino operators.
All interviewees mentioned that diversity is an important principle in their organizations and that they
were taking steps to increase diversity within their workforce. One Category 3 tethered interviewee said
that the customer and employee base in sports wagering has become more racially diverse but is still
predominantly male. Two Category 1 licensee representatives mentioned that they had substantially
increased women's participation in the workforce at all levels. Category 1 licensees suggested that the
proportional involvement of women, minorities, and veterans in sports wagering usually aligned with
the proportion participating in the casino business overall, which was in line with that seen in other
companies.
“If we look at our sports wagering team and compare it to the workforce as a whole,
we’re along pretty similar lines, although it is a smaller sample size.”
- Category 1 licensee representative
UMass Donahue Institute
Economic and Public Policy Research 76

“The industry is probably dominated by White males… in terms of the type of industry
that we are, and the customers and the people who engage with our products. History
has been more of White males who have dominated this workforce.”
- Category 3 untethered licensee representative
PROGRAMS, POLICIES, AND PRACTICES IN PLACE RELATED TO RECRUITMENT
The most significant effort by licensees to increase diversity in their workforce is through recruitment.
Most interviewees mentioned engaging and participating in job fairs and using search firms, recruitment
platforms, and websites (e.g., job boards) designed for specific categories of diverse applicants, such as
job fairs for African Americans, women, or veterans. Some operators host diversity recruitment job fairs
(e.g., for veterans). Interviewees from Category 1 and Category 3 licensees pointed out that they partner
with colleges and universities with a diverse student body (e.g., Historically Black Colleges and
Universities) to recruit employees from diverse backgrounds. Several interviewees mentioned that they
actively encourage people from underrepresented groups to apply, as many potential employees often
see sports wagering as a White male-dominated business. Some Category 1 licensees tried to recruit
from diverse populations in the surrounding communities by recruiting through local organizations such
as educational institutions or partnering with them to get referrals. Additionally, several interviewees
mentioned internal referral programs that encourage and compensate veterans, minorities, and female
employees for referring new employees. Some operators have ambassadors in these programs who
serve as liaisons to recruit diverse employees.
“We could probably say that the sportsbook industry mainly gets people through
referrals. And so, with the referral-based system, most people in that industry are
probably referring their friends, who are also excited about sports. So, the employee
profiles kind of match up with our patrons.”
“Sports wagering industry employees reflect the people on the other side of the counter.
Our employees reflect our guest base. We tend to have a larger population of non-
diverse bettors in our marketplace. Our female, veteran, and diverse population mirrors
the population working for us.”
- Category 1 licensee representatives
Category 1 licensees were the only group with specific policies, measurable targets, and reports to
provide accountability that they were committed to diversity in their industry. These policies and targets
are in place because of requirements placed by the MGC on casino operators, and they were
implemented throughout the organization, including the sports wagering branch. The MGC has similar
policies and targets for ethnic diversity but has no guidelines for hiring women and veterans in the
sports betting arms of the retail licensees. Even so, the fraction of female employees and veterans is
similar to that of other Category 1 licensees. Category 3 licensees, on the other hand, tended to have
less specific practices geared towards increasing diversity and generally directed us to general
UMass Donahue Institute
Economic and Public Policy Research 77

statements of intent or corporate social responsibility reports. For example, one untethered Category 3
licensee noted that the recruitment team incorporates diversity and inclusion into their digital
recruitment marketing tools, but they do not have specific guidelines. Most sports betting operators'
employee footprint in Massachusetts was small, which was used to explain the absence of policies and
targets. Representatives from the MGC mentioned requiring all sports wagering licensees to report on
diversity numbers in their quarterly reports. Still, they had no authority to compel non-casino licensees
to foster diversity initiatives.
“We changed our job descriptions, ensuring they're more neutral in language… In the
sports betting field, many people think that either I have to be a sports fanatic or I have
to be a male, and then it's betting… So we've consciously tried to change our sourcing
and hiring efforts.”
- Category 3 untethered licensee representative
INCLUSIVE IMPACT, COMPENSATION, BENEFITS, TRAJECTORY, AND TURNOVER
None of the interviewees mentioned any specific benefits or compensation explicitly offered to
employees from diverse backgrounds. Much of this was grounded in not wanting discriminatory or
preferential policies for employees based on their background. In general, the approach is to offer
benefits that may be particularly useful to certain underrepresented employees but to offer them to
everyone. For example, flexible working hours benefit women with young children. Another Category 1
licensee mentioned an English as a Second Language (ESL) training program that principally benefits
recent immigrants who are often racial minorities.
Category 1 and Category 3 licensees often had employee mentoring programs and Employee Resource
Groups (ERGs) to benefit minority employees, women, and veterans, and the MGC is also setting those
up. Mentors, usually in middle management, were asked to participate in ERGs, where they could
encourage and guide employees from underrepresented demographic groups to succeed and advance in
their careers within the organization. Mentoring and ERGs are the operators' primary mechanisms to
encourage staff retention and promote diverse employee career development.
“We are surveying and looking at the career progression of those individuals that have
gone through those programs. Are they getting promoted? Are they considering top
talent? Are they getting the stretch assignments and making sure that the investment in
these individuals is taken seriously, and the company acknowledges that these are the
individuals we're invested in?”
- Category 3 untethered licensee representative
Interviewees noted that the industry has a relatively high turnover rate, which makes career
advancement difficult. Operators are providing more benefits and flexibility to employees, using
mentoring, training programs, and support groups to encourage employees to stay in the organization
and advance within it. Representatives from the MGC also mentioned the importance of having
UMass Donahue Institute
Economic and Public Policy Research 78

mechanisms for regular employee feedback to better understand the specific challenges that diverse
employees face and devise strategies for addressing them.
The MGC and some licensee representatives noted the importance of conducting pay audits and having
transparent pay structures that would allow a team member involved in equity to see where more
significant intervention is needed and where to direct their efforts. Many interviewees remarked on the
importance of collecting data to evaluate performance, and as the MGC pointed out, that needs to be
followed by transparency in the results and a dedicated effort by a person or group of persons in the
organization to address any shortcomings.
“We've got a transparent pay policy. We identify pay ranges for different roles, so
there's no discrepancy in who's getting paid and what versus what. This allows for
equity, visibility, or knowledge of what people are getting paid and where you fall. We're
very conscious of ensuring that things are equitable and that those in underrepresented
communities are not treated differently from others.”
- Category 3 untethered licensee representative
TRAINING PROGRAMS TO PROMOTE RETENTION AND DEVELOPMENT
Training programs to increase diversity can be divided into two broad categories. On the one hand,
there are programs to promote a more inclusive environment by creating a better work culture. These
training programs are meant to reduce implicit bias, educate employees on non-discrimination, and
foster tolerance and inclusivity. The bigger licensees often require all employees to attend these short
sessions and may require managers to participate when entering that role. Most of these are one-off
events offered when employees begin working with an operator, although some licensees mentioned
that they encourage employees to take them more than once. More effort is needed to quantify these
programs' impact on employees.
“We have conscious inclusion training and general unbiased interview practices.
Conscious inclusion training is completed by all managers and above and focuses on
helping managers understand their unconscious bias and how they can move from
unconscious bias to conscious inclusion.”
- Category 3 tethered licensee representatives
The other category of training programs is professional development programs, which are meant to
benefit employees and promote their advancement within the organization. These programs are usually
open to all employees, but they may be sponsored by Employee Resource Groups (ERGs) so that the
majority of attendees are diverse members of the ERGs. In addition to the benefits of learning in the
training programs, these often provide opportunities for diverse employees to find mentors and
network within the organization. A few training programs target specific demographic groups, such as
training programs designed for veterans or leadership programs for women. In this same category of
programs are training programs geared towards diverse employees, such as the ESL programs
mentioned previously, and cross-functional training in operational areas with predominantly diverse
UMass Donahue Institute
Economic and Public Policy Research 79

employees. One example provided was training employees in the food and beverage sectors to learn
sportsbook operational skills.
One Category 1 operator mentioned that they have twelve-week programs to train emerging leaders to
move into management roles. Managers are encouraged to select diverse employees to participate in
this program. After completing those programs, they are placed in development plans to get promoted
and advance within the company. Additionally, they have leadership programs geared towards students
that provide internships and encourage them to apply for organizational roles once they graduate.
Most interviewees pointed to Employee Resource Groups (ERG) as significant programs that promote a
diverse workforce and encourage diverse employees to climb the corporate ladder. Managers were
often encouraged to mentor and guide employees from diverse backgrounds to advance within the
organization. The most common ERGs organized within sports wagering operators are those for women,
people of color, and LGBTQI+ employees. Although there are programs that are designed specifically for
veterans, there were fewer mentions of ERGs for them, and this may be due to the small fraction of the
organization's employees represented by veterans. The success of ERGs in retaining diverse employees
or promoting their advancement needs to be clarified. Although the researchers asked for contact
information for participants in ERGs, the interviewees did not provide it.
BARRIERS TO DIVERSE EMPLOYMENT
Various interviewees stated that the main barrier to diverse employment is at the recruitment stage.
Most applicants tend to be White males, possibly due to a perception that the sports betting industry
shares that demographic profile. Despite efforts to increase the recruitment of diverse employees by
using targeted strategies mentioned above (e.g., job fairs for veterans), these are only sometimes
successful as there is a relatively small pool of candidates. Despite investment in diverse job fairs, most
interviewees noted that there is still room to increase the fraction of diverse employees within their
organizations.
“We spend a lot of time and finances looking for diverse candidates. But sometimes
those arenas don’t give us results. So, we may spend $3,000 for corporate sponsorship to
be at a veteran’s job fair at Gillette Stadium, and we might only speak to four
candidates. Of the four candidates, we may only have one to pass on to someone in our
organization or team. So many folks are looking for diversity, veterans, and females, and
there aren’t enough candidates for all of us from a recruitment perspective. The other
piece is that because so many people are looking for diversity, females, and veterans, we
may have a higher turnover rate because they’re often being recruited or snatched by
other organizations.”
- Category 1 licensee representative
An additional barrier is the high turnover rate. Most diverse employees are recruited at lower-paying
entry-level positions with the highest turnover. Often, there are structural barriers that limit the
recruitment and retention of diverse employees. These include language barriers, the need for childcare
and flexible work schedules, and State requirements of no previous criminal record for MGC and
gambling employees. This last requirement entails a costly background check, which creates an
UMass Donahue Institute
Economic and Public Policy Research 80

additional financial barrier for diverse applicants. Representatives from the MGC and Category 3
licensees mentioned that many offered positions require specialized skills or degrees, such as computer
programming expertise or law degrees. The proportion of diverse applicants to those positions is smaller
than entry-level positions because the pool of diverse applicants is smaller in relative and absolute
terms. Many people also have negative associations with gambling, which may deter them from
applying to work in that industry.
“The sports wagering industry is very much technical. Those skills or roles were heavily
male-dominated for many years. And so, as with other underrepresented groups, it takes
time to find those with the aptitude and get the skills development training to get them
up to par for the positions.”
- Category 3 tethered licensee representative
“We do a lot of job fairs, and there’s a kind of stigma for the casino industry… that we
are a bad industry… a seedy industry. That there is high crime in our industry.”
- Category 1 licensee representative
Category 1 licensees are more motivated to address these barriers and increase diversity within their
workforce because they present these numbers to the MGC. Category 3 licensees, on the other hand, do
not have that statutory obligation, and their efforts to ensure greater diversity may not be as significant.
SUCCESS EXAMPLES AND RECOMMENDATIONS
As mentioned above, because they regularly report these numbers to the MGC and are compelled
through legislation to implement diversity initiatives, Category 1 licensees have been more successful at
recruiting a diverse workforce. As part of operations with intensive diversity programs, they are
meeting or exceeding some of their targets for diverse employees, which has the additional benefit of
creating a more varied pool of referrals. Some operators have succeeded in hiring and promoting more
women, partly due to having more women in managerial positions. Seeing themselves represented at
higher levels within the organization and being encouraged by female managers has increased the
proportion of women working there.
“One of the most interesting anecdotes was when we trained people to work at the
sports betting windows. We were having problems training, so we administered a test. It
was a test of the ability to take bets. It wasn't a test of sports knowledge. We found
overwhelmingly that the women scored far higher on the test, and we ended up with a
much larger percentage of women working in the sports book… and so when we opened
the sports windows, I'd say 80 percent were women.”
- Category 1 licensee representative
UMass Donahue Institute
Economic and Public Policy Research 81

“40 percent of our executive leadership team are women. This is something that is taken
very seriously in terms of driving diversity.”
- Category 3 untethered licensee representative
Various interviewees mentioned that their efforts recruiting at job fairs for women, people of color, and
veterans had yielded some success in hiring more diverse employees. Some Category 1 licensees
mentioned that by working with the surrounding communities, they have built stronger relationships,
which have motivated locals to apply for work there.
“From our external partnerships, one of the benefits is understanding best practices from
other companies and what they are doing in that DEI space. One of the things we are
very focused on with our external partners, and some of our other corporate partners, is
sharing best practices and being heavily focused on collaboration.”
- Category 3 tethered licensee representative
Category 1 licensees shared their Corporate Social Responsibility reports, which show workforce
diversity increasing over time, both overall and at the leadership level (managerial and above). Some
organizations employed roughly the same number of men and women, although this did not hold for
leadership positions. Larger and more established organizations have software and other tools to
measure the diversity of their applicant pool and workforce, which would be helpful for all sports
betting organizations.
Interviewees from Category 1 and Category 3 licensees displayed pride in Employee Resource Groups,
citing them often as one of the most important programs that supported diverse employees. ERGs
provide professional development and mentoring opportunities that benefit people from
underrepresented groups. These programs also encourage diverse employees to stay in their
organization and reduce turnover.
When asked for recommendations on increasing diversity within the sports betting industry, most
interviewees said the biggest challenge is getting diverse employees to apply to positions within these
organizations. Nonetheless, sports bettors are increasingly diverse, and there are now more women and
minorities participating, which also translates into more diverse candidates applying for positions in the
sports betting industry. From this perspective, one Category 1 interviewee mentioned that they are
focusing on new sports that may be more interesting to women or minorities, such as women’s
basketball and soccer. The idea is that with a more diverse clientele, they are more likely to have a more
varied employee applicant pool. The MGC noted that they are revising their recruitment strategy to
include diverse interview panels and candidate slates when recruiting for new positions.
“When you have a situation where 80 percent of eligible candidates are all White males,
it's easy to close the requisition and say, I have a candidate here that can serve the job.
The process might be longer in terms of making sure that we are following the diverse
slate philosophy. So, often, jobs might have to stay open longer than they would have.”

- Category 3 untethered licensee representative
Comparing the responses between Category 1 and Category 3 licensees shows that requiring licensees
to quantify their progress, implement diversity initiatives, and report these results to the MGC
effectively motivates licensees to adopt more robust and more effective programs, policies, and
practices. These programs, policies, and practices help explain why Category 1 licensees also have a
more diverse workforce. Representatives from the MGC noted that there needs to be a formal,
structured recruitment strategy and mechanisms for measuring these approaches' effectiveness. Asking
this of all licensees would increase diversity across the sports betting industry.
Vendor Diversity
OVERVIEW
Sports betting operators spend relatively little on outside vendors and usually contract with only a few
suppliers providing specialized products. Thus, there are few opportunities and not a large pool of
businesses for them to diversify their purchases. Few of these vendors are based in Massachusetts, and
only some are certified as diverse businesses. The MGC mentioned that the most plentiful diversity-
owned companies are women-owned, facilitating contracting them.
The purchasing needs of Category 1 licensees are usually only for specialized products, such as a specific
type of paper or kiosks for them to place bets. These are often sole-sourced from a single specialized
vendor. The companies that provide online betting services for these licensees are also sole-sourced,
with an exclusivity agreement for a given casino. Many casino vendors are diverse businesses, but these
contracts are not specifically for sports wagering.
“On the vendor side, in sports wagering, there's not a ton that we spend operationally.
It's office supplies, toner, and things like that. There's not a lot of opportunity for diverse
spend in the sports wagering area.”
- Category 1 licensee representative
Category 3 licensees also have very limited suppliers, and their needs are also highly specialized.
Some of these include technological infrastructure for hosting sports betting applications or
processing payments. Since sports betting is relatively new in the United States, especially
compared with Europe, interviewees said that foreign companies provided some services.
One area where Category 1 and Category 3 licensees suggested there was room to increase
diversity is when contracting with advertising and marketing businesses. These do not need to
be as specialized as other gambling procurements, and there are many vendors who provide
these services. Operators have more choices, including diverse vendors. Thus, they present an
opportunity to contract with certified diverse businesses. This may also present an opportunity
for licensees to contract with Massachusetts-based companies.
UMass Donahue Institute
Economic and Public Policy Research 83

“The only opportunity for discretionary spending would be office supplies and
marketing… That would be the biggest opportunity.”
- Category 1 licensee representative
PROGRAMS, POLICIES, AND PRACTICES IN PLACE RELATED TO SOLICITATION AND CONTRACTING
Across the board, Category 1 and 3 licensees emphasized that vendor spending was generally limited to
a few specialized companies and that there wasn’t much opportunity to diversify their spending on
diverse businesses.
“The only vendor specific to sports wagering is a single supplier that supplies paper for
the sports wagering kiosks. When we opened up sports wagering in 2023, we didn’t
know how many paper kiosk rolls we would need. We have about five years of
inventory.”
- Category 1 licensee representative
Category 3 licensees, in particular, mentioned that they usually don’t have specific programs or policies
for soliciting and contracting with diverse companies. Category 1 licensees, on the other hand, despite
the small size of their sports betting spending, have agreements with the MGC that date to the licenses
given to operate a casino in Massachusetts. These agreements about diversity are understood to extend
to sports betting and were renewed recently. The agreements include plans that the Category 1
licensees submit to the MGC and are publicly available on the MGC website.50 The plans include goals
and targets for engaging with minority, women, and veteran-owned businesses. They also designate
teams to address diversity in procurement and hiring in their organizations.
Operators often post statements committing to diversity on their websites and train employees who
deal with procurement on the importance of diversity. Some interviewees mentioned a written
commitment by procurement teams to seek diversity-certified businesses and that these teams also
help guide companies to certify as diverse-owned if needed. Massachusetts has a Supplier Diversity
Office, which has helped organizations find and contract diverse vendors and sets benchmarks that
organizations can try to meet. The parent companies of Category 1 licensees usually have programs to
increase supplier diversity led by a strategy team that engages with diverse trade organizations (e.g., the
National Veteran-Owned Business Association). They actively seek diverse businesses through these
chambers of commerce and other business associations.
PROGRAMS TO INCREASE LEVELS OF ENGAGEMENT, VOLUME, AND SCALE
Even though sports betting operators spend small amounts on diverse vendors, interviewees
demonstrated a genuine interest in fostering their relationships with diverse vendors. Operators often
50 Diversity plans can be found on the following page: https://massgaming.com/about/diversity/
UMass Donahue Institute
Economic and Public Policy Research 84

encouraged businesses to certify as diverse if they qualified and would guide them through the process,
which can be lengthy and cumbersome.
“We work with many diverse businesses that may not have received their certification
for one reason or another, and so we are very active in pushing them through the
process or the resources to get it. We're also developing some additional programs that
will help support that.”
- Category 3 tethered licensee representative
The parent companies of Category 1 licensees often have policies explicitly considering diverse
companies when they need a supplier. One interviewee mentioned that the procurement team is
outstanding about contacting diverse suppliers when needed and considering diversity spending first.
Nonetheless, the same interviewee noted that finding a replacement can be challenging when they lose
a diverse supplier.
A Category 1 licensee representative mentioned that they often encourage diverse vendors to scale up,
as the casinos frequently require suppliers who can provide products on a large scale. Nonetheless, this
was usually challenging for smaller companies, as expansion requires a significant capital investment.
Licensees contract with diverse vendors for minor needs but rely on big, established companies for
large, specialized purchases. The MGC noted that they have diversity benchmarks for large
procurements and are also adapting those for smaller procurements. Even small procurements require
Supplier Diversity Plans in public vendor bid proposal postings.
BARRIERS TO CONTRACTING DIVERSE VENDORS
The primary barrier to contracting diverse vendors is the limited number of significant purchases, which
are usually specialized and sole-sourced. Category 1 licensees often encounter this situation, requiring
only a few specialty products, such as paper or kiosk manufacturers. Category 3 licensees have larger
contracts with vendors, but these are usually specialized products, such as digital infrastructure or
payment support, provided by few, large, and specialized companies. Some vendors are not based in the
United States and do not qualify as diverse companies. The MGC mentioned that it was particularly
challenging to engage with veteran-owned businesses because very few of them provided the services
they regularly used (research and legal services).
“[We can only do business] if diverse vendors can do the type of work we need.
Otherwise, we won't be switching the vendors we have.”
- Category 3 untethered licensee representative
Very few companies are diverse-owned and provide the specialty products and services the sports
betting industry needs. Thus, it is not easy to find and engage in business with diverse companies, and it
is challenging to replace a diverse company if it loses its contract.
UMass Donahue Institute
Economic and Public Policy Research 85

“When we started, we had a veteran-owned vendor, and they were fantastic. Then, they
were purchased by a larger company with a national presence, and now they are no
longer a diverse-owned business. That’s happened three or four times now with some of
our main suppliers.”
- Category 1 licensee representative
Many interviewees mentioned an additional barrier: the cumbersome process of certifying as a diverse-
owned company in Massachusetts. Although they try to encourage, guide, and help some companies
through the process, some vendors do not find it worthwhile and do not undergo certification, even
after efforts to convince them. Additionally, Category 1 licensees require all companies to register with
the MGC as suppliers. This process is also a burden; some diverse vendors would rather not engage and
avoid contracts with casino-based operators.
“Certification can be challenging. It can take a lot of resources that suppliers may not
have available to them or understand how to navigate that process. We also see
challenges with suppliers being able to scale up. They may be able to offer us a product
or service for the sports wagering piece of our business in Massachusetts. Still, they can't
offer that service to the entire sports wagering business… they have a product or service
they can offer us in one location, but they can't scale across the company.”
- Category 3 tethered licensee representative
SUCCESS EXAMPLES AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Most operators generally state that contracting with diverse vendors has had a minimal impact because
this amounts to a tiny fraction of their overall spending. Nonetheless, there does seem to be great
potential for an increase—at least for Category 3 licensees. One licensee mentioned that although less
than 1 percent of their spending in the United States went to diverse businesses, that still amounted to
millions of dollars spent on over one hundred companies in one year. Other Category 3 licensees could
have at least comparable spending levels, which may provide opportunities to increase the proportion
of expenditures that goes to diverse companies. Further, only half of those companies were officially
certified as diverse, which suggests that this fraction could also increase if there were incentives for
companies to do so. One tethered Category 3 licensee representative said that for the parent company
(which includes many land-based casinos), 12 percent of purchases were from diverse suppliers, which
suggests that Category 1 licensees may be able to meet higher targets.
The parent companies of Category 1 licensees often have large company-wide programs to increase
their diversity spending, which have been successful. For example, one company had a 70 percent
increase in companywide diverse expenditure in three years. Tracking diverse spending is a relatively
recent phenomenon that drives increased spending on diverse vendors. A couple of licensees from
different categories mentioned having recently updated or planning on updating their tools for tracking
diverse suppliers.
UMass Donahue Institute
Economic and Public Policy Research 86

Licensee representatives said purchasing from diverse companies had helped foster mutually beneficial
relationships. For Category 1 licensees, these relationships helped create rapport with the surrounding
communities and encouraged other parts of the parent organization to engage with these vendors.
Diversity is becoming increasingly important for bigger corporations, and there is a push to increase
diversity on all levels.
“On a national level, diversity is becoming more of a mindset. And it’s been pushed down
across all avenues over the past four or five years.”
- Category 1 licensee representative
One area where licensee representatives suggested that there might be an opening to contract diverse
vendors is marketing and advertising. Some interviewees indicated that there may be increased interest
in this space, including from certified diverse-owned companies. Moreover, there may be an
opportunity to encourage companies to contract with local vendors within the Commonwealth. Another
interviewee mentioned that Massachusetts often has diverse vendors for office supplies and software
resellers. One Category 3 licensee representative suggested that requiring procurement processes to
have targets for diverse spending would help increase the volume and scale of business with diverse-
owned vendors.
Category 1 licensee representatives noted that one way to increase purchases from diverse vendors is to
lower the barriers for them to register as such and to register with the MGC. This latter process, in
particular, can be an obstacle for smaller businesses. Interviewees noted that there needs to be an
increase in the supply of diverse vendors to make it easier to engage with these companies.
Conclusions and Recommendations
As with the rest of the country, there has been a renewed focus on increasing diversity since 2020, when
national protests increased discussions around this topic. Various operators from different categories
have all increased their efforts to expand diversity in their workforce and have been successful to
varying degrees. Category 1 licensees have been especially effective, as they were able to build upon
their uniquely intensive diversity programs, which have been in place since casinos were legally allowed
to operate in Massachusetts. Interviewees and a review of the documents shared suggest that the most
significant gains have been with women, who are participating in increasing numbers in gambling and
the sports betting industry. There have been gains with other minority groups and veterans, but these
have been smaller.
Interviewees noted that having a more diverse workforce helped promote more varied perspectives and
innovation within their organizations. One interviewee mentioned that fostering diversity and inclusion
has increased employee engagement and morale. Doing business with diverse-owned vendors was also
a valuable way for operators to engage with the local community, particularly for Category 1 licensees.
Additionally, diverse-owned vendors could provide variety to specific sectors, such as food and
beverages.
UMass Donahue Institute
Economic and Public Policy Research 87

Many of the interviewees emphasized that diversity was an essential pillar in their organizations and
that they actively tried to recruit a more diverse workforce. A few interviewees noted that declaring a
commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion and assigning one or more employees to specifically
address that within an organization was a signal to other industries and the public at large that this is an
important matter, and this has led to positive change within institutions and the industry.
Representatives from the MGC mentioned that creating a foundational work culture that supports DEI
initiatives is the most critical step to enhancing these goals within their organization.
Most diversity commitments by Category 3 licensees are limited to statements of purpose and do not
include actual policies with targets and measurable goals. The strategies were often limited to
participating in diversity job fairs, posting on websites targeting underrepresented demographic groups,
or supporting Employee Resource Groups (ERG). Evaluating how successful these strategies have been
beyond anecdotal accounts is a challenge. Establishing and standardizing metrics that assess these
approaches' benefits is necessary. Asking operators to provide targets, progress reports, and diversity
initiatives, as with land-based casinos, may help ensure that sports betting operators implement
effective strategies to increase diversity.
On the vendor side, Category 1 licensees had more robust programs and policies to increase purchases
from diverse-owned businesses. These include plans, reports, goals, and targets they present to the
MGC regularly. Category 3 licensees, lacking such comprehensive requirements, had fewer explicit
policies and generally could not point to specific targets. Only two tethered Category 3 licensees
provided us with documents about their institution’s diversity policies and programs. At best, they
pointed us to one or two sentences on their website regarding a commitment to diversity. Untethered
Category 3 licensees had little impetus to demonstrate a commitment to diversity in Massachusetts. The
MGC’s requirement that all procurements, big or small, follow a Supplier Diversity Plan would go a long
way in ensuring that licensees are making committed efforts to purchasing from diverse-owned
businesses. All organizations, including the MGC, would benefit from having digital tools to measure
diversity in their workforce and suppliers and to evaluate the success of strategies used to increase
diversity.
Policies to increase diversity will only be implemented if the MGC can influence operators. In a few
instances, repeated prodding over various months, directly by the MGC, was necessary to obtain
responses to requests from some licensees. Reluctant compliance may occur because there are no
consequences for non-cooperation. Given that this was a low-stakes request for operators to implement
diversity initiatives, it may be necessary for the MGC to sanction non-compliance if more extensive
changes are requested. Nevertheless, representatives from the MGC noted that they have a minimal
role in regulating the sports betting industry compared to their regulation of casino operations, and this
was due to an absence of legislation mandating operators to meet targets or implement diversity
initiatives.

Appendix C – Regulatory Agency—Massachusetts Gaming
Commission—Findings, Policies and Practices
We are separating the reporting on some MGC findings from the sports wagering licensee analysis
because as a government regulator it is very different from the gambling industry sectors and the
comparison industries which can be used to assess participation levels in those sectors.
Participation
EMPLOYMENT DIVERSITY
A comparison industry that can be used to assess MGC employment diversity is the sector measuring
government agencies called Public Administration. Reflecting its official diversity goal of achieving 25
percent ethnic diversity, the MGC workforce has a slightly higher proportion of racial and ethnic
minority workers than the U.S.-level Public Administration workforce (25.7% versus 22.0%). At the same
time, the Commission has a lower proportion of female workers (45% versus 55%) than the U.S. Public
Administration sector overall.
MGC employment diversity data can also be compared with Massachusetts population benchmarks, a
practice adopted by the MGC to establish a target proportion for diverse employees. Detailed ethnic and
racial diversity data show that the MGC has a slightly higher percentage of Asians (9.0% vs. 6.9%) and
Blacks (8.0% vs. 7.3%) compared to the state, but a lower percentage of Hispanics (2.0% vs. 4.6%). The
White population is similar (74.2% in the Commission vs. 74.54% statewide). Gender data show that the
MGC has a higher proportion of men (55.0%) compared to the state (48.8%) and a lower proportion of
women (45.0% vs. 51.2%). Veteran status data show that the MGC has a lower percentage of veterans
(2.0%) compared to the state (4.3%).

Diversity Policies and Programs
Related to efforts to increase workforce diversity and supplier diversity at the MGC, we looked at
employment policies to increase recruitment and retainment among employees along with efforts to
identify and increase engagement among vendors. Due to the differences between the MGC and sports
wagering operators, we kept this analysis separate from the discussion in Appendix D. As itemized in the
table below, the MGC has programs in place to cover each of the RFR’s areas of interest and has plans to
significantly increase their employment diversity efforts through hiring a dedicated individual to focus
on that area.

Appendix D – Sports Wagering Operators Policies and Practices to
Increase Diversity
This appendix provides additional detail on the types of policies and programs in use among
Massachusetts sports wagering license holders. A questionnaire sent to all licensees allowed us to
determine the extent to which sports wagering license holders maintain policies and programs to
increase contracting with diverse business enterprises and employment diversity.
The questionnaire, written interviews, and key informant interviews allowed us to gather more specific
examples of the types of activities in use.
Supplier Diversity
Related to supplier diversity, we looked for information on programs and policies in two areas:
organizational policies and practices in place related to solicitation of and contracting with minority,
women, and veteran business enterprises in the Commonwealth; and programs to increase levels of
engagement, volume, and scale with minority, women, and veteran business enterprises.
As discussed above, we found that license holders universally practice at least one program in each of
the two areas. The following table provides specific examples of supplier diversity programs within each
type, policies or practices related to spending on contracting with diverse vendors, and programs to
increase levels of engagement, volume, and scale:

Employment Diversity
Related to workforce diversity, the RFR asked for information on programs and policies in three areas:
recruitment and retention of a diverse workforce; programs to promote inclusivity related to
employment impact, compensation, benefits, trajectory, and turnover for women, minority, and veteran
employees; and training and education to promote retention and professional development. Because
inclusive impact programs overlap significantly with both policies for recruitment and policies for
retention, we did not provide a table for that category. Instead, they are included in both tables.

Appendix F – Massachusetts Supplier Diversity Program - Background
The primary responsibility of the Massachusetts Supplier Diversity Office (SDO) is to certify diverse and
small businesses at the state level which enables them to participate in certain procurements for goods
and services or non-federally funded construction procurements. The SDO manages several programs
through which it works to build a more inclusive supplier base:
o State Certification Program
o Supplier Diversity Program (SDP)
o Small Business Purchasing Program (SBPP)
o Commonwealth and Municipal Construction Affirmative Marketing Programs (MCAMP)
o Individuals with Disabilities in State Procurement and Contracting Program
According to their annual report, in FY2023, the SDO expanded its mission statement to more
intentionally promote diversity, equity and inclusion in state contracting by certifying diverse and small
Massachusetts-based businesses; connecting these companies with business opportunities and
resources to enhance their marketability; and collaborating with government agencies and public
organizations to identify and remove barriers and increase diverse and small business spending.53
State Certification Program:
The mechanism for becoming certified to obtain contracts as minority business enterprises (MBE),
woman business enterprises (WBE), or veteran business enterprises (VBE) is certification through the
SDO’s State Certification Program.
• Firms are certified and decertified weekly. In FY2023 there were 5,669 certified diverse firms
available to do business with the Commonwealth and its prime contractors, a 25 percent
increase over FY2022. This total includes the 7 types of diverse businesses certified by the SDO
as well as 8 types of Third-Party Certified Businesses. Much of the growth in SDO program
businesses was due to growth in the numbers of third party-certified businesses.
• At the end of FY2023 there was a total of 3,796 SDO-certified businesses (3,549 for-profit and
162 nonprofit firms), some of which are both minority- and women-owned/controlled (M/WBE
and M/W/NPO).
• The state certification unit accepts applications, conducts investigations and site visits, and
issues certifications for diverse businesses.
• Third-party certifications are recognized and accepted such as:
o VBE and SDVOBE certified by VetBiz/U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs
o SDVOBE and DOBE certifications issues by Disability: IN
o LGBTBE certifications issues by National LGBT Chamber of Commerce

The Supplier Diversity Program
The Supplier Diversity Program (SDP) promotes equity of opportunity in state government by extending
to a variety of supplier diversity groups the prospect of full participation in all areas of state
procurement by all Agencies. Executive order 565 affirmed expanded spending goals for Massachusetts-
based small businesses, as well as for Minority Business Enterprises, Women Business Enterprises, and
Veteran Business Enterprises. The executive order further committed to coordinated capacity
development for certified businesses across the state. The SDO, Office of Access and Opportunity
(“OAO”) and the Executive Office for Housing and Economic Development in coordination were directed
to:
• Make available to all categories of certified businesses under the Executive Order capacity
development programming and coordinate and expand statewide capacity building efforts.
• Collaborate with partners and entities in the public and private sector to adopt best practices for
capacity building; and
• Leverage the state’s rigorous certification process and convene public and private entities…to
expand and promote opportunities for all certified entities to compete for business throughout
the Commonwealth.
The program institutes policies to encourage participating organizations and their contractors to use
SDO-certified MBEs, WBEs, VBEs, SDVOBEs, DOBEs, and LGBTBEs in their contracts for goods and
services. In 2023, seventy-three organizations participated in the SDP, falling into three groups:
• Executive branch departments in all secretariats;
• Non-executive departments and constitutional offices (for example, Office of the Governor, the
Massachusetts Gaming Commission, the Commission Against Discrimination, and the Disabled
Persons Protection Commission); and
UMass Donahue Institute
Economic and Public Policy Research 109

• Quasi-public entities (for example, the Massachusetts Convention Center Authority and the
Massachusetts Housing Finance Agency).
Only executive departments are required to participate in the SDO’s procurement programs to
encourage contracting with diverse and small businesses through the SDP and SBPP: “Agencies must
continue their commitment to achieve best value for the Commonwealth by working to promote
diversity in the Commonwealth’s supply chain.”54
The SDO sets annual benchmark goals expressed as a percentage of each organization’s discretionary
budget (MBE 8%; WBE 14%; VBE/SDVOBE 3%).55 The SDP applies to all executive department
procurements for goods and services exceeding $150,000. Full participants accept and track the
benchmark goals, and report in a consistent manner. Some non-executive departments and quasi-public
organizations participate in the SDP only and do so voluntarily.
According to the latest SDO report, seven quasi-public organizations fully participate in the SDP with
goal setting, tracking, and reporting consistent with procedures used by executive branch departments:
• Office of the Governor
• Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination
• Disabled Persons Protection Commission
• Massachusetts Convention Center Authority (MCCA)
• Massachusetts Gaming Commission
• Massachusetts Housing Finance Agency (MassHousing)
• Cannabis Control Commission
Participating organizations may use two types of spending to achieve program spending goals:
• Direct spending with MBE, WBE, VBE, SDVOBE, DOBE, and LGBTBE prime contractors; and
• Indirect spending resulting from business partnerships between the organizations’ contractors
and MBE, WBE, VBE, SDVOBE, DOBE, or LGBTBE vendors used in the contractors’ operations.
This includes subcontracting, as well as other types of business-to-business relationships.
Indirect spending can be further subdivided into the following types:
• Subcontracting, defined as a partnership in which the SDP partner is involved in the provision of
products and/or services to the Commonwealth. Such relationships typically, but not always,
involve a formal written agreement between the SDP partner and the prime contractor.

2015.
https://www.mass.gov/executive-orders/no-565-reaffirming-and-expanding-the-massachusetts-supplier-diversity-program
55 Non-discretionary spending includes pension and insurance-related expenditures, payments of grants and subsidies, entitlement programs,
and loans and special payments.
UMass Donahue Institute
Economic and Public Policy Research 110

• Ancillary Products and Services, defined as a business relationship in which the SDP partner
provides the prime contractor products or services that are not directly related to the prime
contractor’s contract with the Commonwealth. In most cases, this type of partnership is related
to the prime contractor’s general business operations and may or may not involve a formal
written agreement with the SDP partner. It is also recognized that, in some cases, products
and/or services provided by the SDP partner may contribute to both subcontracting (when used
by the Commonwealth) and ancillary (when used by other customers) spending.
Eleven additional quasi-public and non-executive organizations submit narrative program reports for
inclusion in the SDO’s annual report:
• Commonwealth Corporation
• Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA)
• Massachusetts Growth Capital Corporation (MGCC)
• Massachusetts Water Resources Authority (MWRA)
• Massachusetts School Building Authority (MSBA)
• Massachusetts State College Building Authority (MSCBA)
• MassDevelopment
• Massport
• Office of the Inspector General
• UMass Building Authority (UMBA)
• University of Massachusetts (UMass)
The FY2023 SBO annual report shows that these quasi-public and non-executive organizations have
adopted a variety of strategies to increase contracting and spending with diverse businesses. They have
developed their own supplier diversity programs for contracting, including establishing their own
internal commitment levels and creating their own best practices and strategies to enhance contracting
with MBE’s, WBE’s, VBE’s and others.56

Category 3
Sports Betting Impacts - Online/Mobile
Operators
Welcome!
Sports betting has been expanding across many U.S. states. Our team at the UMass Donahue Institute
(UMDI) leads the Massachusetts Gaming Commission (MGC) research agenda aimed at understanding
the social and economic impacts of gambling in Massachusetts. Our current research projects include a
study of the early impacts of sports wagering and a study examining diversity within the industry.
We are using this questionnaire to gather data to answer research questions in studies for the MGC. The
answers will help us gain a better understanding of what moving into a new state means for Category 3
sports betting licensees. We want to understand how (if at all) your organization increases your
economic activity (new hiring or spending) in the course of doing business in a new state. In addition to
these economic questions, we also want to get a general idea of your business' approach to diversity in
hiring and in spending on outside firms. We plan to report the data in the most aggregated way possible
which still allows us to answer the required research questions. We will report observed trends in
responses (e.g. “X percent of operators indicated”). Results may be reported using categories such as ‘all
mobile operators,’ ‘in-state headquarters,’ ‘out-of-state headquarters,’ etc. Operators will also have the
opportunity to review our work prior to its release and provide feedback.
We ask that you answer these questions to the best of your ability, consulting with other staff if
necessary. The survey should take between 10 and 20 minutes to complete.
If you have any questions, please reach out to Tom Peake <tpeake@donahue.umass.edu>
Thank you for your time. We appreciate your help!
