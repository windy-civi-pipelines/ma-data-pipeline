Justice Reinvestment Policy Oversight Board June 2025

Section 2:
1. Introduction
The Justice Reinvestment Policy Oversight Board (the “Board”) was created in April 2018 with the
passage into law of Chapter 69 of the Acts of 2018, “An Act Relative to Criminal Justice Reform.” The
Board, chaired by the Secretary of the Executive Office of Technology Services and Security (EOTSS) and
comprised of a broad spectrum of criminal justice agency heads and stakeholders inside and outside of
state government, is charged with monitoring the development and implementation of justice
reinvestment policies relative to the collection, standardization, and public availability of data to ensure
they achieve anticipated goals.
The legislation requires that the Board file a report with the clerks of the Massachusetts House of
Representatives and the Senate annually by July 1 that reviews the compliance of the criminal justice
agencies and the Trial Court, including the Probation Service, the Parole Board, the Executive Office of
Public Safety and Security (EOPSS), the Department of Correction, houses of correction, and county jails,
with:

Section 3:
1. Collecting and submitting to EOPSS data required by section 18 ¾ of chapter 6A of the
Massachusetts General Laws in the form of a cross-agency tracking system that uses a
unique state identification number assigned to each person who enters the criminal justice
system;

Section 4:
2. Making said data available to the public through the use of an application programming
interface (API), as required by paragraph 12 of section 18 ¾;

Section 5:
3. Establishing data collection and reporting standards relative to recidivism rates for re-
arraignment, reconviction, and reincarceration; and

Section 6:
4. Establishing data collection and reporting standards to standardize the methods of
reporting race and ethnicity data to facilitate assessment of the racial and ethnic
composition of the criminal justice population.
This is the Board’s seventh annual report and will address the progress made to-date towards
compliance with M.G.L. c. 6A, § 18 ¾.
The Board convened three times in FY 2025 and continued its work to research, describe, and identify
the current landscape with respect to data collection and reporting across criminal justice agencies
pursuant to M.G.L. c. 6A, § 18 ¾. The Board’s purpose is to aid the agencies and offices subject to
M.G.L. c. 6A, § 18 ¾ with furthering their efforts toward statutory compliance.
The following sections present the Board’s findings in each of the four areas listed above. The final

Section 7:
section presents recommendations and additional considerations raised by the Board.

Section 8:
2. Cross-Tracking Data Collection System
M.G.L. Chapter 6A, section 18 ¾ (the “statute”), Paragraph (12)(i), mandates the collection of at least
seventeen (17) distinct categories of data by criminal justice agencies and the Trial Court, including but
not necessarily limited to: (1) a unique statewide identification number assigned to each person who
enters the criminal justice system; (2) the offense for which the person has been incarcerated; (3-4) the
date and time of the offense; (5) the location of the offense; (6-9) the race, ethnicity, gender, and age of
the person; (10) whether the person is the primary caretaker of a child; (11) the status of the person’s
reproductive health needs; (12-13) risk and needs assessment scores; (14- 15) participation in and
completion of evidence-based programs; and (16-17) entry and exit/release dates from a jail or house
of correction.
Under the definition of “criminal justice agencies” adopted in 501 CMR 18.00: Data Collection and
Reporting Standards for Criminal Justice Agencies, EOPSS’s goals for the platform are to ultimately
ingest data from the custodial agencies—DOC and Massachusetts Sheriffs—and the Trial Court, as well
as the Massachusetts Probation Service, Massachusetts Parole Board, Massachusetts State Police, the
Commonwealth’s 350+ local police departments, the Offices of the District Attorneys and the Attorney
General’s Office.
The below accomplishments demonstrate an evolution of the cross-tracking system. Since 2021, cross-tracking
has not only expanded to include more data sets and more agency ingestion, but also expanded to include more
real time data that is continuously refreshed with up-to-date information. In June 2022, the platform displayed
data from the Department of Correction (DOC) and the Massachusetts Sheriffs that hold incarcerated individuals
within the Houses of Correction (HOCs) and county jails from 2017 to 2022. In Fiscal Year 2023 (FY23), new data
from the Trial Court, Probation Service, and Parole Board was ingested into the platform and those ingestion jobs
were automated, refreshing with new data weekly. In FY24, additional data from the DOC, HOCs, and the Trial
Court was ingested into the platform including programs data, recidivism data, and charges and convictions data.
Fiscal Year 2024 also saw the creation of a pilot law enforcement program. In FY25, the Programs and Recidivism
dashboards were refreshed to include current data, and a risk and needs assessments dashboard was created
with initial data from Parole, DOC, and Probation. Additionally, an API (Application Programming Interface), as
required by the statute, was published with data from the custodial cohort. In FY25, Parole’s record management
system, the State Parole Integrated Records and Information Tracking (Spirit II) was fully integrated with the
OneIII system, which generates State Identification Numbers.
The program has achieved the following key statutory milestones:

Due to the maturity of Cross-Tracking and to ensure coordination, improve efficiency and track the progress of
the data collection system implementation, EOPSS replaced the Executive Governance Council (EGC) with the
Data Governance Council (DGC). EOPSS and its stakeholders chose to replace the EGC with the established DGC
as both councils were comprised of the same stakeholder representatives and the DGC was a better
3
Justice Reinvestment Policy Oversight Board June 2025
representation of cross-tracking as a program that will continue and evolve, rather than a project with an end
date.
Comprised of key stakeholders and subject matter experts, the DGC is a forum for data experts and workstream
leads to discuss their efforts, identify any roadblocks, collaborate on solutions, and seek guidance and
clarification. The DGC addresses identified roadblocks with data standardization that affect the platform as a
whole and agencies generally. It is tasked with providing clarification and feedback to ensure the program is
running smoothly and efficiently. Further, the DGC is intended to enhance the collaboration between all agencies
and entities that support the technical components of the platform and meets to discuss specific data questions
that may arise and work together to achieve resolution and consistency across the different agencies.
During Fiscal Year 2024, EOPSS created the law enforcement pilot program comprised of three (3) local law
enforcement agencies and the Massachusetts State Police (MSP). The main goal of the pilot program is to
understand law enforcement data in the individual record management systems (RMS) and how that data can be
ingested into the cross-tracking system. This required reviewing additional systems that included the LiveScan,
which is used by law enforcement agencies to take fingerprints, and the Electronic Application for Criminal
Complaints (EACC), which is used by law enforcement to transmit data to the Trial Court.
Fiscal Year 2025 saw the publication of the Application Programming Interface (API) which will serve as a
platform for standardizing data sets and presentation across cohorts, enabling research across populations.
EOPSS also completed the Spirit II integration project with the OneIll system, and ensured that LiveScan
machines were made operational at all law enforcement agencies with integration updates completed.
Additionally, efforts were made to expand upon the work completed with the law enforcement pilot program
including updating the Law Enforcement Data Collection Model Policy and Procedures along with compiling and
preparing the relevant data for corresponding dashboards once the EACC and LiveScan updates are completed.
In the next fiscal year, the cross-tracking program will focus on:
• Developing an anonymized, linked dataset at an individual level for public consumption
• Expanding the program’s Application Programming Interface (API) with new cohorts
o Publishing the Admission and Release cohort
• Updating the Risks and Needs Assessment Dashboards with Sheriff Office data
• Publishing the Primary Caretaker and Reproductive Needs Dashboard
• Publishing local Law Enforcement Agency Dashboards
The cross-tracking platform is built to grow and ingest more criminal justice agency data. EOPSS will continue
updating previously released dashboards with up-to-date information and publish new public-facing data
dashboards and application programming interfaces in Fiscal Year 2026 to ingest more cross tracking data into
the platform. The public-facing State and County Correctional Populations and Admissions and Release
dashboards will continue to be refreshed in weekly intervals, while other public dashboards will have yearly
updates.
Statewide Unique Identification Number
Paragraph (12)(ii) of the statute further mandates that data shall be collected in the form of a cross-
tracking system that tracks individuals through a unique, fingerprint-supported, statewide identification
number (SID).
There remain technical and statutory challenges with the adoption of the SID across constituent agencies. To
summarize, some agencies’ record management systems (RMS) were not configured to communicate with the
Massachusetts State Police OneIII system through which SIDs are generated and stored, and fingerprinting is not
mandated in Massachusetts for all offenses. Additionally, updates to the Electronic Application for Criminal
Complaints (EACC), which is used by law enforcement to transmit data to the Trial Court have contributed to the
delays in achieving full compliance with collection and transmission of SIDs. Although the EACC does not
generate or store SIDs, these system updates and enhancements are imperative in ensuring good, reliable data
across the Commonwealth and also in ensuring different agency systems are communicating and
receiving/sending information correctly and smoothly. In an effort to upgrade their systems all at once for both
EACC and OneIII integration, many departments are waiting until EACC upgrades are finalized.
While departments await the EACC update to begin RMS upgrades, since the last report, EOPSS has completed
updates to Parole’s RMS, Spirit II, to allow for integration with OneIll, representing a major operational
milestone. Now, SIDs are automatically generated into Parole’s RMS from OneIII. Additionally, the MassCourts
system has completed SID integration.

Section 24:
3. Public Availability of Data
Paragraph 12(ii) of the statute requires that anonymized, cross-agency data be made available to the public for
analysis through an application programming interface (API) which allows access to all electronically available
records.
In the last year, EOPSS has made progress on publicly-available data through the launch of the Risk and Needs
Assessment dashboards in December 2024, and published the API for data concerning the custodial cohort. Work
this year across the custodial agencies will continue to focus on further API publication, including the Recidivism
cohort and the Admission and Release cohort APIs.
A first phase of dashboards, released in August 2022, shows the supervised populations of the DOC and
Massachusetts Sheriffs by Pre-Trial and Sentenced status. Data is available by key demographics, including race,
ethnicity, gender, and age. Importantly, these dashboards are designed to meet the statute’s requirements for
race and ethnicity reporting, discussed in more detail in section 5 below. A second phase of dashboards, released
in March 2023, reports on admissions and releases from these same institutions over time and by reason for
release. A third phase released in June 2023, meets the statute’s requirements for recidivism reporting and is
discussed in more detail in section 4. In November 2023, EOPSS released another public dashboard consisting of
programs reporting information from custodial institutions. The Commonwealth has a rich display of offender
programming information across all of its custodial agencies; program data is often limited to state agencies and
is usually only available at the general program category level. In March 2024, EOPSS released another public
dashboard reporting on Charges and Convictions data for sentenced individuals. This dashboard displays
aggregated and organized information on charges and convictions, combining data from many different state
agencies. This required a lengthy, detailed review to match the data across the agency systems. In 2024, EOPSS
released similar dashboards on risk and needs assessments for the Parole, Probation and DOC populations.
Additionally, major statutory annual updates to public data dashboards were made on recidivism and programs.
In January 2025, EOPSS published the API with the first cohort containing custodial data which includes
populations, charges and convictions, and programs. With this, users can access anonymized criminal justice data
with the ability to apply filters and select desired metrics across the Cross-Tracking dashboards. API cohorts for
recidivism and admissions and releases are expected in early FY26 and EOPSS expects the fully anonymized
integration to be completed in 2025. This integration will apply the API to all published Cross-Tracking
dashboards creating cohorts for all publicly available Cross-Tracking information. The API promotes the
transparency of the criminal justice system, informs the public, policy makers and researchers about the criminal
justice system, allows for monitoring and accountability of the system, and furthers the ability to identify trends
5
Justice Reinvestment Policy Oversight Board June 2025
and issues that will inform the development of effective public policy. Using the API allows users to customize
data extracts that span the dashboards. The integration of final anonymized data cohorts with the API is ongoing
to ensure that the trajectory shown for an individual through the API cannot be used to reveal the identity of an
individual. All of these dashboards allow users to filter by demographics, institution, year, etc. and allow for the
public to download data sets for their own review and study to deepen their understanding of the
Commonwealth criminal justice system.
All available dashboards are published on mass.gov: Commonwealth of Massachusetts | Criminal Justice Cross-
Tracking System | Mass.gov

Section 25:
4. Collection and Reporting Standards for Recidivism
Paragraph (13) of the statute requires the Secretary of Public Safety to establish data collection and reporting
standards for criminal justice agencies and Trial Court relative to recidivism rates for re-arraignment,
reconviction, and reincarceration with data tracked over 1, 2, and 3-year periods. Recidivism rates must be
tracked by race, ethnicity, gender, and age and reported annually to the Secretary of Public Safety.
6
Justice Reinvestment Policy Oversight Board June 2025
Recidivism reports for re-arraignment, re-conviction, and re-incarceration are on mass.gov, the Commonwealth’s
website, since June 2023. As required, reports, in the form of interactive dashboards, track recidivism over 1, 2,
and 3-year periods, by key demographics: race, ethnicity, gender, and age, and use standard recidivism
calculation and reporting protocols developed in an earlier phase of the cross-tracking effort. The dashboards are
updated regularly to comply with the statute. As of June 2025, public-facing recidivism dashboard data has been
ingested into the Application Programming Interface.
EOPSS has developed two recidivism measures that are reflected in the dashboards.
The first, in line with the CMR, tracks recidivism from the date the individual completes their full term of
supervision, including any Parole or Probation supervision, while the second tracks recidivism from the date an
individual is released from their sentence with the DOC or Massachusetts Sheriffs into the community, whether
or not the individual continues to be under Parole or Probation supervision. The publicly available dashboards
display data for both metrics from the DOC, Massachusetts Sheriffs, Parole Board and Probation Service, and the
Trial Court. EOPSS worked with its partner agencies to expand the data available in the platform to include
demographic data from the DOC, Massachusetts Sheriffs, Parole Board and Probation Service, as well as
arraignment data from the Trial Court.
Table 3 shows the major milestones completed in the recidivism reporting work, along with their target dates.

Section 26:
5. Reporting Standards for Race and Ethnicity
Paragraph (14) of the statute mandates that EOPSS establish data collection and reporting standards for criminal
justice agencies and the Trial Court to standardize methods of reporting of race and ethnicity data to facilitate
assessment of the racial and ethnic composition of the criminal justice population of the Commonwealth. The
criminal justice agencies and the Trial Court, including houses of correction and county jails, must further
coordinate to ensure that racial and ethnic data related to populations, trends and outcomes is reported
accurately to the Secretary of Public Safety and the public.
After establishing regulations and consolidating correctional data from the DOC and county sheriffs, EOPSS
worked with agencies to update systems, as needed, to comply with the new standardized race and ethnicity
reporting requirements. If this required training, EOPSS also assisted, as needed. Through this training and
updates, the cross-tracking system was able to ingest the standardized race and ethnicity data.
The inaugural dashboard debuted online in 2022 and reflects this standardized race and ethnicity
data. Subsequent dashboards display updated admission and release data from the DOC and county sheriffs;
evidence-based programming from the DOC and county sheriffs; recidivism rates for re-incarceration, re-
conviction, and re-arraignment; charges and convictions for those sentenced and pre-trial individuals in the DOC
and county sheriffs; and most recently risk and needs assessments for DOC, Parole and Probation. All of these
dashboards include data received by way of a data flow between partner agency record management systems to
a centralized system. This required extensive upgrades to comply with the new data standards. As of this writing,
work is ongoing to harmonize records management systems with the LiveScan fingerprinting machines within
local law enforcement agencies (LEAs).

6. Recommendations and Considerations of the Board
Based on the reports provided to the Board this fiscal year, EOPSS is nearing full compliance with M.G.L. c. 6A, §
18 ¾. Throughout this past year, several Board Members have noted the progress being made has met or
exceeded expectations and the information being shared to the board and surfaced publicly has represented
considerable progress and alignment with the goals of the legislation.
As we look to FY2026, the Board remains invested in monitoring progress and supports the overarching goal of
improving the criminal justice system by enhancing the integrity, accuracy, consistency, and transparency of
information. To that end, the Board recommends particular attention to the following items:
• The Board should discuss ways to call attention to and highlight the progress being made via this Cross-Tracking
System, with consideration paid to current usage, consumption and viewing rates of the publicly available
dashboards and other information shared on mass.gov.
• The Board requests EOPSS provide an update to the Board in FY26 relative to the continued progress of the API
development and the public sharing of anonymized data sets.
• The Board requests EOPSS, or its relevant agencies, provide an update as to how these linked data sets are being
used internally to inform policy and program development.
• The Board requests additional updates relative to the integration of critical data from the Attorney General’s
Office and the District Attorney’s Offices, including the pursuit of new case management infrastructure
necessary to facilitate said integration and/or improve data sharing.
Finally, the Board should consider and discuss its role once statutory compliance has been achieved, as
anticipated in FY26.

Justice Reinvestment Policy Oversight Board June 2025
1. Introduction
The Justice Reinvestment Policy Oversight Board (the “Board”) was created in April 2018 with the
passage into law of Chapter 69 of the Acts of 2018, “An Act Relative to Criminal Justice Reform.” The
Board, chaired by the Secretary of the Executive Office of Technology Services and Security (EOTSS) and
comprised of a broad spectrum of criminal justice agency heads and stakeholders inside and outside of
state government, is charged with monitoring the development and implementation of justice
reinvestment policies relative to the collection, standardization, and public availability of data to ensure
they achieve anticipated goals.
The legislation requires that the Board file a report with the clerks of the Massachusetts House of
Representatives and the Senate annually by July 1 that reviews the compliance of the criminal justice
agencies and the Trial Court, including the Probation Service, the Parole Board, the Executive Office of
Public Safety and Security (EOPSS), the Department of Correction, houses of correction, and county jails,
with:
1. Collecting and submitting to EOPSS data required by section 18 ¾ of chapter 6A of the
Massachusetts General Laws in the form of a cross-agency tracking system that uses a
unique state identification number assigned to each person who enters the criminal justice
system;
2. Making said data available to the public through the use of an application programming
interface (API), as required by paragraph 12 of section 18 ¾;
3. Establishing data collection and reporting standards relative to recidivism rates for re-
arraignment, reconviction, and reincarceration; and
4. Establishing data collection and reporting standards to standardize the methods of
reporting race and ethnicity data to facilitate assessment of the racial and ethnic
composition of the criminal justice population.
This is the Board’s seventh annual report and will address the progress made to-date towards
compliance with M.G.L. c. 6A, § 18 ¾.
The Board convened three times in FY 2025 and continued its work to research, describe, and identify
the current landscape with respect to data collection and reporting across criminal justice agencies
pursuant to M.G.L. c. 6A, § 18 ¾. The Board’s purpose is to aid the agencies and offices subject to
M.G.L. c. 6A, § 18 ¾ with furthering their efforts toward statutory compliance.
The following sections present the Board’s findings in each of the four areas listed above. The final
section presents recommendations and additional considerations raised by the Board.

Justice Reinvestment Policy Oversight Board June 2025
2. Cross-Tracking Data Collection System
M.G.L. Chapter 6A, section 18 ¾ (the “statute”), Paragraph (12)(i), mandates the collection of at least
seventeen (17) distinct categories of data by criminal justice agencies and the Trial Court, including but
not necessarily limited to: (1) a unique statewide identification number assigned to each person who
enters the criminal justice system; (2) the offense for which the person has been incarcerated; (3-4) the
date and time of the offense; (5) the location of the offense; (6-9) the race, ethnicity, gender, and age of
the person; (10) whether the person is the primary caretaker of a child; (11) the status of the person’s
reproductive health needs; (12-13) risk and needs assessment scores; (14- 15) participation in and
completion of evidence-based programs; and (16-17) entry and exit/release dates from a jail or house
of correction.
Under the definition of “criminal justice agencies” adopted in 501 CMR 18.00: Data Collection and
Reporting Standards for Criminal Justice Agencies, EOPSS’s goals for the platform are to ultimately
ingest data from the custodial agencies—DOC and Massachusetts Sheriffs—and the Trial Court, as well
as the Massachusetts Probation Service, Massachusetts Parole Board, Massachusetts State Police, the
Commonwealth’s 350+ local police departments, the Offices of the District Attorneys and the Attorney
General’s Office.
The below accomplishments demonstrate an evolution of the cross-tracking system. Since 2021, cross-tracking
has not only expanded to include more data sets and more agency ingestion, but also expanded to include more
real time data that is continuously refreshed with up-to-date information. In June 2022, the platform displayed
data from the Department of Correction (DOC) and the Massachusetts Sheriffs that hold incarcerated individuals
within the Houses of Correction (HOCs) and county jails from 2017 to 2022. In Fiscal Year 2023 (FY23), new data
from the Trial Court, Probation Service, and Parole Board was ingested into the platform and those ingestion jobs
were automated, refreshing with new data weekly. In FY24, additional data from the DOC, HOCs, and the Trial
Court was ingested into the platform including programs data, recidivism data, and charges and convictions data.
Fiscal Year 2024 also saw the creation of a pilot law enforcement program. In FY25, the Programs and Recidivism
dashboards were refreshed to include current data, and a risk and needs assessments dashboard was created
with initial data from Parole, DOC, and Probation. Additionally, an API (Application Programming Interface), as
required by the statute, was published with data from the custodial cohort. In FY25, Parole’s record management
system, the State Parole Integrated Records and Information Tracking (Spirit II) was fully integrated with the
OneIII system, which generates State Identification Numbers.
The program has achieved the following key statutory milestones:
1. December 2021: Standardized definitions (includes race, ethnicity, and gender) across criminal justice
organizations 501 CMR 18
2. August 2022: Public release of Cross Tracking Platform – Custodial Agencies Population reporting (1st

15. June 2025: Recidivism API cohort published.
Due to the maturity of Cross-Tracking and to ensure coordination, improve efficiency and track the progress of
the data collection system implementation, EOPSS replaced the Executive Governance Council (EGC) with the
Data Governance Council (DGC). EOPSS and its stakeholders chose to replace the EGC with the established DGC
as both councils were comprised of the same stakeholder representatives and the DGC was a better
3

Justice Reinvestment Policy Oversight Board June 2025
representation of cross-tracking as a program that will continue and evolve, rather than a project with an end
date.
Comprised of key stakeholders and subject matter experts, the DGC is a forum for data experts and workstream
leads to discuss their efforts, identify any roadblocks, collaborate on solutions, and seek guidance and
clarification. The DGC addresses identified roadblocks with data standardization that affect the platform as a
whole and agencies generally. It is tasked with providing clarification and feedback to ensure the program is
running smoothly and efficiently. Further, the DGC is intended to enhance the collaboration between all agencies
and entities that support the technical components of the platform and meets to discuss specific data questions
that may arise and work together to achieve resolution and consistency across the different agencies.
During Fiscal Year 2024, EOPSS created the law enforcement pilot program comprised of three (3) local law
enforcement agencies and the Massachusetts State Police (MSP). The main goal of the pilot program is to
understand law enforcement data in the individual record management systems (RMS) and how that data can be
ingested into the cross-tracking system. This required reviewing additional systems that included the LiveScan,
which is used by law enforcement agencies to take fingerprints, and the Electronic Application for Criminal
Complaints (EACC), which is used by law enforcement to transmit data to the Trial Court.
Fiscal Year 2025 saw the publication of the Application Programming Interface (API) which will serve as a
platform for standardizing data sets and presentation across cohorts, enabling research across populations.
EOPSS also completed the Spirit II integration project with the OneIll system, and ensured that LiveScan
machines were made operational at all law enforcement agencies with integration updates completed.
Additionally, efforts were made to expand upon the work completed with the law enforcement pilot program
including updating the Law Enforcement Data Collection Model Policy and Procedures along with compiling and
preparing the relevant data for corresponding dashboards once the EACC and LiveScan updates are completed.
In the next fiscal year, the cross-tracking program will focus on:
• Developing an anonymized, linked dataset at an individual level for public consumption
• Expanding the program’s Application Programming Interface (API) with new cohorts
o Publishing the Admission and Release cohort
• Updating the Risks and Needs Assessment Dashboards with Sheriff Office data
• Publishing the Primary Caretaker and Reproductive Needs Dashboard
• Publishing local Law Enforcement Agency Dashboards
The cross-tracking platform is built to grow and ingest more criminal justice agency data. EOPSS will continue
updating previously released dashboards with up-to-date information and publish new public-facing data
dashboards and application programming interfaces in Fiscal Year 2026 to ingest more cross tracking data into
the platform. The public-facing State and County Correctional Populations and Admissions and Release
dashboards will continue to be refreshed in weekly intervals, while other public dashboards will have yearly
updates.
Statewide Unique Identification Number
Paragraph (12)(ii) of the statute further mandates that data shall be collected in the form of a cross-
tracking system that tracks individuals through a unique, fingerprint-supported, statewide identification
number (SID).
There remain technical and statutory challenges with the adoption of the SID across constituent agencies. To
summarize, some agencies’ record management systems (RMS) were not configured to communicate with the
Massachusetts State Police OneIII system through which SIDs are generated and stored, and fingerprinting is not
mandated in Massachusetts for all offenses. Additionally, updates to the Electronic Application for Criminal
Complaints (EACC), which is used by law enforcement to transmit data to the Trial Court have contributed to the
delays in achieving full compliance with collection and transmission of SIDs. Although the EACC does not
generate or store SIDs, these system updates and enhancements are imperative in ensuring good, reliable data
across the Commonwealth and also in ensuring different agency systems are communicating and
receiving/sending information correctly and smoothly. In an effort to upgrade their systems all at once for both
EACC and OneIII integration, many departments are waiting until EACC upgrades are finalized.
While departments await the EACC update to begin RMS upgrades, since the last report, EOPSS has completed
updates to Parole’s RMS, Spirit II, to allow for integration with OneIll, representing a major operational
milestone. Now, SIDs are automatically generated into Parole’s RMS from OneIII. Additionally, the MassCourts
system has completed SID integration.

3. Public Availability of Data
Paragraph 12(ii) of the statute requires that anonymized, cross-agency data be made available to the public for
analysis through an application programming interface (API) which allows access to all electronically available
records.
In the last year, EOPSS has made progress on publicly-available data through the launch of the Risk and Needs
Assessment dashboards in December 2024, and published the API for data concerning the custodial cohort. Work
this year across the custodial agencies will continue to focus on further API publication, including the Recidivism
cohort and the Admission and Release cohort APIs.
A first phase of dashboards, released in August 2022, shows the supervised populations of the DOC and
Massachusetts Sheriffs by Pre-Trial and Sentenced status. Data is available by key demographics, including race,
ethnicity, gender, and age. Importantly, these dashboards are designed to meet the statute’s requirements for
race and ethnicity reporting, discussed in more detail in section 5 below. A second phase of dashboards, released
in March 2023, reports on admissions and releases from these same institutions over time and by reason for
release. A third phase released in June 2023, meets the statute’s requirements for recidivism reporting and is
discussed in more detail in section 4. In November 2023, EOPSS released another public dashboard consisting of
programs reporting information from custodial institutions. The Commonwealth has a rich display of offender
programming information across all of its custodial agencies; program data is often limited to state agencies and
is usually only available at the general program category level. In March 2024, EOPSS released another public
dashboard reporting on Charges and Convictions data for sentenced individuals. This dashboard displays
aggregated and organized information on charges and convictions, combining data from many different state
agencies. This required a lengthy, detailed review to match the data across the agency systems. In 2024, EOPSS
released similar dashboards on risk and needs assessments for the Parole, Probation and DOC populations.
Additionally, major statutory annual updates to public data dashboards were made on recidivism and programs.
In January 2025, EOPSS published the API with the first cohort containing custodial data which includes
populations, charges and convictions, and programs. With this, users can access anonymized criminal justice data
with the ability to apply filters and select desired metrics across the Cross-Tracking dashboards. API cohorts for
recidivism and admissions and releases are expected in early FY26 and EOPSS expects the fully anonymized
integration to be completed in 2025. This integration will apply the API to all published Cross-Tracking
dashboards creating cohorts for all publicly available Cross-Tracking information. The API promotes the
transparency of the criminal justice system, informs the public, policy makers and researchers about the criminal
justice system, allows for monitoring and accountability of the system, and furthers the ability to identify trends
5

Justice Reinvestment Policy Oversight Board June 2025
and issues that will inform the development of effective public policy. Using the API allows users to customize
data extracts that span the dashboards. The integration of final anonymized data cohorts with the API is ongoing
to ensure that the trajectory shown for an individual through the API cannot be used to reveal the identity of an
individual. All of these dashboards allow users to filter by demographics, institution, year, etc. and allow for the
public to download data sets for their own review and study to deepen their understanding of the
Commonwealth criminal justice system.
All available dashboards are published on mass.gov: Commonwealth of Massachusetts | Criminal Justice Cross-
Tracking System | Mass.gov

4. Collection and Reporting Standards for Recidivism
Paragraph (13) of the statute requires the Secretary of Public Safety to establish data collection and reporting
standards for criminal justice agencies and Trial Court relative to recidivism rates for re-arraignment,
reconviction, and reincarceration with data tracked over 1, 2, and 3-year periods. Recidivism rates must be
tracked by race, ethnicity, gender, and age and reported annually to the Secretary of Public Safety.
6

Justice Reinvestment Policy Oversight Board June 2025
Recidivism reports for re-arraignment, re-conviction, and re-incarceration are on mass.gov, the Commonwealth’s
website, since June 2023. As required, reports, in the form of interactive dashboards, track recidivism over 1, 2,
and 3-year periods, by key demographics: race, ethnicity, gender, and age, and use standard recidivism
calculation and reporting protocols developed in an earlier phase of the cross-tracking effort. The dashboards are
updated regularly to comply with the statute. As of June 2025, public-facing recidivism dashboard data has been
ingested into the Application Programming Interface.
EOPSS has developed two recidivism measures that are reflected in the dashboards.
The first, in line with the CMR, tracks recidivism from the date the individual completes their full term of
supervision, including any Parole or Probation supervision, while the second tracks recidivism from the date an
individual is released from their sentence with the DOC or Massachusetts Sheriffs into the community, whether
or not the individual continues to be under Parole or Probation supervision. The publicly available dashboards
display data for both metrics from the DOC, Massachusetts Sheriffs, Parole Board and Probation Service, and the
Trial Court. EOPSS worked with its partner agencies to expand the data available in the platform to include
demographic data from the DOC, Massachusetts Sheriffs, Parole Board and Probation Service, as well as
arraignment data from the Trial Court.

5. Reporting Standards for Race and Ethnicity
Paragraph (14) of the statute mandates that EOPSS establish data collection and reporting standards for criminal
justice agencies and the Trial Court to standardize methods of reporting of race and ethnicity data to facilitate
assessment of the racial and ethnic composition of the criminal justice population of the Commonwealth. The
criminal justice agencies and the Trial Court, including houses of correction and county jails, must further
coordinate to ensure that racial and ethnic data related to populations, trends and outcomes is reported
accurately to the Secretary of Public Safety and the public.
After establishing regulations and consolidating correctional data from the DOC and county sheriffs, EOPSS
worked with agencies to update systems, as needed, to comply with the new standardized race and ethnicity
reporting requirements. If this required training, EOPSS also assisted, as needed. Through this training and
updates, the cross-tracking system was able to ingest the standardized race and ethnicity data.
The inaugural dashboard debuted online in 2022 and reflects this standardized race and ethnicity
data. Subsequent dashboards display updated admission and release data from the DOC and county sheriffs;
evidence-based programming from the DOC and county sheriffs; recidivism rates for re-incarceration, re-
conviction, and re-arraignment; charges and convictions for those sentenced and pre-trial individuals in the DOC
and county sheriffs; and most recently risk and needs assessments for DOC, Parole and Probation. All of these
dashboards include data received by way of a data flow between partner agency record management systems to
a centralized system. This required extensive upgrades to comply with the new data standards. As of this writing,
work is ongoing to harmonize records management systems with the LiveScan fingerprinting machines within
local law enforcement agencies (LEAs).
Data dashboards can be found below:

6. Recommendations and Considerations of the Board
Based on the reports provided to the Board this fiscal year, EOPSS is nearing full compliance with M.G.L. c. 6A, §
18 ¾. Throughout this past year, several Board Members have noted the progress being made has met or
exceeded expectations and the information being shared to the board and surfaced publicly has represented
considerable progress and alignment with the goals of the legislation.
As we look to FY2026, the Board remains invested in monitoring progress and supports the overarching goal of
improving the criminal justice system by enhancing the integrity, accuracy, consistency, and transparency of
information. To that end, the Board recommends particular attention to the following items:
• The Board should discuss ways to call attention to and highlight the progress being made via this Cross-Tracking
System, with consideration paid to current usage, consumption and viewing rates of the publicly available
dashboards and other information shared on mass.gov.
• The Board requests EOPSS provide an update to the Board in FY26 relative to the continued progress of the API
development and the public sharing of anonymized data sets.
• The Board requests EOPSS, or its relevant agencies, provide an update as to how these linked data sets are being
used internally to inform policy and program development.
• The Board requests additional updates relative to the integration of critical data from the Attorney General’s
Office and the District Attorney’s Offices, including the pursuit of new case management infrastructure
necessary to facilitate said integration and/or improve data sharing.
Finally, the Board should consider and discuss its role once statutory compliance has been achieved, as
anticipated in FY26.
