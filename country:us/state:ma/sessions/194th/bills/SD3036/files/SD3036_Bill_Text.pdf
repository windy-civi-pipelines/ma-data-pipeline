Section 1: Executive Summary
Background and Context:
Chapter 135 of the Acts of 2024 “An Act Modernizing Firearm Laws in the
Commonwealth,” (“Act”) was signed into law by Governor Maura Healey on July
25, 2024, representing significant gun safety legislation. The Legislature passed
the bill in response to the Supreme Court’s decision in New York State Rifle &
Pistol Association v. Bruen, which limits states’ authority to enact gun safety
measures. This law updates Massachusetts’ firearms laws by tackling concerns
like untraceable “ghost guns” and 3-D printed firearms, strengthening the
“Red Flag Law,” and improving public safety by requiring that firearms safety
courses include live fire training as part of their curriculum.
With respect to this Report, the Act requires:
“SECTION 152. Notwithstanding any general or special law, rule or regulation to
the contrary, the secretary of public safety and security or a designee shall
study and report to the legislature on recommendations to ensure the
effective implementation of live firearm training as required pursuant to
section 131P of chapter 140 of the General Laws. Said report shall include, but
not be limited to, any recommendations to ensure that such training does not
become cost prohibitive and that resources and facilities to conduct such
training are adequate and reasonably available to individuals in all regions of
the state. Prior to issuing such report and recommendations, the secretary, or
designee, shall conduct not less than 2 public hearings in different regions of
the state to solicit public input regarding the implementation of the live
firearm training requirement. The report and any recommendations shall be
filed with the clerk of the house of representatives, the clerk of the senate, the
senate and house chairs of the joint committee on the judiciary and the senate
and house chairs of the joint committee on public safety not later than 9
months from the effective date of this act.”
The Executive Office of Public Safety and Security (EOPSS) held two public
hearings on May 29, 2025, and June 4, 2025, after providing notice to interested
stakeholders, including by publishing notice in the Boston Herald. Both
hearings were held remotely to allow as many members of the public from all
regions of Massachusetts to participate as possible. In total, approximately 170
people participated in the hearings and 58 comments were offered by 37
speakers. EOPSS received approximately 42 written comments during the
public comment period, which was open for more than 3 weeks.

In addition to reviewing the information shared with EOPSS via the hearings
and written submissions, this report also highlights research from other states
with live firearm protocols, key considerations, and suggested
recommendations that support effective live firearm training as part of the
basic firearm safety certificate requirement.
Key Findings:
Findings outlined in this report will be carefully considered as part of the
implementation process underway for live firearm training, which is statutorily
required to be in effect April 2026.
The key considerations identified within this report include:
• Cost: There are potential cost implications that must be considered for
successful enactment of the live fire requirement contained in Section
74 of the Act. Some potential costs include the cost of conducting
firearms classes (e.g., supplying firearms and equipment), range
insurance, travel expenses, range maintenance costs, etc.
• Accessibility: There are currently no state-run ranges, requiring
Massachusetts to rely on non-state-run ranges (or, potentially, ranges
currently not accessible to the public), to provide the infrastructure to
support the live fire training requirement. This will present challenges for
both instructors, who will need to access ranges to teach firearms
courses, and for ranges concerned about potential maintenance costs,
insurance costs, capacity, and environmental impacts of opening their
doors to accommodate the required live fire trainings. Additionally,
license applicants have expressed concerns about being able to get to
ranges.
With approximately a year before the enactment of the live fire training
requirement, EOPSS intends to continue to engage key stakeholders –
including ranges, certified instructors, and licensees – to fully understand
resource availability, constraints, and potential impacts so that the live fire may
be reasonably and practically implemented.
In addition to the key findings, the report also highlights several potential
recommendations that emerged through research and public feedback. These
recommendations include:
• Developing minimum standards for the live fire training requirement to
clarify teaching goals.
• Engaging with relevant stakeholders, including ranges, certified
instructors, and organizations, to help ensure successful implementation
Page | 4

of live fire by discussing solutions that will ensure the requirement is
accessible and affordable.
• Continuing public engagement to ensure the public is aware of changes
and is provided the necessary information for a smooth implementation.
• Engaging with other states to understand potential implementation
barriers.
• Being cost conscious by exploring creative opportunities (e.g., state
subsidies, grants, fee structures, partnerships, incentives, etc.) to attempt
to ameliorate the chance of cost burden on stakeholders (e.g., ranges,
certified instructors, class participants).
• Ensuring resources and facilities to conduct live fire training are
adequate and reasonably available to individuals in all regions of the
state by continuing to understand the capacity and demand constraints
and identifying opportunities to create balance. Examples include
documenting and sharing information on ranges and certified
instructors offering live fire training courses, identifying transportation
options, and exploring methods for increasing capacity (e.g., incentives
for ranges, building new ranges, using existing state facilities, etc.).
The recommendations outlined in this report are not intended to be
exhaustive or final. EOPSS, in collaboration with the MSP, remains committed
to ongoing engagement with necessary stakeholders for the successful
implementation of the live fire training requirement and as such, the
recommendations and approach are expected to evolve as discussions and
feedback continue to take place.
Section 2: Research & Analysis
To ensure that the enactment of the live fire requirements are grounded in
proven approaches, EOPSS examined other states and municipalities within
the Commonwealth that already have live fire training requirements. This
section also includes an analysis of the accessibility and potential cost
associated with implementing the live fire requirement.
Section 2.1: States with live fire training requirements
More than a third of U.S. states require live fire training as part of their firearm
permitting or licensing process. These states include: California, Connecticut,
Delaware, Florida, Illinois, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Nebraska,
Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, North Carolina, Ohio, Rhode Island, and
Texas.
Page | 5

Each state that mandates live fire training has its own specific requirements.
For example, some states require live fire training only for specialty licenses,
such as those for concealed carry. In addition, each state uses different naming
conventions and permit structures for their licenses. As a result, it is not
possible to make direct, one-to-one comparisons between states. Additionally,
the challenges faced by other states may differ from those Massachusetts
might encounter when implementing a similar requirement. Nonetheless, this
information is helpful in providing a broad overview of live fire training
requirements across the country.

Section 2.2: Municipalities within Massachusetts with live fire training
requirements
While section 74 of the new firearms law mandates live firearm training as a
component of the basic safety firearms curriculum across Massachusetts, this
requirement is not entirely new to all parts of the state. Prior to and
concurrently with this statewide mandate taking effect, several municipalities
already required applicants to demonstrate competency through live fire
training as part of their local licensing process or as a prerequisite for applying.
The table below details the specific live fire requirements in these
municipalities, including Boston, Weymouth, Quincy, Rockland, and Braintree.

Section 2.3: Analysis on the Availability and Accessibility of Training
Resources
According to wheretoshoot.org, which can be found on Mass.gov under the
page “Shooting Ranges with Public Access,” xxxiii there are currently
approximately 39 shooting ranges accessible to the public (“publicly accessible
ranges”) or non-members throughout Massachusetts. There are also 99 private,
member-driven, shooting ranges in Massachusetts.xxxiv

The graph below highlights towns in which there is a publicly accessible range
or private range (or, in some cases, both a publicly accessible range and a
private range).

According to the Firearms Records Bureau data posted to Mass.gov, there is an
average of approximately 43,000 new applications for firearms licenses per
year. Note, this data includes Licenses to Carry and Firearms Identification
Cards. Approximately 1-2% of the applications are for other license types, such
as License to Sell Ammunition. The average was derived from the number of
applicants over the past 3 years, specifically 2024: 56,231 new applicants, 2023:
37,740 new applicants, 2022: 35,216 new applicants.xxxv
The number of new applicants (rather than renewal applicants) was used in
this section given that a person who has been issued a firearms identification
card or license to carry on or before August 1, 2024, will not be required to
complete the live fire component, including when seeking to renew the card
or license. For the purposes of this report, impact on demand was determined
by the number of publicly accessible ranges.
Page | 14

Year 2024 2023 2022
New applications (annual) 56,231 37,740 35,216
New applications (monthly) 4,686 3,145 2,935
Applicants per range per month (assuming 39 120 81 71
publicly accessible ranges)
Applicants per range per week (assuming 39 30 20 19
publicly accessible ranges)
It is estimated that publicly accessible ranges could have to train 20-30
applicants per week, per range to meet the potential demand. The current
demand of applicants per month, per range is not known. The demand on
accessibility is expected to be reduced with the inclusion of private ranges.
Section 2.4: Cost Analysis
In assessing the overall cost of participating in activities offered by shooting
ranges, a significant financial factor to consider is the cost of training. While
new live fire certification requirements are not finalized and updated courses
are not yet approved by MSP, this report is using research from both
Massachusetts classes that do and do not incorporate live fire into the
curriculum. A small subset of courses from across Massachusetts were used in
the research. Generally, training that involves a live fire component is higher in
cost compared to classes without live fire.
Classes without a live fire component ranged in cost from $80 to $150. Classes
with a live fire component ranged from $120 to $199.
Beyond the direct cost of training classes, several other financial considerations
are relevant to the overall expense of engaging with ranges. Additional cost
considerations are highlighted in the stakeholder group in Section 4: Key
Considerations section of this report.
Section 3: Public Feedback
Public hearings regarding the implementation of the live firearm training
requirement took place on May 29, 2025, from 1:00 pm to 3:00 pm EST and June
4, 2025, from 10:00 am to 12:00 pm EST. Meeting minutes are published on the
EOPSS website found here: https://www.mass.gov/orgs/executive-office-of-
public-safety-and-security.
As previously discussed, the public hearings attracted approximately 170
participants yielding approximately 100 public comments. Attendees included
Page | 15

representatives from gun owner organizations and ranges, as well as certified
instructors, law enforcement officers, and individuals with firearm licenses or
seeking licensure.
This section summarizes recurring themes and concerns raised during the
public hearings and from written submission feedback.
• Most commentors agree with the concept of live fire training, but do
not believe it should be mandatory: Most commentors opened their
remarks saying they agreed with the concept of live fire training and are
generally supportive of a high level of training, especially for new gun
owners. However, many commentors believed that completing a course
with live fire requirement should be voluntary and not mandated by the
Commonwealth.
• Lack of Clarity on State Standards Regarding Live Fire Requirement:
A primary concern was the lack of specific information from the
Commonwealth (the MSP) regarding what the mandated training will
entail. Questions were raised about whether the training would cover
only handguns or multiple types of firearms (handgun, rifle, shotgun).
Attendees were concerned about a lack of clarity on what constitutes a
minimum acceptable standard, what the passing requirements will be,
if any, and how instructors will be assessed or recertified to assure
capability with modern education.
There was debate among public participants about whether the training
should focus on basic safety or require demonstration of shooting
proficiency. Some instructors argued that the decision on what firearm
and whether to require live fire should be up to the instructor,
recommending the option to select a lower caliber appropriate to the
student's ability and intended use. It was noted that a short 4-hour class
is unlikely to make someone a "good" shooter but can focus on safety.
Many had questions about timing and if those who have taken a course
with live fire would be grandfathered into the requirement.
• Availability and Access: Attendees stressed the significant challenges
posed by the limited number of publicly accessible ranges, noting that
most ranges in the Commonwealth are private, members-only, ranges.
Many attendees noted that there are no state-run public ranges in
Massachusetts.
Page | 16

Concerns were raised about how applicants who do not belong to a
private range or cannot afford membership will be able to access a range
to complete the required training.
Many raised concerns about access, cost, and ability to pass a live fire
certification on behalf of the growing demographic of underrepresented
gun owners, especially women, racial minorities, elderly, and people with
disabilities.
There is uncertainty about whether some ranges will be willing or able
to open their doors to applicants seeking training without that
impacting their members' use. The process for instructors to partner
with ranges to offer these courses is currently unclear, and some ranges
are hesitant to let individual certified instructors use their facilities to
teach classes. Ranges cited concerns including: a) increased
maintenance and insurance costs; b) needing to dedicate a lane for
classes, thus decreasing available range space for other shooters; and c)
lead and environmental concerns.
Instructor participants noted that the safest practice is to have one
instructor for each trainee and noted that this will limit the number of
attendees per available class, cause delays, and make classes more
expensive.
It was suggested that the Commonwealth could explore using
simulators in place of live fire, with the intention of increasing
accessibility for those with limited access to ranges. There was discussion
about the cost of this solution and the likeness to open fire at a range.
Some suggested that the state could provide classroom space to teach
training courses. Others brought up that the state could explore the use
of other existing facilities not currently made available to the public.
• Cost and Affordability of Training: The potential cost burden associated
with the live firearm requirement was a significant concern, with fears
that it could price people out of gun ownership. Speakers noted that
classes, especially those including live fire, can be expensive due to
instructor time, the cost of ammunition, and instructors potentially
needing to supply firearms and essential equipment such as eye and ear
protection now that training is mandated. Insurance expenses for ranges
and instructors could become a prohibitive issue, causing ranges to
refuse to host live fire trainings or forcing private instructors to close their
Page | 17

businesses. Participants raised the possibility of the state indemnifying
the ranges to help reduce insurance costs.
• Instructor Preparedness and Liability: Instructors also expressed
concerns about potential liability and danger involved with teaching
beginners.
• Logistical and Practical Challenges: The challenge of how participants
can practice before they have obtained a license to possess firearms was
mentioned several times, especially in relation to the concern of needing
to pass a shooting test to obtain a license.
• Constitutionality and Process: Many raised concerns with the
constitutionality of this requirement and wished public hearings had
been conducted before the legal requirement was put in place. Many did
not understand the problem that the live fire requirement is solving,
stating that a very small portion of gun-related deaths and injuries are
accidents in Massachusetts.
The two Public Hearings revealed concern among stakeholders regarding the
practical implementation, cost, availability, and specific requirements of the
new live firearm training mandate, emphasizing the need for clear standards,
increased range access, and continued dialogue with affected parties.
Section 4: Key Considerations
Based on research and feedback gathered from the public hearings, several
key challenges and considerations emerged that warrant further discussion
and careful consideration as live fire is implemented. Key considerations are
grouped by the four main stakeholder groups that will be impacted by the new
requirement. These stakeholder groups include:
1) Certified Instructors (“instructors”)
2) Massachusetts State Police (“MSP”)
3) Firearms Safety Class Participants (“class participants”)
4) Shooting Ranges (“ranges”)
Organizing the key considerations and concerns by stakeholder group
highlights the specific needs and challenges of each group, providing a more
focused and holistic delivery approach and ensures that all relevant
perspectives are considered during the implementation process.
Page | 18

Section 4.1: Certified Instructors
Certified Instructors are certified by the MSP to teach a basic safety firearms
course to individuals seeking to obtain a firearms license or permit. While there
are approximately 3,000 individuals currently certified as instructors in the
Commonwealth today, it is noted that not all of them may be actively
teaching.xxxvi The following considerations apply to instructors:
• Time and availability: Courses will need to be resubmitted to ensure that
the course covers the curriculum requirements, including live fire. While
this process is underway, the availability of active certified instructors
who can teach approved courses may be limited, potentially impacting
how many instructors will be available to provide the training by April
2026 as required by the Act.
Individual instructors may need to establish relationships with ranges to
be able to offer courses that include the live fire component. How
instructors will collaborate with ranges to offer these courses needs to be
defined. It is essential that there is cohesive collaboration between
individual instructors and ranges to prevent the possible reduction of
instructors available to teach the live fire course.
• Cost: Most individuals who will be required to take the live fire training
do not currently have access or permission to own a firearm within the
Commonwealth. As a result, instructors may be required to supply
equipment necessary for the training, such as firearms, ammunition,
targets, goggles and safety equipment, and other materials. The cost of
providing these materials can impact the cost to teach the course, as
instructors may need to source these materials for use.
Section 4.2: Massachusetts State Police (MSP)
The implementation of the live firearm training requirement places specific
responsibilities on the MSP. For example, as previously stated, there are
approximately 26 approved Basic Safety Firearms Courses.xxxvii Courses will
need to be re-evaluated by the Massachusetts State Police. The following
considerations apply to MSP:
• Time and availability: The MSP will bear the primary responsibility for
certifying updated safety course curriculum, which must now include
Page | 19

live fire training. This involves clarifying the standards to be used in all
mandated safety courses.
Section 4.3: Firearms Safety Class Participants
Starting April 2026, new and renewing applicants are required to complete a
basic firearms safety course that includes live firearm training. As noted in
Section 2: Research & Analysis, it can be inferred that publicly accessible ranges
could have to train ~20 - 30 applicants per week, per range to meet the
potential demand. Section 5: Recommendations suggests that EOPSS and
MSP continue to conduct research with ranges to determine how much of a
shift in demand this represents. The following considerations apply to Class
Participants:
• Time and availability: At least a portion of firearms training class must
now be conducted at a shooting range. This means participants will have
to travel to a range location, which could be further than current local
course certification classrooms. This could impact accessibility,
particularly in areas with limited publicly accessible range availability.
Courses incorporating live fire training may be longer in duration on
average than classes that do not contain live fire. In addition, range
capacity limitations may restrict the number of participants allowed in a
single class. This could result in fewer classes being taught annually or
longer waiting times for applicants to fulfill the training requirement.
• Cost: The inclusion of live fire training and potentially increased overhead
for instructors and ranges may lead to classes being more expensive
than previous safety courses.
Section 4.4: Shooting Ranges
Shooting ranges are essential facilities for fulfilling the live firearm training
requirement. As noted in Section 2: Research & Analysis, wheretoshoot.org
shows that there are at least 138 shooting ranges within the Commonwealth.
The following considerations apply to ranges:
• Time and availability: Bringing a large number of students to ranges for
training may lead to increased crowding at these facilities. Increased
demand for training could impact the availability of range time for
existing members or individuals who wish to use the range for sport or
Page | 20

recreational shooting. Increased demand could also impact noise levels,
lead levels, and other environmental factors at ranges.
• Cost: Increased usage and crowding could potentially lead to higher
maintenance and / or insurance costs for the ranges.
Section 5: Recommendations
This section of the report outlines recommendations to ensure the effective
implementation of the live firearm training requirement. Guided by the
principle of balancing public safety and proper instruction without
overburdening impacted stakeholders, these recommendations aim to
address concerns regarding the availability and cost-prohibitive nature of the
required training, as stipulated in Section 152 of the Act.
It is important to note that, pursuant to the Act, this report is being submitted
to the legislature well before the requirements for the live fire program are
completed. This provides time for additional consideration and planning of
these recommendations. The live fire requirement takes effect 18 months after
the effective date of the Act, which is approximately April 2, 2026.
Based on the key considerations identified and findings from the public
hearings, the following recommendations are proposed:
• Develop minimum standards for the live fire training requirement to
clarify teaching goals: It will be critical to recertify the courses firearms
instructors teach, as well as any new courses, and determine the
standards for the live fire component of the courses (e.g., if there is a
standard for caliber, rounds of ammunition, etc.). Clear minimum
standards should be developed in a dynamic way, leveraging examples
from other states and from municipalities within the Commonwealth,
and active engagement of key stakeholders.
• Continue robust Massachusetts stakeholder engagement, especially
with ranges and instructors, to work toward making adequate
facilities and classes available throughout the Commonwealth: It will
be important to continue and deepen engagement with instructors and
leadership at ranges through conversations and/or a survey. Engaging
ranges and instructors on key considerations like capacity, potential
Page | 21

challenges (e.g., crowding, maintenance, insurance, impact on ranges’
sport use), and willingness to host trainings will be critical for ensuring
adequate facilities are available statewide. It will also be critical to
continue engaging all other public stakeholders to ensure they
understand expectations, timelines, options, and progress.
• Engage other states to understand potential implementation
barriers: Other states (e.g., those listed in the Research & Analysis section
of this document) can help the Commonwealth to understand cost,
access, and other implementation barriers and successes, as well as
lessons learned.
• Be cost conscious to mitigate potential cost-impact on ranges,
instructors, and participants: There are opportunities to explore
creative solutions (e.g., state subsidies, grants, fee structures,
partnerships, incentives, etc.) to attempt to ameliorate the chance of cost
burden from the list below of likely additional costs on three main
stakeholder groups:
• Certified Instructors:
Equipment costs like firearms, ammunition, targets, ear plugs,
o
and goggles
Instructor and course recertification costs
o
• Firearms Safety Class Participants Travel to ranges:
Potential increase to class fees
o
• Shooting Ranges:
Increased maintenance costs
o
Increased insurance costs
o
Opportunity cost of using range space for training rather than
o
sporting or other member activities
• Ensure resources and facilities to conduct live fire training are
adequate and reasonably available to individuals in all regions of the
state:
• Validate Capacity: continue to validate the potential capacity issue
laid out in this report based on number of applicants expected in 2025
and 2026, instructors intending to get certified to teach live fire
courses, ranges anticipated to make space available for live fire
courses, etc.
Page | 22

• Share Information on Certified Instructors: establish a documented
list of ranges that are willing to work with certified instructors.
• Course Availability: consider strategies to maximize the availability of
training slots, perhaps by encouraging ranges to dedicate specific
times to training or exploring flexible scheduling models.
• Transportation options: explore facilitating transport options for
individuals to get to ranges for the live fire portion of their training.
• Explore alternative methods for meeting the live fire requirement: in
places where it is found that appropriate range availability does not
exist, the Commonwealth could consider alternative options, like
using simulators, which could bolster access, even in a temporary
fashion.
• Explore opportunities to increase capacity: investigate potential
models or incentives that encourage private ranges to make their
facilities available for certified instructors to conduct the required
training. Alternatively, explore opportunities to add to the range
capacity by building ranges or by using other existing facilities for the
live fire requirement.
• Explore opportunities to manage demand: explore strategies to
manage the volume of students requiring a live fire training, such as
a rolling requirement or an extended period in which the live fire
requirement can be completed.
Recommendations conclusion: These recommendations are meant to allow
the Commonwealth to work towards balancing the critical goal of enhancing
public safety through comprehensive firearm training, including live fire, with
the practical needs and potential burdens on all stakeholders involved in the
licensing process. The timeframe provided by the delayed effective date of the
live fire requirement should help to achieve these goals through continued
collaboration with stakeholders.
Section 6: Conclusion
This report addresses the mandate from Section 152 of Chapter 135 of the Acts
of 2024, requiring a study and recommendations for the effective
implementation of live firearm training.
Page | 23

The report includes research & analysis, identifies key considerations, and
incorporates public feedback. Key findings indicate that other jurisdictions
require live fire training and its implementation in Massachusetts will require
similar careful consideration. These include maintaining awareness as to range
capacity, monitoring cost increases for both instructors and participants, and
publicizing clear and understandable state standards for training courses.
Public feedback strongly echoed these matters, emphasizing the importance
of well-defined guidance, accessibility, affordability, and engagement with
interested stakeholders.
The report provides specific recommendations aimed at addressing these
challenges. These steps are designed to support the successful integration of
the live fire training requirement while balancing public safety goals with
practical implementation considerations.
