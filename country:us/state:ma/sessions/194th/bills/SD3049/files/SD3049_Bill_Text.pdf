SECTION 5: Observations and Recommendations
1. The inmate population was 853 at the time of inspection.
2. In the F Building, bathroom and shower areas were observed to be deteriorating and causing unsanitary
conditions. EHRS is concerned with the increased risk of disease transmission with the high number of inmates
being exposed to such unsanitary conditions.
a. EHRS recommends developing a plan to reconstruct showers with smooth and easily cleanable surfaces
as well as developing a higher frequency shower cleaning policy.
3. In the I Building, bathroom and shower areas were observed to be deteriorating and causing unsanitary
conditions. EHRS is concerned with the increased risk of disease transmission with the high number of inmates
being exposed to such unsanitary conditions.
a. EHRS recommends developing a plan to reconstruct floors with smooth and easily cleanable surfaces.
4. EHRS observed the Certificates of Occupancy for all buildings within NCCI Gardner had expired in May 2023. The
regulation 105 CMR 451.384, requires each facility to have a current certificate of use and occupancy issued by
the local building commissioner or inspector of buildings. During the inspection, it was stated that all buildings in
use at the facility do not have a current certificate of occupancy due to the damaged ramp and stairs at the
entrance to the facility.
a. EHRS is concerned with the lack of current Certificates of Occupancy for the facility and requests a copy
of the current Certificate of Occupancy for these buildings once received.
451-24(2)-NCCI Gardner-Report 1-30-25 Page 40 of 41

5. EHRS was informed that the slop sink in the basement of Thompson Hall is used to fill cambros with water to
bring to the units. EHRS is concerned with the use of a slop sink for food preparation due to the increased
exposure to bacteria.
a. EHRS recommends utilizing a sink suitable for food preparation to fill the cambros.
6. EHRS recommends labeling all sinks throughout the kitchen area with their intended use.

SECTION 5: Observations and Recommendations
1. The inmate population was 853 at the time of inspection.
2. In the F Building, bathroom and shower areas were observed to be deteriorating and causing unsanitary
conditions. EHRS is concerned with the increased risk of disease transmission with the high number of inmates
being exposed to such unsanitary conditions.
a. EHRS recommends developing a plan to reconstruct showers with smooth and easily cleanable surfaces
as well as developing a higher frequency shower cleaning policy.
3. In the I Building, bathroom and shower areas were observed to be deteriorating and causing unsanitary
conditions. EHRS is concerned with the increased risk of disease transmission with the high number of inmates
being exposed to such unsanitary conditions.
a. EHRS recommends developing a plan to reconstruct floors with smooth and easily cleanable surfaces.
4. EHRS observed the Certificates of Occupancy for all buildings within NCCI Gardner had expired in May 2023. The
regulation 105 CMR 451.384, requires each facility to have a current certificate of use and occupancy issued by
the local building commissioner or inspector of buildings. During the inspection, it was stated that all buildings in
use at the facility do not have a current certificate of occupancy due to the damaged ramp and stairs at the
entrance to the facility.
a. EHRS is concerned with the lack of current Certificates of Occupancy for the facility and requests a copy
of the current Certificate of Occupancy for these buildings once received.
451-24(2)-NCCI Gardner-Report 1-30-25 Page 40 of 41

5. EHRS was informed that the slop sink in the basement of Thompson Hall is used to fill cambros with water to
bring to the units. EHRS is concerned with the use of a slop sink for food preparation due to the increased
exposure to bacteria.
a. EHRS recommends utilizing a sink suitable for food preparation to fill the cambros.
6. EHRS recommends labeling all sinks throughout the kitchen area with their intended use.

SECTION 5: Observations and Recommendations
1. The inmate population was 853 at the time of inspection.
2. In the F Building, bathroom and shower areas were observed to be deteriorating and causing unsanitary
conditions. EHRS is concerned with the increased risk of disease transmission with the high number of inmates
being exposed to such unsanitary conditions.
a. EHRS recommends developing a plan to reconstruct showers with smooth and easily cleanable surfaces as well as
developing a higher frequency shower cleaning policy.
3. In the I Building, bathroom and shower areas were observed to be deteriorating and causing unsanitary
conditions. EHRS is concerned with the increased risk of disease transmission with the high number of inmates
being exposed to such unsanitary conditions.
a. EHRS recommends developing a plan to reconstruct floors with smooth and easily cleanable surfaces.
4. EHRS observed the Certificates of Occupancy for all buildings within NCCI Gardner had expired in May 2023. The
regulation 105 CMR 451.384, requires each facility to have a current certificate of use and occupancy issued by
the local building commissioner or inspector of buildings. During the inspection, it was stated that all buildings in
use at the facility do not have a current certificate of occupancy due to the damaged ramp and stairs at the
entrance to the facility.
a. EHRS is concerned with the lack of current Certificates of Occupancy for the facility and requests a copy of the
current Certificate of Occupancy for these buildings once received.
451-24(2)-NCCI Gardner-Report 1-30-25 Page 40 of 41

5. EHRS was informed that the slop sink in the basement of Thompson Hall is used to fill cambros with water to
bring to the units. EHRS is concerned with the use of a slop sink for food preparation due to the increased
exposure to bacteria.
a. EHRS recommends utilizing a sink suitable for food preparation to fill the cambros.
6. EHRS recommends labeling all sinks throughout the kitchen area with their intended use.

SECTION 4: Plan of Correction
This facility does not comply with the Department’s regulations cited above. In accordance with 105 CMR
451.404, please submit a plan of correction within 10 working days of receipt of this notice which includes:
1. Specific corrective steps to be taken
2. A timetable for the corrective actions for larger projects
3. The date by which correction will be achieved
4. Any interim measures being implemented to ensure the health and safety of incarcerated
individuals and facility staff
5. The plan should be signed by the Superintendent or Administrator and submitted to my
attention, at the address listed above.
SECTION 5: Observations and Recommendations
1. The inmate population was 853 at the time of inspection.
2. In the F Building, bathroom and shower areas were observed to be deteriorating and causing
unsanitary conditions. EHRS is concerned with the increased risk of disease transmission with the high
number of inmates being exposed to such unsanitary conditions.
a. EHRS recommends developing a plan to reconstruct showers with smooth and easily cleanable
surfaces as well as developing a higher frequency shower cleaning policy.
3. In the I Building, bathroom and shower areas were observed to be deteriorating and causing unsanitary
conditions. EHRS is concerned with the increased risk of disease transmission with the high number of
inmates being exposed to such unsanitary conditions.
a. EHRS recommends developing a plan to reconstruct floors with smooth and easily cleanable surfaces.
4. EHRS observed the Certificates of Occupancy for all buildings within NCCI Gardner had expired in May
2023. The regulation 105 CMR 451.384, requires each facility to have a current certificate of use and
occupancy issued by the local building commissioner or inspector of buildings. During the inspection, it
was stated that all buildings in use at the facility do not have a current certificate of occupancy due to
the damaged ramp and stairs at the entrance to the facility.
a. EHRS is concerned with the lack of current Certificates of Occupancy for the facility and requests
a copy of the current Certificate of Occupancy for these buildings once received.
5. HRS was informed that the slop sink in the basement of Thompson Hall is used to fill cambros with
water to bring to the units. EHRS is concerned with the use of a slop sink for food preparation due to
the increased exposure to bacteria.
a. EHRS recommends utilizing a sink suitable for food preparation to fill the cambros.
6. EHRS recommends labeling all sinks throughout the kitchen area with their intended use.
