Higher Education Innovation Fund Grant Summary
The Department of Higher Education (DHE) released a request for proposals (RFP) on September
19, 2023, under the FY24 Higher Education Innovation Fund (HEIF) grant program. The request
garnered 10 proposals totaling $2,019,289 in funding requests by the application due date of
November 1, 2023. Of the 10 applications received, the DHE awarded seven grants, totaling
$1,338,114 in funding.
The primary objective of this grant is to seed and support evidence-based practices as well as
new innovations in public higher education specifically aimed at the Commonwealth’s
overarching goal to eliminate race disparities in the Massachusetts public higher education
system. The FY24 RFP continued, and expanded upon, the prior year’s focus on the
Department’s Equity Agenda with funds supporting initiatives and activities that adopted an
equity lens designed to increase enrollment and completion rates for Students of Color. The
grant sought to accomplish these goals by actualizing three of the five strategies identified in
the Department’s Strategic Plan for Racial Equity as follows: 1) Transform Institutional Cultures
to be Equity-Minded, 2) Reimagine and Build Culturally Relevant and Civically Engaged
Educational Experiences for Students of Color, and 3) Prepare Students of Color to Thrive
Beyond Their Time in Higher Education.

Four out of the seven projects funded during this grant cycle addressed the goal of transforming
institutional cultures to be equity minded. Together these projects served approximately
170,922 students and trained over 166 faculty and staff. The other three recommended projects
addressed the goal of reimagining and building culturally relevant and civically engaged
educational experiences for students of color. These three projects served approximately 2,862
students and trained over 130 faculty and staff. Of these three projects, the proposal by North
Shore Community College involved all Massachusetts 15 public community college for
enhancing and accelerating post-secondary credit for prior learning options as an incentive for
college entry, re-entry, and completion. The proposal by Springfield Technical Community
College knitted together all the public higher education institutions in Western, Ma, and one
private, Springfield College. The large numbers of students, faculty and staff among all the
recommended projects had a transformative effect across the higher education system in
building more welcoming and equitable institutions.
The HEIF grant is a competitive, one-year grant with funds available to September 2024 (FY24).
