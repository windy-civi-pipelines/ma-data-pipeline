RE: Fiscal Year 2025 Capital Gains Tax Revenue Transfers to the Stabilization Fund,
the State Retiree Benefits Trust Fund, and the Pension Liability Fund
Dear Secretary Gorzkowicz, Chair Michlewitz, and Chair Rodrigues:

Section 2:
Section 5G of Chapter 29 of the Massachusetts General Laws requires that capital gains tax
revenue in excess of the fiscal year capital gains tax threshold be transferred as follows:
(i) 90% to the Commonwealth Stabilization Fund; (ii) 5% to the State Retiree Benefits Trust
Fund (SRBTF) and (iii) 5% to the Commonwealth’s Pension Liability Fund (PRIT). Note that

The Fiscal Year 2025 capital gains tax threshold is $1,563,655,002. On June 23, 2025, I
processed transfers to the three funds totaling $591,040,532.73, pursuant to the Fiscal Year 2025
Quarter 3 capital gains tax estimates certified by DOR on June 17, 2025. The amounts
transferred to each fund are as follows:

Attachment # 1: MGL Chapter 29, Section 5G
After each quarter, the department of revenue shall certify to the state comptroller the amount of
tax revenues estimated to have been collected during the preceding quarter from capital gains
income. If the department of revenue certifies that the amount of tax revenues estimated to have
been collected from capital gains income exceeds $1,000,000,000 in a fiscal year, the
comptroller shall transfer quarterly any such amount that exceeds $1,000,000,000 collected
during that fiscal year as follows: (i) 90 per cent shall be transferred to the Commonwealth
Stabilization Fund established in section 2H; (ii) 5 per cent shall be transferred to the State
Retiree Benefits Trust Fund established in section 24 of chapter 32A; and (iii) 5 per cent shall be
transferred to the Commonwealth's Pension Liability Fund established in subsection (e) of
subdivision 8 of section 22 of chapter 32. The $1,000,000,000 threshold established in the
preceding sentence shall be adjusted annually to reflect the average annual rate of growth in
United States gross domestic product over the preceding 5 years based on the most recently
available data published by the Bureau of Economic Analysis in the United States Department of
Commerce.
The transfers shall be made before the certification of the consolidated net surplus for the
previous fiscal year under section 5C. The department of revenue shall report by November 30 to
the state comptroller, the executive office for administration and finance and the house and
senate committees on ways and means tax revenues estimated to have been collected during the
preceding fiscal year from capital gains income. The comptroller shall not make adjustment to
amounts previously transferred if the capital gains revenue reported on November 30 differs
from the amounts estimated during the preceding fiscal year.
For the purposes of this section, income tax revenue collected from the additional 4 per cent
income tax levied pursuant to Article XLIV of the Amendments to the Constitution of the
Commonwealth shall not be considered to be tax revenue collected from capital gains income. .

Dear Comptroller McNamara:
Pursuant to Section 5G of Chapter 29 of the General Laws, the Department of Revenue (DOR) is required to
certify to the State Comptroller, after each quarter during the fiscal year, the amount of tax revenues estimated to
have been collected during the quarter from capital gain income.
Because capital gains tax payments are remitted unevenly throughout the fiscal year according to tax filing
deadlines, to ensure accurate reporting DOR certifies capital gains tax collections on the following schedule:
Period 1 (July 1 through September 30)
Period 2 (October 1 through January 31)
Period 3 (February 1 through May 31)
Period 4 (June 1 through June 30)
The table below shows capital gains tax revenue estimates for each of the first three certification periods, and on a
year-to-date basis during fiscal year 2025.
Capital Gains Tax Collections ($)
Period Period total Fiscal year-to-date total
Period 1 (July 1, 2024 to September 30, 2024) $312,365,173.37 $312,365,173.37
Period 2 (October 1, 2024 to January 31, 2025) $554,151,388.58 $866,516,561.95
Period 3 (February 1, 2025 to May 31, 2025) $1,288,178,972.78 $2,154,695,534.73
Based on currently available data, DOR hereby certifies that tax revenue estimated to have been collected from
capital gains income was $1,288,178,972.78 during the FY2025 Period 3 (February 1, 2025 through May 31,
Docusign Envelope ID: 5E226EE6-A745-4EB0-B18E-A62F3A2A3419
2025). The year-to-date (July 1, 2024 through May 31, 2025) tax revenue estimated to have been collected from
capital gains income was $2,154,695,534.73. Please note that these amounts are subject to revision in the Period 4
certification as DOR further analyzes tax data. The FY2025 Period 3 estimate of $1,288,178,972.78 and the
FY2025 year-to-date estimate of $2,154,695,534.73 do not include estimates of capital gains tax revenue
collected from the additional 4% income tax levied pursuant to Article XLIV of the Amendments of the
Constitution of the Commonwealth.1
