Re: 2024 Annual Report of the State Fire Marshal regarding the effectiveness of
the Massachusetts Fire Standard Compliant Cigarette Law
(M.G.L. c. 64C, s. 2A-2F)
Dear Secretary Reidy:
Pursuant to the reporting requirements of M.G.L. c. 64C, s. 2B(f), please accept this as the
2024 Annual Report of the State Fire Marshal regarding the effectiveness of the
Massachusetts Fire Standard Compliant Cigarette law (M.G.L. c. 64C, s. 2A-2F).
The Fire Standard Compliant Cigarette (FSC) law was enacted pursuant to Chapter 140 of
the Acts of 2006, “An Act Relative to the Loss of Life Due to Fires Caused by Cigarettes”
and became effective on January 1, 2008. At that time, Massachusetts was the sixth state
in the nation to adopt fire standard compliant cigarette legislation, and by 2011, all 50
states had passed and implemented similar legislation. The manufacturing standard
outlined in the law is designed to reduce the incidence of accidental fires caused by
careless disposal of cigarettes by prompting cigarettes to self-extinguish when not being
actively smoked.
The law requires that all cigarettes sold in the Commonwealth be manufactured with at
least two bands of a less-permeable material in the cigarette paper which when reached by
the combustion process, will restrict airflow and extinguish the burn if the smoker is not
actively pulling air through the cigarette. The standard was designed specifically to
prevent ignition of upholstered furniture and bedding in interior environments with static
air. To certify any individual style of cigarette for sale in Massachusetts, the manufacturer
must test the product in accordance with an internationally accepted standard to verify that

these bands effectively cause the cigarette to self-extinguish, and attest in their application
for certification that the test results met the performance criteria specified by law.
We are pleased to report that since the FSC law went into effect, Massachusetts has seen
a substantial decrease in the number of cigarette fires that occur. From 2001-2007, an
average of 252.4 residential cigarette fires per year caused 8.1 civilian deaths and 21.7
civilian injuries annually. Since the law went into effect, those averages have fallen to
205.2 residential cigarette fires per year, causing 6.1 civilian deaths and 14.1 civilian
injuries annually.
While the data discussed above accounts for all types of cigarette fires, the law was most
specifically intended to reduce interior structure fires where bedding and upholstered
furniture are the material first ignited. These fires often involve individuals with limited
mobility or those who are sleeping or have an otherwise altered level of alertness,
rendering them unable to escape in time. From 2001-2007, an average of 70 cigarette
fires per year originated on bedding or upholstered furniture. Since the inception of the
FSC law in 2008, that average has fallen to 26 per year (Figure 1). Similarly, the average
number of fatalities per year resulting from cigarette fires originating on bedding or
upholstered furniture dropped from 5.3 in 2001-2007 to 2.8 from 2008-2024 (Figure 2).
Further, data shows that the law is preventing nearly $1.7 million a year in property
losses associated with bedding/upholstered furniture cigarette fires (Figure 3) and
reducing the number of firefighter injuries by over 60% (Figure 4). This is the strongest
evidence available that the law is working as intended.
While the total number of cigarette fires per year that originate indoors has decreased
since 2008, the number of cigarette fires that originate outdoors has increased. In each
year from 2001 to 2008, more cigarette fires began indoors than outdoors. In each year
since, more cigarette fires have started outside (Figure 5). The primary driver of this
trend is likely public health efforts which have effectively reduced the tolerance to
indoor smoking across the population. As previously mentioned, the FSC cigarette
standard was designed to prevent fires from igniting on upholstered furniture and
bedding in environments with motionless air, but not on porches, decks, mulch, and
brush with moving air. While outdoor cigarette fires are uniquely dangerous because
smoke alarms are not present to alert residents and they may burn longer before they are
discovered, they have proven to be substantially less deadly than indoor cigarette fires
since 2008 (one civilian death per every 167 outdoor cigarette fires as compared to one
civilian death per every 14 indoor cigarette fires).
To ensure compliance with the FSC law, the Department of Fire Services (DFS)
purchases cigarettes from retailers around the Commonwealth and sends them to an
independent laboratory (MSR Laboratories in Rehoboth) for testing to the ASTM
standard for ignition propensity and the required placement of the lower permeability
bands on the paper. The ignition testing process involves lighting a cigarette that is
placed on 10 layers of filter paper in a controlled chamber, and letting it burn until it
either self-extinguishes or reaches the end of the tobacco column. If an individual
cigarette self-extinguishes before the entire length of the tobacco column burns, it is
considered passing. If it burns the entire length of the tobacco column, it fails. The FSC
law considers 40 replicate tests to be a single test trial and dictates that no more than
25% (10 cigarettes) in a test trial may fail. Cigarettes are also tested to confirm that the

two lowered-permeability bands that are placed in accordance with the law (at least one
of the bands must be greater than 15mm from the lighting end).
To date, DFS has conducted over 245,000 ignition tests and over 22,000 band
placement/measurement tests. The overall passing rate for individual cigarettes that have
undergone ignition testing is 91.5%, and the passing rate for band
placement/measurement is 98.9%. Each style of cigarette is sent to the lab for testing
when it is first certified and then sent back for re-testing on a rolling basis in future years
to ensure ongoing compliance. Cigarettes that do not perform within the confines of the
FSC law are immediately re-tested. If results show consistent failure rates of greater than
25% in test trials of 40 cigarettes, administrative hearings are held with the
manufacturer. In the past, these hearings have resulted in fines, testing cost
reimbursement to DFS, and non-compliant products being removed from retail locations.
Additionally, whenever there is a fatal fire caused by cigarettes, State Troopers assigned
to the Fire and Explosion Investigation Unit determine what brand style of cigarettes
caused the fire, and 20 packs of that exact product are purchased immediately by DFS
staff to be sent out for testing.
Over 10,000 ignition tests were conducted in 2024 with an overall pass rate of 97.6%,
while over 2,000 band measurement tests were conducted with a passing rate of 99.3%.
With all 50 states requiring cigarettes to meet the same testing standard, compliance with
this law is high. Figure 6 in the appendix shows the consistently high passing rates per
year since the program’s inception.
The FSC Program collects certification fees ($3,000 per brand style of cigarette every
three years) to fund this robust testing program. When the ban on the retail sale of
menthol flavored tobacco products was enacted, we projected a significant drop in
program revenue, as approximately 1/3 of the products certified at the time were menthol
flavored. Surprisingly, many manufacturers have continued to pay to certify new
menthol brand styles and recertify existing styles to this point. When the ban became
effective on June 1, 2020, there were 352 menthol brand styles certified. As of December
31, 2024, there were still 166 actively certified menthol products (with 30 recertifications
and 2 new certifications having been processed in 2024), despite the fact that they can no
longer be sold in a retail setting. Regardless of this surprising pattern, we have planned
for the likelihood that revenue from menthol flavored brand styles will eventually cease
entirely and will still be able to run a comprehensive testing program supported entirely
by certification fees for non-flavored products for the foreseeable future.
The Executive Office of Administration and Finance did transfer $769,451.00 out of the
FSC Trust Fund in November of 2024 under the authority of M.G.L. c. 29, s. 13A. We
have assessed the impact of this transfer on our existing ten-year budget projections and
have no concerns about our ability to achieve the objectives of the program while
maintaining a sufficient operating balance over that period.
While the last time that DFS conducted an enforcement action against a manufacturer for
the sale of products that did not meet the required ignition standard was in 2017, the
agency did address administrative non-compliance issues with two manufacturers in
2024. The first case, involving R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, began in 2023 after
DFS denied a recertification request for a significant number of cigarettes because they

had not been tested in accordance with the ignition standard within 365 days of the
renewal date. Limited efforts were made by R.J. Reynolds to correct this issue, and an
abnormally high number of products were allowed to expire. DFS contacted R.J.
Reynolds in early 2024 to confirm that those products were no longer being sold in the
Commonwealth, and R.J. Reynolds acknowledged that they had in fact continued
offering 45 of the 142 products in question for sale in Massachusetts. After this
exchange, R.J. Reynolds took prompt action to test and recertify the expired products,
and also removed 20,000 packs of cigarettes that had entered the commerce chain in
Massachusetts while expired from wholesale and retail locations.
Later in 2024, as part of its standard practices, DFS sent a letter to U.S. Flue-Cured
Tobacco memorializing the expiration of seven cigarette styles that they had not
requested to be renewed. The manufacturer immediately responded to inform DFS that
the failure to request renewal was an oversight and that the products were still being
offered for sale in Massachusetts. Per direction from DFS, they removed all products that
had entered the marketplace during the lapse period from retail locations (primarily
Cumberland Farms stores) until a completed renewal request was submitted to DFS
approximately three weeks later. While these two issues were administrative in nature
and did not involve the introduction of any unsafe cigarettes into the retail environment,
they demonstrate to the manufacturers the diligence with which the Commonwealth
oversees the FSC law.
Overall, compliance with the Fire Standard Compliant Cigarette Law remains high, and it
continues to have a positive impact on the lives of the citizens of Massachusetts by
preventing unnecessary loss of life and property as it was initially intended to.
As always, I thank you for your attention to this program and for all the work you do to
advance fire safety for the citizens and firefighters of the Commonwealth.
Sincerely,
