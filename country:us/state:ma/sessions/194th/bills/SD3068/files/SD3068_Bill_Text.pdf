Dear Members of the General Court:
I am pleased to submit this Report to the Legislature: Commonwealth Virtual Schools,
pursuant to G.L. c. 71, § 94(p).
A Commonwealth Virtual School (CMVS) is a public school operated by a board of trustees
whose teachers primarily teach from a remote location using the Internet or other
computer-based methods and whose students are not required to be located at the
physical premises of the school. Like a charter school, a virtual school is an autonomous,
single-school district that operates independently of any existing school district.
The Board of Elementary and Secondary Education (Board) grants a certificate to the board
of trustees of a virtual school for not less than three years and not more than five years, as
determined by the Board. The school and its board then become a state entity, directly
accountable to the Board and the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education
(Department). A virtual school may not discriminate in the enrollment of students based on
race, color, national origin, creed, sex, gender identity, ethnicity, sexual orientation, mental
or physical disability, age, ancestry, athletic performance, special need, English language
proficiency, or academic achievement.
As of 2022-23, the time period covered by this report, the Board has granted two virtual
school certificates, one to the Greater Commonwealth Virtual School (GCVS) and one to
the TEC Connections Academy Commonwealth Virtual School (TECCA). Both schools
enroll students statewide. These schools enrolled a total of 4,095 students as of October 1,
2022.
If you have any questions about this report, please contact Director Alison Bagg at 781-338-
3218.
Sincerely,
Russell D. Johnston
Acting Commissioner of Elementary and Secondary Education

Introduction
The Department of Elementary and Secondary Education respectfully submits this Report
to the Legislature: Commonwealth Virtual Schools pursuant to G.L. c. 71 § 94(p):
“On or before September 1, the commissioner shall prepare a report on the
implementation and impact of this section, including, but not limited to:(1) the fiscal
impact on sending districts; (2) any necessary adjustments to tuition rates, including
whether the amount should vary based on grade or type of school and the
appropriate mechanism for funding virtual schools; (3) information on course
completion and student attendance and participation rates; (4) the academic
achievement of students attending commonwealth virtual schools; (5) the level of
supervision or support needed for students in elementary and middle school; (6) the
support necessary or helpful to ensure that students successfully complete online
courses; (7) the professional development virtual school teachers require; (8) the
appropriate enrollment limit for a virtual school, if any, including information about
wait lists; and (9) the need for any changes to the commonwealth virtual school
program.”
A Commonwealth Virtual School (CMVS) is a public school operated by a board of trustees
where Massachusetts licensed teachers primarily teach from a remote location using the
Internet or other computer-based methods, and where students are not required to be
located at the physical premises of the school. The statute permits up to ten virtual schools
to operate in the Commonwealth at any time.
As of the 2022-2023 school year, the Board of Elementary and Secondary Education
(Board) had granted two virtual school certificates, one to the Greater Commonwealth
Virtual School (GCVS) and one to the TEC Connections Academy Commonwealth Virtual
School (TECCA).1 Both schools enroll students statewide. As of October 1, 2022, these
schools enrolled a total of 4,095 students including 1,155 from GCVS and 2,940 from
TECCA for FY23, the period addressed in this report.
1 GCVS has a three-year certificate to operate from July 1, 2019 through June 30, 2022. TECCA has a five-year
certificate to operate from July 1, 2017 through June 30, 2022.

Greater Commonwealth Virtual School
Greater Commonwealth Virtual School (GCVS), formerly Greenfield Commonwealth Virtual
School (GCVS), first opened in 2010 as the Massachusetts Virtual Academy of Greenfield
(MAVA) under the innovation school law (G.L.c.71, § 92). On January 2, 2013, Governor
Patrick signed into law Chapter 379 of the Acts of 2012, “An Act Establishing
Commonwealth Virtual Schools” (Act), most of which is codified as G.L. c. 71, § 942. By
statute, MAVA ceased to exist on July 1, 2013. Section 6 of the Act required the Board of
Elementary and Secondary Education (Board) to grant a certificate to operate a
Commonwealth of Massachusetts Virtual School (CMVS) to MAVA upon submission of a
timely application that addressed the information specified in the statute. GCVS received
its certificate on June 25, 2013, and began operating as a CMVS on July 1, 2013, serving 750
students in grades K through 12.
The school’s board of trustees oversees the executive director, who oversees the school
administration. The school administration includes the director of business services, the
director of teaching and learning (also referred to as the principal for grades K through 12),
the flex program director (to oversee the asynchronous Edgenuity program), the director of
information technology, the director of special education, the director of instructional
technology, the director of accountability and support services, and the family engagement
coordinator. The principal oversees the assistant principal for grades K through 8, the
assistant principal for grades 9 through 12, and the guidance counselors. The principal and
assistant principals share oversight of the general education teachers. The director of
accountability and support services oversees English as a Second Language (ESL) and Title
I teachers, and the director of special education oversees the special education teachers,
the support center coordinator, and the school adjustment officer. The family engagement
coordinator oversees the family engagement liaisons.
On June 2014, the Board voted to place GCVS on probation for the remainder of the
school's certificate term (until June 30, 2016) with conditions requiring the school to:
submit board of trustees minutes to the Department of Elementary and Secondary
Education (Department); submit a final contract with K12, Inc.; align its curriculum with the
Massachusetts curriculum frameworks; submit a comprehensive evaluation of its
academic program; submit an action plan outlining strategies to improve academic
performance; and demonstrate significant academic improvement by 2015. In February
2016, the Board renewed the school’s certificate and extended the school’s probationary
status. The probationary conditions required the school to: limit its maximum enrollment to
750 students for grades K through 12; submit board of trustees meeting materials; submit
weekly student enrollment reports; submit projected budgets to meet requirement for
enrolling at least 5 percent of students from Greenfield; submit a corrective action plan to
ensure at least 95 percent of students and student groups participated in MCAS; establish
3

an escrow account to pay for potential closure; and to demonstrate significant and
sustained academic improvement by 2017.
In October 2017, the Board approved an amendment for the school to terminate its
contract with K12, Inc. and to adopt the Canvas learning management system by
Instructure, Inc. The school adopted a new curriculum, including EngageNY (grades K
through 5, English language arts, and mathematics), and Florida Virtual Schools Global
(FLVS) (grades 6 through 12, all subjects). Then in January 2018, the commissioner
approved an amendment for the school to amend its mission statement. In March 2018,
the Board extended the school’s probationary status, maintained the prior probationary
conditions, and added a new condition related to the provision of services for English
learners.
In March 2019, the Board removed the school from probation and renewed the school’s
certificate with conditions requiring the school to: submit board of trustees meeting
materials and weekly student enrollment reports; enroll a maximum of 750 students;
provide the Department with updates on the implementation of its plan for serving English
learners; submit a comprehensive evaluation of the school’s mathematics, English
language arts, and science programs by 2019; submit a comprehensive action plan for
improving academic performance and addressing other areas for improvement by 2019;
and demonstrate academic success by providing evidence that the school has exhibited
significant and sustained academic improvement in mathematics, English language arts,
and science on the statewide assessment for all student subgroups by 2021.
In June 2019, the GCVS teachers voted to join a union and are now an affiliate of the
American Federation of Teachers (AFT). GCVS has negotiated the teachers’ contract with
the AFT. In April 2021, the contract was ratified and signed by all teachers and the GCVS
Board of Trustees.
In October 2019, the commissioner approved a number of amendment requests to change
elements of GCVS’ educational program by adding supports for students (an in-person
support center for students who struggle to advance in the school’s academic program),
adopting two new curricula (Accelerate Education for grades K-5 and Edgenuity for a 9-12
asynchronous program), and offering students dual enrollment at Greenfield Community
College (GCC).
In July 2020, the commissioner approved an amendment to change the school’s
curriculum for grades K through 5 from Accelerate Education to the newly released
curriculum from FLVS for all subjects for synchronous programs. This change allowed the
school to implement FLVS across all grades. At that time, the commissioner also approved
an amendment to increase the school’s maximum enrollment by an additional 250 seats,
for a new maximum enrollment of 1,000 until the end of the school’s current certificate
(June 30, 2022). This granting of additional seats was explicitly conditioned on GCVS
demonstrating that its K-12 curriculum is fully aligned with the Massachusetts curriculum
4

frameworks by September 15, 2020. After a second request from GCVS, the maximum
enrollment was amended again, in September 2020, with an increase of 50 additional
seats, for a new maximum enrollment of 1,050 until the end of the current certificate.
In December 2020, the Department conducted an Accountability Review of GCVS and then
in January 2021, the commissioner approved the school’s request to report on a new
accountability plan.
In September 2021, the commissioner approved an amendment to change the school’s
name from Greenfield Commonwealth Virtual School to Greater Commonwealth Virtual
School and to change the Learning Management System (LMS) from Canvas to Schoology.
In February 2022, the commissioner approved the school’s request to increase its
maximum enrollment by an additional 150 seats, for a new maximum of 1,200 seats, in
order to meet elevated demand for students who are unable to attend school in person
because of a medical condition. That same month, the commissioner approved the
school’s request to amend its enrollment policy to provide the first order enrollment
preference to students who are unable to attend school in-person because of a medical
condition.
The school has implemented leadership changes during the certificate term. In July 2019,
GCVS created the position for and hired the family engagement coordinator. In August
2019, a vice principal for grades K through 5 was hired and in 2021 the vice principal’s role
was expanded to oversee grades K through 8. In September 2019, the asynchronous
Edgenuity program director was hired. In June 2020 the responsibilities of the director of
special education and student services position were split into two roles: the director of
special education and the director of accountability and student services. In August 2020,
a vice principal for grades 9 through 12 as hired. In December 2020, GCVS hired a new
director of instructional technology. In August 2021, GCVS hired a new support center
coordinator.
Pursuant to CMR 52.11, and in accordance with the Department’s guidelines, on June 30,
2021, GCVS applied to renew its certificate. The Department conducted a renewal
inspection on November 22-23, 2021 and the report from this inspection was issued to the
school in March 2022. At its March 22, 2022, meeting, in accordance with G.L. c. 71, §94,
and 603 CMR 52.00, the Board renewed the certificate of GCVS for an additional four-year
period from July 1, 2022 through June 30, 2026 with a maximum enrollment of 1,200
students. Further, pursuant to 603 CMR 52.12, the Board imposed conditions that the
school is required to meet as recommended by Commissioner Jeffrey C. Riley in his
memorandum to the Board dated March 22, 2022
In November 2022, the commissioner approved an amendment to the school’s
Accountability Plan for the 2022- 2026 certificate term. December 2022, the commissioner
approved an amendment request to modify the school’s instructional methodology and
curriculum to include a semi-autonomous independent learning (SAIL) program for a
5

limited number of students in grades 3-5. The school also sought and received approval for
additional technical changes to its certificate. Upon the school’s successful renewal, the
school updated and revised a number of policies and procedures requiring amendments to
the GCVS certificate. In February 2023, the commissioner approved an amendment to the
board of trustees’ bylaws. In March 2023, the commissioner approved an amendment to
the schools Expulsion Policy and Complaint Procedures.
TEC Connections Academy Commonwealth Virtual School
The Education Cooperative (TEC) as the “founder entity” submitted an application for a
virtual certificate to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education (Department)
in the spring of 2013; on February 25, 2014, the Board of Elementary and Secondary
Education (Board) approved a 3-year operating certificate for TEC Connections Academy
Commonwealth Virtual School (TECCA) under the state's virtual school legislation
(Chapter 379 of the Acts of 2012). TECCA opened on July 1, 2014, serving 1,000 students in
grades K-12. The school expanded to its original maximum enrollment of 2,000 by the third
year of its operation.
The school’s board of trustees oversees the superintendent, who oversees the district
leadership team. The school district leadership team includes the business manager,
human resources, executive assistant to administration, director of assessment,
instruction, and professional development, director and assistant director of counseling
services, director of special education, assistant director of special education, principal of
elementary school, principal of middle school, and principal of high school. The
superintendent and school principals share oversight of the general education teachers.
The director and assistant director of counseling services share oversight of the school’s
guidance counselors, family engagement coordinators, social workers, and 504
coordinators. The director of special education oversees special education teachers.
In June and August 2014, the commissioner approved two amendment requests allowing
the school to add three new board members to TECCA’s board of trustees. Then in
November 2015, the commissioner approved an amendment for the school to amend the
financial and operational arrangement between TECCA and Connections Education (CE),
the entity that provides the school with its LMS, curriculum, and additional services as
specified in the contract.
In May 2016, the commissioner approved an amendment for the school to amend its board
of trustees’ bylaws. Then in September 2016, the commissioner approved an amendment
for the school to amend its contract with CE regarding human resources management.
In February 2017, the Board renewed the school’s certificate for a five-year term (until June
20, 2022) with conditions requiring the school to submit a detailed plan for ensuring that
not less than 95 percent of students participate in the Spring 2017 MCAS tests by March
6

2017 and submit a detailed plan for serving students who are English language learners by
April 2017. TECCA met both conditions by the corresponding deadlines.
In August 2018, the commissioner approved an amendment to increase the school’s
maximum enrollment by an additional 300 seats, for a new maximum enrollment of 2,300.
The Commissioner also approved four additional amendment requests: to amend TECCA’s
contract with CE, to amend TECCA’s mission statement and add two additional pathways
(i.e., accelerated, extended programs), and to add a new board member to TECCA’s board
of trustees.
In November 2019, the commissioner approved an amendment for the school to amend its
contract with CE to include accounting (expense reporting, tracking, receivables,
facilitating accounts payable excluding any payment to CE), audit support, and provision of
Human Resources support during a time of administrative transition.
In January 2020, the interim superintendent created the district leadership team including
new leadership positions of director and assistant director of elementary school, director
and assistant director of middle and high school, dean of students, 504 coordinator, and
registrar. In July 2020, the interim superintendent transitioned to TECCA’s new
superintendent, replacing the former superintendent who had served in the role since July
2015.
In August 2020, the commissioner approved the school’s request to increase its maximum
enrollment by an additional 400 seats, for a new maximum of 2,700 in order to meet
elevated demand for virtual programming due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The
commissioner also approved an amendment for the school to amend its contract with CE
to include partner school leadership and strategic account relationship support.
In March 2020, TECCA teachers started negotiations to become an affiliate of the
Massachusetts Teacher’s Association (MTA). In June 2020 MTA was certified at TECCA and
negotiations for a contract continued until September 2021.
On January 20-21, 2021, the Department conducted an Accountability Review of TECCA.
The review team issued ratings in the areas of academic program success, organizational
viability, and faithfulness to certificate, the guiding principles of virtual school
accountability. In February 2021, the commissioner approved the school’s requests to
amend the school’s enrollment policy and to report on a new accountability plan.
In October 2021, the commissioner approved the school’s request to increase its
maximum enrollment by an additional 300 seats, for a new maximum of 3,000 in order to
meet elevated demand for students who are unable to attend to school in-person because
of the student’s medical condition. That same month, the commissioner approved the
school’s request to amend its enrollment policy to provide the first order enrollment
7

preference to students who are unable to attend school in-person because of the student’s
medical condition.
On August 17, 2021, TECCA requested another contract amendment with Connections
Education. The commissioner approved this amendment on August 23, 2021. The
amendment removed PSLT Support Services, Pathways programs, and Chromebook
technology. The fee schedule was adjusted, reducing substitute teacher fees, monthly fees
for students without PSLT, alternative pricing for staff not using laptops, and increasing
elective course instruction fees. The school also restructured its leadership team at the
elementary, middle, and high school to replace the director and assistant directors with an
elementary school principal, middle school principal, and high school principal.
Pursuant to CMR 52.11, and in accordance with the Department’s guidelines, on June 9,
2021, TECCA applied to renew its certificate. The Department conducted a renewal
inspection on October 9 and November 20, 2021 and the report from this inspection was
issued to the school on March 2022. At its March 22, 2022 meeting, in accordance with
G.L. c. 71, §94, and 603 CMR 52.00, the Board renewed the certificate of TECCA for an
additional four-year period from July 1, 2022 through June 30, 2026 with a maximum
enrollment of 3,000 students. Further, pursuant to 603 CMR 52.12, the Board imposed
conditions that the school is required to meet as recommended by Commissioner Jeffrey
C. Riley in his memorandum to the Board dated March 22, 2022.
On August 2022, the commissioner approved TECCA’s request to amend the contract
between TECCA and Connections Education and extend it for an additional year, as the
governing board worked to renegotiate a new contract. Upon the school’s successful
renewal, the school updated and revised a number of policies and procedures requiring
amendments to the TECCA certificate. In February 2023, the commissioner approved an
amendment to the board of trustees’ Bylaws, Complaint Policy, and Accountability Plan for
the remainer of its certificate term through 2026. In April 2023, the commissioner approved
an amendment to the school’s Expulsion Policy.
Fiscal Impact on SendingDistricts
The virtual school statute, at G.L. c. 71, § 94(k), funds a CMVS based upon the funding for
school choice under G.L. c. 76, § 12B: the school district of residence of each student
enrolled in the CMVS is charged a set tuition, and the Department transfers the funds from
the district to the CMVS. Tuition is based on full year enrollment and is prorated if a student
is enrolled in the CMVS for only a portion of the school year.
8

The default tuition rate for a student enrolled in a CVMS is the school choice tuition rate of
$5,000.3 The Board, in consultation with the Operational Services Division (OSD), may
approve a rate higher than $5,000 in CMVS certificates provided the rate does not exceed
the state average per pupil foundation budget for students of the same classification and
grade level. G.L. c. 71, § 94(k); 603 CMR 52.07(1). At its December 7, 2017 meeting, the
Board voted to amend the certificates of GCVS and TECCA to specify a tuition rate4 of
$8,265 per pupil, effective for FY19, with $75 per pupil retained by the Department for
program administration. Additionally, the Board voted to delegate to the Commissioner
authority to adjust this rate annually for inflation for the remainder of the schools' current
certificates and amend their certificates accordingly. In March 2022, the Board approved
certificates for both CMVS that included the higher rate and continued the Commissioner’s
authority to adjust the tuition rate annually for inflation. The Board-approved CMVS tuition
rate does not change over the course of a fiscal year.
In FY23, the state average per pupil foundation budget was $14,2635. In FY23, districts were
charged $9,259 per full-time pupil enrolled in a CMVS6. In FY23, GCVS and TECCA received
a per pupil tuition amount of $9,184, which equals the district per-pupil tuition amount,
less $75 per pupil retained by the Department for program administration, as permitted by
statute.
In FY23, the virtual schools received $41,437,450 in tuition payments from 255 districts of
residence. While enrollment varies from district to district, the following four districts
accounted for approximately 20 percent of virtual school tuition and enrollment: Boston
(7.1% percent) Springfield (5.8 percent), Worcester (4.2 percent), New Bedford (2.7
percent). A summary of FY23 tuition payments is provided in Appendix B.
Course Completion and Student Attendance and
Participation Rates
GCVS and TECCA provide 425 instructional hours in kindergarten, 900 hours in grades 1-8,
and 990 hours in grades 9-12 in accordance with state regulations.
Both schools offer flexibility in terms of the time of day when students participate. Teachers
and “learning coaches” (students’ parents/guardians) take attendance and monitor the
hours of schoolwork completed. In FY23, GCVS reported an attendance rate of 83.1
percent and TECCA reported an attendance rate of 86.6 percent.
3 The tuition for special education students is the cost of providing the special education required by the student.
G.L. c. 71, § 94(k).
4 Until December 2017, the CMVS tuition rate remained at $6,700, less $75 per pupil retained by the Department
(total rate of $6,625 per pupil paid to each CMVS).

While each school’s calendar provides for holidays and vacations during which teachers
are not available, students may continue to do schoolwork and access the online learning
management system at any time during the school year. Attendance is based on courses
completion and not “seat time” – while each school expects all students to complete their
coursework by the end of a typical semester or school year, students may proceed through
the curriculum at their own pace.
Course completion data for GCVS and TECCA are provided in Tables 1 and 2. Because
many students arrive in school after the beginning of the school year or transferred out of
the school prior to the end of the school year, course completion data are only reported for
students enrolled in the schools for a full academic year, as defined in Table 1.

students, high need students, comparable percentages of students with disabilities, and
lower percentages of English language learners, and non-native English speakers than
statewide averages.8

8 The “high needs” category includes any student identified as economically disadvantaged, English learners, or
students with disabilities.
12

According to the enrollment policies of both schools, eligibility for enrollment in a specific
grade requires a student to have successfully completed the preceding grade. Each school
reviews academic documentation to ensure accurate grade level assignments and course
placements.
Both TECCA and GCVS reported having greater demand than in past years. Since the
emergence of COVID-19 and the subsequent closures of brick-and-mortar schools
statewide, families have sought admission to both CMVSs in unprecedented numbers.
During the FY23 school year the waitlists for GCVS averaged approximately 167 and TECCA
averaged approximately 340 students.
Academic Achievement
The purpose of the statewide accountability system is to provide clear, actionable
information about school and district performance. The Department did not issue school,
district, or state accountability determinations for the 2019-2020 school year due to the
cancellation of state assessments and school closures related to COVID-19. Additionally,
the Department did not issue school, district, or state accountability determinations in
2021; spring 2021 MCAS administration included a partial test for grades 3-8 and some
grade 3-8 students took the assessment remotely. In 2022, schools administered full MCAS
assessments in grades 3-8 and 10. The Department published some, but not all, of the
indicators included in the statewide accountability system.
A summary of performance data from 2023 for both schools is provided in Appendix C.

Supervision and Support for Students in Elementary
and Middle School
Much of the responsibility for student learning is placed on the “learning coach,” typically
the student’s parent/guardian, particularly in the early grades. Learning coaches facilitate
their student’s progress through daily lessons and help manage the student’s schedule and
pacing through the online program. Both schools have systems in place for closely
monitoring student progress on a course-by-course basis. At GCVS and TECCA, guidance
counselors and family engagement coordinators help learning coaches and students
adjust to the virtual environment, support students’ nonacademic needs, and create a
sense of community through face-to-face and virtual activities.
GCVS reports that at the elementary level (grades K-5), in 2022-23, students received daily
full class and small group live instruction in core academic subjects. At the middle school
level (grades 6-8) student received 5 live lessons a week in each core academic subject.
Art, Music, Physical Education, and Computer electives rotate each quarter and met live
once per week. GCVS employs Family Engagement Liaisons (FELs) who provide support
and assistance in addition to the support provided by the classroom teachers. Teachers
alert the FELs to any individual family concerns who, in turn, work with those families on an
individual basis to ensure proper support for students at home. As part of the school
structure, GCVS also uses the following supports: Title I and English as a Second Language
(ESL) services; Family Engagement; contracts for students with particular needs; Special
14

Education supports, in person meet-ups, extra help from teachers, dual enrollment with
Greenfield Community College, use of GCVS Chromebooks with added security measures.
TECCA reports that students in the elementary, middle, and high school are supported by
their homeroom teachers and subject teachers, in addition to the supervision provided by
the learning coach. Homeroom teachers are responsible for biweekly contact with each of
their students, and during these calls, the teachers review the student’s overall progress in
lessons and assignments, often with the learning coach present as well, depending on the
grade level of the student. Subject teachers monitor student progress on a regular basis
and analyze student performance on assessments so they can differentiate instruction,
provide support to students in a small group or 1:1, as well as provide resources to support
struggling students. In addition, the learning coach, who is often the student’s caretaker,
facilitates their student’s progress and helps manage the student’s schedule, attendance,
pacing through the online program, and provides outreach to teachers when help is
needed. TECCA has additional support staff who also work to support all students to adjust
to the virtual environment, support students’ both academic and non-academic needs,
and assist in creating a sense of community through other face-to-face and virtual
interactions and activities.
Support for Online Course Completion
As indicated above, both GCVS and TECCA, a “learning coach,” typically the student’s
parent/guardian, facilitates student progress through daily lessons, with flexibility in terms
of pace and scheduling. The schools expect learning coaches to spend three to five hours
daily supporting students and students to spend five to six hours daily on schoolwork and
homework. Teachers are expected to manage all facets of the student’s instructional
experience and engage in regular communication with learning coaches and students via
email, telephone, and online meetings. Further, both schools arrange face-to-face
activities, such as field trips, throughout the school year.
GCVS
In 2022-23, GCVS supported its students in both the live and asynchronous platforms. All
live sessions are recorded so that students can access them at any time. Teachers also
schedule small group and individual intervention sessions as needed throughout the week,
which may be recorded. Throughout the class, teachers constantly monitor a chat area,
virtual whiteboard area where both students and teachers can post items, and verbal
interaction via microphones or headsets. Break-out rooms can be created for individual or
small groups of students during the live session to allow for differentiated
instruction/assignments as needed. In terms of the GCVS “flex” (asynchronous) courses
there are staff dedicated to supporting students in the asynchronous program, ESL staff
work to monitor and shelter material, and the school provides a summer extension time.
15

The school also used ESSER funds to hire over 30 tutors to support students at all grade
levels and in both the live and async platforms.
In FY23, there were three full time Title I teachers and one paraprofessional. In addition to
providing support for students performing below grade level, the high school Title I math
teacher worked with the math team to develop and run Math Essentials courses, as well as
an MCAS prep class. GCVS special education teachers support students with IEPs. Two
English Learner (EL) teachers provided supports to students whose first language is not
English. All general and special education teachers are either Sheltered English Immersion
(SEI) endorsed or in the process of obtaining it, which enables them to support ELs in the
regular classroom. Students who require accommodation under Section 504 have their
assignments and curriculum modified by classroom teachers, as necessary, although
many students enrolling with 504 plans found that the District Curriculum Accommodation
Plan (DCAP) was sufficient to meet their needs. Students are identified for interventions
and/or services are referred to the Tiered System of Support process, monitored by the
three assistant principals and the Family Engagement Team.
TECCA
For 2022-23, TECCA reported that staff work to ensure families/students are aware of all
expectations for high-quality online learning outcomes. Once enrolled, all
students/families receive a welcome call typically within five school days by a homeroom
teacher to ensure students/families begin the year with personal connection to a teacher,
set up regular bi-weekly supportive contact for the student, and to begin establishing an
understanding of the expectations both students and families will need to meet as the year
progresses.
TECCA also reports that it has a technical support system available to students and
families who may be experiencing technical difficulties impeding their access to the school
and course materials. Students, caretakers, and learning coaches have access to
technical (hardware, software, and Connexus) support services from both Connections
Education (TECCA’s contracted partner) personnel and by TECCA faculty and staff.
Students, caretakers, and learning coaches have access to our extensive technical
support services via webmail and email 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, and can call into
the helpdesk.
Additionally, TECCA has the role of student success coach in the middle and high schools
to monitor a variety of student metrics, including academic performance, attendance, and
course completion status. Student success coaches work directly with a group of
homeroom students and complete a biweekly check in calls/meetings. In addition to
student success coaches, general education teachers, guidance counselors, social
workers, special education teachers, and virtual counselors, also monitor and support
students who may require an additional layer of support and/or service. At the elementary
level, grade level teachers or special education case managers act as homeroom teachers
and perform these same responsibilities.
16

TECCA also has a family engagement coordinator for students who are struggling to meet
engagement and attendance expectations. The staff work with both the student and the
learning coach to create an academic plan in which the student/family sets goals and
tracks progress toward meeting those goals.
To support teachers and help to identify any gaps in completion or engagement, the District
Leadership Team (DLT) met biweekly to review and discuss at-risk students. School leaders
then used this information in their biweekly touch bases with their individual staff members
to ensure that all students were receiving the support they needed. The DLT uses metrics to
plan for upcoming professional development and ensure teachers had the resources and
tools they needed to best engage students in learning.
Professional Development
According to GCVS, teachers met on a regular basis throughout the 2022-2023 school year.
GCVS continued to hold full faculty meetings and/or team meetings by grade cluster to
discuss data and share instructional strategies. GCVS created Professional Learning
Communities (PLSs) to map the core curriculum. GCVS’s instructional leadership team
met every other week. GCVS created time for special education teachers and general
education teachers to collaborate multiple times a week.
GCVS began the 2022-23 school year with four days of Professional Development in which
the entire staff participates in presentations. Topics included: the evaluation process and
school goals; co-teaching and inclusive practices; teaching students with IEPs and 504
plans: review of regulations and processes; and specific technical tools and programs
used by GCVS. Throughout the year, GCVS also provided content- and department-specific
learning opportunities, such as training in the new ESL monitoring software.
TECCA reported multiple professional developmental opportunities for its faculty and staff.
Professional development topics included: New Staff Orientation, Mentoring and
Induction; Special Populations Support and Differentiation; Power BI; Center for Behavioral
Health, Equity and Leadership in Schools (BEHLS) Leadership Learning Team (LLT)
Leadership Development and Coaching; BEHLS Teacher Leadership Professional
Development; MCAS and STAR Trainings; Youth Mental Health First Aid; Book Studies;
Supporting Multilingual Students Across the Content Areas; and Advisory.
Recommended Changes to the Commonwealth
Virtual School Program
In FY20, the Department engaged consultants to help update the Commonwealth Virtual
School Performance Criteria (Criteria). The Criteria were first developed in 2014 and
17

required updates. During the fall of 2019, the Department began a substantial review and
revision process to update these Criteria to incorporate national best practices and
standards for virtual school performance. By November 2022, the Department published
the Criteria, which is in effect during the CMVS’ current certificate terms (2022 through
2026).
Pursuant to the virtual school statute, G.L. c. 71, § 94(j), and the CMVS regulations at 603
CMR 52.11, on March 22, 2202, the Board of Elementary and Secondary Education (Board)
renewed the certificates for GCVS and TECCA for an additional four years. The
Commissioner recommended, and the Board also voted to place conditions9 on the
schools’ certificates to address concerns related to academic performance and
governance issues.
Using quantitative and qualitative evidence, the Department evaluated the performance of
both CMVSs against the statutory requirements for renewal10 and the Commonwealth
Virtual School Performance Criteria. Based on evidence gathered, neither school was
found to have fully delivered on the promises of its mission. In determining conditions, the
Commissioner of Elementary and Secondary Education carefully considered each school’s
history, each school’s student population, the limited accountability data due to the
pandemic, and the track record of virtual schools in Massachusetts and nationwide. Key
considerations follow.
Focus group interviews with families of CMVS students demonstrate continued demand for
a virtual option because it benefits students with unique circumstances. Evidence
provided by families indicates that CMVSs provide a safe educational option for students
with social and emotional needs, students who experienced bullying in traditional public
schools, students with chronic medical conditions that make consistent attendance in-
person difficult, and academically or athletically gifted students who desire more flexible
programming. As noted in the table below, both GCVS and TECCA enroll students with
disabilities/504 plans and low-income students at rates above state averages. Additionally,
both CMVS enroll English learners at rates below state averages.
Students with Students with Students who are English
disabilities 504 plans low income learners
% of GCVS 22.5 7.0 57.7 1.7
% of TECCA 20.6 9.0 54.0 1.4
% of State 18.9 5.0 43.8 11.0
9 Pursuant to 603 CMR 52.12(1), the “Board or Commissioner may impose conditions on a virtual school's
certificate for violations of law, failure to improve student achievement, failure to comply with the terms of the
virtual school's certificate, or failure to remain viable.”
10 “When deciding on certificate renewal, the board shall consider progress made in student academic achievement
and whether the school has met its obligations and commitments under the certificate.” G.L. c. 71, §94(j).
18

Neither school’s results have consistently met academic standards set by the statewide
accountability system. Despite coordinating testing locations across the state each year,
both schools have struggled to meet the state assessment participation levels required by
law, both schools produce results that are well below state averages,11 and both schools
have been identified as performing in the lowest percentile levels across the state. Results
of these two virtual schools are similar to the academic results seen in virtual schools
nationwide.12 Further, the COVID-19 pandemic forced changes to MCAS administrations in
2020 and 2021; these changes created a lack of academic data making it difficult to assess
academic progress during the schools’ current certificate term. Renewing the schools’
certificates with conditions that clearly outline areas for improvement or correction gives
both schools additional time to demonstrate academic improvement and retains the
Board’s ability to impose probation should the school’s performance worsen.
For detailed information on the conditions placed on each certificate see the March 14,
2022 memorandum from the Commissioner of Elementary and Secondary Education to the
Board of Elementary and Secondary Education.
During the 2022-23 school year, both GCVS and TECCA submitted evidence to the
Department to demonstrate progress towards meeting these conditions. Also, upon
renewal, the Department worked with both schools to revise and refine key organizational
policies (e.g. boards of trustees’ bylaws, enrollment policies, accountability plans).
Establishing and refreshing robust policies and procedures, can help each CMVS achieve
more efficiency, consistency, and overall effectiveness, laying the groundwork for long-
term sustainability and success. In addition, the Department continues to collaborate with
others on a regional and national level to identify the best ways to support high-quality
virtual educational programs, curriculum, and instructional practices.
11 Student achievement rates at TECCA in 2021 exceeded or were comparable to state averages; students in grades 3
through 8 took modified MCAS examinations and virtual testing was allowed.

agreement entered into by more than 1 school district or by an education collaborative shall not be counted
towards this limit if the commonwealth virtual school only enrolls students who reside in the school district,
22

in the school districts that signed the agreement or in the school districts that are members of an education
collaborative. The board may authorize a single board of trustees to manage more than 1 commonwealth
virtual school; provided, however, that each school is issued its own certificate. Under no circumstances
shall the total number of full-time students attending commonwealth virtual schools exceed 2 per cent of the
total number of students attending public schools in the commonwealth. In the case of a commonwealth
virtual school that is established by a school district, not less than 5 per cent of the students enrolled in the

whether proposed schools will create or enhance the opportunity for students to attend virtual schools in all
grades from kindergarten through grade 12.
(d) A commonwealth virtual school shall operate under a certificate issued by the board and be governed by
a board of trustees. If a district or education collaborative operates the commonwealth virtual school, then
the board of trustees shall be appointed by the member school committees of the district or the collaborative
board. The board of trustees of a commonwealth virtual school, upon being granted a certificate, shall be
deemed to be a public agent authorized by the commonwealth to supervise and control the commonwealth
virtual school. A commonwealth virtual school shall be deemed to be a state agency under chapter 268A and
members of the board of trustees shall be deemed to be public employees under chapter 268B.
(e) The board of trustees of a commonwealth virtual school shall have all powers necessary or desirable for
carrying out its virtual program, including, but not limited to, the power to:
(1) adopt a name and corporate seal; provided, that any name selected shall include the words

applicable state and federal health and safety laws and regulations.
(g) The board may waive requirements that students who attend a commonwealth virtual school, attend
school for a minimum number of hours or days each school year and may permit students to earn credits by
demonstrating competency in a grade or subject matter. Students in commonwealth virtual schools shall be
required to meet the same academic standards, testing and portfolio requirements set by the board for
students in other public schools.
To ensure that students are learning and demonstrating their knowledge, each commonwealth virtual school
shall ensure that students are provided, in each credit-bearing course, multiple synchronous learning
opportunities with their teachers in which students are required to participate and share their knowledge.
(h) Commonwealth virtual schools shall comply with chapter 71B; provided, however, that the fiscal
responsibility for a student with a disability enrolled in or determined to require a private day or residential
school shall remain with the school district where the student resides. If a commonwealth virtual school
expects that a student with a disability enrolled in the commonwealth virtual school may be in need of the
services of a private day or residential school, it shall convene an individualized education program team
meeting for the student. Notice of the team meeting shall be provided to the special education department of
the school district in which the child resides at least 5 days in advance. Personnel from the school district in
which the child resides shall participate in the team meeting concerning future placement of and services for
the child and shall agree on the needed services for the child.
(i) No teacher shall be hired by a commonwealth virtual school who is not certified pursuant to section 38G.
Nothing herein shall preclude such teacher from using digital content which may include, but not be limited
to, guest lecturers.
(j) A certificate to operate a commonwealth virtual school granted by the board shall be for not less than 3
years and not more than 5 years, as determined by the board. The board shall develop procedures and
guidelines for amending, revoking and renewing a virtual school’s certificate. When deciding on certificate
renewal, the board shall consider progress made in student academic achievement and whether the school
has met its obligations and commitments under the certificate.
(k) The amount of tuition per pupil a school district shall pay for a student residing in the district who is
enrolled in a commonwealth virtual school shall be the school choice tuition amount, which shall be paid
through the school choice mechanism; provided, that the department may, in consultation with the
operational services division, approve alternative tuition amounts proposed by applicants that shall not
exceed the state average per pupil foundation budget for students of the same classification and grade level;
provided, further, that the department may authorize additional tuition assessments for services required by
an individualized education program established pursuant to chapter 71B. If a commonwealth virtual school
offers online courses to students attending other schools, the commonwealth virtual school shall work with
the student’s district or school to determine whether the online courses meet said district’s or school’s
standards and requirements and what the commonwealth virtual school will charge the student’s district or
school for such online courses.
The department may retain not more than $75 per pupil for the administration of the commonwealth virtual
school program.
24

The department, in consultation with the department of youth services, shall determine the appropriate
tuition responsibility for students who are in the custody of the department of corrections, a sheriff or the
department of youth services.
Students enrolled in a commonwealth virtual school shall be counted in the foundation enrollment of the
school district where the student resides.
(l) The department shall promulgate rules and regulations creating a reporting requirement for a
commonwealth virtual school’s net asset balance at the end of each fiscal year; provided, however, that the
report shall include, but not be limited to: (1) the revenue and expenditures for the prior fiscal year with a
specific accounting of the uses of public and private dollars; (2) compensation and benefits for teachers,
staff, administrators, executives and members of the board of trustees; (3) the amount of funds paid to a
management company; (4) the sources of surplus funds, specifically whether the funds are private or public;
(5) how surplus funds were used in the previous fiscal year; and (6) the planned use of surplus funds in the
upcoming fiscal year and in future fiscal years. The board may establish limits for excess funds that may be
retained by commonwealth virtual schools and may require commonwealth virtual schools to return excess
funds to school districts.
(m) Each commonwealth virtual school shall submit an annual report, on or before January 1, to the board.
The school shall make its report available to the public on its website. The annual report shall be in such form
as may be prescribed by the board and shall include, but not be limited to: (1) a discussion of progress made
toward the achievement of the goals set forth in the certificate; (2) a list of the programs and courses offered;
(3) a description and number of the students enrolled in the commonwealth virtual school by grade level, the
number of students eligible for free and reduced price lunch and the number of students who applied and
were not admitted; (4) a financial statement describing by appropriate categories the revenue and
expenditures for the prior fiscal year and a balance sheet describing the commonwealth virtual school’s
assets, liabilities and fund balances or equities; (5) information regarding and a discussion of student
attendance and participation; (6) information regarding and a discussion of student-teacher interaction; (7)
information regarding and a discussion of student performance in the commonwealth virtual school,
including data from state assessments and a comparison of students’ achievement against the achievement
of the students in the sending district; (8) a discussion of how many courses were completed and not
completed; (9) a discussion of how the school created a community for students; (10) what activities were
included to engage students and how students participated in those activities; (11) a discussion of parental
involvement; and (12) a discussion of the school’s outreach and recruitment efforts; provided, however, that
said report shall include input from teachers and administrators at the virtual school and input from
administrators in a district that has established a virtual school or districts that are members of an education
collaborative that has established a virtual school.
(n) Each commonwealth virtual school shall maintain an accurate account of all its activities and all its
receipts and expenditures and shall annually conduct an independent audit of its accounts. Such audit shall
be filed annually on or before January 1 with the department and the state auditor and shall be in a form
prescribed by the state auditor. The state auditor may investigate the budget and finances of commonwealth
virtual schools and their financial dealings, transactions and relationships and shall have the power to
examine the records of commonwealth virtual schools and to prescribe methods of accounting and the
rendering of periodic reports.
(o) On or before September 1, the commissioner shall furnish a supplemental report on the Massachusetts
comprehensive assessment system performance results of students served by each commonwealth virtual
school and on the racial, ethnic and socio-economic make-up of the students served by each commonwealth
virtual school. The commissioner shall also provide information on the number of students enrolled in each
commonwealth virtual school who have individualized education programs pursuant to chapter 71B. The
department shall make such report available to the public on the department’s website.
25

(p) On or before September 1, the commissioner shall prepare a report on the implementation and impact of
this section, including, but not limited to:
(1) the fiscal impact on sending districts;
(2) any necessary adjustments to tuition rates, including whether the amount should vary based on grade or
type of school and the appropriate mechanism for funding virtual schools;
(3) information on course completion and student attendance and participation rates;
(4) the academic achievement of students attending commonwealth virtual schools;
(5) the level of supervision or support needed for students in elementary and middle school;
(6) the support necessary or helpful to ensure that students successfully complete online courses;
(7) the professional development virtual schoolteachers require;
(8) the appropriate enrollment limit for a virtual school, if any, including information about wait lists; and
(9) the need for any changes to the commonwealth virtual school program.
The report shall be based partially on information in each commonwealth virtual school’s annual report and
financial audits. This report shall include input from virtual schoolteachers and administrators. The
commissioner shall consult with the digital learning advisory council to prepare this report. The
commissioner shall file the report with the clerks of the house and senate, who shall forward the report to the
joint committee on education. The department shall make the report available to the public on the
department’s website.
(q) The commissioner shall identify and offer information on online courses which are aligned with state
academic standards that districts may use and shall publish that list on the department’s website. At least 1
of the online courses listed shall be available at no cost to school districts, provided that such no cost online
course is aligned with state academic standards. The list shall be reviewed and updated annually. Nothing in
this subsection shall preclude school districts from using other courses not identified by the commissioner.
(r) The board may promulgate regulations for implementation and enforcement of this section, provided that
the regulations may include, but shall not be limited to, a provision indicating the appropriate percentage of
online academic instruction provided for a school to be considered a commonwealth virtual school pursuant
to this section. Upon release of the proposed regulations, the board shall file a copy of the regulations with
the clerks of the house of representatives and the senate, who shall forward the regulations to the joint
committee on education. Within 30 days of the filing, the committee may hold a public hearing and issue a
report on the regulations and file the report with the board. The board, pursuant to applicable law, may adopt
final regulations making revisions to the proposed regulations as it deems appropriate after consideration of
the report and shall file a copy of the regulations with the chairpersons of the joint committee on education
and, not earlier than 30 days after the filing, the board shall file the final regulations with the state secretary.
(s) Nothing in this section shall preclude a student from taking some or all of the student’s classes online
when such classes are offered or approved by the school the student attends or by an education collaborative
in which the student’s school district participates.
26

This section shall not apply to a virtual school operated by a single school district if the school enrolls only
students residing in the school district; provided, however, that such district shall submit a summary
description of the proposed virtual school to the commissioner for review and comment at least 4 months in
advance of the opening of the virtual school. The commissioner shall then provide written comments on the
proposal to each district’s school committee.
(t) A school committee may, by vote, restrict enrollment of its students in commonwealth virtual schools if
the total enrollment of its students in commonwealth virtual schools exceeds 1 per cent of the total
enrollment in its district; provided, however, that no student enrolled in a commonwealth virtual school shall
be compelled to withdraw as a result of that vote.

Appendix C: CMVS Academic Achievement Data
The Department did not issue school, district, or state accountability determinations for
the 2019-2020 school year due to the cancellation of state assessments and school
closures related to COVID-19. Additionally, the Department did not issue school, district, or
state accountability determinations in 2021; spring 2021 MCAS administration included a
partial test for grades 3-8 and some grade 3-8 students took the assessment remotely. All
Massachusetts schools administered the full MCAS for grades 3-8 and 10 during the spring
of 2022. Due to prior data disruption, the Department published some, but not all, of the
data for the statewide accountability system in 2022. The Department published all data
available for the statewide accountability system in 2023, based on two years of MCAS
administration (2022 and 2023).
