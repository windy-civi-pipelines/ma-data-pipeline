Executive Summary
In accordance with Line item 5046-0000 of Chapter 140 of the Acts of 2024, this
document presents a comprehensive analysis of the Department of Mental Health's (DMH)
police-based Jail and Arrest Diversion Initiatives for Fiscal Year 2024. The report covers
operations from July 1st, 2023, through June 30th, 2024, detailing: the scope and distribution
of crisis intervention teams and jail diversion programs; grant allocations across
municipalities and service providers; cost-effectiveness measures; program impact metrics;
and strategic recommendations for future growth. This assessment fulfills the legislative
mandate to evaluate the initiatives' reach, financial stewardship, and operational
effectiveness.
Through strategic community partnerships and
targeted grant funding, DMH's Jail and Arrest
Diversion Initiatives transform how law
enforcement addresses behavioral health crises.
Since its inception in 2007, the program has
fostered innovative collaborations between police
departments and mental health providers, creating
pathways for intervention and treatment rather
than arrest.
In Fiscal Year 2024, DMH awarded $16,668,784 in grant funding
through the Jail and Arrest Diversion Initiatives.
In fiscal year 2024, 117 grant projects were funded for diversion activities across
three categories.
1. Co-Response Teams: Mental health clinicians are integrated directly into police
operations, accompanying officers on calls involving behavioral health crises. This
partnership enables real-time clinical assessment and intervention at the scene.

4
2. Crisis Intervention Team (CIT) Implementation: Police departments receive support
to adopt and maintain the internationally recognized CIT model, ensuring officers are
equipped with advanced skills for de-escalation and crisis resolution.
3. Component JDP Grants: Support local municipalities in implementing customized
arrest diversion strategies that address their community's specific needs. Depending
on the community's requirements, DMH-funded programs provide training, technical
assistance, and a Co-Response clinician.
4. Training and Technical Assistance Centers (TTAC): These specialized centers develop
and deliver comprehensive behavioral health education for both CIT programs and
Co-Response models. TTACs provide essential training, implementation support, and
ongoing technical assistance to ensure program effectiveness.
5. Trainer/Consultant/Researcher Grants: Support individuals and organizations
offering jail and arrest diversion consultation services. DMH grants in this category
fund those who provide law enforcement with subject matter expertise, specialized
training curriculum, and advanced research.
Background on Jail and Arrest Diversion
The Jail and Arrest Diversion programs (JDP) create multiple intervention points to
redirect individuals experiencing behavioral health crises away from the criminal justice
system. By engaging at crucial moments during police encounters, these programs offer
alternatives to arrest and incarceration, connecting individuals with appropriate behavioral
health services and support. This approach transforms traditional law enforcement
responses into opportunities for treatment and recovery.
• Individuals with untreated mental illness face an increased risk of harm in
interactions with law enforcement (Treatment Advocacy Center, 2015).
• It is estimated that 20% of police calls for service are in response to someone in a
mental health and/or substance use crisis, although local estimates are much higher
(Abramson, 2021; Wood et al., 2017).
• According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, two million arrests (16.9%) in the United
States each year involve people with serious mental illness (Leifman, 2019).
• Approximately 20-25% of incarcerated people have a history of mental health
conditions, resulting in the need for mental health care and treatment of those
persons in jail and prison environments (Prins, 2014; Timmer & Nowotny, 2021).
• Approximately 37% of people in state prisons and 44% in local jails have a history of
mental health conditions, highlighting the significant need for mental health care
within these settings as well as prior to incarceration (National Alliance on Mental
Illness, n.d.).
Jail and Arrest Diversion Strategies in Massachusetts

5
Massachusetts' police diversion
programs aim to reduce arrests and
unnecessary trips to the emergency
department by redirecting individuals in
crisis to appropriate services. Co-Response
clinicians are key to these efforts, assisting
with de-escalation, evaluating the needs of
those involved, and crafting adequate
interventions. Additionally, Crisis
Intervention Teams (CIT) provide
specialized training and guidance for law
enforcement, including creating the role of a CIT Coordinator and implementing specific
mental health policies within departments.
The Department of Mental Health (DMH) focuses on fostering partnerships with local
communities to improve responses to mental health crises. For FY24, DMH provided funding
for nine regional Crisis Intervention and Co-Response Training and Technical Assistance
Centers, aimed at strengthening pre-arrest diversion programs statewide. Additionally, DMH
equips law enforcement with the necessary training and resources to handle crises more
effectively, helping to decrease the use of force, enhance officer preparedness, and reduce
injury risks during crisis response efforts.
The Center for Police Training in Crisis Intervention (The Center) serves municipal
police and public safety personnel throughout the Commonwealth. It functions as a hub for
cost-effective, evidence-based mental health, substance use, and crisis intervention training
programs for law enforcement and public safety professionals. It is structured to support,
coordinate, promote, and facilitate training opportunities provided by regional TTACs and
other DMH-funded projects, while maintaining an inventory of available training resources.
The Center is involved with the planning and development of training content focused
on recognizing the signs and symptoms of mental illness and substance misuse, mental
health treatments, co-occurring disorders, responding to mental health or substance use
crises, and best practices in community policing. As of the end of FY24, the Center anticipated
the launch of the Department of Mental Health Jail Diversion Programs (DMH-JDP) Learning
Management System (LMS) at the start of FY25. The LMS, in line with Mass. General Laws
c.19 § 25 (2018), was successfully launched as planned in early FY25, providing easy access
to the Center's recommended training materials and other valuable educational resources.
Jail and Arrest Diversion Initiative Funding
DMH maintains a longstanding commitment to enhancing law enforcement's capacity
to effectively respond to mental health crises. Through comprehensive training programs,
DMH equips officers with essential skills in mental health awareness, crisis intervention, and
de-escalation techniques. Over the years, DMH has expanded its police-based jail and arrest
diversion initiatives, diversifying program models to meet evolving needs. These initiatives
represent a critical intersection between law enforcement and mental health services,
promoting alternatives to arrest for individuals experiencing mental health crises.

6
The DMH Arrest and Jail Diversion Initiatives grant program provides direct funding
to municipalities and behavioral health providers, fostering collaborative partnerships with
local law enforcement agencies. Since the program's inception, with an initial investment of
$100,000 in FY2007, it has expanded significantly, now reaching 117 grantees with annual
funding totaling $16,668,784 in FY2024.
These initiatives have transformed how law enforcement agencies across the
Commonwealth respond to mental health-related calls, reducing unnecessary arrests,
improving access to mental health services, and enhancing community safety through
preventive intervention. As the program grows, it continues to strengthen partnerships
between mental health providers and law enforcement, creating better outcomes for
individuals in crisis and advancing community well-being.

clinicians for police departments. Training requires one-time costs, while the hiring of clinicians
requires annualized costs.
DMH Jail and Arrest Diversion Initiatives

7
DMH grants continue to support evidence-based training models, including Crisis
Intervention Team (CIT) training (40 hours), Integrating Communications, Assessment, and
Tactics (ICAT) (16 hours), and specialized curriculum tailored for Co-Response clinicians
and their law enforcement partners. These training initiatives are continuously refined and
delivered to ensure best practices in crisis response and intervention techniques.
Crisis Intervention Team (CIT)
Since 2008, DMH grant recipients have
successfully implemented the Crisis Intervention
Team (CIT) model. CIT remains a police-led,
collaborative approach to behavioral health crises,
designed to enhance safety and improve outcomes.
CIT-trained officers are equipped to recognize and
de-escalate situations involving individuals
experiencing behavioral health crises, connecting
them with appropriate services rather than
defaulting to arrest. Officers must complete comprehensive knowledge and skills
assessments to receive their certification through JDP Training and Technical Assistance
Centers. The model continues to emphasize crucial partnerships between law enforcement
and behavioral health service providers, fostering a comprehensive community response
system.
CIT Training & Technical Assistance Centers
CIT-TTACs support local law enforcement agencies by providing behavioral health
training and developing CIT programs. These centers partner with surrounding towns and
police departments to deliver comprehensive training, including the 40-hour CIT
curriculum, advanced training for
public safety personnel, community
partnerships, and technical assistance.
All CIT-TTACs have successfully
integrated standardized certification
processes into their operations,
ensuring consistent quality and
documented completion of training
requirements across the
Commonwealth. The centers continue
to serve as accessible hubs for CIT
development, assisting local law
enforcement in implementing robust
CIT programs.

8
Co-Response Training and Technical Assistance Centers
In 2018, the Department of Mental Health (DMH) began supporting the Co-Response
Training and Technical Assistance Center (CR-TTAC) model as a hub for developing,
operating, and training Co-Responder programs. These centers provide advanced training
for Co-Response clinicians and law enforcement partners, and they play a key role in
launching and implementing Co-Response programs across the Commonwealth.
Starting in FY22, William James College (WJC) leveraged DMH funding to launch the
first-ever CR-TTAC within an academic setting. This center offers a 10-credit graduate-level
certificate program in Crisis Response and Behavioral Health, as well as providing technical
support, webinars, research opportunities, and a growing Community of Practice. The
program incorporates innovative simulation technology, MILO (Multiple Interactive
Learning Objectives), to enhance the training experience.
By FY24, WJC increased its enrollment capacity to accommodate two cohorts in the
certificate program, organized a Co-Response Research Symposium, expanded the
Community of Practice, and delivered continuous technical support, monthly webinars, and
targeted crisis intervention training sessions. The program continues to look forward to
expansion with a focus on developing a 5-day Co-Resonse Intensive Training to continue to
enrich learning experiences in the coming year.

Data Collection and Analysis
Pre-arrest Jail Diversion Programs (JDP) have rapidly expanded both in the number
of communities served and the scope of interventions provided. DMH collects data on jail
and arrest activities resulting in diversion from unnecessary arrest, diversion from
overcrowded emergency departments, successful de-escalation, and the contributing factors
that impact diversion outcomes.
DMH maintains its commitment to prioritizing the collection and analysis of outcome
data for jail/arrest programs funded by the department. In FY24, this commitment was
demonstrated through the full implementation of a comprehensive new data management
infrastructure. The new online, real-time, secure system for intervention tracking has
dramatically improved data collection, as evidenced by the significant increase in
documented interventions across programs. Building on this success, DMH has also
introduced enhanced systems for quarterly reporting, resulting in substantially higher
submission rates from active programs. Additionally, a new standardized data monitoring
system for CIT certification has been implemented across all TTACs, ensuring consistent
tracking of training outcomes.
These systematic improvements reflect DMH's dedication to data-driven models with
transparent outcomes. The enhanced data collection infrastructure provides a more
accurate picture of program activities and impacts across the Commonwealth.
FY24 Jail and Arrest Diversion Training Summary
In FY 24, the TTACs provided 119 training sessions and over 41,560 hours of training.
A total of 695 officers attended CIT (Crisis Intervention Team) training (40-hour curriculum)
in FY 24, and 304 officers attended MHFA (Mental Health First Aid) training for Public Safety.
Around 1,000 officers were trained in either MHFA or CIT. Nearly all the law enforcement
officers who attended CIT were certified as CIT officers through the Commonwealth’s
knowledge check and demonstration of practical de-escalation skills. The TTACs held 36 CIT
trainings, 22 MHFA trainings, and 24 Specialty CIT trainings. In FY24, The William James
Center for Crisis Response and Behavioral Health (CRBH) successfully completed its
intensive 9-month Certificate Program in FY 24 and graduated 24 students. Additionally, the
CRBH offered webinars regularly, which were attended by more than 265 participants, and
hosted a Co-Response Research Symposium in March 2024, which had over 110 attendees.

10
Combined, the TTACs impacted 174 Massachusetts communities along with an
additional 22 campus police and 29 dispatch agencies, totaling 225 public safety agencies.
At least 85 new law enforcement and community agencies benefited from the TTAC's
services in FY24, and an impressive total of 299 agencies participated in the various training
offerings. The table below summarizes FY21 to FY24 of TTAC training impacts, including
overall number of law enforcement officers trained in specialized behavioral health
trainings, while highlighting police trained in Mental Health First Aid and Crisis Intervention
Teams. The table also displays the number of dispatchers trained in CIT, not included in the

Summary of Police-Based Jail and Arrest Initiatives FY24
The graph below shows the number of interventions by police-based jail and DMH
grant-funded programs for five years (FY19-FY24). In FY24, there were 30,523 interventions
recorded, nearly double the interventions documented in FY23. This significant increase
reflects both the expansion of jail diversion programs and initiatives, as well as the
implementation of a new data entry system. The new database allowed for more
comprehensive and accurate tracking of interventions, ensuring that all activities were
systematically recorded for the first time throughout the fiscal year.
The new system was specifically designed to streamline the data entry process,
making it more accessible for JDP team members. Combined with comprehensive training
and widespread adoption across all DMH-funded jail diversion programs, this purpose-built
solution has dramatically improved data collection. The FY24 data provides a more accurate
picture of program activity, demonstrating how responding to user feedback and
implementing targeted solutions can lead to more complete reporting.

Diversion Outcomes by Grantees FY19-FY24
The following chart shows the FY19-FY24 recorded number of diversions from
arrests and emergency department visits by year. In FY24, data indicates a notable rise in
emergency department diversions, likely attributable to the expansion and enhanced
training of programs statewide, as well as the implementation of a more accessible data
collection system that enables more comprehensive tracking and documentation of these
interventions.
Technical Assistance Services Provided

12
The DMH’s Jail and Arrest Diversion Initiatives grant program not only provides
financial support to municipalities and behavioral health organizations for diversion
projects but also strengthens statewide efforts in this area. In FY24, the program funded nine
regional Crisis Intervention and Co-Response Training and Technical Assistance Centers to
enhance pre-arrest diversion strategies throughout the state. These centers assist with
launching new diversion programs, developing policies, and delivering comprehensive
training for law enforcement and their behavioral health partners. The TTACs provided
nearly 410 hours of technical assistance to police departments across the Commonwealth,
covering a range of topics such as developing Crisis Intervention Team (CIT) and Co-
Response programs, managing recurrent cases (both individual and by typology), applying
for DMH and other grants, and implementing effective diversion strategies.
Statewide Impact of Jail Diversion Grants
Receiving a DMH grant offers substantial advantages to police departments
throughout Massachusetts. These grants expand access to statewide training and technical
support for Jail and Arrest Diversion initiatives. With the growth of CIT and Co-Response
TTACs, more communities and clinicians can now utilize Crisis Intervention Teams,
advanced de-escalation strategies, and Co-Response training programs, all at no additional
cost.
While Jail Diversion Grants were initially designed to decrease unnecessary arrests
and improve law enforcement’s responses to behavioral health crisis, these programs do
much more. In addition to decreasing emergency department use, co-response programs in
particular are viewed as an important extension of the behavioral health system. Not only do
these co-responders work with law enforcement at the point of 911 crisis, the clinicians
serve as a point of contact for the community, including CBHC’s, and can also provide follow-
up to ensure the best possible outcome.
Crisis Intervention Team Training Certification
The start of FY24 marked a significant milestone in the certification of Massachusetts
law enforcement officers in crisis intervention techniques. Officers who completed the forty-
hour CIT course through the TTACs entered the first full cycle of the statewide certification
process. This certification process ensures that officers attending the CIT course are officially
recognized for their training in crisis intervention.
The certification process includes an online, 25-question Knowledge Check test,
designed around the core topics covered in the TTAC training. In addition, officers must
demonstrate their practical de-escalation skills by participating in de-escalation scenarios,
where a clinician and an officer observe and assess them on six specific aspects of de-
escalation.
During FY24, 675 Officers took the Knowledge Check to become CIT certified. All
participants demonstrated the requisite de-escalation skills, leading to a total of 675 CIT
certified officers in FY24.

13
Crisis Intervention Team Statewide Curriculum Revision
In the fall of 2023, DMH and their CIT Training and CIT-TTACs began a review process
of the statewide CIT curriculum. As the curriculum was over five years old, it needed to be
refreshed with current information relevant to teach law enforcement about both behavioral
health disorders and best practice for intervention and de-escalation. The goal of this project
was to continue to homogenize CIT training, to make subject content and training offerings
very similar throughout the Commonwealth. After receiving feedback from TTAC Directors,
clinicians, law enforcement officers, and other subject matter experts throughout FY24, the
revision of the CIT Curriculum outline was established towards the end of the FY. The
revision project was completed in early September 2024 when the Massachusetts CIT
Standardized Curriculum was distributed.
Estimated Cost Savings Achieved in Fiscal Year 2024
The implementation of jail and arrest diversion programs continues to demonstrate
both fiscal efficiency and operational effectiveness. By emphasizing immediate stabilization
over unnecessary arrests or Emergency Department visits, these programs generate
significant cost savings across criminal justice and healthcare systems. The cost benefits
cascade through multiple stages, from avoiding initial arrests to eliminating subsequent
court proceedings. The collaboration between CIT and Co-Response clinicians remains
instrumental in reducing arrests for minor offenses while promoting on-scene stabilization
and community-based treatment alternatives.
While comprehensively quantifying nationwide cost savings from jail and arrest
diversion programs remains complex due to the interconnected nature of healthcare and
criminal justice costs, along with challenges in measuring long-term impacts and intangible
benefits (such as reduced injuries and workplace absenteeism), this report includes
estimated cost savings based on current law enforcement, incarceration, and emergency
room expenditures. Emergency Department diversions, when appropriate, continue to play
a vital role in cost containment and harm reduction. These diversions not only reduce
healthcare expenses but also ensure more efficient resource allocation for urgent cases by
preventing unnecessary wait times.
DMH's sustained investment in programs that provide on-scene clinical support and
specialized law enforcement training enhances the capability of first responders to redirect
individuals from arrests toward community-based treatment options. This proactive
approach effectively manages costs by introducing alternative resources during the earliest
stages of police encounters.
Estimated Public Safety Costs per Arrest
On average, the cost of police and court activity incurred is calculated at a rate of $7,169
per arrest (Hunt et al., 2017; Hunt et al., 2019; RAND, 2023).

14
These projections encompass law enforcement personnel's collective time and expenses,
including police officers, judges, public defenders, prosecutors, and support staff, addressing
reported crimes. Law enforcement activities, such as responding to scenes, managing crime
scenes, investigations, paperwork, interrogations, arrests, and court appearances,
contribute to these estimates. Costs include equipment, supplies, fuel, administrative staff,
and utilities.
Estimated Incarceration Costs per Incident
On average, the cost of incarceration resulting from an arrest/incident incurs an average
cost of $5,650 (Vera Institute of Justice, 2015).
Since only a subset of all arrests results in pretrial incarceration, we have applied the
multiplier of 25% to the overall number of arrest diversions to derive the cost savings
estimate. In Massachusetts, incarceration expenses average $143.72 per day. This
encompasses court-related transportation/security, correctional officer and personnel
costs, facility maintenance, medical/mental health care, meals, clothing, supplies, and
inmate necessities.
Estimated Health Care Costs per ED Visit
On average, the Emergency Department level of care for mental health
assessment/treatment incurs a cost of $2,188 per day for an individual (Consumer
Health Ratings, 2023).

Rationale for Continued Expansion

15
During the fiscal year 2024, the Department of Mental Health received an
unprecedented number of applications for grant funding and technical assistance through
the Jail and Arrest Diversion Initiatives. The requests were submitted by law enforcement,
educational institutions, and community-based organizations across the state for jail and
arrest diversion models. The funding requests increased in FY24, representing the robust
and continued demand across the Commonwealth. The graph below shows the past 5-year
increase in demand for DMH Jail/Arrest Diversion grants.
In FY24, law enforcement agencies across Massachusetts continued to maximize
DMH funding through CIT training, Co-Response program implementation, participation in
the Certificate Program, utilization of Training and Technical Assistance Centers, and other
innovative approaches.
The Commonwealth maintains compelling reasons to further expand the capacity and
reach of this grant program:
● DMH's extensive data collection demonstrates that diversion programs for
individuals with behavioral health issues consistently yield positive outcomes in
police responses.
● Law enforcement agencies continue to enhance community relations, reduce use of
force incidents, and successfully divert arrests and emergency department visits
through personnel training in improved response and intervention strategies.
● The Commonwealth's annual investment in jail diversion projects maintains a
conservative cost-benefit estimate of almost $3 in savings for every $1 spent, with
returns facilitated through healthcare and criminal justice system cost reductions.
● The Jail and Arrest Diversion Initiatives remain aligned with and complement other
major Commonwealth efforts, including the expansion of Community Behavioral
Health Centers (CBHCs), which enhance coordination of local service resources with
law enforcement to strengthen systemic responses to behavioral health crises.
● The International Association of Chiefs of Police and Massachusetts Chiefs of Police
Association continue to advocate for Massachusetts police departments to train a
substantial portion of their uniformed personnel in advanced de-escalation

16
techniques, maintaining the recommended minimum of 20% personnel trained in
CIT (Crisis Intervention Team) tactics.
● Many departments are maintaining momentum in training higher numbers of
personnel, sustaining increased demand for CIT and CR-TTACs, jail diversion grants,
and technical assistance from the Commonwealth.
● Support for increased crisis training and Co-Responder presence on law
enforcement calls involving individuals in mental health crises remains strong and
continues to grow.
● During FY24, the Department of Mental Health continued to receive and approve
funding requests both for existing project expansions and from new communities
seeking to initiate diversion programs aimed at reducing jail and arrest rates.
Conclusion
The opportunity to expand successful collaborations and partnerships across the
Commonwealth continues to grow, meeting the increasing demand for jail diversion
programs. DMH Jail and Arrest grants are strategically distributed throughout
Massachusetts to support both existing and innovative new projects. The Massachusetts Jail
& Arrest Diversion Initiatives remain critically important, particularly given the ongoing
statewide and national focus on law enforcement, use of force, and training requirements.
The demand for clinical integration in policing responses and service delivery continues to
rise.
The outcomes presented in this report demonstrate that jail diversion initiatives
effectively strengthen community support systems, enhance law enforcement's capacity to
respond to behavioral health crisis calls, improve public safety outcomes, promote better
health outcomes, and enhance overall community well-being. These programs continue to
generate cost savings across the Commonwealth's public safety and healthcare systems. Law
enforcement agencies maintain strong enthusiasm for continuing and improving their
initiatives through Department of Mental Health funding, with grant participation reaching
unprecedented levels.
The Massachusetts Jail and Arrest Diversion Initiatives continue to be recognized as
highly effective and valuable assets to the Commonwealth by the Department of Mental
Health, serving as a model for other states. Looking ahead to FY25, our goals include
sustaining support for evidence-based interventions, advancing best practices, and
expanding assistance for JDP throughout the Commonwealth. A key priority is ensuring full
implementation of the mental health and crisis intervention training requirements for law
enforcement officers as outlined in Chapter 208 of the Acts of 2018, strengthening our
commitment to comprehensive crisis response capabilities across Massachusetts.

Appendix II: DMH Jail and Arrest Projects: Grant Types and
Descriptions
During FY24, DMH provided several types of diversion projects for local law enforcement,
behavioral health organizations, and their respective communities to consider. Below are
summaries of the project types:
✔ Behavioral Health Interdisciplinary Program (BHIP) Grants: Support municipalities
or regional clusters to expand mobile crisis response for individuals with co-occurring
substance use disorder and mental health conditions. This will be done through a specialized
behavioral health team consisting of a program coordinator, behavioral health clinician,
EMT, and SUD outreach worker. Large metropolitan areas will be prioritized.
✔ Crisis Intervention Team (CIT) Grants: Support police departments in developing CIT
programs. Police departments develop a CIT program by sending an appropriate number or
percentage of officers who are interested and selected to attend CIT training for certification,
having a CIT policy, a CIT coordinator within their department, regular communication and
meetings with stakeholders regarding their CIT initiative inclusive of behavioral health
providers, a police administration that is aware of and in charge of the CIT program, and
preferably a mental health CIT coordinator.
✔ CIT Technical Assistance Center (CIT-TTAC) Grants: Support regional centers offering
training and support to police departments that adopt the CIT model. DMH-funded TTACs
offer standardized CIT curricula and follow-up consultation during program development.
✔ Co-Response Grants: Support crisis clinicians being embedded in law enforcement
operations. Clinicians play a critical role in crisis intervention and mental health support,
participate in ride-alongs, and respond alongside law enforcement to 911 calls for service.
Co-Response clinicians de-escalate crises, cross-train their law enforcement partners, collect
call data, and coordinate scheduled meetings for program leadership and stakeholders.
✔ Co-Response Technical Assistance Center (CR-TTAC) Grants: Support graduate-level
education, evidence-based training, and technical assistance to Co-Response practitioners
and law enforcement statewide. CR-TTACs offer advanced training, scenario-based
experiences, webinars, scenario-based curricula, and specialized topics.
✔ Component JDP Grants: Support local municipalities in implementing customized arrest
diversion strategies that address their community's specific needs. Depending on the

25
community's requirements, DMH-funded programs provide training, technical assistance,
and a Co-Response clinician.
✔ Training/Backfill Grants: Support law enforcement agencies in providing advanced and
specialized training to their personnel. The grants cover the reimbursement for participating
in DMH-sponsored Crisis Intervention Team training, William James College Graduate
Certificate in Crisis Response and Behavioral Health, attendance at national conferences
related to CIT and Co-Response, and other specialized behavioral health training.
✔Trainer/Consultant/Researcher Grants: Support individuals and organizations offering
jail and arrest diversion consultation services. DMH grants in this category fund those who
provide law enforcement with subject matter expertise, specialized training curriculum, and
advanced research.

Appendix III: JDP Impact Narratives (highlights)
XXX PD (CIT and Co-Response):
This Police Department had received numerous calls about an unhoused female
who was camping in the center of town and amassing belongings. She was sleeping in a
small park downtown because she believed it was safest. She had a pleasant
temperament but struggled with paranoid delusions. She professed to be religious and
believed the devil would get her if she was living indoors. She was clean and well-kept
but appeared gaunt and frail. She would not allow others to help her obtain services or
funds. The PD’s Community Impact Unit (CIU – CIT officers and co-responder)
intervened by having her religious sect’s clergy come speak to her but that still did not
get her off the streets. The Police Department’s CIU checked in on her several times per
week and she came to trust them, and they learned that she was using an alias. Once she
was identified by her legal name, the CIT officer found her family member in the
Midwest. It turned out that the unhoused woman was an heiress. The program also
learned that she was diabetic and not getting treatment and the family was looking for
her for over a year. Because of her ongoing symptoms and risk to herself, she was sent to
the ER on a section 12. A family member flew here and the client went inpatient. She
was treated at a local psychiatric hospital until the sister could obtain guardianship.
Later it was learned that she had driven here from the south and had been hospitalized
twice along the way because of her acute psychiatric needs. When she made it to
Massachusetts, she was living in her car which was later stolen, along with all her
identification. Today she lives in an Assisted Living facility near her sister.
XXX Police Department (CIT):
Earlier this year at approx. 4 a.m., the Police Department’s midnight shift
responded to an armed male on top of a tall structure. This male was contemplating
suicide by either jumping off, suicide by gun, or suicide by cop. He was standing on the
very edge. The patrol shift spoke to this male for over 1.5 hours. The suspect gave up
the loaded firearm and retreated from the ledge. He was taken in custody and brought
to the hospital under Section 12. No criminal charges were filed. It is believed the time,
patience, and empathy that was shown to this person was a direct result of the CIT
program and working with in-house clinicians.
