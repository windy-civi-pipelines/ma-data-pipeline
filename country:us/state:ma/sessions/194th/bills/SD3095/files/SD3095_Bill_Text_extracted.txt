appropriately addresses all of the violations noted in the report with the following exception:
In regards to the issue of overcrowding, EHRS appreciates the limitations of correctional facilities and the need to
accommodate the ever-increasing population; however we remain concerned with the overcrowded conditions.

Sincerely,
Patrick Wallace
