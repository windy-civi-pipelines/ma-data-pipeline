Additionally, $1.3 million of FY24 state budget funding was utilized to 1) develop a
comprehensive, cross-agency, statewide clean energy and climate resiliency workforce
development plan; and 2) the creation of a statewide Climate Services Corps (a program that
provides support to organizations that run work-based learning and career support in energy
efficiency and heating and cooling technologies that produce lower emissions for people ages
18-24). These objectives align with the Massachusetts Clean Energy and Climate Plan for 2050.
MassCEC’s Workforce Development Department also worked closely with the MA Department
of Energy Resources (DOER) to secure a number of federally funded awards aligned with the
Massachusetts 2050 CECP and workforce targets. In October 2024, DOER, in partnership with

MassCEC, Roxbury Community College, and Greenfield Community College, received a $2
million Energy Auditor Training grant from the US Dept of Energy (DOE).
Additionally, DOER, MassCEC, and the cities of Boston and Cambridge launched a new
partnership, garnering a $19.9 million Assistance for Latest and Zero Building Energy Code
Adoption grant from the DOE, which includes funding to support a Career Technical Instructor
Externship program. This program would help instructors at public career technical high schools
who are preparing young people for jobs in the building trades understand the latest building
performance standards and how building contractors are helping owners meet these new
energy efficiency requirements. This will help them prepare their students for the latest skills
and technologies needed. MassCEC and DOER also partnered on an application that was
awarded $2.7 million in DOE formula funding for Training for Residential Energy Contractors
(TREC). Lastly, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)-funded Solar for All program,
includes $7 million in funding for apprenticeship and training programs and a solar business
accelerator. The Solar for All program provides funding for solar development in underserved
communities.
Offshore Energy:
The 2050 CECP identifies offshore wind as a cornerstone of the Commonwealth’s strategy to
decarbonize the electric grid and expand the clean energy economy, setting a target of
approximately 23 gigawatts (GW) of offshore wind capacity by 2050. The initiatives described
below directly support 2050 CECP goals by building and preparing a skilled and inclusive
workforce, accelerating innovation, and strengthening the offshore wind ecosystem—enabling
the Commonwealth’s transition to a decarbonized energy system while driving economic
growth and equity.
MassCEC is advancing these goals through four (4) key program areas:
1. Offshore Wind Workforce Development: Details on anticipated FY25 awards for the
Offshore Wind Works program are provided in the section above. In FY25, MassCEC held
quarterly meetings of the Offshore Wind Works Community of Practice (CoP), bringing
together workforce stakeholders to share best practices and strengthen collaboration.
To continue this work and expand its impact, MassCEC anticipates making a FY25 award

to support ongoing facilitation through the next calendar year. This effort will include
continued quarterly CoP meetings led by professional facilitators, as well as the launch
of new quarterly affinity group meetings focused on higher education and community-
based organizations. These affinity groups will work to identify and build distinct
pathways between programs, enhancing coordination and connectivity across the
offshore wind workforce development landscape.
2. Offshore Wind Business Support: In FY25, MassCEC will launch the Offshore Wind Works
Business Ready Pilot Program. The program will seek to onboard a team of consultants
to help guide multiple (10-12) businesses, with one anticipated award totaling
approximately $320,000. This initiative will support Massachusetts-based businesses in
enhancing operational readiness and pursuing procurement opportunities in the
offshore wind supply chain.
Also, MassCEC along with industry, academic, and NGO partners is developing plans to
lead initiatives to provide facilities and services to support entrepreneurs, start-ups, and
SMEs to address key challenges to commercialization and deployment of technologies.
An RFP for these services will be released later this spring (2025).
3. Ports Investments: In FY25, MassCEC continued to manage the Offshore Wind Ports
Investments Challenge funding, which awarded $200 million to seven projects
representing a diverse cross-section of the offshore wind supply chain including
investments on both the north and south shores such as the Salem Offshore Wind
Terminal and the New Bedford Marine Commerce Terminal. This funding leveraged over
$444 million of significant new capital expenditure and is estimated to produce over
27,000 new job years.
*One award of $25 million (Prysmian Cable Manufacturing) was ultimately declined. These funds will be
repurposed. *
MassCEC owns and operates the 30-acre New Bedford Marine Commerce Terminal, the
first purpose built offshore wind marshalling port in the United States and the site of
Vineyard Wind’s staging for its 800 MW project. In the spring of 2025, MassCEC
commenced an expansion and improvement project that will result in the terminal
being able to fully support the larger turbine parts being manufactured for the next

generation of offshore projects. This significant investment in improvements to the
Terminal is critical to meeting the Commonwealth’s climate goals.
4. Science & Research: MassCEC continued to cultivate capacity and provide direct support
for science and research that helps reduce costs, increase reliability, and address
identified challenges for advancing the responsible development of offshore wind. In
FY25, MassCEC awarded $3.2 million to eight (8) grantees for science and research
projects, covering topics including fisheries and wildlife interaction with offshore wind,
and wind turbine blade testing technology. MassCEC awarded $2 million to UMass
Amherst for launch of the DOE-designated Offshore Wind Center of Excellence,
Academic Center for Reliability and Resilience of Offshore Wind (ARROW) to advance
post-secondary training in offshore wind in the context of reliable and resilient offshore
wind planning, infrastructure, and operations. MassCEC also continues a unique
partnership with state, federal, and UK agencies to support applied research to
accelerate offshore wind deployment and address challenges through the National
Offshore Wind Research and Development Consortium (NOWRDC) ($1million awarded
in FY2024).
Additionally, below is an updated table from the FY24 State Budget Report. The prior
submission included only awards made at the time of reporting; since then, an additional
eleven (11) awards have been made.
The total awarded for these FY24 Offshore Wind Works grants is $8,217,500, including money
from both ARPA and $1 million from the Vineyard Wind Accelerator, a $15 million investment
committed as part of Vineyard Wind’s 2018 successful bid in Massachusetts’ first offshore wind
energy procurement.

Clean Transportation:
The 2050 CECP set a benchmark of 93% of medium and heavy-duty vehicles being either
electrified or non-emitting and 97% of light-duty vehicles. Key sector strategies to achieve these
benchmarks include retirement of internal combustion engines, encouraging smart charging,
and addressing hard-to-electrify modes of transportation. MassCEC has worked toward these
goals in the following ways:
1. Increasing Access to Clean Transportation: MassCEC funds projects that demonstrate
innovative, equitable, and replicable clean transportation technologies and modalities
projects, and meet the twin goals of increasing access and reducing burdens. Focus
areas of this program aim to support the 2050 CECP strategies of encouraging smart
charging through a focus on EV charging accessibility models, addressing hard-to-
electrify modes of transportation through supporting Regional Transit Authority (“RTA”)
decarbonization projects and projects that expand access to economic opportunities
through education, training, and demonstrations of emerging technologies.

3. Statewide E-bike Voucher Program: The 2050 CECP outlined strategies that the
Commonwealth will pursue to promote clean alternatives to personal vehicle travel.
MassCEC is assisting in this strategy via the recently announced Massachusetts
Statewide E-bike Program. This Program is funded by $4.35 million from the FY24 state
budget and provides incentives to income eligible Massachusetts residents to reduce
the cost of purchasing e-bikes. As noted in the CECP, the e-bike voucher program is a
key strategy to reduce growth in total vehicle miles travelled (VMT) and GHG emissions
in Massachusetts. The Program will also contribute to the Commonwealth’s goal of
equitably facilitating access to clean energy technologies across the state.
4. Charging Solutions Programs: MassCEC developed and launched a series of four (4)
charging station programs, supporting the CECP strategies of encouraging smart
charging, with a key focus on addressing hard-to-electrify modes of transportation and
retirement of internal combustion engines. This was a direct result of the finding of the
Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Coordinating Council. The four programs are as follows:
• Vehicle-to-Everything Charging Solutions
• On-street Charging Solutions
• Vehicle-for-Hire EV Charging Solutions
• Medium- and Heavy-Duty Mobile and Non-Grid Tied Charging Solutions

High Performance Buildings:
The 2050 CECP calls for 80% of homes heated and cooled by electric heat pumps and 87% of
commercial space heated by either electricity or alternative fuels. MassCEC has worked toward
those goals in the following ways:
1. Concierge Support for Residential Electrification: MassCEC launched the Home
Modernization Navigator Program in Springfield and Lowell in November 2024 to
provide customized and ongoing guidance for underserved residents pursuing
electrification, efficiency, and renewable energy projects. The program will expand in
2025 and is part of a statewide initiative led by the Executive Office of Energy and
Environmental Affairs (EEA) Climate Team to make building decarbonization more
accessible and equitable.
2. Making Building Electrification More Affordable: In November 2024, MassCEC expanded
its Building Electrification and Transformation Accelerator to establish replicable, lowest
cost approaches for transitioning residential and commercial buildings from inefficient
and fossil-fuel burning equipment to efficient, electric technologies. MassCEC also
sponsored a pilot with Ipswich Electric Light Department and the Center for
Ecotechnology to demonstrate whether tariffed on-bill financing of decarbonization
measures could remove barriers for low-income households, particularly renters, and
decrease implementation costs. These learnings can be developed into best practice
guidance and shared at scale.
