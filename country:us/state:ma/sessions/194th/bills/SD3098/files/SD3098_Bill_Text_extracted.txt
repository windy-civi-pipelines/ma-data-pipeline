RE: 2024 Annual Report Concerning Self-Generation
Dear Messrs. Hurley and Carroll:
Pursuant to Section 193 of the Electric Restructuring Act (“Act”)1, the Department of
Public Utilities (“Department”) hereby submits its report concerning installations of
cogeneration, fuel cell, renewable energy, and on-site generation facilities (collectively,
“self-generation”) for the year 2024 (“2024 Annual Report”). This 2024 Annual Report
evaluates the effects of self-generation on sales of electricity and recovery of transition costs by
1 “An Act Relative To Restructuring The Electric Utility Industry In The Commonwealth,
Regulating The Provision Of Electricity And Other Services, And Promoting Enhanced
Consumer Protections Therein.” Chapter 164 of the Acts of 1997. Among other things,

electric distribution companies (“EDCs”)2 during the year 2024, with comparative information
from 1998 (when the Department began reporting on self-generation).
I. INTRODUCTION
The Act recognizes that self-generation, if implemented at a significant level, may lead to
the shifting of costs to non-generating customers. St. 1997, c. 164, § 193. Accordingly, the Act
requires that the Department monitor and report on the cost effects attributable to self-generation.
General Laws, c. 164, § 1G(g) states, in pertinent part:
The [D]epartment shall issue a report on July 1, 1999 and every year thereafter,
for the period of transition cost recovery, relative to [the] degree of impact on the
aggregate reduction of the electricity and impact on transition charges due to
implementation or use of cogeneration systems, fuel cell and renewable energy
technologies.
Pursuant to G.L. c. 164, §§ 1G(a)(1) and 1G(e), EDCs collect their transition costs from
customers through a non-bypassable charge, billed based on the amount of kilowatt-hours
(“kWh”) of electricity used. To the extent that a customer uses less electricity from the EDC,
that customer will pay a lower transition cost amount, and other customers will pay a larger share
of the EDC’s transition costs. An example of lowered electricity usage is self-generation that
operates with little or no use of power from an EDC’s power system.
In preparing this 2024 Annual Report, the Department relied on self-generation data from
the following EDCs: NSTAR Electric Company d/b/a Eversource Energy (legacy Boston Edison
Company, Commonwealth Electric Company, Cambridge Electric Light Company, and Western
2 An EDC’s transition costs include the following: (1) unrecovered fixed costs for
generation-related assets and obligations associated with producing electricity from
generation facilities that were being collected by Department-approved rates on
January 1, 1997, determined by the Department as prudently incurred and that became
uneconomic as a result of the creation of the competitive generation market; (2) nuclear
entitlements of an EDC that divested its non-nuclear generation facilities and liabilities
for nuclear plant post-shutdown and decommissioning costs not recoverable from the
authorized decommissioning fund; (3) unrecovered book-balance amounts of generation-
related regulatory assets; and (4) amounts by which the cost of contractual commitments
for purchased power exceeds the competitive market price for the power upon the
restructuring, buyout, or termination of the contract. G.L. c. 164, § 1G(b)(1)(i)-(iv).

Massachusetts Electric Company) (“NSTAR”);3 Fitchburg Gas and Electric Light Company
d/b/a Unitil (“Fitchburg”); and Massachusetts Electric Company and Nantucket Electric
Company, each d/b/a National Grid (“National Grid”).
II. AGGREGATE REDUCTION OF ELECTRICITY SALES
EDCs reported a total of 24,535 self-generation facilities installed during 2024. Of this
total, 23,516 installations (95.8 percent) were equal to or less than 60 kilowatts in size and were
photovoltaic (solar) systems. Furthermore, 24,369 of the installations (99.3 percent) were
eligible for net metering under the Department’s regulations at 220 CMR 18.00.
EDCs reported estimated reductions (combined reductions) in 2024 sales due to
self-generation installations equal to 2.4 million megawatt-hours (“MWh”),4 an approximate

Section 3:
5.07 percent reduction of total EDC sales for the calendar year. The percent reduction in
electricity sales for 2024 ranged from a low of 1.6 percent for NSTAR to a high of 12.1 percent
for Fitchburg.
For the period March 1, 1998 (the beginning of self-generation reporting) through
December 31, 2024, EDCs have reported an estimated cumulative reduction in electricity sales
due to self-generation of approximately 116.9 million MWh, representing 9.54 percent of total
EDCs’ sales since 1998, which were reportedly 1.2 billion MWh. The incremental reduction in
electricity sales of approximately 2.4 million MWh from 2024 represents 2.1 percent of the total
cumulative reduction in sales from self-generation installations over the past 26 years, since

Section 4:
1998.
III. IMPACT ON TRANSITION CHARGES
The EDCs have recovered nearly all of their transition costs through 2024.5 Currently,
transition costs are primarily a result of the EDCs’ cost responsibilities associated with legacy
3 These legacy companies have been merged into NSTAR Electric Company, which
operates within the Eversource Energy holding company system. For purposes of
self-generation reporting to the Department, Boston Edison Company, Commonwealth
Electric Company, and Cambridge Electric Light Company are grouped as “NSTAR” and
Western Massachusetts Electric Company is reported as “WMECo.”
4 A megawatt-hour equals 1,000 kWh.
5 At the end of 2020, the Department approved Fitchburg’s proposal to terminate its
transition charge. Fitchburg Gas and Electric Light Company, D.P.U. 20-134, at 4
(December 29, 2020). Transition charges for National Grid and NSTAR Electric are
currently credits to ratepayers (Department of Public Utilities 2023 Annual Report at 88).

long-term power purchase agreements. The level of associated transition costs can vary from
year to year based on the market value of the underlying power commitments. The EDCs’
estimated cumulative impact on transition costs related to self-generation since 1998 is less than

Section 5:
1.5 percent for each company.
IV. CONCLUSION
Based upon the self-generation information that the EDCs reported, the Department
concludes that for the period January 1, 2024 through December 31, 2024, self-generation did
not have a significant effect on the transition cost recovery of the EDCs operating in
Massachusetts. Regarding the impact of self-generation installations on electricity sales, the
2024 electricity sales reductions, in and of themselves, are relatively small.

James M. Van Nostrand, Chair

Therefore, the negative value for self-generation’s impact on National Grid’s recovery
reflects credits that National Grid has not had to pay to customers with on-site generating
facilities.
