Cannabis Social Equity Trust Fund
FY25 Annual Legislative Report
General Laws (“Authorizing Statute”) to administer the Cannabis Social Equity Trust Fund (“CSETF”), in
consultation with the Cannabis Social Equity Advisory Board (“Advisory Board”), for the purpose of
encouraging the full participation in the Commonwealth's regulated marijuana industry by entrepreneurs from
communities that have been disproportionately harmed by marijuana prohibition and enforcement.
EOED, in consultation with the Advisory Board, is required by the Authorizing Statute to annually submit a
report to the clerks of the House of Representatives and Senate, the House and Senate Committees on Ways and
Means and the Joint Committee on Cannabis Policy.
The report must identify and describe the amount of money expended from the fund; a list of the entities that
received a grant or loan from the fund; the geographic location of recipient entities; the form of funding
received by each entity; information indicating whether each recipient entity is a minority-owned entity; and
any information deemed appropriate to ensure equity and accountability.
Accordingly, EOED submits this report describing the activities of EOED and the Advisory Board covering the
time period from July 1st, 2024, through June 30th, 2025. A copy of this report will also be made publicly
available on EOED’s website.
Membership of the Cannabis Social Equity Advisory Board
The Advisory Board is established by Section 14A(b) of Chapter 94G of the Mass. General Laws, and consists

harmed by marijuana prohibition and enforcement. The current members of the Advisory Board are as follows:
• Governor Appointee (Chair) - Keisha Brice

Cannabis Social Equity Advisory Board Meetings
The Advisory Board met twice during the covered period of this report on July 22, 2024, and January 31, 2025.
Member discussions have included the following topics:
• Review of proposed program guidelines for the FY25 Social Equity Grant Program in anticipation of
publishing Notice of Funding Availability (NOFA);
• Review of awards issued for the FY25 Social Equity Grant Fund Program, as well as compliance and
reporting expectations for grantees;
• Description of a potential CSETF loan program; and
• Launch of the CSETF donations portal.
Implementation of Online Donations Portal for the CSETF
The CSETF Authorizing Statute requires funding for the Trust Fund to consist of a portion of funds transferred
by the Marijuana Regulation Fund as well as “any funds from private sources, including, but not limited to,
gifts, grants and donations.” See G.L. c. 94G section 14A(ii). Accordingly, on April 10, 2025, EOED launched
a donation portal on the CSETF program website to accept contributions in support of the Fund’s mission. The
launch of the donation portal represents an important opportunity for public and private stakeholders to
contribute to the advancement of the equitable participation in the cannabis industry across the Commonwealth.
As of June 30, 2025, the CSETF has received $12,001.00 in donations.
Trust Fund Balance

Section 2:
Section 14 of Chapter 94G of the General Laws establishes the Marijuana Regulation Fund that receives money
resulting from applications and licensing for marijuana establishments, civil penalties for violations of Chapter
94G and revenue generated by the state tax imposed by section 2 of chapter 64N of the General Laws and
interest earned or income on balances in the fund. On an annual basis at the beginning of each calendar year,
fifteen percent of Marijuana Regulation Fund is transferred to the Cannabis Social Equity Trust Fund.
At the start of the fiscal year, the Trust Fund had a total balance of $27,278,317. In April 2025, the calendar
year transfer was deposited in the amount of $29,001,226, and $12,001 was deposited from various donations
that were received during the year. The total available funds in FY25 were $56,291,544.
In December 2024, EOED announced grant awards totaling $26,500,000 through the FY25 application round of
the Social Equity Grant Program. In addition, EOED allocated approximately $230,918 to cover the program’s
administrative costs. During the year, a total of $26,730,918 from the Trust Fund was spent or committed.
At the end of the fiscal year, the balance of uncommitted funds in the Trust Fund was $29,560,626.
FY25 Social Equity Grant Program Overview
The FY25 Social Equity Grant Program (“FY25 Grant Program”) launched in September 2024 as the second
major funding initiative of the CSETF. This program was designed to provide critical financial support to
cannabis businesses owned by individuals disproportionately harmed by marijuana prohibition and
enforcement.
Page 2 of 9
The FY25 Grant Program received a total of 278 applications and awarded a total of $26,500,000 in grant
funding to 181 social equity businesses across the Commonwealth. Grant awards ranged from $25,000 to
$500,000, with funding amounts determined by the applicant’s license status and business development stage.

Eligible applicants included Pre-Licensed Cannabis Businesses, Marijuana Establishments, and Medical

Empowerment Priority Applicants or Social Equity Program Participants by the Massachusetts Cannabis
Control Commission (CCC).
The funding supported a range of eligible business expenses, including but not limited to:

Cannabis Social Equity Trust Fund
FY25 Annual Legislative Report
The Executive Office of Economic Development (“EOED”) is required by Section 14A of Chapter 94G of the
General Laws (“Authorizing Statute”) to administer the Cannabis Social Equity Trust Fund (“CSETF”), in
consultation with the Cannabis Social Equity Advisory Board (“Advisory Board”), for the purpose of
encouraging the full participation in the Commonwealth's regulated marijuana industry by entrepreneurs from
communities that have been disproportionately harmed by marijuana prohibition and enforcement.
EOED, in consultation with the Advisory Board, is required by the Authorizing Statute to annually submit a
report to the clerks of the House of Representatives and Senate, the House and Senate Committees on Ways and
Means and the Joint Committee on Cannabis Policy.
The report must identify and describe the amount of money expended from the fund; a list of the entities that
received a grant or loan from the fund; the geographic location of recipient entities; the form of funding
received by each entity; information indicating whether each recipient entity is a minority-owned entity; and
any information deemed appropriate to ensure equity and accountability.
Accordingly, EOED submits this report describing the activities of EOED and the Advisory Board covering the
time period from July 1st, 2024, through June 30th, 2025. A copy of this report will also be made publicly
available on EOED’s website.
Membership of the Cannabis Social Equity Advisory Board

• Review of awards issued for the FY25 Social Equity Grant Fund Program, as well as compliance and
reporting expectations for grantees;
• Description of a potential CSETF loan program; and
• Launch of the CSETF donations portal.
Implementation of Online Donations Portal for the CSETF
The CSETF Authorizing Statute requires funding for the Trust Fund to consist of a portion of funds transferred
by the Marijuana Regulation Fund as well as “any funds from private sources, including, but not limited to,
gifts, grants and donations.” See G.L. c. 94G section 14A(ii). Accordingly, on April 10, 2025, EOED launched
a donation portal on the CSETF program website to accept contributions in support of the Fund’s mission. The
launch of the donation portal represents an important opportunity for public and private stakeholders to
contribute to the advancement of the equitable participation in the cannabis industry across the Commonwealth.
As of June 30, 2025, the CSETF has received $12,001.00 in donations.
Trust Fund Balance
Section 14 of Chapter 94G of the General Laws establishes the Marijuana Regulation Fund that receives money
resulting from applications and licensing for marijuana establishments, civil penalties for violations of Chapter
94G and revenue generated by the state tax imposed by section 2 of chapter 64N of the General Laws and
interest earned or income on balances in the fund. On an annual basis at the beginning of each calendar year,
fifteen percent of Marijuana Regulation Fund is transferred to the Cannabis Social Equity Trust Fund.
At the start of the fiscal year, the Trust Fund had a total balance of $27,278,317. In April 2025, the calendar
year transfer was deposited in the amount of $29,001,226, and $12,001 was deposited from various donations
that were received during the year. The total available funds in FY25 were $56,291,544.
In December 2024, EOED announced grant awards totaling $26,500,000 through the FY25 application round of
the Social Equity Grant Program. In addition, EOED allocated approximately $230,918 to cover the program’s
administrative costs. During the year, a total of $26,730,918 from the Trust Fund was spent or committed.
At the end of the fiscal year, the balance of uncommitted funds in the Trust Fund was $29,560,626.
FY25 Social Equity Grant Program Overview
The FY25 Social Equity Grant Program (“FY25 Grant Program”) launched in September 2024 as the second
major funding initiative of the CSETF. This program was designed to provide critical financial support to
cannabis businesses owned by individuals disproportionately harmed by marijuana prohibition and
enforcement.
Page 2 of 9

The FY25 Grant Program received a total of 278 applications and awarded a total of $26,500,000 in grant
funding to 181 social equity businesses across the Commonwealth. Grant awards ranged from $25,000 to
$500,000, with funding amounts determined by the applicant’s license status and business development stage.
Applicants selected one of four program tiers when applying, depending on eligibility:
• Tier 1: Industry Entry Support – Pre-licensed social equity cannabis businesses
• Tier 2: Immediate Needs – Provisional and final licensees needing urgent operational support
• Tier 3: Support for License Acquisition and Commencement of Business Operations – Provisional
licensees seeking financial support to commence operations
• Tier 4: Existing Business Growth and Expansion – Operational businesses seeking to improve or expand
Eligible applicants included Pre-Licensed Cannabis Businesses, Marijuana Establishments, and Medical
Marijuana Treatment Centers with a majority of ownership held by individuals designated as Economic
Empowerment Priority Applicants or Social Equity Program Participants by the Massachusetts Cannabis
Control Commission (CCC).
The funding supported a range of eligible business expenses, including but not limited to:
• Immediate needs (e.g., rent, payroll, debt service, taxes)
• Professional services (e.g., legal, accounting, compliance)
• Facility-related costs (e.g., construction, renovations)
• Licensing and regulatory fees
• Business expenses including equipment and supplies
• Business related insurance fees
• Vehicle lease and purchases
All funds are being distributed on a cost-reimbursement basis, and recipients are required to comply with
program reporting and documentation requirements. See Attachment A for the full list of grantees, award tiers
and amounts, and minority business designation, as applicable.
