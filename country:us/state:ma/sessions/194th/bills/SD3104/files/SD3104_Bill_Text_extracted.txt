Introduction
Senate Committees on Ways and Means in accordance with legislative language related to line item
7004-9316, the Residential Assistance for Families in Transition (RAFT) program, below:
provided further, that the department shall submit quarterly reports to the house and senate committees
on ways and means detailing the: (1) number of families who applied for assistance; (2) number of
families approved for assistance; (3) minimum, median and average amount of financial assistance
awarded; (4) total amount of assistance awarded to date, including a breakdown by income category;
and (5) number of families falling into each income category.

Applications
Household cases applied for assistance 43,575
Households approved for assistance 11,975
Households denied assistance 8,609
Note that a household who is approved for assistance may apply one or more times. The approval rate
appears artificially low for this reason as a household may apply and have their application timed out for
missing documentation (for example) but later reapply and be approved.
Households may be approved for assistance more than once, but within the same quarter, this is rare.
Any household who applied or was approved more than once in a quarter is counted more than once.
“Households who applied for assistance” includes all incoming applications. “Households approved for
assistance” and all data in “Financial Assistance Awarded” includes only applications funded by RAFT and
not any applications funded by reallocated federal Emergency Rental Assistance dollars.

Median amount of financial assistance awarded $3,050
