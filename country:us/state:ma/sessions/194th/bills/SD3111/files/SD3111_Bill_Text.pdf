Introduction
The Department of Elementary and Secondary Education (DESE) respectfully submits
this Report to the Legislature: fiscal year 2024 Annual Report to the Legislature on the
Progress of Green School Works Program pursuant to Outside Section 35 of the fiscal
year 2024 GAA Budget, which amended Chapter 69 by adding Section 37(c):
SECTION 35
Section 35 Green School Works
Said Chapter 69 is hereby further amended by adding the following section:-
Section 37. (a)(1) There shall be a competitive grant program, known as Green School Works,
to provide financial support to eligible K-12 public schools or districts for projects to install or
maintain clean energy infrastructure. The program shall be administered by the department, in
consultation with the Massachusetts Clean Energy Technology Center, established by Section 2
of Chapter 23J. Grants shall be made available to address the costs of installation, operation, or
upgrades of clean energy infrastructure that improves energy efficiency, reduces carbon
emissions, or mitigates impacts of climate change, including school rooftop construction or
repair costs necessary for a clean energy infrastructure project to be safely installed; provided,
that such installation, operation or upgrades shall be conducted in compliance with any relevant
procurement laws, including, but not limited to, Chapter 149 and all state and local building
codes.
(2) Grants awarded by the department shall maximize the total number of projects that shall be
undertaken by public schools or districts.
(b) The department, in consultation with the Massachusetts Clean Energy Technology Center,
shall establish eligibility and selection criteria for the program. The department may give
preference to grant applications from schools serving low-income and environmental justice
populations.
(c) Annually, not later than July 15, the commissioner shall report to the clerks of the House of
Representatives and the Senate, the Joint Committee on Education, the Joint Committee on
Telecommunications, Utilities and Energy, and the House and Senate Committees on Ways and
Means on the grants awarded during the previous fiscal year, including the grant amount, grant
recipient, a description of the project for which the grant was awarded and any progress on
completion of the project.
(d) The department, in consultation with the Massachusetts Clean Energy Technology Center
and the Massachusetts School Building Authority, established by section 1A of Chapter 70B,
shall promulgate regulations to implement this section.
Created as part of the state’s fiscal year 2024 budget, the goal of the Green School
Works program (the “Program”) is to provide financial support to “K-12 public schools or
districts for projects to install or maintain clean energy infrastructure.” The program is
meant to address “the costs of installation, operation, or upgrades of clean energy
5

infrastructure that improves energy efficiency, reduces carbon emissions, or mitigates
the impacts of climate change, including school rooftop construction or repair costs
necessary for a clean energy infrastructure project to be safely installed.” The enabling
legislation additionally sets as objectives maximizing the total number of projects
undertaken by public schools or districts and giving preference to projects for schools
serving low-income and environmental justice populations.
As we noted in last year’s legislative report, based on the input of a working group of
clean energy and school building experts from across state government, DESE
transferred the funds to the Massachusetts Clean Energy Center (MassCEC) to run the
program, while DESE maintains oversight for the program (reporting, regulating, etc.) as
specified in the budget language.
Implementation Grant Launch
Following a robust stakeholder engagement and planning process in 2024 and early
2025, the Green School Works Implementation Grant program opened up for proposals
from eligible Massachusetts kindergarten through 12th grade public schools, districts,
and collaboratives.
The heart of the implementation grant program lies in its commitment to equity and
sustainability. Funding eligibility was prioritized for schools, districts, and collaboratives
where at least 40% of students are classified as low-income, ensuring that the benefits
of cleaner air, lower energy bills, and healthier learning environments reach the
communities that need them most. Many of these schools are located in environmental
justice communities that have historically borne the brunt of environmental degradation
and underinvestment.
MassCEC accepted applications during a monthlong window, from March 31, 2025,
through April 30, 2025. A round of communications was done to drum up interest in the
program, including email blasts from multiple agencies, as well as webinars and partner
organization outreach. Interest from school districts was stronger than anticipated, with
MassCEC ultimately receiving 54 grant requests totaling $159.7 million.
Green School Works Implementation Grants provide eligible schools, districts, and
collaboratives with funding to implement projects that improve energy efficiency, reduce
carbon emissions, or mitigate the impacts of climate change. The funding opportunity
was intentionally broad and flexible to support a range of project types from a small
project involving a single technology to a full school decarbonization project.

Implementation Grant Awards
After the close of the application process window, a cross-agency team reviewed all of
the proposals and scored them based on the criteria outlined in the request for
proposals (“RFP”). As outlined in the RFP, there was an effort to select projects at
schools and collaboratives throughout the Commonwealth, in both large and small
districts, that:
• Met the goals of the Green School Works program (serving low-income students,
reducing energy and emissions, and providing other benefits to the school
community including resilience),
• Had the relevant capacity, support, and budget in place to ensure the project’s
success, and
• Contributed to developing school decarbonization evidence-based practices
(tests an innovative solution, demonstrates a highly replicable approach, and/or
fills a funding gap).
In June 2025, MassCEC awarded $52.5 million for the following 18 projects under the
Green School Works implementation grant program:

Technical Assistance
On June 30, 2025, MassCEC opened the Green School Works technical assistance
offering to eligible schools, districts, and collaboratives. MassCEC has prequalified 17
vendors to provide technical assistance and plans to begin making awards to vendors to
provide Green School Works technical assistance in fiscal year 2026.
Technical Assistance offers an excellent opportunity for eligible schools, districts, and
collaboratives to receive low- or no-cost support for decarbonization planning that
focuses on modern, energy efficient school buildings and facilities. The Green School
Works technical assistance offerings described below were designed to align with Mass
Save® offerings, so that Mass Save-eligible schools, districts, and collaboratives could
stack Green School Works funding on top of Mass Save funding. This ensures that
Green School Works funding will have the most impact by leveraging Mass Save
funding while reducing or eliminating any co-pays for low-income serving schools and
adds renewable energy analysis to the state’s main source of electrification planning.
Adding Green School Works technical assistance services to Mass Save offerings also
streamlines the experience for schools, districts, and collaboratives that will work with a
single vendor and get a single report. The Green School Works technical assistance
services are:
• Comprehensive Building Assessment: A scoping study to assess the current
conditions at a building and identify energy-saving and carbon emissions
reducing opportunities, including weatherization and building electrification.
Additional scope can be added to include the context of local ordinances such as
BERDO and BEUDO.
• Portfolio Decarbonization Roadmap: An in-depth, high-rigor assessment of the
strategies a school district or collaborative would need to employ to meet specific
decarbonization targets for a portfolio of buildings (e.g. multiple buildings on one
campus or multiple buildings across a school district). In addition to
weatherization, building electrification, and energy efficiency, this study may also
address other impacts such as motor vehicle fleets, maintenance equipment, and
the embodied carbon of construction materials.
• Focused Study: A detailed study investigating the economic and energy impacts
of implementing a measure or specific set of measures. These are often needed
when submitting a Mass Save application for custom projects where an estimate
of energy savings and cost is required.
Each of these services includes a renewable energy feasibility analysis and
Massachusetts Class I Renewable Energy Certificate (REC) analysis paid for by Green
School Works. Participants will also receive information on available incentives and
funding opportunities for energy-efficient and fossil-fuel-free technologies and
infrastructure.
When the eligible school, district, or collaborative is not a Mass Save customer,
MassCEC will pay for all or part of the total technical assistance cost.

Fiscal Year 2026 Activities
As stated above, in FY26 MassCEC intends to contract with all of the grantees listed
above and begin dispersing funding as projects move forward. MassCEC will also enroll
eligible schools, districts, and collaboratives in the technical assistance services
described above.
An additional $10 million was allocated to Green School Works in the supplemental
budget for Fiscal Year 2025, as well as an additional $10 million in the State’s Fiscal
Year 2026 budget. DESE and MassCEC intend to use these resources to issue new
funding opportunities in FY26.
