Commission Charge
The commission was charged to study and report on:

Section 7:
Section 29 of Chapter 197 of the
Acts of 2024
I. Continuing care retirement communities, their care contracts, and
their impact on consumers
II. The financial viability of CCRCs
III. The payment and return of entrance fees at CCRCs
IV. Statutory and regulatory oversight of CCRCs, including any activities by state agencies to enforce those
regulatory requirements
V. Advertising practices communicated to potential residents and families about CCRCs
VI. Regulatory procedures for the closure or change of ownership of CCRCs
The Commission was also required to:

recommendations, to the Clerks of the House of Representatives and the Senate, the Joint Committee on
Aging and Independence and the Senate and House Committees on Ways and Means no later than
August 1st, 2025.
10
Overall Findings
I. CCRCs are a unique model that provide housing, medical care, and social support to
residents across the Commonwealth.
II. Given key metrics, the CCRC industry in Massachusetts is financially robust and in-
demand, though it can be financially challenging for CCRCs with SNF units.
III. CCRC entrance fees are an important aspect that allow communities to invest
in capital and manage debt. Many residents and families feel that there needs to be
more transparency and a deadline to when entrance fees are refunded.
IV.CCRCs lack a uniform regulatory body.
V. It can be confusing for consumers to know which communities are CCRCs and which
communities are not.
VI.Since CCRCs lack a uniform regulatory body, there is no uniform procedure for the
closure of or change of ownership of a CCRC.
11
Charge I: The commission shall study and report on
continuing care retirement communities, their care contracts
and their impact on consumers
12
Charge I – Findings
CCRCs are a unique model that provide housing, medical care, and social
support to residents across the Commonwealth.
• There are 29 total CCRCs registered
with AGE in the Commonwealth, 22
of which are non-profits.
• CCRCs have been operating in
Massachusetts for 40+ years.
• More than half of CCRCs are in the
greater Boston area.

Charge I - Findings
Continuing Care Retirement Community (CCRC) Definition:
• CCRCs must provide board and lodging together with nursing services, medical services or other health
related services, regardless of whether the lodging and services are provided at the same location.
• CCRCs must have a contract that is effective for the life of the individual or for a period more than one year.
• CCRCs charge an entrance fee. This entrance fee is separate and distinct from any fee payable to the CCRC
on a periodic basis for board, lodging, medical or other health related services or an application fee.
CCRC Consumer Guide
Entrance Fee Definition: (AGE)
• An initial or deferred transfer to a provider of a sum of money or other property made or promised to be made
as full or partial consideration for acceptance of a specified individual as a resident in a facility. No part of
any fee payable on a periodic basis for board, lodging, medical or other health related services rendered by
the provider to a resident shall be considered as constituting an entrance fee. No application charge or other
sum payable in addition to such periodic fees, which does not exceed four times such periodic fees, shall be
considered as constituting an entrance fee.
M.G.L. ch. 93 § 76
14
Charge I - Findings
Overview: CCRCs in Massachusetts
• The level of medical services offered by CCRCs varies, as not all offer
an assisted living residence (ALR) unit or a skilled nursing facility (SNF)
unit.
• CCRC occupancy is generally driven by personal consumer choice,
rather than medical necessity as is often the case in ALRs or SNFs.
• Demand is high for CCRCs with an average occupancy rate of ~ 90%
and higher rates for non-profits. This results in lengthy waitlists for
consumers.
15
Charge I - Findings
Residents of CCRCs tend to exhibit greater physical, social, and
intellectual wellness compared to older adults in the community at
large.

Days of Cash on Hand
The table to the right includes several
financial ratios that can be used to
determine a CCRC's financial standing.
For a single-site CCRC:
• The 25th percentile has 266 days of

• The 50th percentile has 419 days of
cash on hand.
• The 75th percentile has 720 days of

Charge II - Findings
CCRCs with a SNF Unit
CHIA collects financial data about SNFs, including SNF units within CCRCs. The data
comes from nursing home cost reports that MassHealth uses for rate renewal processes.
In 2022, 11 SNF units within CCRCs were operating with a negative profit margin. In 2023,
the number decreased to 8 SNF units.
This suggests that it may be more financially challenging for CCRCs with SNF units to
operate and speaks to the high cost of operating a SNF.
25
Charge II - Findings

26
Charge III: The commission shall study and report on the
payment and return of entrance fees at CCRCs
27
Charge III - Findings
CCRC entrance fees are an important aspect that allow communities to invest in
capital and manage debt. Many residents and families feel that there needs to be
more transparency and a deadline to when entrance fees are refunded.
28
Charge III - Findings
CCRCs require entrance fees for all residents. The amount of the entrance fee can
depend on the contract type signed by the resident.
Type A: Life Care Type B: Modified Type C: Fee for Service

29
Charge III - Findings
Most CCRCs have long waitlists for incoming residents, which means residents
and their families receive their entrance fee refund in a timely manner.
However, some CCRC residents and their families have reported that it has
taken months or in some rare cases, years, for their entrance fee to be
refunded. The refunds are returned when the unit is reoccupied, so if a resident
was occupying a less desirable unit, they may wait longer than other residents
for their refund. Residents may also experience long wait times during times of
crisis, such as recessions or pandemics.
30
Charge III - Findings
CCRCs use the entrance fee funds for several purposes:
• Capital improvements to the facility.
• In contract types A and B, it can be used as a pre-payment for future healthcare
services.
• It can be used to pay down debt or enhance liquidity.
• Incoming entrance fees from new residents are used to refund the former resident
and/or their family when they have moved out or have passed away.
• Amenities to the facility, including operating expenses.
Some CCRC providers argue that if they are required to refund an entrance fee before a
unit has been re-occupied, it could jeopardize the community and the current residents
living there and that a strict deadline for the entrance fee could stifle the development of
new CCRCs.
31
Charge IV: The commission shall study and report
on statutory and regulatory oversight of CCRCs, including any
activities by state agencies to enforce
regulatory requirements
32
Charge IV - Findings
CCRCs lack a uniform regulatory body.
• If a CCRC features a Skilled Nursing Facility (SNF) component, the
Department of Public Health (DPH) has oversight over the nursing unit.
• If a CCRC includes an Assisted Living Residence (ALR) that is advertised
independently from the Life Plan, the Executive Office of Aging and
Independence (AGE) has oversight over the ALR.
• Commission members expressed concern that some CCRCs may advertise
"supportive care" rather than "assisted living" to bypass AGE oversight.
• Independent Living units in a CCRC do not have a regulatory body
overseeing them.
33
Charge IV - Findings
AGE requires for CCRCs to submit a copy of the following information within 30 days
of marketing of the facility begins:

Section 15:
1. the disclosure statement required under subsection (b) to be delivered to the
persons with whom the contract for continuing care is to be entered;

Section 16:
2. the contracts for continuing care to be entered into by the provider under
subsection (c) with a person who will occupy a living unit in a continuing care
facility; and

Section 17:
3. any available advertising or promotional material to be used in conjunction with
such marketing effort.
M.G.L. 93 § 76
34
Charge IV - Findings
35
Charge IV - Findings
Attorney General's Office and Chapter 93A Protections
Chapter 93A enables the Attorney General to take legal action against unfair or
deceptive conduct by businesses operating in the Commonwealth.
Residents of CCRCs can file complaints about misleading marketing
or contract violations. Potential enforcement powers include investigations,
civil enforcement actions, and consumer complaint resolutions.
36
Charge V: The commission shall study and report
on advertising practices communicated to potential
residents and families about CCRCs
37
Charge V - Findings
It can be confusing for consumers to know which communities are CCRCs and
which communities are not.
According to M.G.L. 93 § 76, "continuing care" is defined as the furnishing to an individual, other than an
individual related by consanguinity or affinity to the person furnishing such care, of board and lodging together
with nursing services, medical services or other health related services, regardless of whether or not the
lodging and services are provided at the same location, pursuant to a contract effective for the life of the
individual or for a period in excess of one year.
This means that CCRCs have to offer more than one type of care, but they don't have to offer the full continuum:
independent units, assisted living units and SNF units. For example, some CCRCs may not have SNF units on
campus but provide both independent and assisted units. Providers on the Commission also noted that their
residents have a strong desire to stay in independent living as long as possible and there are new programs that
allow residents to receive assisted living and skilled nursing care in their units.
38
Charge V - Findings
M.G.L. 93 § 76 defines "marketing" as including but not limited to the establishment of a waiting list,
acceptance of money, property or other consideration or distribution of marketing brochures by the provider.
CCRCs are required to provide the following information to AGE:

Section 18:
1. the disclosure statement required under subsection (b) to be delivered to the persons with whom the
contract for continuing care is to be entered;

Section 19:
2. the contracts for continuing care to be entered into by the provider under subsection (c) with a person
who will occupy a living unit in a continuing care facility; and

Section 20:
3. any available advertising or promotional material to be used in conjunction with such marketing
effort.
AGE is required make such information available to the public in a manner which shall allow residents and
prospective residents to make informed choices regarding the selection of a provider, packages of services
and coverage and care alternatives.
39
Charge V - Findings
Some communities that feature independent living may advertise themselves as a
CCRC, which can be confusing for consumers.
The Executive Office of Aging and Independence maintains a CCRC Consumer Guide,
which has guiding questions for residents and their families to ask to fully understand
what the facility offers and what contract they are entering.
Industry representatives have asserted that CCRCs with high occupancy and long
waitlists generally do not need to advertise themselves.
40
Charge VI: The commission shall study and report
on regulatory procedures for the closure or change of
ownership of CCRCs.
41
Charge VI - Findings
Since CCRCs lack a uniform regulatory body, there is no uniform procedure for
the closure of or change of ownership of a CCRC.
42
Charge VI - Findings
If there is a closure or change of ownership for a SNF unit within a CCRC, the CCRC will
follow the procedure for a closure or change of ownership of a SNF regulated by DPH.
Closure procedure: Change of ownership procedure:
• The facility must notify DPH and those • The prospective owner must submit a

• DPH will review and approve the closure plan.
• The facility will work with residents to find

alternative placements.
43
Charge VI - Findings
If there is a change of ownership for an ALR unit within a CCRC, the CCRC will follow the
procedure for a change of ownership of an ALR regulated by AGE.
Change of ownership procedure:
• Any person or entity who intends to acquire a 25% or greater interest in an ALR must apply for
certification to AGE at least 30 days prior to the transfer of ownership.
• If AGE receives the correct documents at least 30 days in advance, the applicant will be
deemed temporarily certified, until AGE approves or denies their application.
• When a transfer of ownership happens, it is within the Secretary's discretion to conduct a full
or partial compliance review.
651 CMR 12.00
44
Charge VI - Findings
The below includes changes made to closures or changes in ownership for ALRs in Chapter
197 of the Acts of 2024. The regulations are currently in development by AGE.
ALRs:
• Lowers the ownership disclosure during the certification process from 25% to 5%

45
Charge VI - Findings
The below includes changes made to closures or changes in ownership for SNFs in Chapter 197 of the
Acts of 2024. The regulations are currently in development by DPH.
Chapter 197 of the Acts of 2024
SNFs:
During the suitability review for a new facility or a new owner, DPH will now consider:
• the criminal or civil litigation history of the applicant, potential transferee, or management company
• the financial capacity of the applicant, potential transferee, or management company
• the history of applicant, potential transferee, or management company in providing quality long-term care
in the Commonwealth
• the history of applicant, potential transferee, or management company in providing quality long-term care
outside the Commonwealth
Additionally, the law updates the definition of “owner” and expands the scope of oversight into management
functions by including management companies. It also requires DPH to notify the Legislature within 3
business days of being notified of a long-term care facility’s decision to close.
46
Recommendations
47
Consensus
The CCRC Commission defines consensus as no stated opposition to
any of the recommendations discussed.
48
Recommendations
The CCRC Commission came to a consensus on the following
recommendations:
I. Pass S.478, the disclosure bill, to increase transparency for
consumers around the entrance fee refund
II. Update AGE's consumer guide
49
Recommendation I
The CCRC Commission endorses and recommends passage of S478 to
increase transparency for consumers around the entrance fee refund.
S478, An Act relative to disclosing continuing care retirement community
entrance fees, would require CCRCs to give prospective residents a separate
document that clearly states:
• The amount of the entrance fee to be refunded to the resident under the
provider's contract
• The terms, conditions and explanation of the process by which the
provider will make such refund to the resident after the resident leaves
the facility or passes away
50
Recommendation II
The CCRC Commission recommends that AGE's consumer guide be
updated.
• Recommend for AGE to collaborate with LeadingAge MA, MLCRA,
Massachusetts Senior Care Association, Massachusetts Assisted Living
Association, and AARP on updating the consumer guide.
• Require AGE to update the consumer guide annually.
• Require that the consumer guide include a list of known CCRCs in the
Commonwealth.
• Require that CCRCs give prospective residents access to the consumer
guide.
51
Other Recommendations Considered
The CCRC Commission recommends further discussion on
other recommendations considered, such as:
• A mandate that each CCRC board include not less than one resident member
with voting rights.
• The resident board member would be chosen by the residents of each
CCRC.
52
Other Recommendations Considered
The CCRC Commission recommends further discussion on
other recommendations considered, such as:
• Recommending that CCRC boards hold an open meeting each year.
• The open meeting will be an opportunity for residents and family
members to have their opinions and concerns heard by their respective
CCRC's board.
53
Other Recommendations Considered
The CCRC Commission recommends further discussion on other
recommendations considered, such as:
• Recommending changes to how CCRCs refund their entrance fees,
including:
• A sequential model, meaning that residents/families would receive their refund
in the order of when they left the unit.
• An interest model, meaning that the CCRC would pay interest to the resident or
their family each month until the unit is re-occupied.
• A blanket 1-year deadline, meaning that the CCRC would be required to issue
the refund within 1 year of the resident leaving the unit.
54
Other Recommendations Considered
The CCRC Commission recommends further discussion on
other recommendations considered, such as:
• Recommending changes to how CCRCs are defined in the statute,
including:
• Recommending that AGE certify or register CCRCs, so consumers have a clear
picture of which facility is a CCRC, and which facility is not a CCRC.
• Requiring that all CCRCs offer the entire continuum of care. Currently, CCRCs
are required to offer more than one type of care.

Findings by Charge
9

Commission Charge
The commission was charged to study and report on:
Section 29 of Chapter 197 of the
Acts of 2024
I. Continuing care retirement communities, their care contracts, and
their impact on consumers
II. The financial viability of CCRCs
III. The payment and return of entrance fees at CCRCs
IV. Statutory and regulatory oversight of CCRCs, including any activities by state agencies to enforce those
regulatory requirements
V. Advertising practices communicated to potential residents and families about CCRCs
VI. Regulatory procedures for the closure or change of ownership of CCRCs
The Commission was also required to:
• Submit a report with recommendations, including legislation or regulations necessary to carry out such
recommendations, to the Clerks of the House of Representatives and the Senate, the Joint Committee on
Aging and Independence and the Senate and House Committees on Ways and Means no later than
August 1st, 2025.
10

Overall Findings
I. CCRCs are a unique model that provide housing, medical care, and social support to
residents across the Commonwealth.
II. Given key metrics, the CCRC industry in Massachusetts is financially robust and in-
demand, though it can be financially challenging for CCRCs with SNF units.
III. CCRC entrance fees are an important aspect that allow communities to invest
in capital and manage debt. Many residents and families feel that there needs to be
more transparency and a deadline to when entrance fees are refunded.
IV.CCRCs lack a uniform regulatory body.
V. It can be confusing for consumers to know which communities are CCRCs and which
communities are not.
VI.Since CCRCs lack a uniform regulatory body, there is no uniform procedure for the
closure of or change of ownership of a CCRC.
11

Charge I: The commission shall study and report on
continuing care retirement communities, their care contracts
and their impact on consumers
12

Charge I – Findings
CCRCs are a unique model that provide housing, medical care, and social
support to residents across the Commonwealth.
• There are 29 total CCRCs registered
with AGE in the Commonwealth, 22
of which are non-profits.
• CCRCs have been operating in
Massachusetts for 40+ years.
• More than half of CCRCs are in the
greater Boston area.

Charge I - Findings
Continuing Care Retirement Community (CCRC) Definition:
• CCRCs must provide board and lodging together with nursing services, medical services or other health
related services, regardless of whether the lodging and services are provided at the same location.
• CCRCs must have a contract that is effective for the life of the individual or for a period more than one year.
• CCRCs charge an entrance fee. This entrance fee is separate and distinct from any fee payable to the CCRC
on a periodic basis for board, lodging, medical or other health related services or an application fee.
CCRC Consumer Guide
Entrance Fee Definition: (AGE)
• An initial or deferred transfer to a provider of a sum of money or other property made or promised to be made
as full or partial consideration for acceptance of a specified individual as a resident in a facility. No part of
any fee payable on a periodic basis for board, lodging, medical or other health related services rendered by
the provider to a resident shall be considered as constituting an entrance fee. No application charge or other
sum payable in addition to such periodic fees, which does not exceed four times such periodic fees, shall be
considered as constituting an entrance fee.
M.G.L. ch. 93 § 76
14

Charge I - Findings
Overview: CCRCs in Massachusetts
• The level of medical services offered by CCRCs varies, as not all offer
an assisted living residence (ALR) unit or a skilled nursing facility (SNF)
unit.
• CCRC occupancy is generally driven by personal consumer choice,
rather than medical necessity as is often the case in ALRs or SNFs.
• Demand is high for CCRCs with an average occupancy rate of ~ 90%
and higher rates for non-profits. This results in lengthy waitlists for
consumers.
15

Charge I - Findings
Residents of CCRCs tend to exhibit greater physical, social, and
intellectual wellness compared to older adults in the community at
large.

new residents:
1. The name and business address of the provider and a statement of whether the provider is a
partnership, corporation, or other type of legal entity.
2. The names of the officers, directors, trustees, or managing or general partners of the provider and a
description of each such person's occupation with the provider.
3. A description of the business experience of the provider in the operation or management of similar

18

Charge I - Findings
CCRCs are required to submit the following information in their disclosure
to new residents:
5. The location and description of the physical property or properties of the facility, existing or
proposed; and to the extent proposed, the estimated completion date or dates, whether or
not construction has begun and the contingencies subject to which construction may be deferred.

Charge II - Findings
CCRCs with a SNF Unit
CHIA collects financial data about SNFs, including SNF units within CCRCs. The data
comes from nursing home cost reports that MassHealth uses for rate renewal processes.
In 2022, 11 SNF units within CCRCs were operating with a negative profit margin. In 2023,
the number decreased to 8 SNF units.
This suggests that it may be more financially challenging for CCRCs with SNF units to
operate and speaks to the high cost of operating a SNF.
25

Charge II - Findings

Charge III: The commission shall study and report on the
payment and return of entrance fees at CCRCs
27

Charge III - Findings
CCRC entrance fees are an important aspect that allow communities to invest in
capital and manage debt. Many residents and families feel that there needs to be
more transparency and a deadline to when entrance fees are refunded.
28

Charge III - Findings
CCRCs require entrance fees for all residents. The amount of the entrance fee can
depend on the contract type signed by the resident.

29

Charge III - Findings
Most CCRCs have long waitlists for incoming residents, which means residents
and their families receive their entrance fee refund in a timely manner.
However, some CCRC residents and their families have reported that it has
taken months or in some rare cases, years, for their entrance fee to be
refunded. The refunds are returned when the unit is reoccupied, so if a resident
was occupying a less desirable unit, they may wait longer than other residents
for their refund. Residents may also experience long wait times during times of
crisis, such as recessions or pandemics.
30

Charge III - Findings
CCRCs use the entrance fee funds for several purposes:
• Capital improvements to the facility.
• In contract types A and B, it can be used as a pre-payment for future healthcare
services.
• It can be used to pay down debt or enhance liquidity.
• Incoming entrance fees from new residents are used to refund the former resident
and/or their family when they have moved out or have passed away.
• Amenities to the facility, including operating expenses.
Some CCRC providers argue that if they are required to refund an entrance fee before a
unit has been re-occupied, it could jeopardize the community and the current residents
living there and that a strict deadline for the entrance fee could stifle the development of
new CCRCs.
31

Charge IV: The commission shall study and report
on statutory and regulatory oversight of CCRCs, including any
activities by state agencies to enforce
regulatory requirements
32

Charge IV - Findings
CCRCs lack a uniform regulatory body.
• If a CCRC features a Skilled Nursing Facility (SNF) component, the
Department of Public Health (DPH) has oversight over the nursing unit.
• If a CCRC includes an Assisted Living Residence (ALR) that is advertised
independently from the Life Plan, the Executive Office of Aging and
Independence (AGE) has oversight over the ALR.
• Commission members expressed concern that some CCRCs may advertise
"supportive care" rather than "assisted living" to bypass AGE oversight.
• Independent Living units in a CCRC do not have a regulatory body
overseeing them.
33

Charge IV - Findings
AGE requires for CCRCs to submit a copy of the following information within 30 days
of marketing of the facility begins:
1. the disclosure statement required under subsection (b) to be delivered to the
persons with whom the contract for continuing care is to be entered;
2. the contracts for continuing care to be entered into by the provider under
subsection (c) with a person who will occupy a living unit in a continuing care
facility; and
3. any available advertising or promotional material to be used in conjunction with
such marketing effort.
M.G.L. 93 § 76
34

Charge IV - Findings
35

Charge IV - Findings
Attorney General's Office and Chapter 93A Protections
Chapter 93A enables the Attorney General to take legal action against unfair or
deceptive conduct by businesses operating in the Commonwealth.
Residents of CCRCs can file complaints about misleading marketing
or contract violations. Potential enforcement powers include investigations,
civil enforcement actions, and consumer complaint resolutions.
36

Charge V: The commission shall study and report
on advertising practices communicated to potential
residents and families about CCRCs
37

Charge V - Findings
It can be confusing for consumers to know which communities are CCRCs and
which communities are not.
According to M.G.L. 93 § 76, "continuing care" is defined as the furnishing to an individual, other than an
individual related by consanguinity or affinity to the person furnishing such care, of board and lodging together
with nursing services, medical services or other health related services, regardless of whether or not the
lodging and services are provided at the same location, pursuant to a contract effective for the life of the
individual or for a period in excess of one year.
This means that CCRCs have to offer more than one type of care, but they don't have to offer the full continuum:
independent units, assisted living units and SNF units. For example, some CCRCs may not have SNF units on
campus but provide both independent and assisted units. Providers on the Commission also noted that their
residents have a strong desire to stay in independent living as long as possible and there are new programs that
allow residents to receive assisted living and skilled nursing care in their units.
38

Charge V - Findings
M.G.L. 93 § 76 defines "marketing" as including but not limited to the establishment of a waiting list,
acceptance of money, property or other consideration or distribution of marketing brochures by the provider.
CCRCs are required to provide the following information to AGE:
1. the disclosure statement required under subsection (b) to be delivered to the persons with whom the
contract for continuing care is to be entered;
2. the contracts for continuing care to be entered into by the provider under subsection (c) with a person
who will occupy a living unit in a continuing care facility; and
3. any available advertising or promotional material to be used in conjunction with such marketing
effort.
AGE is required make such information available to the public in a manner which shall allow residents and
prospective residents to make informed choices regarding the selection of a provider, packages of services
and coverage and care alternatives.
39

Charge V - Findings
Some communities that feature independent living may advertise themselves as a
CCRC, which can be confusing for consumers.
The Executive Office of Aging and Independence maintains a CCRC Consumer Guide,
which has guiding questions for residents and their families to ask to fully understand
what the facility offers and what contract they are entering.
Industry representatives have asserted that CCRCs with high occupancy and long
waitlists generally do not need to advertise themselves.
40

Charge VI: The commission shall study and report
on regulatory procedures for the closure or change of
ownership of CCRCs.
41

Charge VI - Findings
Since CCRCs lack a uniform regulatory body, there is no uniform procedure for
the closure of or change of ownership of a CCRC.
42

Charge VI - Findings
If there is a closure or change of ownership for a SNF unit within a CCRC, the CCRC will
follow the procedure for a closure or change of ownership of a SNF regulated by DPH.
Closure procedure: Change of ownership procedure:
• The facility must notify DPH and those • The prospective owner must submit a

• DPH will review and approve the closure plan.
• The facility will work with residents to find

alternative placements.
43

Charge VI - Findings
If there is a change of ownership for an ALR unit within a CCRC, the CCRC will follow the
procedure for a change of ownership of an ALR regulated by AGE.
Change of ownership procedure:
• Any person or entity who intends to acquire a 25% or greater interest in an ALR must apply for
certification to AGE at least 30 days prior to the transfer of ownership.
• If AGE receives the correct documents at least 30 days in advance, the applicant will be
deemed temporarily certified, until AGE approves or denies their application.
• When a transfer of ownership happens, it is within the Secretary's discretion to conduct a full
or partial compliance review.

44

Charge VI - Findings
The below includes changes made to closures or changes in ownership for ALRs in Chapter
197 of the Acts of 2024. The regulations are currently in development by AGE.
ALRs:
• Lowers the ownership disclosure during the certification process from 25% to 5%

45

Charge VI - Findings
The below includes changes made to closures or changes in ownership for SNFs in Chapter 197 of the
Acts of 2024. The regulations are currently in development by DPH.
Chapter 197 of the Acts of 2024
SNFs:
During the suitability review for a new facility or a new owner, DPH will now consider:
• the criminal or civil litigation history of the applicant, potential transferee, or management company
• the financial capacity of the applicant, potential transferee, or management company
• the history of applicant, potential transferee, or management company in providing quality long-term care
in the Commonwealth
• the history of applicant, potential transferee, or management company in providing quality long-term care
outside the Commonwealth
Additionally, the law updates the definition of “owner” and expands the scope of oversight into management
functions by including management companies. It also requires DPH to notify the Legislature within 3
business days of being notified of a long-term care facility’s decision to close.
46

Recommendations
47

Consensus
The CCRC Commission defines consensus as no stated opposition to
any of the recommendations discussed.
48

Recommendations
The CCRC Commission came to a consensus on the following
recommendations:
I. Pass S.478, the disclosure bill, to increase transparency for
consumers around the entrance fee refund
II. Update AGE's consumer guide
49

Recommendation I
The CCRC Commission endorses and recommends passage of S478 to
increase transparency for consumers around the entrance fee refund.
S478, An Act relative to disclosing continuing care retirement community
entrance fees, would require CCRCs to give prospective residents a separate
document that clearly states:
• The amount of the entrance fee to be refunded to the resident under the
provider's contract
• The terms, conditions and explanation of the process by which the
provider will make such refund to the resident after the resident leaves
the facility or passes away
50

Recommendation II
The CCRC Commission recommends that AGE's consumer guide be
updated.
• Recommend for AGE to collaborate with LeadingAge MA, MLCRA,
Massachusetts Senior Care Association, Massachusetts Assisted Living
Association, and AARP on updating the consumer guide.
• Require AGE to update the consumer guide annually.
• Require that the consumer guide include a list of known CCRCs in the
Commonwealth.
• Require that CCRCs give prospective residents access to the consumer
guide.
51

Other Recommendations Considered
The CCRC Commission recommends further discussion on
other recommendations considered, such as:
• A mandate that each CCRC board include not less than one resident member
with voting rights.
• The resident board member would be chosen by the residents of each
CCRC.
52

Other Recommendations Considered
The CCRC Commission recommends further discussion on
other recommendations considered, such as:
• Recommending that CCRC boards hold an open meeting each year.
• The open meeting will be an opportunity for residents and family
members to have their opinions and concerns heard by their respective
CCRC's board.

Other Recommendations Considered
The CCRC Commission recommends further discussion on other
recommendations considered, such as:
• Recommending changes to how CCRCs refund their entrance fees,
including:
• A sequential model, meaning that residents/families would receive their refund
in the order of when they left the unit.
• An interest model, meaning that the CCRC would pay interest to the resident or
their family each month until the unit is re-occupied.
• A blanket 1-year deadline, meaning that the CCRC would be required to issue
the refund within 1 year of the resident leaving the unit.

Other Recommendations Considered
The CCRC Commission recommends further discussion on
other recommendations considered, such as:
• Recommending changes to how CCRCs are defined in the statute,
including:
• Recommending that AGE certify or register CCRCs, so consumers have a clear
picture of which facility is a CCRC, and which facility is not a CCRC.
• Requiring that all CCRCs offer the entire continuum of care. Currently, CCRCs
are required to offer more than one type of care.
