DEPARTMENT OF TRANSITIONAL ASSISTANCE
REPORT ON ECONOMIC INDEPENDENCE ACCOUNTS
DECEMBER 2024
OVERVIEW
The Department of Transitional Assistance (DTA) is required to report to the Legislature
annually on the development of Economic Independence Accounts. This savings program is
intended to allow families receiving Transitional Aid to Families with Dependent Children
(TAFDC) to accumulate assets without risking the loss of eligibility for assistance. G.L. c. 18, §
2(B)(q) and c. 118, §16.
DEPARTMENT OF TRANSITIONAL ASSISTANCE MISSION
DTA’s mission is to assist and empower low-income individuals and families to meet their basic
needs, improve their quality of life, and achieve long-term economic self-sufficiency. DTA offers
a comprehensive system of programs and supports to help individuals and families achieve
greater economic self-sufficiency, including food and nutritional assistance, economic
assistance, and employment supports.
LEGISLATION
In 2014, An Act to Foster Economic Independence was signed into law, Chapter 158 of the Acts
of 2014, incorporating significant reforms to the state’s TAFDC program. These reforms
bolstered DTA’s efforts to support the economic mobility of families while also strengthening
agency program integrity capabilities.
The law required DTA to develop a savings program (i.e., Economic Independence Accounts
(EIAs)) for TAFDC clients so that eligible families could accumulate assets outside of the asset
limit applied to savings accounts. The accounts were to be modeled after similar asset-building
accounts such as Individual Development Accounts (IDAs) and Individual Asset Accounts (IAAs).
The EIAs allowed TAFDC recipients to accumulate assets beyond the program’s asset limit of
$5,000.
In September 2021, the Legislature enacted An Act Relative to Eligibility for Transitional Aid to
Families with Dependent Children, Chapter 72 of the Acts of 2021, which eliminated the asset
limits for the TAFDC program.
As a result of the elimination of the asset limit for the program, families may be eligible for
TAFDC benefits with existing assets and accumulate assets while receiving TAFDC. As such,
specific asset-building accounts, which could be deemed non-countable for the purposes of
determining TAFDC eligibility, are no longer necessary.

SUPPORTING ECONOMIC MOBILITY FOR DTA FAMILIES
DTA supports the economic mobility of families by providing educational and training
opportunities that lead to meaningful career pathways and longer-term economic security.
These opportunities are provided through Pathways to Work, DTA’s strategy in connecting
individuals and families to education, employment, employment and training programs, and
support services that promote career pathways, economic mobility and well-being. DTA
engagement staff connect clients to the appropriate program based on assessments, skill level
and personal choice.
Pathways to Work employment services include:
• Competitive Integrated Employment Services (CIES)
• Employment Supports Services Program, via the Office for Refugees and Immigrants
(ORI)
• DTA Works Program
• Young Parents Program (YPP), and
• Empowering to Employ (ETE).
Additional TAFDC Pathways to Work employment programs in this report include the:
• Secure Jobs Program (line item 4400-1020), and
• The Work Participant Program (line item 4400-1979).
More information regarding DTA’s Pathways to Work can be found here: DTA Pathways to Work
| Mass.gov.
In addition to Pathways to Work programs, DTA offers financial education and coaching services
as a core component of the DTA Works program. DTA Works is a TAFDC Pathways to Work
program offered statewide for eligible TAFDC recipients seeking to acquire and develop skills
necessary to re-enter the workforce, through direct internship experience and sector-based,
regional training tracks focused on high demand career pathways. Participants in DTA Works
receive group and individualized financial coaching and education services from Women’s
Money Matters that supports financial wellness for the whole family. Since the addition of this
curriculum in 2023, DTA Works participants have made progress in their transition to economic
mobility through improved credit scores, increased savings, and reduced debt.
DTA is supporting cliff effects work by using ARPA funding for the Bridge to Prosperity Program
through Springfield Works. The program will provide cash assistance, individualized coaching,
and employer partnerships that will ease the transition off of safety net benefits. The program
seeks to enroll participants beginning in 2025 from Springfield, Worcester and Boston, with an
emphasis on Black and Latino residents.
DTA also has been collaborating with the Office of the Treasurer to leverage the
Commonwealth’s infant savings program, the BabySteps savings program, as a mechanism to
interrupt multigenerational poverty. Every child who is a Massachusetts resident is eligible for a
3

$50 BabySteps deposit within one year of his or her birth or adoption, and through partnership,
every child enrolled in both the BabySteps Savings Plan and SNAP within one year of their birth
or adoption is eligible to receive an additional monthly deposit of $10 to their MEFA U.Fund
529 account for one year.
DTA also remains a key partner in the state’s implementation of the federal Workforce
Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) focused on addressing “cliff effects” for families
receiving public assistance. Through these partnerships with other state agencies and
community-based organizations, DTA remains committed to exploring new strategies to
incorporate financial coaching and education services in workforce programming to better
prepare families for mitigating the financial cliff effects that are associated with finding
employment and supporting the transition to economic mobility.
