Dear Mr. Clerk,
the week of August 4, 2025. This report outlines the risk levels for municipalities based on both
historical prevalence and recent activity of Eastern Equine Encephalitis (EEE) and West Nile
Virus (WNV), including information on the most recent WNV human cases.
Sincerely,
Robert Goldstein, MD, PhD

Arbovirus Weekly Report
Week of August 4, 2025
For additional information regarding this report,
Please contact Ryan McGeown-Conron, DPH Director of Legislative Affairs
Ryan.c.mcgeown-conron@mass.gov
Background information on West Nile virus (WNV) and eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) virus and the
Department of Public Health’s current surveillance and response activities is available through
www.mass.gov/dph/mosquito.
Additionally, please find videos regarding mosquitoes and ticks and how best to protect yourself.
Please feel free to share these resources with your constituents: www.mass.gov/MosquitoesAndTicks.
Season Total Total Positive
Number of Mosquito Samples 5085 WNV – 61
Tested EEE – 2
Number of Animals Tested 4 WNV – 1
EEE – 0
Number of People Tested 70 WNV – 0
EEE – 0
Key Talking Points for the public for the week of August 4, 2025:
• MDPH identified EEE positive mosquitoes in Bridgewater and Belchertown. Risk levels have been
elevated to moderate in these areas.
• MDPH identified one WNV positive Goat from Worcester County on 7/15, and increased risk levels
to moderate in the area.
• In 2025, MDPH identified 61 WNV positive mosquito samples in Barnstable, Berkshire, Bristol,
Hampden, Middlesex, Norfolk, Suffolk, and Worcester Counties
• In 2024, DPH identified four EEE human cases, four EEE animal cases, and 97 EEE mosquito
samples. Due to intensive EEE activity, aerial spraying occurred in Plymouth County, and ground
spraying was performed in Worcester County
• Historical aerial and ground spray maps are available here: https://massnrc.org/spray-
map/Region/List
• 2024 was the first EEE outbreak year since the 2019 – 2020 EEE cycle. 2019 was the most active
EEE year in Massachusetts since the 1950s. There were 12 human cases with 6 deaths and nine
animal cases. Six aerial sprays were conducted to reduce the risk from EEE.
• In 2024, DPH identified 18 WNV human cases and 333 positive WNV mosquito samples
• DPH began early season EEE surveillance in mid-May and continues surveillance activities this
week to monitor arboviral activity. Results from trapping and testing mosquitoes are critical to
understanding how rapidly the viruses might emerge this year and how widespread it might
become.
• DPH has been working since the end of the last season with partners and stakeholders, including
the Massachusetts Department of Agricultural Resources, to prepare for this season.
• Recommended public health measures include raising awareness among residents and reminding
them that it is important to use mosquito repellents with an EPA-registered active ingredient, use
long sleeves and pants to reduce exposed skin, and be aware of mosquito activity around you.
• Regional precipitation events coupled with warm weather are expected to increase the abundance
of mosquito vectors for both EEE and WNV.
• Most human cases of WNV and EEE occur in August and September.
• Arbovirus prevention resources and risk levels are available here: www.mass.gov/dph/mosquito.
• Remember that several 30 second PSA videos are available for download to promote prevention
activities to our residents. These can be found at www.mass.gov/mosquitoesandticks.
• Pick a repellent with an EPA-registered active ingredient;
• Use long sleeves to cover up when possible;
• Repair screens;
• Remove standing water to help reduce mosquito populations; and
• Teach children to be aware of mosquito activity around them and avoid it.

Below are important steps families and individuals can take in protecting themselves
and their loved ones from illnesses caused by mosquitoes:
Avoid Mosquito Bites
• Apply Insect Repellent when Outdoors. Use a repellent with DEET (N, N-diethyl-m-
toluamide), permethrin, picaridin (KBR 3023), oil of lemon eucalyptus [p-methane 3, 8-
diol (PMD)] or IR3535 according to the instructions on the product label. DEET products
should not be used on infants under 2 months of age and should be used in
concentrations of 30% or less on older children. Oil of lemon eucalyptus should not be
used on children under 3 years of age.
• Be Aware of Peak Mosquito Hours. The hours from dusk to dawn are peak biting times
for many mosquitoes. Consider rescheduling outdoor activities that occur during
evening or early morning.
• Clothing Can Help Reduce Mosquito Bites. Wearing long-sleeves, long pants and socks
when outdoors will help keep mosquitoes away from your skin.
Mosquito-Proof Your Home
• Drain Standing Water. Mosquitoes lay their eggs in standing water. Limit the number of
places around your home for mosquitoes to breed by either draining or discarding items
that hold water. Check rain gutters and drains. Empty any unused flowerpots and
wading pools, and change water in birdbaths frequently.
• Install or Repair Screens. Keep mosquitoes outside by having tightly-fitting screens on
all of your windows and doors.
More information is available on the DPH website:
www.mass.gov/dph/mosquito. Information about WNV and Eastern Equine Encephalitis (EEE)
is also available by calling the Epidemiology Program at 617-983-6800.
