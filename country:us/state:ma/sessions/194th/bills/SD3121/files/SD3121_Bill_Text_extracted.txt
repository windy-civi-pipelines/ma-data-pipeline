RE: Fiscal Year 2025 Excess Capital Gains Tax Revenue Transfers to the Stabilization
Fund, the State Retiree Benefits Trust Fund, and the Pension Liability Fund
Dear Secretary Gorzkowicz, Chair Michlewitz, and Chair Rodrigues:

Section 2:
Section 5G of Chapter 29 of the Massachusetts General Laws, as amended, requires that capital
gains tax revenue in excess of the fiscal year capital gains tax threshold be transferred as follows:
(i) 90% to the Commonwealth Stabilization Fund; (ii) 5% to the State Retiree Benefits Trust Fund
(SRBTF) and (iii) 5% to the Commonwealth’s Pension Liability Fund (PRIT). The Fiscal Year
2025 capital gains tax threshold is $1,563,655,002. On June 17, 2025, the Commissioner of
Revenue certified the Fiscal Year 2025 estimated revenue collected from capital gains income
through Period 3. The amount certified was $2,154,695,534.73. On June 23, 2025, I processed
transfers to the three funds totaling $591,040,532.73. The amounts transferred to each fund were as
follows:
Commonwealth Stabilization Fund $531,936,479.45 90%
State Retiree Benefits Trust Fund (SRBTF) $29,552,026.64 5%
Commonwealth’s Pension Liability Fund (PRIT) $29,552,026.64 5%
Total $591,040,532.73 100%

On July 21, 2025, the Commissioner of Revenue certified the Fiscal Year 2025 estimated revenue
collected from capital gains income through Period 4. The amount certified was $2,439,571,818.62.
This represents an increase of $284,876,283.89 over the Period 3 certification.
On July 31, 2025, the Secretary for Administration and Finance notified this office that, pursuant to

Section 3:
Section 224 of Chapter 140 of the Acts of 2024, he is directing the Comptroller to reduce Fiscal
Year 2025 transfers attributable to capital gains income by $375,000,000. To implement this
directive, we made a partial reversal of the Period 3 transfer in the amount of $90,123,716.11 on
August 5, 2025. When combined with the Period 4 revenue of $284,876,283.89, the total is
$375,000,000 as required under Section 224.
Fiscal Year 2025 capital gains income exceeding the threshold is $875,916,816.62. After the

Section 4:
Section 224 reduction of $375,000,000 the net amount for transfer is $500,916,816.62. As a result
of the transactions described above, the net transfers for Fiscal Year 2025 are as follows:
From the General Fund to: Amount % of total
Commonwealth Stabilization Fund $450,825,134.96 90%
State Retiree Benefits Trust Fund (SRBTF) $25,045,840.83 5%
Commonwealth’s Pension Liability Fund (PRIT) $25,045,840.83 5%
Total $500,916,816.62 100%

Attachment # 1: MGL Chapter 29, Section 5G
After each quarter, the department of revenue shall certify to the state comptroller the amount of tax
revenues estimated to have been collected during the preceding quarter from capital gains income.
If the department of revenue certifies that the amount of tax revenues estimated to have been
collected from capital gains income exceeds $1,000,000,000 in a fiscal year, the comptroller shall
transfer quarterly any such amount that exceeds $1,000,000,000 collected during that fiscal year as
follows: (i) 90 per cent shall be transferred to the Commonwealth Stabilization Fund established in

Section 5:
section 2H; (ii) 5 per cent shall be transferred to the State Retiree Benefits Trust Fund established in

Section 6:
section 24 of chapter 32A; and (iii) 5 per cent shall be transferred to the Commonwealth's Pension
Liability Fund established in subsection (e) of subdivision 8 of section 22 of chapter 32. The
$1,000,000,000 threshold established in the preceding sentence shall be adjusted annually to reflect
the average annual rate of growth in United States gross domestic product over the preceding 5
years based on the most recently available data published by the Bureau of Economic Analysis in
the United States Department of Commerce.
The transfers shall be made before the certification of the consolidated net surplus for the previous
fiscal year under section 5C. The department of revenue shall report by November 30 to the state
comptroller, the executive office for administration and finance and the house and senate
committees on ways and means tax revenues estimated to have been collected during the preceding
fiscal year from capital gains income. The comptroller shall not make adjustment to amounts
previously transferred if the capital gains revenue reported on November 30 differs from the
amounts estimated during the preceding fiscal year.
For the purposes of this section, income tax revenue collected from the additional 4 per cent income
tax levied pursuant to Article XLIV of the Amendments to the Constitution of the Commonwealth
shall not be considered to be tax revenue collected from capital gains income.

Dear Comptroller McNamara:
Pursuant to Section 5G of Chapter 29 of the General Laws, the Department of Revenue (DOR) is required to
certify to the State Comptroller, after each quarter during the fiscal year, the amount of tax revenue estimated to
have been collected during the quarter from capital gain income.
Because capital gains tax payments are remitted unevenly throughout the fiscal year according to tax filing
deadlines, to ensure accurate reporting DOR certifies capital gains tax collections on the following schedule:
Period 1 (July 1 through September 30)
Period 2 (October 1 through January 31)
Period 3 (February 1 through May 31)
Period 4 (June 1 through June 30)
The table below shows capital gains tax revenue estimates for each of the certification periods, and for the full
fiscal year 2025.
Capital Gains Tax Collections ($)
Period Period total Fiscal year-to-date total
Period 1 (July 1, 2024 through September 30, 2024) $311,917,746.43 $311,917,746.43
Period 2 (October 1, 2024 through January 31, 2025) $553,432,498.52 $865,350,244.95
Period 3 (February 1, 2025 through May 31, 2025) $1,308,795,977.03 $2,174,146,221.98
Period 4 (June 1, 2025 through June 30, 2025) $265,425,596.64 $2,439,571,818.62
Docusign Envelope ID: 2FE4449B-331B-4FDC-8C9B-C4A056B896BC
Based on currently available data, DOR hereby certifies that tax revenue estimated to have been collected from
capital gains income was $265,425,596.64 during Period 4 of fiscal year 2025 (June 1, 2025 through June 30,
2025). The fiscal year 2025 full year tax revenue estimated to have been collected from capital gains income was
$2,439,571,818.62. The fiscal year 2025 full year tax revenue estimate of $2,439,571,818.62 does not include an
estimated $1,254,548,524.48 in capital gains tax revenue collected from the 4% income surtax.1 These figures are
subject to revision as DOR receives and analyzes more tax data. Those changes will be reflected in the November
2025 final report of fiscal year 2025 tax revenue from capital gains income.

RE: Fiscal Year 2025 Excess Capital Gains Tax Revenue Transfers to the Stabilization
Fund, the State Retiree Benefits Trust Fund, and the Pension Liability Fund
Dear Secretary Gorzkowicz, Chair Michlewitz, and Chair Rodrigues:
Section 5G of Chapter 29 of the Massachusetts General Laws, as amended, requires that capital
gains tax revenue in excess of the fiscal year capital gains tax threshold be transferred as follows:
(i) 90% to the Commonwealth Stabilization Fund; (ii) 5% to the State Retiree Benefits Trust Fund
(SRBTF) and (iii) 5% to the Commonwealth’s Pension Liability Fund (PRIT). The Fiscal Year
2025 capital gains tax threshold is $1,563,655,002. On June 17, 2025, the Commissioner of
Revenue certified the Fiscal Year 2025 estimated revenue collected from capital gains income
through Period 3. The amount certified was $2,154,695,534.73. On June 23, 2025, I processed
transfers to the three funds totaling $591,040,532.73. The amounts transferred to each fund were as
follows:
Commonwealth Stabilization Fund $531,936,479.45 90%
State Retiree Benefits Trust Fund (SRBTF) $29,552,026.64 5%

After each quarter, the department of revenue shall certify to the state comptroller the amount of tax
revenues estimated to have been collected during the preceding quarter from capital gains income.
If the department of revenue certifies that the amount of tax revenues estimated to have been
collected from capital gains income exceeds $1,000,000,000 in a fiscal year, the comptroller shall

the average annual rate of growth in United States gross domestic product over the preceding 5
years based on the most recently available data published by the Bureau of Economic Analysis in
the United States Department of Commerce.
The transfers shall be made before the certification of the consolidated net surplus for the previous

For the purposes of this section, income tax revenue collected from the additional 4 per cent income
tax levied pursuant to Article XLIV of the Amendments to the Constitution of the Commonwealth
shall not be considered to be tax revenue collected from capital gains income.
