Letter from the Co-Chairs
Dear Reader,
Thank you for your interest in this important report on the state of poverty in the Commonwealth of
Massachusetts. In a state that is renowned for its innovation economy in the life sciences and healthcare
sectors, higher education prowess, and progressive values, it is important to both name and quantify the
significant portion of our population that is living in poverty, struggling to make ends meet, and utilizing
government assistance.
We are grateful for the leadership of House Speaker Ron Mariano and Senate President Karen Spilka for
prioritizing this work and for appointing us to Co-Chair this Commission based on our history of
leading anti-poverty work in our respective chambers. Some highlights of previous anti-poverty
achievements include:
Lifting the Child Cap on Temporary Aid for Families with Dependent Children (TAFDC): In 2019,
we ended a harmful policy that capped TAFDC assistance based on initial family size, ensuring that
every child in families facing deep poverty now receives increased support.
Increasing the State Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) Match: Over the past decade, we have
advocated to increase Massachusetts’ EITC from 15% to 40% of the federal amount, secured
groundbreaking separate filing for married survivors of intimate partner violence, and continue
pushing to raise the EITC to 50%.
Establishing a New, Streamlined Child and Family Tax Credit (CFTC): We passed a universal and
immigrant-inclusive child and family tax credit in 2023 that provides increasing benefits per
dependent without income limits or caps, making it one of the most generous in the country.
Increasing Cash Assistance Through the TAFDC and Emergency Assistance for the Elderly,
Disabled, and Children (EAEDC) Programs to Lift Families Out of Deep Poverty: Since 2021,
we’ve increased TAFDC and EAEDC benefits multiple times—raising TAFDC grants for a family of
three from $593 to $861 by 2025—while continuing to advocate for higher, inflation-indexed benefits
to better support families in deep poverty.
Creating a Common Application: In 2022, we passed legislation that created a Common
Application to streamline access to core safety net programs, such as SNAP, MassHealth, cash
assistance, child care, housing subsidies, fuel assistance, and other critical benefits.
Codifying Universal School Meals: In 2023, Massachusetts became the eighth state in the nation
to make universal school breakfast and lunch permanent for all students. This has led to 12.2 million
lunches and 9 million more breakfasts served in the ‘22-’23 school year compared to ‘18-‘19.
These accomplishments would not be possible without the leadership of Ways & Means Chairs
Representative Aaron Michlewitz and Senator Michael Rodrigues, the Speaker of the House and Senate
President, and the support of our colleagues. We are also incredibly grateful for the tireless work of
advocates and coalitions who help drive the conversations, organize external actions, and meet with
legislators to garner support.

It is imperative that we continue to center the needs and experiences of people living in poverty to create a
Commonwealth where everyone can thrive. We believe that the work of this Commission will enable us to
strive toward that goal each day through intentional policy choices.
It is important for us to note that the 2024 presidential election and the new federal administration has
significantly shifted the context for these recommendations. Many were developed prior to the election and
have been updated to reflect the new political landscape. The impacts of the federal context are still being
understood. However, we have already seen the loss of federal funds and grants that have significantly
upended state and municipal budget projections. While the Legislature continues to work to address funding
deficits and federal policy in contradiction with our Commonwealth’s values, it is important to note that the
state will not be able to replace the losses, dollar for dollar.
This context is reflected throughout the report, and it is critical that the recommendations be bold, far-
reaching, and designed to benefit as many residents of the Commonwealth as possible. We believe the
proposals outlined in this roadmap accomplish this goal, and we urge that these policies and regulatory
changes be implemented to significantly reduce poverty in the Commonwealth by 2035.
This report serves as a forward-thinking, ambitious, and comprehensive roadmap to significantly reduce
poverty in the Commonwealth within ten years. We believe that the recommendations in this report also
provide important safeguards against the harmful policies advanced by the current federal administration. It
is crucial that we work collectively to push the boundaries of what is possible and necessary to tackle the root
causes of poverty.
Sincerely,
Representative Marjorie C. Decker Senator Sal N. DiDomenico

Executive Summary
The report presents a comprehensive roadmap to reduce poverty and expand opportunity in the
Commonwealth. It is organized into four core action areas, each with vision statements, domain definitions,
and detailed recommendations.
The recommendations were shaped by a diverse group of 34 Commissioners from non-profit organizations
and state agencies. The Commissioners developed recommendations based on professional experience,
public and written testimony, and input from advisory groups consisting of individuals with lived experience
of poverty. While Commissioners endorsed the high-level recommendations, specific policy actions were
not individually endorsed by every member. This report was also informed by subject matter experts and
the policy expertise of the two Co-Chairs of the Commission.
The Commission designed this roadmap to serve multiple stakeholders across the Commonwealth:
State agencies can implement recommendations within their regulatory authority to inform planning
and priorities,
State legislators can develop legislative agendas based on these findings and,
Service providers can use this framework to better understand systemic poverty and enhance their
advocacy efforts.
In the State of Poverty section, we use qualitative and quantitative data to provide a window into
populations and geographic areas in Massachusetts that are disproportionately affected by poverty. In the
Root Causes of Poverty section, we describe the factors and conditions that cause or perpetuate cycles
of poverty. Throughout the report, we include Spotlights that highlight legislative investments, programs,
and policy changes that are innovative, promising, and effective in addressing the root causes of poverty —
and on which the full slate of recommendations can build.

The four core action areas of recommendations are organized to demonstrate the complexity and
interconnectedness of the factors that make it difficult to navigate through and out of poverty.
Through this organization of recommendations, stakeholders can determine where to concentrate
resources and efforts.
The action areas are:
Access to Essential Support: The recommendations in this section focus on opportunities to remove
barriers to accessing immediate, critical resources such as food, child care, health care, and
transportation. This section further focuses on ways to ensure residents can meet basic needs, avoid
crisis, and begin a path out of poverty.
Stability for Individuals and Families: The recommendations in this section focus on opportunities to
strengthen the conditions that prevent people from falling deeper into poverty by ensuring consistent
income, secure housing, and caregiving support.
Opportunity for Economic Mobility: The recommendations in this section focus on opportunities to
create long-term pathways out of poverty by expanding access to education, quality jobs, and wealth-
building tools.
Systems Coordination and Implementation: The recommendations in this section focus on
opportunities to align governance, funding, and service delivery to build a robust infrastructure to
support the entities that serve people living in poverty, strengthen data and systems, and improve
accountability.
While comprehensive in scope, the Commission recognizes that poverty reduction requires a multifaceted
approach and that no single recommendation or policy action alone will eliminate poverty. However, if
enacted, the recommendations within this report offer a roadmap that would substantially reduce poverty
rates throughout Massachusetts by 2035.

Introduction
Massachusetts consistently ranks among the highest of all states in health care access and health
outcomes, educational attainment, investment in life sciences, technology and innovation, and
overall quality of life.1 In the past few years alone, the Commonwealth has adopted public policies
that expand health coverage, make community college virtually free for all residents, extend
access to early care and education support for lower income families, provide universal free
school meals, increase the child tax credit, and more.2–5 These efforts have made, and will
continue to make, our residents and our state overall healthier and more equitable.

Commission Purpose
The Massachusetts Poverty Commission, established by statute in the Fiscal Year 2022 budget, enacted on
September 30, 2021, completed its comprehensive study between April 2024 and June 2025. The
Commission was tasked with studying poverty in the Commonwealth and developing recommendations to
significantly reduce poverty over the next 10 years (see Commission Charge from Chapter 74 of the Acts
2021 in Appendix 1).

Historical trends in poverty
Root causes of poverty

Demographic and regional Effective anti-poverty programs in
disparities in poverty rates Massachusetts and other states
Despite Massachusetts’ reputation for excellence in sectors such as education, healthcare, and innovation,
economic prosperity remains out of reach for many residents. Approximately one in ten Massachusetts
residents live below the federal poverty line, with many more experiencing economic insecurities while working,
caregiving, or studying.23
Economic hardship in Massachusetts disproportionally affects populations who have historically been
excluded from opportunity. These include, but are not limited to:
Children and youth in under-resourced neighborhoods,
Older adults on fixed incomes,
Black and Latine families facing persistent racial wealth gaps,
Immigrants encountering systemic barriers,
People with disabilities, and
Rural residents with limited access to essential services.
This section paints a portrait of the state of poverty in Massachusetts, defining poverty and its characteristics
and providing state-specific data to illustrate the impact of poverty in communities across the Commonwealth.
The statistics provided are interwoven with the perspectives of those with lived and living experience of
poverty, shining a light on the real world challenges faced by economically vulnerable residents in the
Commonwealth. In the subsequent sections, we establish the foundation for understanding the systemic, root
causes of poverty and make the case for immediate action.
Poverty extends beyond technical definitions and income thresholds. For those experiencing it, poverty means
daily tradeoffs: choosing between meals and rent, medical care and utility bills, accepting a wage increase and
losing critical benefits, or balancing earnings against the cost of child care.
In Massachusetts, where the cost of living is
among the highest in the nation, many residents
face economic hardship despite not meeting the
definition of poverty. These individuals earn just
above the eligibility limits for public assistance yet
struggle to afford basic necessities like housing,
child care, and transportation. Their experience

limited choices, and an inadequate safety net.
While some experience poverty as a temporary setback due to job loss, illness, or caregiving responsibilities,
others experience poverty across generations. In all cases, poverty restricts opportunities and alters life
trajectories in ways that statistics alone can’t measure. Developing effective solutions requires understanding
poverty in human terms, recognizing it as complex conditions involving unmet needs, limited options, and daily
compromises that undermine long-term stability.

State of Poverty in
Massachusetts
What is Poverty?
“Poverty isn’t just not having money.
It’s being told you’re not worth helping.
It’s being treated like your time, your
energy, your kids don’t matter.”
How we measure poverty fundamentally shapes who receives
support. The most commonly used measurement standard is
the Federal Poverty Level (FPL), which was developed in the
1960s and is annually adjusted for inflation.24 The FPL, issued
by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, defines
the minimum income threshold a household needs to meet
basic living expenses. This standard is generally viewed as
inadequate and outdated because it fails to account for:
Today’s rising costs of housing, health care, and child care.
Geographic variations in cost of living, particularly in high-
cost states like Massachusetts.
Non-cash benefits and tax credits that affect household
resources.25
More comprehensive tools have been developed to address these limitations. The Supplemental Poverty
Measure (SPM) from the U.S. Census Bureau includes a broader range of expenses and resources, adjusts
for regional cost differences, and accounts for non-cash benefits like SNAP, WIC, housing subsidies, and tax
credits like the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC).11,25
The MIT Living Wage Calculator offers localized cost-of-living estimates for every Massachusetts county and
several metro areas. With data available for a wide range of household types, from single adults to two-
parent families, it captures the diversity of working age households and estimates the income needed for
self-sufficiency without public or private assistance. In Massachusetts, for example, a single caregiver with
one child must earn nearly $115,000 a year (about $55 per hour) to cover basic expenses, over five times the
2025 FPL for the same family.25,26
The Elder Economic Security Standard Index
(Elder Index), developed by the Gerontology
Institute at UMass Boston, is a benchmark that
estimates the minimum cost of living for older
adults—based on household type, housing
status, health, and location—to maintain
independence and meet basic needs. This
measure reveals that many older adults lack
sufficient income to escape financial hardship,
even if their income exceeds the FPL.26,27
While each measure provides valuable insights, all share a critical limitation – they capture only what can be
quantified. Missing from these calculations are the daily realities of economic hardship, the daily stress of
juggling bills, the instability of irregular employment, the cost of unpaid caregiving, and the challenges of
navigating complex support systems. These experiences significantly illuminate the reality of poverty, even
when they remain invisible in official statistics.

PREVALENCE AND NEAR-POVERTY
In 2023, over 10% of Massachusetts residents lived below
the Federal Poverty Line (FPL).23 For context, the FPL was
$19,720 for a single adult with one child and $30,000 for a
family of four; these amounts fall far short of covering basic
expenses in Massachusetts.25,28
This official poverty rate offers only a narrow view of
hardship. Nearly one in five residents lived 200% below the
FPL.29 These households are often over the income limits for
public assistance yet still struggle to afford rent, food,
transportation, and child care.
While the statewide poverty rate has declined from over 11% in 2015, progress has been uneven.30 In
Massachusetts, four out of five adults living in poverty are in working households, underscoring a growing
disconnect between employment and economic stability.23 In addition, one in eight children and youth in the
Commonwealth live below the FPL, placing them at heightened risk for long-term economic hardship.23
Research shows that roughly one-third of children who grow up in poverty will also experience poverty as
adults, highlighting the urgency of addressing childhood poverty to disrupt intergenerational disadvantage.31
Poverty in Massachusetts follows distinct patterns linked to structural inequities and data reveal critical
disparities.
Racial and Ethnic Disparities
In 2023, compared to a statewide poverty rate of 7% for non-Hispanic white residents, the poverty rate by
race/ethnicity was:
Among Asian residents, the overall poverty rate was over 11%, but this aggregate figure conceals wide
disparities within subgroups. For example, poverty rates for Chinese and Vietnamese residents were more
than double those for Indian residents.33 These disparities reflect the enduring effects of migration history,
limited language access, unequal educational opportunity, and systemic racism—realities that remain hidden
when data is aggregated and Asian communities are treated as a monolith.34

Immigration Status
Immigrants and refugees, especially recent
arrivals, noncitizens, and those with limited English
proficiency, also experience disproportionally high
rates of poverty in Massachusetts. In 2023, 18% of
noncitizens lived in poverty, compared to 10% of
naturalized citizens and 9% of U.S.-born citizens.35
These disparities reflect compounding barriers to
employment, public benefits, and language-
access services. The burden is particularly acute
for undocumented residents, many of whom
remain excluded from critical supports.36 Amid a
national climate of heightened immigration
enforcement and fear, access to basic resources
becomes even more tenuous, underscoring the
urgent need for inclusive and protective policies.

Gender and Family Structure
Gender and family structure are powerful
determinants of poverty in the Commonwealth.
Nearly one in three female-headed households
with children under 18 live in poverty—more than
eight times the rate for married couples with
children.37 These households face multiple
overlapping challenges, including food insecurity,
unstable housing, and limited access to high-
quality and affordable child care.38–40 The average
annual cost of toddler child care in the state is
nearly $20,000, placing a heavy burden on single
mothers.41 Although many single mothers work—
often in low-wage, part-time, or unstable jobs—
employment alone is rarely enough to ensure
economic stability.
Many women also shoulder unpaid caregiving
responsibilities: three out of five family caregivers
in Massachusetts are employed, and most have

Location significantly influences economic opportunity across Massachusetts. While the statewide poverty
rate is 10.4%, this figure masks substantial regional differences resulting from historical disinvestment and
unequal access to resources (see Figure 1).51 Even within cities and towns, poverty concentrates unevenly.
Understanding these regional dynamics is essential to developing targeted, equitable solutions that

While data can reveal disparities, it often cannot
explain why they persist. Many forms of economic
hardship, and the communities most affected,
remain invisible in our current poverty
measurements. Unpaid caregivers, rural residents,
and older adults, for example, often face significant
structural barriers that official statistics fail to
capture. This section examines the systemic drivers
behind economic insecurity in Massachusetts.
Poverty reflects generations of policy choices and social structures that have systemically limited access to
opportunity, stability, and dignity for certain communities. These inequities are not inevitable; they are the
product of systems designed to benefit some while marginalizing others. Racism, ageism, ableism,
xenophobia, and gender inequity continue to influence legislation, resource distribution, and policy
priorities.
The root causes of poverty are intersecting forces that compound hardship over time.6 Identifying these
systemic factors clearly is essential to build solutions that are not only effective, but transformative.
Passed by voters in 2022, the Fair Share Amendment to the Massachusetts Constitution added an
additional income tax on high earners in order to provide the Commonwealth with more revenue
for public education and transportation. Fair Share funds have enabled Massachusetts to address
some of the root causes of poverty shared in these next sections. Funds have been used for
universal free school meals, tuition-free community college, early education grants, fare-free
regional transit, and improvements to public transportation infrastructure.104

Structural racism continues to shape economic outcomes across Massachusetts. From housing and
education to employment and health care, systems operate in ways that advantage white communities
while creating barriers for communities of color.
These disparities result from specific historic
and current-day policy decisions, including:
Redlining and exclusionary zoning,
Unequal school funding formulas,
Discriminatory lending practices, and
Biased hiring processes.
These policies have systematically denied Black,
Latine, Asian, and Indigenous communities access
to stability and wealth-building opportunities for
generations. Today, these legacies persist in the
form of eviction disparities, segregated schools,
underinvestment in public infrastructure, and
unequal access to health care, high-quality child
care, and transit, resulting in significant racial
disparities in wealth and income.
As of 2022, white households in the U.S. held a
median wealth of $285,000, while Black
households held just $45,000 and Latine
households, $62,000.56 This means that for every
$100 in wealth held by white families, Black
families held only about $16 and Latine families
about $22. In Massachusetts, Asian American and
Pacific Islander (AAPI) households often have
higher median wealth than Black and Latine
households yet still fall short of white household
wealth. Closing the racial wealth gap will require
confronting the enduring effects of structural
racism and making sustained investments in
communities of color to expand and build lasting
economic opportunity.

Economic and Labor Factors
In Massachusetts, employment does not guarantee economic stability. Many workers, particularly those
in sectors like caregiving, food service, and retail, earn wages that do not cover basic living expenses.
While the state’s minimum wage reached $15 per hour in 2023, the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology (MIT) Living Wage Calculator estimates that a single adult with one child would need to
earn $55 per hour to meet basic living expenses.25 This gap between wages and living costs stems from
specific policy decisions and structural shifts that have weakened worker protections, depressed wages
relative to productivity, and increased employment precarity.57–59

Gender Inequity and Unpaid Care Work
Gender-based inequities are deeply embedded in both the labor market and social safety net. Women,
especially women of color, disproportionally occupy low-wage, part-time positions with limited benefits,
job security, or advancement opportunities.41,67,68 Simultaneously, women perform most unpaid
caregiving responsibilities for children, older adults, and family members with disabilities.
This essential but largely invisible care work
significantly constrains women’s economic
potential. In Massachusetts, women make up 85%
of home care and long-term care workers and 92%
of child care workers—roles that are among the
lowest paid in the state.41 Moreover, these critical
care roles often lack basic benefits like employer-

Students in Massachusetts face persistent educational inequities that reinforce cycles of poverty and

Massachusetts ranged from just over $9,000 to more than $51,000, with the highest spending districts
located in wealthier, predominantly white areas.87 Conversely, districts with the lowest spending levels

frequently mirror racial and economic segregation, resulting in significant disadvantages in staffing,

Social Safety Net
Public benefit programs designed to provide basic stability during periods of hardship often fail to meet the

Programs such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), Transitional Aid to Families with
Dependent Children (TAFDC), Emergency Aid to the Elderly, Disabled, and Children (EAEDC), and housing
assistance often fall short of covering essential needs, particularly in high-cost regions. For example, one in
five eligible households are not enrolled in SNAP, despite experiencing food insecurity.48 In addition, 75% of

generous universal child and dependent tax credit in the county.
An Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) that increases credit from 30% to 40% of the federal credit.

Transportation
Reliable, affordable transportation is essential for economic mobility, yet access is limited for many
Massachusetts residents. Limited transit options create daily obstacles to accessing opportunities for
employment, education, health care, social services, and other critical needs.

SPOTLIGHT:
Free and Reduced Transit Fares
Affordable and reliable transportation is critical to accessing employment, education, health care, child care, and
daily necessities. Reduced public transit fares have been linked to low-income riders taking 30% more trips,
including more trips for health care and social services appointments. In light of MBTA riders reporting that reliability,
affordability, and frequency are their top concerns, it is notable that eliminating fare collection has been shown to
improve on-time performance. The Legislature has made significant investments in transportation in recent years to
make it more accessible, including funding for fare-free RTAs and reduced fares for the MBTA.114-117
Several Regional Transit Authorities (RTAs) across the Commonwealth have eliminated fares, including the
following RTAs: Worcester (fare-free since 2020); Merrimack Valley (fare-free since 2022); and
Southeastern (temporarily fare-free in 2020 and 2022, fare-free since 2024). All have experienced large
ridership gains, with Southeastern RTA’s ridership growing 13 to 14 times faster than its two neighboring
transit agencies that charged fares. Eliminating fare collection has also improved on-time performance.
The Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA)’s Income-Eligible Reduced Fares Program was
launched in 2024 with the goal of expanding access to public transit. The program offers approximately 50
percent off fares to riders between the ages of 18 – 64 who are enrolled in an approved state assistance
program. Fares for all MBTA buses, subway, commuter rail, ferries, and paratransit (The RIDE) are included,
31 making this the first reduced fare program to include RIDE trips.
Poverty in Massachusetts stems from
interconnected systems that create advantage for
some while excluding others—not from individual
choices or isolated gaps. These systems can be
reimagined and rebuilt through collective action and
structural solutions.
Through this process, the Poverty Commission
prioritized:
Elevating voices typically excluded from policy
discussions,
Grounding recommendations in lived
experience, and
Applying a structural analysis to identify
root causes.

Inclusion Criteria
To effectively guide and prioritize amongst the broad range of ideas and interventions
that emerged with the Commission, the following criteria was established:
EQUITY:
Examines a recommendation’s potential to reduce disparities across diverse populations,
focusing on systemically marginalized groups such as Black, Indigenous, and People of Color
(BIPOC) communities, people with disabilities, immigrants, single parents, and rural
residents. This approach acknowledges that many individuals face compounded challenges
due to intersecting identities, which amplify economic hardships and deepen systemic
inequities. Priority should be given to recommendations that confront institutional and
structural barriers, build community power, advance fair resource distribution, and promote
pathways for long-term social mobility.
IMPACT:
Assesses a recommendation’s potential to produce measurable, meaningful, and
sustainable short- and long-term outcomes that alleviate poverty. High-impact
recommendations substantially improve the quality of life for low-income individuals
and families, reduce poverty rates, and promote long-term positive changes in social
determinants of health such as housing, education, and employment. Priority should be
given to recommendations with evidence-informed strategies and clear metrics for
success, ensuring lasting benefits to households and communities over time.
COMMUNITY NEEDS:
Reflects how a recommendation aligns with the expressed needs, lived experiences,
and cultural contexts of communities most affected by poverty. Priority should be
given to recommendations that incorporate input from individuals with direct
experience of poverty, reflect a comprehensive understanding of local challenges, and
have strong community support. This approach ensures that solutions are relevant,
responsive, and culturally appropriate, fostering trust and long-term impact within
communities most at risk for poverty.

Recommendations
The following recommendations reflect the collective insights of Commissioners and community members
with lived experience of poverty, including those who participated in subsequent focus groups. Organized
into four core action areas, each includes a vision statement, domain definitions, and detailed
recommendations to guide policy and practice over the next 10 years.
The core action areas include:
Access to Stability for Individuals
Essential Support and Families
Removes barriers to immediate, critical resources Strengthens the conditions that prevent people
such as food, child care, health care, and from falling deeper into poverty by ensuring
transportation to ensure residents can meet basic consistent income, secure housing, and caregiving
needs, avoid crisis, and begin a path out of poverty. support. Promotes resilience, protects against
disruption, and allows families to plan.
Opportunity for Systems Coordination
Economic Mobility and Implementation
Creates long-term pathways out of poverty by Aligns governance, funding, and service delivery to
expanding access to education, quality jobs, and strengthen implementation, improve
wealth-building tools. True mobility requires accountability, and embed community voice in
dismantling systemic barriers and investing in decision-making.
people’s ability to grow income, build assets, and
lead self-directed, economically secure lives.
Rather than representing isolated programs or life stages, these core action areas reflect interconnected
strategies designed to work in concert, creating lasting and positive change. Together, the recommendations
chart a roadmap for a more just and economically secure Massachusetts—one where every resident has the
resources, opportunity, and support necessary to thrive.
OTHER STATE MODELS
In 2017, Governor Jay Inslee of Washington State created the Poverty Reduction
Work Group (PRWG) via directive which, over several years, created a 10-year
roadmap to reduce poverty. In the three years since the plan was finalized, the group
leading the efforts, now named the Washington Economic Justice Alliance has taken
270 actions together to implement the 10-Year Plan.
Vision Statement: All Massachusetts residents can reliably access the essential resources
they need to live with dignity, achieve economic stability, and fully participate in community
life. Support must be trauma-informed, culturally and linguistically responsive, and
delivered without stigma, judgment, or punitive barriers.
Basic Needs
Ensure consistent, dignified access to basic needs by strengthening programs and closing
service gaps.
Expand and coordinate access to essential items including food, diapers, hygiene supplies, clothing, school
supplies, and fuel assistance. Strengthen and invest in programs like TAFDC, EAEDC, SNAP, WIC, HIP, and
school meals, including the staffing and infrastructure that allows the programs to run effectively and
efficiently. Maximize eligibility for immigrant households as permitted by law. Permanently expand eligibility
for basic needs programs for pregnant individuals.
Why This Matters: Meeting basic needs is fundamental to human dignity and creates stability that enables
opportunity. When families have reliable access to essential resources, they can focus on work, caregiving,
and overall well-being rather than day-to-day survival. Improved delivery systems for these necessities
affirm that every Massachusetts resident deserves to live without experiencing shame or hardship when
seeking support.
Expand and improve access to refundable tax credits.
Strengthen state refundable credits like the Earned Income
Tax Credit (EITC) and Child and Family Tax Credit (CFTC).
Expand eligibility to include immigrants (such as ITIN filers),
unpaid caregivers, younger workers, older adults, and
individuals without dependents. Increase investment in
outreach and simplified filing assistance to ensure all eligible
households receive their full entitled benefits.
Why This Matters: Refundable tax credits ensure
households can meet basic needs with dignity by covering
essentials like food, rent, and utilities. For
older adults, especially those with limited or no retirement
savings, expanded eligibility can reduce economic insecurity
later in life. These credits rank among the most effective
tools for immediate poverty reduction. By strengthening
these programs and extending them to historically excluded
populations, Massachusetts can significantly improve
household financial stability for residents across the state.

Establish minimum benefit levels and targeted state supplements for excluded or
underserved households
Develop state-funded minimum benefits and targeted supplements for individuals and families with limited or
no federal assistance, including immigrants, older adults, caregivers, and those just above federal thresholds.
Adjust annually for inflation and cost-of-living.
Why This Matters: Many individuals and families are excluded from federal aid or receive inadequate support
due to outdated eligibility rules. State-funded supplements can effectively bridge these gaps, particularly for
immigrant families and low-income households who face systemic barriers to assistance. These targeted
supports promote long-term stability and ensure that all residents can meet their basic needs regardless of
federal eligibility status.

RECOMMENDATION
Child Care, Education, and Skills
RECOMMENDATION
Expand access to affordable, high-quality early education, and after school and out-of-
school time programs.
Increase availability of culturally responsive, year-round care from infancy through school age, including
school breaks and summer. Ensure programs support learning, safety, and family economic stability.
Why This Matters: Early education and care supports children’s development and school readiness,
while enabling parents, especially women and low-income caregivers, to pursue work and other
opportunities.
RECOMMENDATION
Support early language and literacy development beginning at birth through 3rd grade,
with a focus on under-resourced communities.
Increase investment in literacy programs that promote evidence-based early reading proficiency across early
education and care, school, and community settings. Expand access to high-quality, evidence-based
coaching, culturally-responsive, language-rich materials, and family partnerships in historically underserved
districts. Equip educators, healthcare providers, and other professionals to regularly assess and support
children's language and literacy development starting in early childhood.
Why This Matters: Strong reading skills by third grade are a critical predictor of future academic and
economic achievement. Language development begins at birth through everyday interactions that build the
foundation for reading and learning. By investing early in environments that nurture language and reading
proficiency, we create a foundation for educational success that reduces disparities and benefits students
throughout their academic careers.
RECOMMENDATION
Expand access to affordable post-secondary education and student support services.
Continue to invest in early college pathways, free community college, and campus-based wraparound
services to support first-generation, low-income, and historically excluded students.
Why This Matters: Higher education opens doors to economic stability. Eliminating cost and access
barriers and offering wraparound services helps historically excluded students complete their education
37 and pursue mobility.

Digital Equity and Access
RECOMMENDATION
Close the digital divide through broadband expansion, skills training, and outreach to
underserved populations.
Advance digital equity by increasing investment in programs such as affordable high-speed internet, public
Wi-Fi, and digital literacy training, especially for older adults, rural communities, immigrants, and limited-
English speakers. Expand access to devices and multilingual outreach to ensure all residents can access
services and participate fully in daily life. Build on state initiatives like the Councils on Aging digital literacy
programs to increase impact.
Why This Matters: Digital access is essential for education, work, healthcare, and public services. Digital
exclusion can compound isolation and limit access to telehealth, benefits, and civic participation, especially
for older adults. Barriers like cost, location, or language deepen inequities. Promoting digital equity ensures
everyone can engage in civic and economic life.
Health
RECOMMENDATION
Expand access to comprehensive, community-based care across the lifespan.
Remove eligibility barriers and expand trauma-informed, culturally responsive medical, behavioral, and
preventive care. Ensure services are accessible for children, older adults, immigrants, caregivers, and
underserved communities.
Why This Matters: Health is foundational for full participation in work, school, and caregiving. Equitable,
community-based care improves outcomes and reduces disparities for older adults, caregivers, and
underserved groups.
Transportation
RECOMMENDATION
Expand affordable and accessible transportation that connects individuals and families
to services, opportunity, and community life.
Invest in reliable public transit and flexible local transportation for youth, older adults, caregivers, rural
residents, and people with disabilities. Align transit access with key systems like healthcare, education, and
employment.
Why This Matters: Reliable transportation connects individuals and families to work, care, and community
life. Addressing regional gaps, especially in rural areas such as western Massachusetts, reduces exclusion
and enhances access to services and social connection. Older adults and people with disabilities often face
geographic isolation and mobility limitations that cut them off from essential services.
38
Vision Statement: All Massachusetts residents can rely on strong systems that are well-
funded, staffed, modernized, trauma-informed, and culturally responsive. These systems
promote income stability, prevent displacement, and support long-term well-being,
meeting people where they are without shame, blame, or barriers.
Housing Stability
Expand housing assistance, tenant protections, and the supply of deeply affordable homes.
Increase funding for crucial programs such as Residential Assistance for Families in Transition (RAFT),
Massachusetts Rental Voucher Program (MRVP), and shelter capacity. Advance tenant protections such as
purchase rights and right to counsel. Expand bond-financed housing with long-term affordability protections,
especially for deeply affordable units serving households earning below 30% of the Area Median Income (AMI).
Strategies must center historically excluded renters, especially Black, Latine, and immigrant communities, who
face disproportionate eviction rates. Prioritize support for low-income individuals and families of color, older
adults, caregivers, youth, victims of domestic violence and human trafficking, and people impacted by reentry
or gentrification.
Why This Matters: Affordable, stable housing is essential for individual well-being and economic security.
Public investment and long-term affordability protections are critical to preventing displacement and crisis.
Homelessness creates significant costs and challenges for the Commonwealth and investing in homelessness
prevention resources is essential. When residents lack stable housing, the state faces increased expenses
across multiple systems, including emergency healthcare, shelter services, public safety, and crisis response.
Unhoused individuals experience worse health outcomes, leading to higher utilization of emergency
departments and inpatient care. Children without stable housing show disrupted educational progress,
affecting school performance metrics and future workforce readiness.
By investing in affordable housing solutions, Massachusetts reduces these systemic costs while creating
stronger communities, improving public health outcomes, and supporting economic productivity across the
state.
Increase supportive housing and rental assistance for those with the greatest needs.
Expand rental vouchers and accessible units for older adults, people with disabilities, caregivers, youth, victims
of domestic violence and human trafficking, and multigenerational households. Calculate rent based on net
income and reduce administrative burdens that block access.
Why This Matters: Aligning affordability with real income promotes housing stability and reduces benefit
cliffs. Tailored support helps close racial, age-based, and disability-related disparities, especially for caregiving
and multigenerational households at risk of losing housing.

RECOMMENDATION
Advance structural reforms to increase housing affordability and community control.
Reform zoning laws and codes to allow multifamily housing and adopt tools like estate transfer fees to fund
long-term affordability. Ensure community engagement in planning to prevent displacement and promote
ownership.
Why This Matters: Outdated zoning and financing mechanisms limit supply and reinforce segregation.
Structural reforms that expand community voice and ownership are essential to long-term housing stability.
RECOMMENDATION
Expand inclusive, low-barrier shelter options.
Increase culturally responsive shelter capacity for youth, fathers, older adults, LGBTQ+ individuals,
survivors of violence or trafficking, justice-involved people, and individuals with disabilities or substance use
needs. Design shelters for safety, autonomy, and dignity.
Why This Matters: Low-barrier, identity-affirming shelter options create welcoming environments where
all residents can find stability and safety. These accessible approaches ensure that everyone seeking
shelter—including those with complex needs or from marginalized communities—receives appropriate
support and dignity. By designing shelter systems that respect diverse identities and experiences,
Massachusetts can better promote housing stability and community well-being for all residents, particularly
those facing multiple challenges.
Income Support and Job Quality
RECOMMENDATION
Strengthen and stabilize core cash assistance programs.
Tie Transitional Aid to Families with Dependent Children (TAFDC) and Emergency Aid for Elderly Disabled and
Children (EAEDC) grant levels to the Federal Poverty Level (FPL) and implement automatic annual funding
increases that adjust with FPL changes to maintain consistent support levels.
Why This Matters: Keeping families out of deep poverty is vital to Massachusetts' economic and social well-
being. Cash assistance provides a crucial foundation during crisis, caregiving, or unemployment. Inclusive
eligibility and adequate benefits help prevent deep poverty, ensuring short-term stability while reducing long-
term costs to state systems, improving child outcomes, and maintaining workforce participation when families
can meet basic needs.

RECOMMENDATION
Establish a guaranteed income for residents with low or no income.
Create a guaranteed income program through the tax system that provides a minimum income to residents.
Prioritize groups facing persistent economic hardship, including unpaid caregivers, people with disabilities,
returning citizens, and older adults on fixed incomes. Ensure residents know about the program and that it is
easy to enroll and remain on the program.
Why This Matters: Unrestricted cash in the form of guaranteed or universal basic income (GBI or UBI) puts
money directly into the hands of residents of the Commonwealth, allowing them to spend where it is most
helpful to them. GBI enables people to meet daily needs with dignity and autonomy, reducing short-term
hardship and promoting basic security. A guaranteed income is especially impactful for individuals excluded
from traditional cash assistance and offers a stabilizing foundation that allows households to navigate periods
of economic stress and age with dignity. Multiple studies show a myriad of better outcomes are achieved for
individuals and families. 102–104
SPOTLIGHT:
Rise Up Cambridge
Rise Up Cambridge, a $22 million commitment from the City of Cambridge, provided direct cash
assistance to families with children residing in Cambridge who meet certain eligibility criteria
including income. Under this program, participating households receive $500 per month for 18
months. This program was the first and only city-wide cash assistance program of its kind in the
United States. Research from the program shows that participants have used their funds to meet
basic needs, manage debt, and build savings accounts.101
RECOMMENDATION
Promote living wages and job protection in essential sectors.
Advance wage, benefit, and workplace protections across caregiving, education, food service, reentry,
shelter, and housing sectors. Include paid leave, mental health support, and protections against
harassment.
Why This Matters: Low pay and poor working conditions in caregiving, food service, and shelter sectors
create chronic instability for workers and communities. Raising standards prevents economic insecurity and
reduces turnover in systems critical to public well-being.
41
Reentry Stability
Remove barriers to housing, benefits, and unemployment for people navigating reentry.
Invest in transitional housing with wraparound supports. Ensure timely reinstatement of MassHealth coverage
upon release, with attention to common delays that disrupt access to medications and behavioral health care.
Guarantee access to identification and essential documents before release.
Why This Matters: Addressing structural barriers post-incarceration benefits Massachusetts by reducing
homelessness, poverty, and recidivism rates. When returning residents have immediate access to essentials, the
Commonwealth experiences decreased public safety costs, reduced strain on emergency services, and
increased workforce participation.
These improvements particularly strengthen historically over-policed and under-resourced communities,
creating more equitable outcomes while enhancing public safety and economic stability across the state.

RECOMMENDATION
Reform outdated child support policies to promote family stability.
Implement reforms to child support policies by reducing state recoupment practices and modifying
enforcement approaches. Enhance accessibility to modification processes and legal assistance, while
prioritizing the needs of primary caregivers, with particular consideration for survivors of domestic
violence.
Why This Matters: By reforming child support policies to increase autonomy and dignity for those
engaging in the system and ensuring that families receive their entire payment rather than the state
recouping a portion, the Commonwealth can strengthen family financial stability, improve child well-
being, and create more equitable outcomes for Massachusetts families.
RECOMMENDATION
RECOMMENDATION
Reform the Criminal Offender Record Information (CORI) system by automating record
sealing and providing access to legal assistance.
Support legislation that would reform the CORI system by funding outreach, legal clinics, and education
around record sealing.
Why This Matters: Criminal records can block access to jobs, housing, and education for decades.
Automating the process and supporting legal access helps break cycles of poverty and racial inequity.
RECOMMENDATION
Establish a coordinated, state-funded reentry infrastructure.
Create a statewide network offering reentry navigation, housing assistance, benefits access, and workforce
support. Provide funding for staffing, training, and technical assistance, especially for community-based
providers.
Why This Matters: Successful reentry depends on service coordination, housing access, and employment
support. A permanent infrastructure ensures continuity of care and economic stability, especially for aging or
caregiving populations.
42
Vision Statement: All Massachusetts residents deserve equitable, intergenerational
pathways to build income, access meaningful work, grow wealth, and lead self-directed
lives. Achieving economic mobility requires dismantling structural barriers and rejecting
narratives that blame individuals for systemic poverty.
Job Standards and Worker Rights in Essential Sectors
Raise wages, improve working conditions,
and protect the right to organize for
essential workers across all sectors.
Advance policies that ensure essential workers,
especially women, immigrants, and BIPOC individuals,
have access to fair pay, predictable schedules, safe
conditions protections, paid leave, and job security.
Why This Matters: Many essential jobs across the
economy are undervalued, marked by low wages,
limited benefits, unsafe conditions, and barriers to
organizing. Workers in these roles often face systemic
exploitation, especially in sectors disproportionally
staffed by women, immigrants, and BIPOC individuals.
Raising job standards and protecting organizing rights
are key to ensuring mobility and justice for all, not just
advancement for a few.
Career Pathways and Employer Accountability
Expand equitable career pathways to quality jobs.
Expand registered apprenticeships, vocational programs, and training pathways that lead to stable, well-
compensated jobs with strong labor protections. Ensure programs are certified, aligned with employer
demand, and include guaranteed job placement wherever possible. Define quality jobs as those offering fair
wages, benefits, safety, and worker voice. Support inclusive access and completion for historically excluded
and marginalized communities through outreach, navigation, and wraparound supports.
Why This Matters: Training alone does not reduce poverty unless it leads to quality employment. Many
workers, especially BIPOC individuals, immigrants, women, people with disabilities, and those most impacted
by the criminal legal system, complete programs only to enter low-wage, unstable jobs. Career pathways must
lead to real jobs with livable wages and protections. Clear standards and job guarantees are essential to lasting
opportunity.

Postsecondary and Adult Learning Pathways
Expand access to foundational education and training that connect learners to stable,
well-compensated work.
Invest in affordable, flexible, and community-based education and training, including adult basic education,
English language learning, digital literacy, workforce programs, and college support. Prioritize outreach and
resources for those excluded from traditional systems, such as immigrants, returning citizens, and older adults.
Ensure all programs are linked to stable jobs with fair wages and protections, not just credentials.
Why This Matters: Education can open doors, but it does not guarantee economic stability. For older adults
seeking to retrain or re-enter the workforce, flexible and affordable pathways are frequently out of reach. Too
often, people complete programs only to find low-wage, insecure jobs. All work, not just credentialled careers,
must provide livable wages, protections, and long-term security. Education should be a tool for opportunity,
not a prerequisite for economic survival.
Wealth-Building and Financial Justice
Expand access to wealth-building tools and protect residents from predatory
financial practices.
Increase availability of matched savings accounts, homeownership support, and retirement programs. Pass
legislation to establish baby bonds. Repeal asset limits in benefits programs where the state has authority to do
so. Protect residents from predatory financial products by restricting high-cost lending and simplifying tax
repayment. Expand access to equitable debt relief by reducing interest rates on government and medical
debt, regulating debt collectors, and addressing predatory enforcement practices. Prioritize relief for medical
debt, utility arrears, and unjust fines and fees.
Why This Matters: Building savings and assets are key to closing racial and economic wealth gaps. Predatory
financial practices and exclusionary systems entrench generational poverty. Expanding BabySteps, the Family
Self Sufficiency Program, homeownership support, retirement programs, and consumer protections ensure
more households can build long-term financial security.

Ensure workforce development opportunities are flexible, accessible, and supportive of
both training and employment for workers facing structural barriers.
Expand flexible training options, including evenings, weekends, and online formats. Provide child care,
transportation, and technology supports that extend beyond training into employment, especially for
workers with nontraditional hours. Prioritize access for individuals facing systemic barriers, such as
caregivers, immigrants, older adults, and returning citizens. Offer stipends, navigation, and targeted reentry
supports to increase participation and access.
Why This Matters: Many workers are excluded from workforce opportunities due to rigid schedules,
caregiving responsibilities, or lack of reliable child care, transportation, or internet. Older adults seeking to
reenter the workforce or shift careers often face barriers related to digital literacy, employer bias, and job
structures that lack flexibility in hours, location, or physical demands. These barriers do not end when training
does. Extending support into employment is essential for workers facing structural inequities and systemic
exclusion from economic opportunity.
Advance a cross-cutting caregiver strategy across access, stability, and economic mobility
action areas.
Recognize the economic contributions of unpaid caregivers—primarily women, immigrants, and BIPOC
individuals—and invest across core action areas to support them. Expand paid leave, respite care, and cash
support; improve protections and workplace policies; and create training pathways to paid caregiving
careers.
Why This Matters: Caregivers provide essential support that sustains families and communities across
Massachusetts. Supporting caregivers acknowledges their vital economic and social contributions while
addressing the financial challenges faced. Comprehensive caregiver support promotes equity by addressing
disparities affecting women, people of color, and immigrants who disproportionately provide care. When
caregivers receive adequate resources and recognition, they and those they care for experience improved
well-being, creating stronger, more resilient communities throughout the Commonwealth.

Vision Statement: All Massachusetts residents deserve public systems that are
coordinated, transparent, and equity-driven, guided by lived experience and accountable to
the communities they serve. Effective implementation must eliminate barriers to economic
security, reduce stigma, and center resident voice in shaping policies and programs.
Data and Accountability
Improve data coordination to strengthen anti-poverty policy.
Invest in cross-agency data systems that track benefit interactions and cliff effects, monitor outcomes, and
inform timely decision-making. Ensure data systems are privacy-protected, accessible, informative, and
responsive to community needs.
Why This Matters: Accurate, integrated data is essential for effective policy, transparency, and equity.
Modern data systems should track disparities, support real-time decision-making, and reflect community
priorities using metrics that matter to those most impacted.
Funding Alignment and Delivery Infrastructure
Ensure sufficient state funding for community-based organizations and public agencies
to strengthen service delivery infrastructure.
Increase investment to public agencies, and align public and private funding to support operational capacity,
close service gaps, and improve reimbursement rates to stabilize the capacity of nonprofits and public
agencies delivering essential services. Support shared infrastructure, collaborative planning, and long-term
sustainability through inflation-adjusted funding.
Why This Matters: Community-based organizations and public systems are essential to delivering services
and building trust between residents and the systems that serve them. Long-term, aligned funding for state
agencies, service providers, and grassroots organizations improves stability, equity, and capacity to meet
community needs.

Governance and Cross-Sector Coordination
Establish a permanent, cross-agency body to guide anti-poverty implementation.
Establish a permanent, cross-agency governance body to guide the implementation of this report and
make recommendations as appropriate (i.e. conferred eligibility). Designate a senior-level Coordinator for
Poverty Reduction within the Governor’s Office to oversee implementation, align agency efforts, and
ensure public accountability. Ensure meaningful participation from public agencies, nonprofit organizations,
academic and philanthropic partners, frontline providers, and people with lived experience.
Why This Matters: Bold strategies often stall without coordinated leadership. A resourced governance
structure grounded in community oversight and shared accountability can drive implementation, monitor
progress, and adapt to emerging needs.
Integrated Benefits Access
Modernize and streamline access to benefits through a common application system.
Advance the development of a unified, user-friendly benefits platform that allows streamlined access to a
variety of benefits across state-administered programs. Continue to invest in system integration, staffing,
and digital inclusion to support implementation.
Why This Matters: Streamlining access to benefits allows Massachusetts residents to efficiently connect
with essential supports while saving valuable time and resources. This approach reduces administrative
costs, ensures higher program participation rates, and helps families achieve greater stability. By eliminating
repetitive applications and clarifying eligibility rules, Massachusetts can maximize federal funding
opportunities, improve economic mobility outcomes, and create a more responsive government that better
serves all residents.

Language Access
Invest in and ensure Massachusetts residents receive language access services from
state agencies.
Prioritize funding and development of language access services, including oral interpretation and the
translation of vital documents, within state agencies that are responsive to the language needs of all
Massachusetts residents, including limited-English proficient (LEP) or Deaf and Hard of Hearing persons.
Ensure state agencies establish language access policies, including staff training, so that all Massachusetts
residents can participate in programs and services to which they are eligible and entitled.
Why This Matters: Without the provision of language access services, residents and families who are
limited-English proficient (LEP) or Deaf and Hard of Hearing experience severe challenges when applying
for or utilizing public services or programs due to a lack of access to information in their preferred language.
Even when LEP or Deaf and Hard of Hearing persons can access benefits and programs, in many cases they
improperly receive fewer or no benefits due to application errors and miscommunication, although all
eligibility requirements are met.
With information available in multiple languages and on-demand language access services like
interpretation and translation, all Massachusetts residents will have equal access to services and programs
and equal protections under the law.
Navigation and Service Coordination
Fund culturally and linguistically responsive navigation and case management to close
access gaps.
Embed culturally and linguistically responsive navigators, case managers and qualified interpreters and
translators within public agencies and community-based organizations to help individuals and families
access and coordinate benefits and services. Ensure alignment with state policies and integrate navigation
into broader system infrastructure.
Why This Matters: Service navigation is essential infrastructure, not a temporary solution. By integrating
navigation support within public systems, residents will receive assistance regardless of digital access
challenges and language barriers. Culturally and linguistically responsive coordination builds community
trust while improving efficiency and effectiveness across government services, creating a more accessible
and responsive Commonwealth for all residents.

Service Delivery Workforce
Invest in the workforce and infrastructure that deliver essential services.
Increase funding for salaries, training, and staffing across housing, benefits, reentry, and caregiving systems.
Strengthen organizational capacity and support culturally responsive, trauma-informed service delivery.
Why This Matters: Chronic underinvestment in public and nonprofit systems leads to burnout, high staff
turnover, and access challenges. Investing in salaries, training, and capacity across key roles such as benefits
eligibility, housing coordination, and reentry navigation improves quality, equity, and trust in public delivery
systems.

Conclusion
The recommendations laid out in this report can serve as a roadmap to greatly reduce
poverty in Massachusetts by 2035. These recommendations are grounded in evidence,
shaped by the experience and stories of community members that are most impacted, and
can be collectively owned by leaders, advocates, citizens, and professionals who
understand the urgency and possibility of this work. Additional work will be required to
advance the operationalization of the roadmap. Next steps may include, for example, cost
feasibility studies or sequencing recommendations in the form of an action plan, which
were not part of this phase of work.
While this roadmap comes at a time of deep uncertainty, Massachusetts has a long history
of leading our nation with groundbreaking policy, and with courage, care, and intentionality.
There is no more crucial time than the present to invest in a society where transportation,
housing, and education are truly more affordable, where people have streamlined and
sustained access to basic income, and where there is no stigma or systemic barriers that
prevent people from access and maintaining the support they deserve.
With this roadmap, we urge policymakers, state and local government, advocates,
community-based organizations, and concerned citizens to act boldly. We are committed
to advancing the recommendations outlined here; they are comprehensive, evidence-
based solutions that will work to build a future Massachusetts where all residents are
empowered and supported enough to truly thrive.

Glossary
Area Median Income (AMI) is the midpoint of a region’s income distribution, where half of the households
earn more and half earn less. AMI is frequently used to determine eligibility for income-based housing
assistance programs and is adjusted for household size and geographic area.
BabySteps is a program offered by the State Treasurer’s office that provides $50 to Massachusetts
families to save toward their children’s education.
Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC) is a collective term used to acknowledge the shared and
distinct social, economic, and historical experiences of these communities, particularly in the context of
systemic inequities. The term is often used in policy and research to help guide efforts aimed at addressing
disparities affecting historically marginalized populations.
Child and Family Tax Credit (CFTC) is a state tax credit for Massachusetts residents who support
qualifying dependents, including children under the age of 13, adults aged 65 or older, and those with
disabilities. The CFTC is a refundable tax credit, which means that if the amount of the credit is greater than
the amount of tax owed, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) sends a tax refund for the difference. This credit
is available to single filers, heads of household, and married couples filing jointly. Married individuals filing
separately are not eligible. To claim the credit, taxpayers must file a Massachusetts income tax return, even
if they have no income to report.
Cliff Effect refers to a situation in which a small increase in income gained from a raise or a job promotion
causes a sudden loss of public benefits or aid, resulting in a net decrease in overall resources for a person
or family. This means that despite working or earning more, the individual’s overall financial situation
worsens. The cliff effect can create a disincentive to advance in a career because while earnings may
increase slightly, it is not enough to offset the loss of crucial benefits and support systems.
Criminal Offender Record Information (CORI) is a state-managed criminal background check system
that collects and maintains records documenting an individual’s criminal history including arrests, charges,
convictions, and dispositions. CORI reports are used by authorized employers, licensing boards, and
government agencies to conduct background checks for purposes of employment, housing, and licensing.
Access to CORI is regulated by state law to protect individuals' privacy and limit the dissemination of
information.
Department of Early Education and Care (EEC) is the Massachusetts state agency within EOE
responsible for licensing and overseeing early childhood education and care programs, including
preschools, child care centers, and out-of-school-time programs. EEC also manages subsidies and
initiatives to support early learning and child development.
Department of Elementary and Secondary Education (DESE) is the state agency within EOE responsible
for overseeing public education from pre-kindergarten through grade 12, as well as adult education
programs. The agency administers and enforces education laws, allocates public funds to school districts
and adult education programs, and monitors school performance to ensure compliance with state
education standards.

people intended to offset federal payroll and income taxes. The EITC is a refundable tax credit, which means
that if the amount of the credit is greater than the amount of tax owed, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS)
sends a tax refund for the difference. Massachusetts has established a state-specific EITC to supplement
the federal credit. The Massachusetts credit amount is 40% of the federal EITC that a taxpayer qualifies for.
Emergency Aid to Elders, Disabled and Children (EAEDC) is a state-funded program that provides cash
benefits and MassHealth coverage to eligible individuals who are unable to work due to age, disability, or
caregiving responsibilities. The program helps cover basic living expenses such as food, housing, and
utilities. Benefit amounts are determined based on household composition and living arrangements, with
possible deductions for work-related expenses and dependent care.
English for Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL) refers to educational programs or courses designed to
teach English language skills to individuals whose first language is not English, aiming to improve their
proficiency for communication, education, and employment.

adults and caregivers by overseeing services such as home care, nutrition, housing, protective services, and
programs that promote independence and well-being for adults aged 60 and older.

advancing economic growth, job creation, and business development through policies, programs, and
partnerships that support industries, workforce development, and innovation across the state.

through case management and financial incentives, including escrow savings accounts. Savings are used
for purposes such as homeownership, education or business development.
Federal Poverty Level (FPL) is a measure of income issued annually by the U.S. Department of Health
and Human Services that defines the minimum income threshold a household needs to meet basic living
expenses. It is used to determine eligibility for various federal and state assistance programs, such as
Medicaid, food assistance, and subsidized health insurance. The FPL varies by household size and is
adjusted each year for inflation.
Healthy Incentives Program (HIP) is a Massachusetts state program that aims to increase access to
healthy foods and support local agriculture by providing Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP)
recipients with incentives to purchase local fruits and vegetables at participating vendors, including farmers'
markets, farm stands, mobile markets, and CSA programs. The program offers a dollar-for-dollar match,
meaning that for every dollar spent on eligible produce, an equal amount is credited back to the recipient’s
Electronic Benefit Transfer (EBT) card at the time of purchase, up to a monthly cap based on household size.
Individual Taxpayer Identification Number (ITIN) is a 9-digit tax processing number issued by the
Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to individuals who are required to have a U.S. taxpayer identification number
for federal tax purposes but are not eligible for a Social Security Number (SSN). ITINs are used primarily by
nonresident aliens, their spouses, and dependents to file federal tax returns and comply with U.S. tax laws,
granting these individuals to ability to pay taxes and claim certain tax benefits.
Matched Savings Accounts are savings accounts in which deposits made by an individual are matched by
a designated entity, up to a specified limit, to encourage asset building for purposes such as
homeownership, education, or business development.

Massachusetts Rental Voucher Program (MRVP) is a state-funded program that provides rental
subsidies in the form of vouchers paid directly to landlords for low- and moderate-income households who
meet eligibility criteria based on income and household size.
MassHealth is the Massachusetts Medicaid program that provides health insurance coverage to low- and
moderate-income individuals and families who meet eligibility criteria based on factors such as income,
household size, age, disability status, and citizenship or immigration status. MassHealth covers a broad
range of medical services including doctor visits, hospital care, prescription drugs, and preventive care.
Residential Assistance for Families in Transition (RAFT) is a state-funded program that provides short-
term financial assistance to low-income families and individuals who are at risk of experiencing or currently
experiencing homelessness or housing instability. The program helps cover housing-related costs such as
rent, security deposits, and utility payments, among others, to promote housing stability.
Subsidy refers to direct or indirect financial assistance, often provided by the government, for individuals
or organizations to reduce the cost of goods or services and support activities that serve a public or
economic interest. Subsidies can take various forms, including direct cash payments, tax credits or
exemptions, or interest-free or reduced-interest loans, among others.
Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), formerly known as Food Stamps, is a federal
program administered by the U.S. Department of Agriculture and managed at the state level that provides
low-income individuals and families with monthly benefits to help purchase food. SNAP eligibility is based
on criteria including income and household size, and benefits are issued through an Electronic Benefit
Transfer (EBT) card that can be used at authorized retailers to buy approved food items.
Supplemental Poverty Measure (SPM) is an alternative to the Official Poverty Measure (OPM) used by
the U.S. Census Bureau to provide a more comprehensive assessment of economic need. It incorporates
additional factors beyond a household’s pre-tax cash income, such as tax payments, government
assistance, work-related expenses, medical costs, and geographic cost-of-living differences. While the
OPM is used to determine the Federal Poverty Level (FPL) for program eligibility, the SPM is primarily used
for research and policy analysis to assess the effectiveness of anti-poverty programs.
Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) is a fixed block grant that the federal government provides
to states to design and operate programs aimed toward helping families experiencing low-income achieve and
maintain stability. In Massachusetts, the TANF program is administered by the Department of Transitional
Assistance (DTA) under the name Transitional Aid to Families with Dependent Children (TAFDC).
Transitional Assistance for Families with Dependent Children (TAFDC) is a state and federally funded
program that provides cash assistance to low-income families with children and pregnant individuals.
Universal School Meals Program (USM) is a Massachusetts state program that provides free breakfast
and lunch to all students in public schools, regardless of family income, aimed at addressing food insecurity.
USM is permanently funded through the state budget and covers one nutritious breakfast and lunch per
student each school day. The program has led to increased student consumption in school meals and is
estimated to save families an average of $1,200 per student annually.
Women, Infants & Children Program (WIC) is a federal program administered by the U.S. Department of
Agriculture and managed at the state level that provides nutritional support, education, and access to
healthy foods for low-income pregnant and postpartum individuals, infants, and children up to age five.
Eligibility is based on income, nutritional risk, and residency, and benefits include food vouchers, nutrition
56 counseling, and breastfeeding support.

Letter from the Co-Chairs
Dear Reader,
Thank you for your interest in this important report on the state of poverty in the Commonwealth of
Massachusetts. In a state that is renowned for its innovation economy in the life sciences and healthcare
sectors, higher education prowess, and progressive values, it is important to both name and quantify the
significant portion of our population that is living in poverty, struggling to make ends meet, and utilizing
government assistance.
We are grateful for the leadership of House Speaker Ron Mariano and Senate President Karen Spilka for
prioritizing this work and for appointing us to Co-Chair this Commission based on our history of
leading anti-poverty work in our respective chambers. Some highlights of previous anti-poverty
achievements include:
Lifting the Child Cap on Temporary Aid for Families with Dependent Children (TAFDC): In 2019,
we ended a harmful policy that capped TAFDC assistance based on initial family size, ensuring that
every child in families facing deep poverty now receives increased support.
Increasing the State Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) Match: Over the past decade, we have
advocated to increase Massachusetts’ EITC from 15% to 40% of the federal amount, secured
groundbreaking separate filing for married survivors of intimate partner violence, and continue
pushing to raise the EITC to 50%.
Establishing a New, Streamlined Child and Family Tax Credit (CFTC): We passed a universal and
immigrant-inclusive child and family tax credit in 2023 that provides increasing benefits per
dependent without income limits or caps, making it one of the most generous in the country.
Increasing Cash Assistance Through the TAFDC and Emergency Assistance for the Elderly,
Disabled, and Children (EAEDC) Programs to Lift Families Out of Deep Poverty: Since 2021,
we’ve increased TAFDC and EAEDC benefits multiple times—raising TAFDC grants for a family of
three from $593 to $861 by 2025—while continuing to advocate for higher, inflation-indexed benefits
to better support families in deep poverty.
Creating a Common Application: In 2022, we passed legislation that created a Common
Application to streamline access to core safety net programs, such as SNAP, MassHealth, cash
assistance, child care, housing subsidies, fuel assistance, and other critical benefits.
Codifying Universal School Meals: In 2023, Massachusetts became the eighth state in the nation
to make universal school breakfast and lunch permanent for all students. This has led to 12.2 million
lunches and 9 million more breakfasts served in the ‘22-’23 school year compared to ‘18-‘19.
These accomplishments would not be possible without the leadership of Ways & Means Chairs
Representative Aaron Michlewitz and Senator Michael Rodrigues, the Speaker of the House and Senate
President, and the support of our colleagues. We are also incredibly grateful for the tireless work of
advocates and coalitions who help drive the conversations, organize external actions, and meet with
legislators to garner support.

It is imperative that we continue to center the needs and experiences of people living in poverty to create a
Commonwealth where everyone can thrive. We believe that the work of this Commission will enable us to
strive toward that goal each day through intentional policy choices.
It is important for us to note that the 2024 presidential election and the new federal administration has
significantly shifted the context for these recommendations. Many were developed prior to the election and
have been updated to reflect the new political landscape. The impacts of the federal context are still being
understood. However, we have already seen the loss of federal funds and grants that have significantly
upended state and municipal budget projections. While the Legislature continues to work to address funding
deficits and federal policy in contradiction with our Commonwealth’s values, it is important to note that the
state will not be able to replace the losses, dollar for dollar.
This context is reflected throughout the report, and it is critical that the recommendations be bold, far-
reaching, and designed to benefit as many residents of the Commonwealth as possible. We believe the
proposals outlined in this roadmap accomplish this goal, and we urge that these policies and regulatory
changes be implemented to significantly reduce poverty in the Commonwealth by 2035.
This report serves as a forward-thinking, ambitious, and comprehensive roadmap to significantly reduce
poverty in the Commonwealth within ten years. We believe that the recommendations in this report also
provide important safeguards against the harmful policies advanced by the current federal administration. It
is crucial that we work collectively to push the boundaries of what is possible and necessary to tackle the root
causes of poverty.
Sincerely,
Representative Marjorie C. Decker Senator Sal N. DiDomenico

Executive Summary
The report presents a comprehensive roadmap to reduce poverty and expand opportunity in the
Commonwealth. It is organized into four core action areas, each with vision statements, domain definitions,
and detailed recommendations.
The recommendations were shaped by a diverse group of 34 Commissioners from non-profit organizations
and state agencies. The Commissioners developed recommendations based on professional experience,
public and written testimony, and input from advisory groups consisting of individuals with lived experience
of poverty. While Commissioners endorsed the high-level recommendations, specific policy actions were
not individually endorsed by every member. This report was also informed by subject matter experts and
the policy expertise of the two Co-Chairs of the Commission.
The Commission designed this roadmap to serve multiple stakeholders across the Commonwealth:
State agencies can implement recommendations within their regulatory authority to inform planning
and priorities,
State legislators can develop legislative agendas based on these findings and,
Service providers can use this framework to better understand systemic poverty and enhance their
advocacy efforts.
In the State of Poverty section, we use qualitative and quantitative data to provide a window into
populations and geographic areas in Massachusetts that are disproportionately affected by poverty. In the
Root Causes of Poverty section, we describe the factors and conditions that cause or perpetuate cycles
of poverty. Throughout the report, we include Spotlights that highlight legislative investments, programs,
and policy changes that are innovative, promising, and effective in addressing the root causes of poverty —
and on which the full slate of recommendations can build.

The four core action areas of recommendations are organized to demonstrate the complexity and
interconnectedness of the factors that make it difficult to navigate through and out of poverty.
Through this organization of recommendations, stakeholders can determine where to concentrate
resources and efforts.
The action areas are:
Access to Essential Support: The recommendations in this section focus on opportunities to remove
barriers to accessing immediate, critical resources such as food, child care, health care, and
transportation. This section further focuses on ways to ensure residents can meet basic needs, avoid
crisis, and begin a path out of poverty.
Stability for Individuals and Families: The recommendations in this section focus on opportunities to
strengthen the conditions that prevent people from falling deeper into poverty by ensuring consistent
income, secure housing, and caregiving support.
Opportunity for Economic Mobility: The recommendations in this section focus on opportunities to
create long-term pathways out of poverty by expanding access to education, quality jobs, and wealth-
building tools.
Systems Coordination and Implementation: The recommendations in this section focus on
opportunities to align governance, funding, and service delivery to build a robust infrastructure to
support the entities that serve people living in poverty, strengthen data and systems, and improve
accountability.
While comprehensive in scope, the Commission recognizes that poverty reduction requires a multifaceted
approach and that no single recommendation or policy action alone will eliminate poverty. However, if
enacted, the recommendations within this report offer a roadmap that would substantially reduce poverty
rates throughout Massachusetts by 2035.

Introduction
Massachusetts consistently ranks among the highest of all states in health care access and health
outcomes, educational attainment, investment in life sciences, technology and innovation, and
overall quality of life.1 In the past few years alone, the Commonwealth has adopted public policies
that expand health coverage, make community college virtually free for all residents, extend
access to early care and education support for lower income families, provide universal free
school meals, increase the child tax credit, and more.2–5 These efforts have made, and will
continue to make, our residents and our state overall healthier and more equitable.

Historical trends in poverty
Root causes of poverty

Demographic and regional Effective anti-poverty programs in
disparities in poverty rates Massachusetts and other states

Despite Massachusetts’ reputation for excellence in sectors such as education, healthcare, and innovation,
economic prosperity remains out of reach for many residents. Approximately one in ten Massachusetts
residents live below the federal poverty line, with many more experiencing economic insecurities while working,
caregiving, or studying.23
Economic hardship in Massachusetts disproportionally affects populations who have historically been
excluded from opportunity. These include, but are not limited to:
Children and youth in under-resourced neighborhoods,
Older adults on fixed incomes,
Black and Latine families facing persistent racial wealth gaps,
Immigrants encountering systemic barriers,
People with disabilities, and
Rural residents with limited access to essential services.
This section paints a portrait of the state of poverty in Massachusetts, defining poverty and its characteristics
and providing state-specific data to illustrate the impact of poverty in communities across the Commonwealth.
The statistics provided are interwoven with the perspectives of those with lived and living experience of
poverty, shining a light on the real world challenges faced by economically vulnerable residents in the
Commonwealth. In the subsequent sections, we establish the foundation for understanding the systemic, root
causes of poverty and make the case for immediate action.
Poverty extends beyond technical definitions and income thresholds. For those experiencing it, poverty means
daily tradeoffs: choosing between meals and rent, medical care and utility bills, accepting a wage increase and
losing critical benefits, or balancing earnings against the cost of child care.
In Massachusetts, where the cost of living is
among the highest in the nation, many residents
face economic hardship despite not meeting the
definition of poverty. These individuals earn just
above the eligibility limits for public assistance yet
struggle to afford basic necessities like housing,
child care, and transportation. Their experience
can be characterized not only by absolute or

limited choices, and an inadequate safety net.
While some experience poverty as a temporary setback due to job loss, illness, or caregiving responsibilities,
others experience poverty across generations. In all cases, poverty restricts opportunities and alters life
trajectories in ways that statistics alone can’t measure. Developing effective solutions requires understanding
poverty in human terms, recognizing it as complex conditions involving unmet needs, limited options, and daily
compromises that undermine long-term stability.

State of Poverty in
Massachusetts
What is Poverty?
“Poverty isn’t just not having money.
It’s being told you’re not worth helping.
It’s being treated like your time, your
energy, your kids don’t matter.”

How we measure poverty fundamentally shapes who receives
support. The most commonly used measurement standard is
the Federal Poverty Level (FPL), which was developed in the
1960s and is annually adjusted for inflation.24 The FPL, issued
by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, defines
the minimum income threshold a household needs to meet
basic living expenses. This standard is generally viewed as
inadequate and outdated because it fails to account for:
Today’s rising costs of housing, health care, and child care.
Geographic variations in cost of living, particularly in high-
cost states like Massachusetts.
Non-cash benefits and tax credits that affect household
resources.25
More comprehensive tools have been developed to address these limitations. The Supplemental Poverty
Measure (SPM) from the U.S. Census Bureau includes a broader range of expenses and resources, adjusts
for regional cost differences, and accounts for non-cash benefits like SNAP, WIC, housing subsidies, and tax
credits like the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC).11,25
The MIT Living Wage Calculator offers localized cost-of-living estimates for every Massachusetts county and
several metro areas. With data available for a wide range of household types, from single adults to two-
parent families, it captures the diversity of working age households and estimates the income needed for
self-sufficiency without public or private assistance. In Massachusetts, for example, a single caregiver with
one child must earn nearly $115,000 a year (about $55 per hour) to cover basic expenses, over five times the
2025 FPL for the same family.25,26
The Elder Economic Security Standard Index
(Elder Index), developed by the Gerontology
Institute at UMass Boston, is a benchmark that
estimates the minimum cost of living for older
adults—based on household type, housing
status, health, and location—to maintain
independence and meet basic needs. This
measure reveals that many older adults lack
sufficient income to escape financial hardship,
even if their income exceeds the FPL.26,27
While each measure provides valuable insights, all share a critical limitation – they capture only what can be
quantified. Missing from these calculations are the daily realities of economic hardship, the daily stress of
juggling bills, the instability of irregular employment, the cost of unpaid caregiving, and the challenges of
navigating complex support systems. These experiences significantly illuminate the reality of poverty, even
when they remain invisible in official statistics.

PREVALENCE AND NEAR-POVERTY
In 2023, over 10% of Massachusetts residents lived below
the Federal Poverty Line (FPL).23 For context, the FPL was
$19,720 for a single adult with one child and $30,000 for a
family of four; these amounts fall far short of covering basic
expenses in Massachusetts.25,28
This official poverty rate offers only a narrow view of
hardship. Nearly one in five residents lived 200% below the
FPL.29 These households are often over the income limits for
public assistance yet still struggle to afford rent, food,
transportation, and child care.
While the statewide poverty rate has declined from over 11% in 2015, progress has been uneven.30 In
Massachusetts, four out of five adults living in poverty are in working households, underscoring a growing
disconnect between employment and economic stability.23 In addition, one in eight children and youth in the
Commonwealth live below the FPL, placing them at heightened risk for long-term economic hardship.23
Research shows that roughly one-third of children who grow up in poverty will also experience poverty as
adults, highlighting the urgency of addressing childhood poverty to disrupt intergenerational disadvantage.31
Poverty in Massachusetts follows distinct patterns linked to structural inequities and data reveal critical
disparities.
Racial and Ethnic Disparities
In 2023, compared to a statewide poverty rate of 7% for non-Hispanic white residents, the poverty rate by
race/ethnicity was:
Among Asian residents, the overall poverty rate was over 11%, but this aggregate figure conceals wide
disparities within subgroups. For example, poverty rates for Chinese and Vietnamese residents were more
than double those for Indian residents.33 These disparities reflect the enduring effects of migration history,
limited language access, unequal educational opportunity, and systemic racism—realities that remain hidden
when data is aggregated and Asian communities are treated as a monolith.34

rates of poverty in Massachusetts. In 2023, 18% of
noncitizens lived in poverty, compared to 10% of
naturalized citizens and 9% of U.S.-born citizens.35
These disparities reflect compounding barriers to
employment, public benefits, and language-
access services. The burden is particularly acute
for undocumented residents, many of whom
remain excluded from critical supports.36 Amid a
national climate of heightened immigration
enforcement and fear, access to basic resources
becomes even more tenuous, underscoring the
urgent need for inclusive and protective policies.

Gender and Family Structure
Gender and family structure are powerful
determinants of poverty in the Commonwealth.
Nearly one in three female-headed households
with children under 18 live in poverty—more than
eight times the rate for married couples with
children.37 These households face multiple
overlapping challenges, including food insecurity,
unstable housing, and limited access to high-
quality and affordable child care.38–40 The average
annual cost of toddler child care in the state is
nearly $20,000, placing a heavy burden on single
mothers.41 Although many single mothers work—
often in low-wage, part-time, or unstable jobs—
employment alone is rarely enough to ensure
economic stability.
Many women also shoulder unpaid caregiving

Location significantly influences economic opportunity across Massachusetts. While the statewide poverty
rate is 10.4%, this figure masks substantial regional differences resulting from historical disinvestment and
unequal access to resources (see Figure 1).51 Even within cities and towns, poverty concentrates unevenly.
Understanding these regional dynamics is essential to developing targeted, equitable solutions that

While data can reveal disparities, it often cannot
explain why they persist. Many forms of economic
hardship, and the communities most affected,
remain invisible in our current poverty
measurements. Unpaid caregivers, rural residents,
and older adults, for example, often face significant
structural barriers that official statistics fail to
capture. This section examines the systemic drivers
behind economic insecurity in Massachusetts.
Poverty reflects generations of policy choices and social structures that have systemically limited access to
opportunity, stability, and dignity for certain communities. These inequities are not inevitable; they are the
product of systems designed to benefit some while marginalizing others. Racism, ageism, ableism,
xenophobia, and gender inequity continue to influence legislation, resource distribution, and policy
priorities.
The root causes of poverty are intersecting forces that compound hardship over time.6 Identifying these
systemic factors clearly is essential to build solutions that are not only effective, but transformative.
Passed by voters in 2022, the Fair Share Amendment to the Massachusetts Constitution added an
additional income tax on high earners in order to provide the Commonwealth with more revenue
for public education and transportation. Fair Share funds have enabled Massachusetts to address
some of the root causes of poverty shared in these next sections. Funds have been used for
universal free school meals, tuition-free community college, early education grants, fare-free
regional transit, and improvements to public transportation infrastructure.104

Structural racism continues to shape economic outcomes across Massachusetts. From housing and
education to employment and health care, systems operate in ways that advantage white communities
while creating barriers for communities of color.
These disparities result from specific historic
and current-day policy decisions, including:
Redlining and exclusionary zoning,
Unequal school funding formulas,
Discriminatory lending practices, and
Biased hiring processes.
These policies have systematically denied Black,
Latine, Asian, and Indigenous communities access
to stability and wealth-building opportunities for
generations. Today, these legacies persist in the
form of eviction disparities, segregated schools,
underinvestment in public infrastructure, and
unequal access to health care, high-quality child
care, and transit, resulting in significant racial
disparities in wealth and income.
As of 2022, white households in the U.S. held a
median wealth of $285,000, while Black
households held just $45,000 and Latine
households, $62,000.56 This means that for every
$100 in wealth held by white families, Black
families held only about $16 and Latine families
about $22. In Massachusetts, Asian American and
Pacific Islander (AAPI) households often have
higher median wealth than Black and Latine
households yet still fall short of white household
wealth. Closing the racial wealth gap will require
confronting the enduring effects of structural
racism and making sustained investments in
communities of color to expand and build lasting
economic opportunity.

Economic and Labor Factors
In Massachusetts, employment does not guarantee economic stability. Many workers, particularly those
in sectors like caregiving, food service, and retail, earn wages that do not cover basic living expenses.
While the state’s minimum wage reached $15 per hour in 2023, the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology (MIT) Living Wage Calculator estimates that a single adult with one child would need to
earn $55 per hour to meet basic living expenses.25 This gap between wages and living costs stems from
specific policy decisions and structural shifts that have weakened worker protections, depressed wages
relative to productivity, and increased employment precarity.57–59

The excessive cost and limited availability of child
care continue to restrict women’s workforce
participation, especially single mothers and low-
income families.41 Many must sacrifice earnings
and career opportunities due to caregiving
responsibilities. Yet, public systems often treat
care as a private obligation rather than a collective
responsibility. Without structural changes to how
care work is valued, supported, and compensated,
gender inequity will remain a significant driver of
poverty throughout the Commonwealth.

Gender Inequity and Unpaid Care Work
Gender-based inequities are deeply embedded in both the labor market and social safety net. Women,
especially women of color, disproportionally occupy low-wage, part-time positions with limited benefits,
job security, or advancement opportunities.41,67,68 Simultaneously, women perform most unpaid
caregiving responsibilities for children, older adults, and family members with disabilities.
This essential but largely invisible care work
significantly constrains women’s economic
potential. In Massachusetts, women make up 85%
of home care and long-term care workers and 92%
of child care workers—roles that are among the
lowest paid in the state.41 Moreover, these critical
care roles often lack basic benefits like employer-

Education
Students in Massachusetts face persistent educational inequities that reinforce cycles of poverty and
limit economic mobility. The public education funding model is heavily reliant on local property taxes, a
structure that entrenches disparities between communities. In 2024, per-pupil spending in
Massachusetts ranged from just over $9,000 to more than $51,000, with the highest spending districts
located in wealthier, predominantly white areas.87 Conversely, districts with the lowest spending levels
serve a higher proportion of low-income students, English language learners, and students with
disabilities—populations that require more resources and individualized support. These funding gaps
frequently mirror racial and economic segregation, resulting in significant disadvantages in staffing,

Public benefit programs designed to provide basic stability during periods of hardship often fail to meet the

Programs such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), Transitional Aid to Families with

“Bridge to Prosperity Pilot Program.” This pilot aims to rethink the current safety net programs as a
means for economic mobility rather than as a “poverty trap.” This 3-year program works with a select
group of residents in Massachusetts that are receiving public assistance, and once their income
increases due to a higher-paying job, and their benefits decrease, they will receive supplemental
cash benefits to offset the gap. In addition to cash assistance, participants are receiving career and
financial coaching.112

Reliable, affordable transportation is essential for economic mobility, yet access is limited for many
Massachusetts residents. Limited transit options create daily obstacles to accessing opportunities for
employment, education, health care, social services, and other critical needs.

SPOTLIGHT:
Free and Reduced Transit Fares
Affordable and reliable transportation is critical to accessing employment, education, health care, child care, and
daily necessities. Reduced public transit fares have been linked to low-income riders taking 30% more trips,
including more trips for health care and social services appointments. In light of MBTA riders reporting that reliability,
affordability, and frequency are their top concerns, it is notable that eliminating fare collection has been shown to
improve on-time performance. The Legislature has made significant investments in transportation in recent years to
make it more accessible, including funding for fare-free RTAs and reduced fares for the MBTA.114-117
Several Regional Transit Authorities (RTAs) across the Commonwealth have eliminated fares, including the
following RTAs: Worcester (fare-free since 2020); Merrimack Valley (fare-free since 2022); and
Southeastern (temporarily fare-free in 2020 and 2022, fare-free since 2024). All have experienced large
ridership gains, with Southeastern RTA’s ridership growing 13 to 14 times faster than its two neighboring
transit agencies that charged fares. Eliminating fare collection has also improved on-time performance.
The Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA)’s Income-Eligible Reduced Fares Program was
launched in 2024 with the goal of expanding access to public transit. The program offers approximately 50
percent off fares to riders between the ages of 18 – 64 who are enrolled in an approved state assistance
program. Fares for all MBTA buses, subway, commuter rail, ferries, and paratransit (The RIDE) are included,
31 making this the first reduced fare program to include RIDE trips.

Poverty in Massachusetts stems from
interconnected systems that create advantage for
some while excluding others—not from individual
choices or isolated gaps. These systems can be
reimagined and rebuilt through collective action and
structural solutions.
Through this process, the Poverty Commission
prioritized:
Elevating voices typically excluded from policy
discussions,
Grounding recommendations in lived
experience, and
Applying a structural analysis to identify
root causes.

Inclusion Criteria
To effectively guide and prioritize amongst the broad range of ideas and interventions
that emerged with the Commission, the following criteria was established:
EQUITY:
Examines a recommendation’s potential to reduce disparities across diverse populations,
focusing on systemically marginalized groups such as Black, Indigenous, and People of Color
(BIPOC) communities, people with disabilities, immigrants, single parents, and rural
residents. This approach acknowledges that many individuals face compounded challenges
due to intersecting identities, which amplify economic hardships and deepen systemic
inequities. Priority should be given to recommendations that confront institutional and
structural barriers, build community power, advance fair resource distribution, and promote
pathways for long-term social mobility.
IMPACT:
Assesses a recommendation’s potential to produce measurable, meaningful, and
sustainable short- and long-term outcomes that alleviate poverty. High-impact
recommendations substantially improve the quality of life for low-income individuals
and families, reduce poverty rates, and promote long-term positive changes in social
determinants of health such as housing, education, and employment. Priority should be
given to recommendations with evidence-informed strategies and clear metrics for
success, ensuring lasting benefits to households and communities over time.
COMMUNITY NEEDS:
Reflects how a recommendation aligns with the expressed needs, lived experiences,
and cultural contexts of communities most affected by poverty. Priority should be
given to recommendations that incorporate input from individuals with direct
experience of poverty, reflect a comprehensive understanding of local challenges, and
have strong community support. This approach ensures that solutions are relevant,
responsive, and culturally appropriate, fostering trust and long-term impact within
communities most at risk for poverty.

Recommendations
The following recommendations reflect the collective insights of Commissioners and community members
with lived experience of poverty, including those who participated in subsequent focus groups. Organized
into four core action areas, each includes a vision statement, domain definitions, and detailed
recommendations to guide policy and practice over the next 10 years.
The core action areas include:
Access to Stability for Individuals
Essential Support and Families
Removes barriers to immediate, critical resources Strengthens the conditions that prevent people
such as food, child care, health care, and from falling deeper into poverty by ensuring
transportation to ensure residents can meet basic consistent income, secure housing, and caregiving
needs, avoid crisis, and begin a path out of poverty. support. Promotes resilience, protects against
disruption, and allows families to plan.
Opportunity for Systems Coordination
Economic Mobility and Implementation
Creates long-term pathways out of poverty by Aligns governance, funding, and service delivery to
expanding access to education, quality jobs, and strengthen implementation, improve
wealth-building tools. True mobility requires accountability, and embed community voice in
dismantling systemic barriers and investing in decision-making.
people’s ability to grow income, build assets, and
lead self-directed, economically secure lives.
Rather than representing isolated programs or life stages, these core action areas reflect interconnected
strategies designed to work in concert, creating lasting and positive change. Together, the recommendations
chart a roadmap for a more just and economically secure Massachusetts—one where every resident has the
resources, opportunity, and support necessary to thrive.
OTHER STATE MODELS
In 2017, Governor Jay Inslee of Washington State created the Poverty Reduction
Work Group (PRWG) via directive which, over several years, created a 10-year
roadmap to reduce poverty. In the three years since the plan was finalized, the group
leading the efforts, now named the Washington Economic Justice Alliance has taken
270 actions together to implement the 10-Year Plan.

Vision Statement: All Massachusetts residents can reliably access the essential resources
they need to live with dignity, achieve economic stability, and fully participate in community
life. Support must be trauma-informed, culturally and linguistically responsive, and
delivered without stigma, judgment, or punitive barriers.
Basic Needs
Ensure consistent, dignified access to basic needs by strengthening programs and closing
service gaps.
Expand and coordinate access to essential items including food, diapers, hygiene supplies, clothing, school
supplies, and fuel assistance. Strengthen and invest in programs like TAFDC, EAEDC, SNAP, WIC, HIP, and
school meals, including the staffing and infrastructure that allows the programs to run effectively and
efficiently. Maximize eligibility for immigrant households as permitted by law. Permanently expand eligibility
for basic needs programs for pregnant individuals.
Why This Matters: Meeting basic needs is fundamental to human dignity and creates stability that enables
opportunity. When families have reliable access to essential resources, they can focus on work, caregiving,
and overall well-being rather than day-to-day survival. Improved delivery systems for these necessities
affirm that every Massachusetts resident deserves to live without experiencing shame or hardship when
seeking support.
Expand and improve access to refundable tax credits.
Strengthen state refundable credits like the Earned Income
Tax Credit (EITC) and Child and Family Tax Credit (CFTC).
Expand eligibility to include immigrants (such as ITIN filers),
unpaid caregivers, younger workers, older adults, and
individuals without dependents. Increase investment in
outreach and simplified filing assistance to ensure all eligible
households receive their full entitled benefits.
Why This Matters: Refundable tax credits ensure
households can meet basic needs with dignity by covering
essentials like food, rent, and utilities. For
older adults, especially those with limited or no retirement
savings, expanded eligibility can reduce economic insecurity
later in life. These credits rank among the most effective
tools for immediate poverty reduction. By strengthening
these programs and extending them to historically excluded
populations, Massachusetts can significantly improve
household financial stability for residents across the state.

Establish minimum benefit levels and targeted state supplements for excluded or
underserved households
Develop state-funded minimum benefits and targeted supplements for individuals and families with limited or
no federal assistance, including immigrants, older adults, caregivers, and those just above federal thresholds.
Adjust annually for inflation and cost-of-living.
Why This Matters: Many individuals and families are excluded from federal aid or receive inadequate support
due to outdated eligibility rules. State-funded supplements can effectively bridge these gaps, particularly for
immigrant families and low-income households who face systemic barriers to assistance. These targeted
supports promote long-term stability and ensure that all residents can meet their basic needs regardless of
federal eligibility status.

RECOMMENDATION
Child Care, Education, and Skills
RECOMMENDATION
Expand access to affordable, high-quality early education, and after school and out-of-
school time programs.
Increase availability of culturally responsive, year-round care from infancy through school age, including
school breaks and summer. Ensure programs support learning, safety, and family economic stability.
Why This Matters: Early education and care supports children’s development and school readiness,
while enabling parents, especially women and low-income caregivers, to pursue work and other
opportunities.
RECOMMENDATION
Support early language and literacy development beginning at birth through 3rd grade,
with a focus on under-resourced communities.
Increase investment in literacy programs that promote evidence-based early reading proficiency across early
education and care, school, and community settings. Expand access to high-quality, evidence-based
coaching, culturally-responsive, language-rich materials, and family partnerships in historically underserved
districts. Equip educators, healthcare providers, and other professionals to regularly assess and support
children's language and literacy development starting in early childhood.
Why This Matters: Strong reading skills by third grade are a critical predictor of future academic and
economic achievement. Language development begins at birth through everyday interactions that build the
foundation for reading and learning. By investing early in environments that nurture language and reading
proficiency, we create a foundation for educational success that reduces disparities and benefits students
throughout their academic careers.
RECOMMENDATION
Expand access to affordable post-secondary education and student support services.
Continue to invest in early college pathways, free community college, and campus-based wraparound
services to support first-generation, low-income, and historically excluded students.
Why This Matters: Higher education opens doors to economic stability. Eliminating cost and access
barriers and offering wraparound services helps historically excluded students complete their education
37 and pursue mobility.

Digital Equity and Access
RECOMMENDATION
Close the digital divide through broadband expansion, skills training, and outreach to
underserved populations.
Advance digital equity by increasing investment in programs such as affordable high-speed internet, public
Wi-Fi, and digital literacy training, especially for older adults, rural communities, immigrants, and limited-
English speakers. Expand access to devices and multilingual outreach to ensure all residents can access
services and participate fully in daily life. Build on state initiatives like the Councils on Aging digital literacy
programs to increase impact.
Why This Matters: Digital access is essential for education, work, healthcare, and public services. Digital
exclusion can compound isolation and limit access to telehealth, benefits, and civic participation, especially
for older adults. Barriers like cost, location, or language deepen inequities. Promoting digital equity ensures
everyone can engage in civic and economic life.
Health
RECOMMENDATION
Expand access to comprehensive, community-based care across the lifespan.
Remove eligibility barriers and expand trauma-informed, culturally responsive medical, behavioral, and
preventive care. Ensure services are accessible for children, older adults, immigrants, caregivers, and
underserved communities.
Why This Matters: Health is foundational for full participation in work, school, and caregiving. Equitable,
community-based care improves outcomes and reduces disparities for older adults, caregivers, and
underserved groups.
Transportation
RECOMMENDATION
Expand affordable and accessible transportation that connects individuals and families
to services, opportunity, and community life.
Invest in reliable public transit and flexible local transportation for youth, older adults, caregivers, rural
residents, and people with disabilities. Align transit access with key systems like healthcare, education, and
employment.
Why This Matters: Reliable transportation connects individuals and families to work, care, and community
life. Addressing regional gaps, especially in rural areas such as western Massachusetts, reduces exclusion
and enhances access to services and social connection. Older adults and people with disabilities often face
geographic isolation and mobility limitations that cut them off from essential services.
38

Vision Statement: All Massachusetts residents can rely on strong systems that are well-
funded, staffed, modernized, trauma-informed, and culturally responsive. These systems
promote income stability, prevent displacement, and support long-term well-being,
meeting people where they are without shame, blame, or barriers.
Housing Stability
Expand housing assistance, tenant protections, and the supply of deeply affordable homes.
Increase funding for crucial programs such as Residential Assistance for Families in Transition (RAFT),
Massachusetts Rental Voucher Program (MRVP), and shelter capacity. Advance tenant protections such as
purchase rights and right to counsel. Expand bond-financed housing with long-term affordability protections,
especially for deeply affordable units serving households earning below 30% of the Area Median Income (AMI).
Strategies must center historically excluded renters, especially Black, Latine, and immigrant communities, who
face disproportionate eviction rates. Prioritize support for low-income individuals and families of color, older
adults, caregivers, youth, victims of domestic violence and human trafficking, and people impacted by reentry
or gentrification.
Why This Matters: Affordable, stable housing is essential for individual well-being and economic security.
Public investment and long-term affordability protections are critical to preventing displacement and crisis.
Homelessness creates significant costs and challenges for the Commonwealth and investing in homelessness
prevention resources is essential. When residents lack stable housing, the state faces increased expenses
across multiple systems, including emergency healthcare, shelter services, public safety, and crisis response.
Unhoused individuals experience worse health outcomes, leading to higher utilization of emergency
departments and inpatient care. Children without stable housing show disrupted educational progress,
affecting school performance metrics and future workforce readiness.
By investing in affordable housing solutions, Massachusetts reduces these systemic costs while creating
stronger communities, improving public health outcomes, and supporting economic productivity across the
state.
Increase supportive housing and rental assistance for those with the greatest needs.
Expand rental vouchers and accessible units for older adults, people with disabilities, caregivers, youth, victims
of domestic violence and human trafficking, and multigenerational households. Calculate rent based on net
income and reduce administrative burdens that block access.
Why This Matters: Aligning affordability with real income promotes housing stability and reduces benefit
cliffs. Tailored support helps close racial, age-based, and disability-related disparities, especially for caregiving
and multigenerational households at risk of losing housing.

RECOMMENDATION
Advance structural reforms to increase housing affordability and community control.
Reform zoning laws and codes to allow multifamily housing and adopt tools like estate transfer fees to fund
long-term affordability. Ensure community engagement in planning to prevent displacement and promote
ownership.
Why This Matters: Outdated zoning and financing mechanisms limit supply and reinforce segregation.
Structural reforms that expand community voice and ownership are essential to long-term housing stability.
RECOMMENDATION
Expand inclusive, low-barrier shelter options.
Increase culturally responsive shelter capacity for youth, fathers, older adults, LGBTQ+ individuals,
survivors of violence or trafficking, justice-involved people, and individuals with disabilities or substance use
needs. Design shelters for safety, autonomy, and dignity.
Why This Matters: Low-barrier, identity-affirming shelter options create welcoming environments where
all residents can find stability and safety. These accessible approaches ensure that everyone seeking
shelter—including those with complex needs or from marginalized communities—receives appropriate
support and dignity. By designing shelter systems that respect diverse identities and experiences,
Massachusetts can better promote housing stability and community well-being for all residents, particularly
those facing multiple challenges.
Income Support and Job Quality
RECOMMENDATION
Strengthen and stabilize core cash assistance programs.
Tie Transitional Aid to Families with Dependent Children (TAFDC) and Emergency Aid for Elderly Disabled and
Children (EAEDC) grant levels to the Federal Poverty Level (FPL) and implement automatic annual funding
increases that adjust with FPL changes to maintain consistent support levels.
Why This Matters: Keeping families out of deep poverty is vital to Massachusetts' economic and social well-
being. Cash assistance provides a crucial foundation during crisis, caregiving, or unemployment. Inclusive
eligibility and adequate benefits help prevent deep poverty, ensuring short-term stability while reducing long-
term costs to state systems, improving child outcomes, and maintaining workforce participation when families
can meet basic needs.

RECOMMENDATION
Establish a guaranteed income for residents with low or no income.
Create a guaranteed income program through the tax system that provides a minimum income to residents.
Prioritize groups facing persistent economic hardship, including unpaid caregivers, people with disabilities,
returning citizens, and older adults on fixed incomes. Ensure residents know about the program and that it is
easy to enroll and remain on the program.
Why This Matters: Unrestricted cash in the form of guaranteed or universal basic income (GBI or UBI) puts
money directly into the hands of residents of the Commonwealth, allowing them to spend where it is most
helpful to them. GBI enables people to meet daily needs with dignity and autonomy, reducing short-term
hardship and promoting basic security. A guaranteed income is especially impactful for individuals excluded
from traditional cash assistance and offers a stabilizing foundation that allows households to navigate periods
of economic stress and age with dignity. Multiple studies show a myriad of better outcomes are achieved for
individuals and families. 102–104
SPOTLIGHT:
Rise Up Cambridge
Rise Up Cambridge, a $22 million commitment from the City of Cambridge, provided direct cash
assistance to families with children residing in Cambridge who meet certain eligibility criteria
including income. Under this program, participating households receive $500 per month for 18
months. This program was the first and only city-wide cash assistance program of its kind in the
United States. Research from the program shows that participants have used their funds to meet
basic needs, manage debt, and build savings accounts.101
RECOMMENDATION
Promote living wages and job protection in essential sectors.
Advance wage, benefit, and workplace protections across caregiving, education, food service, reentry,
shelter, and housing sectors. Include paid leave, mental health support, and protections against
harassment.
Why This Matters: Low pay and poor working conditions in caregiving, food service, and shelter sectors
create chronic instability for workers and communities. Raising standards prevents economic insecurity and
reduces turnover in systems critical to public well-being.
41

Reentry Stability
Remove barriers to housing, benefits, and unemployment for people navigating reentry.
Invest in transitional housing with wraparound supports. Ensure timely reinstatement of MassHealth coverage
upon release, with attention to common delays that disrupt access to medications and behavioral health care.
Guarantee access to identification and essential documents before release.
Why This Matters: Addressing structural barriers post-incarceration benefits Massachusetts by reducing
homelessness, poverty, and recidivism rates. When returning residents have immediate access to essentials, the
Commonwealth experiences decreased public safety costs, reduced strain on emergency services, and
increased workforce participation.
These improvements particularly strengthen historically over-policed and under-resourced communities,
creating more equitable outcomes while enhancing public safety and economic stability across the state.

RECOMMENDATION
Reform outdated child support policies to promote family stability.
Implement reforms to child support policies by reducing state recoupment practices and modifying
enforcement approaches. Enhance accessibility to modification processes and legal assistance, while
prioritizing the needs of primary caregivers, with particular consideration for survivors of domestic
violence.
Why This Matters: By reforming child support policies to increase autonomy and dignity for those
engaging in the system and ensuring that families receive their entire payment rather than the state
recouping a portion, the Commonwealth can strengthen family financial stability, improve child well-
being, and create more equitable outcomes for Massachusetts families.
RECOMMENDATION
RECOMMENDATION
Reform the Criminal Offender Record Information (CORI) system by automating record
sealing and providing access to legal assistance.
Support legislation that would reform the CORI system by funding outreach, legal clinics, and education
around record sealing.
Why This Matters: Criminal records can block access to jobs, housing, and education for decades.
Automating the process and supporting legal access helps break cycles of poverty and racial inequity.
RECOMMENDATION
Establish a coordinated, state-funded reentry infrastructure.
Create a statewide network offering reentry navigation, housing assistance, benefits access, and workforce
support. Provide funding for staffing, training, and technical assistance, especially for community-based
providers.
Why This Matters: Successful reentry depends on service coordination, housing access, and employment
support. A permanent infrastructure ensures continuity of care and economic stability, especially for aging or
caregiving populations.
42

Vision Statement: All Massachusetts residents deserve equitable, intergenerational
pathways to build income, access meaningful work, grow wealth, and lead self-directed
lives. Achieving economic mobility requires dismantling structural barriers and rejecting
narratives that blame individuals for systemic poverty.
Job Standards and Worker Rights in Essential Sectors
Raise wages, improve working conditions,
and protect the right to organize for
essential workers across all sectors.
Advance policies that ensure essential workers,
especially women, immigrants, and BIPOC individuals,
have access to fair pay, predictable schedules, safe
conditions protections, paid leave, and job security.
Why This Matters: Many essential jobs across the
economy are undervalued, marked by low wages,
limited benefits, unsafe conditions, and barriers to
organizing. Workers in these roles often face systemic
exploitation, especially in sectors disproportionally
staffed by women, immigrants, and BIPOC individuals.
Raising job standards and protecting organizing rights
are key to ensuring mobility and justice for all, not just
advancement for a few.
Career Pathways and Employer Accountability
Expand equitable career pathways to quality jobs.
Expand registered apprenticeships, vocational programs, and training pathways that lead to stable, well-
compensated jobs with strong labor protections. Ensure programs are certified, aligned with employer
demand, and include guaranteed job placement wherever possible. Define quality jobs as those offering fair
wages, benefits, safety, and worker voice. Support inclusive access and completion for historically excluded
and marginalized communities through outreach, navigation, and wraparound supports.
Why This Matters: Training alone does not reduce poverty unless it leads to quality employment. Many
workers, especially BIPOC individuals, immigrants, women, people with disabilities, and those most impacted
by the criminal legal system, complete programs only to enter low-wage, unstable jobs. Career pathways must
lead to real jobs with livable wages and protections. Clear standards and job guarantees are essential to lasting
opportunity.

RECOMMENDATION
“If I don't work one day, I don't get
paid. If I work extra hours, I do not
get overtime pay. I see that there are
many workplace abuses… many of us
leave our families behind in order to
make better lives for ourselves and
our families at home. Upon arriving
here, I see that we experience an
uphill battle just in order to survive
and bring food home.”
— PUBLIC TESTIMONY
Springfield hearing, 2024

Postsecondary and Adult Learning Pathways
Expand access to foundational education and training that connect learners to stable,
well-compensated work.
Invest in affordable, flexible, and community-based education and training, including adult basic education,
English language learning, digital literacy, workforce programs, and college support. Prioritize outreach and
resources for those excluded from traditional systems, such as immigrants, returning citizens, and older adults.
Ensure all programs are linked to stable jobs with fair wages and protections, not just credentials.
Why This Matters: Education can open doors, but it does not guarantee economic stability. For older adults
seeking to retrain or re-enter the workforce, flexible and affordable pathways are frequently out of reach. Too
often, people complete programs only to find low-wage, insecure jobs. All work, not just credentialled careers,
must provide livable wages, protections, and long-term security. Education should be a tool for opportunity,
not a prerequisite for economic survival.
Wealth-Building and Financial Justice
Expand access to wealth-building tools and protect residents from predatory
financial practices.
Increase availability of matched savings accounts, homeownership support, and retirement programs. Pass
legislation to establish baby bonds. Repeal asset limits in benefits programs where the state has authority to do
so. Protect residents from predatory financial products by restricting high-cost lending and simplifying tax
repayment. Expand access to equitable debt relief by reducing interest rates on government and medical
debt, regulating debt collectors, and addressing predatory enforcement practices. Prioritize relief for medical
debt, utility arrears, and unjust fines and fees.
Why This Matters: Building savings and assets are key to closing racial and economic wealth gaps. Predatory
financial practices and exclusionary systems entrench generational poverty. Expanding BabySteps, the Family
Self Sufficiency Program, homeownership support, retirement programs, and consumer protections ensure
more households can build long-term financial security.

Workforce Equity and Access
Ensure workforce development opportunities are flexible, accessible, and supportive of
both training and employment for workers facing structural barriers.
Expand flexible training options, including evenings, weekends, and online formats. Provide child care,
transportation, and technology supports that extend beyond training into employment, especially for
workers with nontraditional hours. Prioritize access for individuals facing systemic barriers, such as
caregivers, immigrants, older adults, and returning citizens. Offer stipends, navigation, and targeted reentry
supports to increase participation and access.
Why This Matters: Many workers are excluded from workforce opportunities due to rigid schedules,
caregiving responsibilities, or lack of reliable child care, transportation, or internet. Older adults seeking to
reenter the workforce or shift careers often face barriers related to digital literacy, employer bias, and job
structures that lack flexibility in hours, location, or physical demands. These barriers do not end when training
does. Extending support into employment is essential for workers facing structural inequities and systemic
exclusion from economic opportunity.
Advance a cross-cutting caregiver strategy across access, stability, and economic mobility
action areas.
Recognize the economic contributions of unpaid caregivers—primarily women, immigrants, and BIPOC
individuals—and invest across core action areas to support them. Expand paid leave, respite care, and cash
support; improve protections and workplace policies; and create training pathways to paid caregiving
careers.
Why This Matters: Caregivers provide essential support that sustains families and communities across
Massachusetts. Supporting caregivers acknowledges their vital economic and social contributions while
addressing the financial challenges faced. Comprehensive caregiver support promotes equity by addressing
disparities affecting women, people of color, and immigrants who disproportionately provide care. When
caregivers receive adequate resources and recognition, they and those they care for experience improved
well-being, creating stronger, more resilient communities throughout the Commonwealth.

Vision Statement: All Massachusetts residents deserve public systems that are
coordinated, transparent, and equity-driven, guided by lived experience and accountable to
the communities they serve. Effective implementation must eliminate barriers to economic
security, reduce stigma, and center resident voice in shaping policies and programs.
Data and Accountability
Improve data coordination to strengthen anti-poverty policy.
Invest in cross-agency data systems that track benefit interactions and cliff effects, monitor outcomes, and
inform timely decision-making. Ensure data systems are privacy-protected, accessible, informative, and
responsive to community needs.
Why This Matters: Accurate, integrated data is essential for effective policy, transparency, and equity.
Modern data systems should track disparities, support real-time decision-making, and reflect community
priorities using metrics that matter to those most impacted.
Funding Alignment and Delivery Infrastructure
Ensure sufficient state funding for community-based organizations and public agencies
to strengthen service delivery infrastructure.
Increase investment to public agencies, and align public and private funding to support operational capacity,
close service gaps, and improve reimbursement rates to stabilize the capacity of nonprofits and public
agencies delivering essential services. Support shared infrastructure, collaborative planning, and long-term
sustainability through inflation-adjusted funding.
Why This Matters: Community-based organizations and public systems are essential to delivering services
and building trust between residents and the systems that serve them. Long-term, aligned funding for state
agencies, service providers, and grassroots organizations improves stability, equity, and capacity to meet
community needs.

Systems Coordination and Implementation
RECOMMENDATION
RECOMMENDATION

Governance and Cross-Sector Coordination
Establish a permanent, cross-agency body to guide anti-poverty implementation.
Establish a permanent, cross-agency governance body to guide the implementation of this report and
make recommendations as appropriate (i.e. conferred eligibility). Designate a senior-level Coordinator for
Poverty Reduction within the Governor’s Office to oversee implementation, align agency efforts, and
ensure public accountability. Ensure meaningful participation from public agencies, nonprofit organizations,
academic and philanthropic partners, frontline providers, and people with lived experience.
Why This Matters: Bold strategies often stall without coordinated leadership. A resourced governance
structure grounded in community oversight and shared accountability can drive implementation, monitor
progress, and adapt to emerging needs.
Integrated Benefits Access
Modernize and streamline access to benefits through a common application system.
Advance the development of a unified, user-friendly benefits platform that allows streamlined access to a
variety of benefits across state-administered programs. Continue to invest in system integration, staffing,
and digital inclusion to support implementation.
Why This Matters: Streamlining access to benefits allows Massachusetts residents to efficiently connect
with essential supports while saving valuable time and resources. This approach reduces administrative
costs, ensures higher program participation rates, and helps families achieve greater stability. By eliminating
repetitive applications and clarifying eligibility rules, Massachusetts can maximize federal funding
opportunities, improve economic mobility outcomes, and create a more responsive government that better
serves all residents.

Language Access
Invest in and ensure Massachusetts residents receive language access services from
state agencies.
Prioritize funding and development of language access services, including oral interpretation and the
translation of vital documents, within state agencies that are responsive to the language needs of all
Massachusetts residents, including limited-English proficient (LEP) or Deaf and Hard of Hearing persons.
Ensure state agencies establish language access policies, including staff training, so that all Massachusetts
residents can participate in programs and services to which they are eligible and entitled.
Why This Matters: Without the provision of language access services, residents and families who are
limited-English proficient (LEP) or Deaf and Hard of Hearing experience severe challenges when applying
for or utilizing public services or programs due to a lack of access to information in their preferred language.
Even when LEP or Deaf and Hard of Hearing persons can access benefits and programs, in many cases they
improperly receive fewer or no benefits due to application errors and miscommunication, although all
eligibility requirements are met.
With information available in multiple languages and on-demand language access services like
interpretation and translation, all Massachusetts residents will have equal access to services and programs
and equal protections under the law.
Navigation and Service Coordination
Fund culturally and linguistically responsive navigation and case management to close
access gaps.
Embed culturally and linguistically responsive navigators, case managers and qualified interpreters and
translators within public agencies and community-based organizations to help individuals and families
access and coordinate benefits and services. Ensure alignment with state policies and integrate navigation
into broader system infrastructure.
Why This Matters: Service navigation is essential infrastructure, not a temporary solution. By integrating
navigation support within public systems, residents will receive assistance regardless of digital access
challenges and language barriers. Culturally and linguistically responsive coordination builds community
trust while improving efficiency and effectiveness across government services, creating a more accessible
and responsive Commonwealth for all residents.

Service Delivery Workforce
Invest in the workforce and infrastructure that deliver essential services.
Increase funding for salaries, training, and staffing across housing, benefits, reentry, and caregiving systems.
Strengthen organizational capacity and support culturally responsive, trauma-informed service delivery.
Why This Matters: Chronic underinvestment in public and nonprofit systems leads to burnout, high staff
turnover, and access challenges. Investing in salaries, training, and capacity across key roles such as benefits
eligibility, housing coordination, and reentry navigation improves quality, equity, and trust in public delivery
systems.

Conclusion
The recommendations laid out in this report can serve as a roadmap to greatly reduce
poverty in Massachusetts by 2035. These recommendations are grounded in evidence,
shaped by the experience and stories of community members that are most impacted, and
can be collectively owned by leaders, advocates, citizens, and professionals who
understand the urgency and possibility of this work. Additional work will be required to
advance the operationalization of the roadmap. Next steps may include, for example, cost
feasibility studies or sequencing recommendations in the form of an action plan, which
were not part of this phase of work.
While this roadmap comes at a time of deep uncertainty, Massachusetts has a long history
of leading our nation with groundbreaking policy, and with courage, care, and intentionality.
There is no more crucial time than the present to invest in a society where transportation,
housing, and education are truly more affordable, where people have streamlined and
sustained access to basic income, and where there is no stigma or systemic barriers that
prevent people from access and maintaining the support they deserve.
With this roadmap, we urge policymakers, state and local government, advocates,
community-based organizations, and concerned citizens to act boldly. We are committed
to advancing the recommendations outlined here; they are comprehensive, evidence-
based solutions that will work to build a future Massachusetts where all residents are
empowered and supported enough to truly thrive.

Glossary
Area Median Income (AMI) is the midpoint of a region’s income distribution, where half of the households
earn more and half earn less. AMI is frequently used to determine eligibility for income-based housing
assistance programs and is adjusted for household size and geographic area.
BabySteps is a program offered by the State Treasurer’s office that provides $50 to Massachusetts
families to save toward their children’s education.
Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC) is a collective term used to acknowledge the shared and
distinct social, economic, and historical experiences of these communities, particularly in the context of
systemic inequities. The term is often used in policy and research to help guide efforts aimed at addressing
disparities affecting historically marginalized populations.
Child and Family Tax Credit (CFTC) is a state tax credit for Massachusetts residents who support
qualifying dependents, including children under the age of 13, adults aged 65 or older, and those with
disabilities. The CFTC is a refundable tax credit, which means that if the amount of the credit is greater than
the amount of tax owed, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) sends a tax refund for the difference. This credit
is available to single filers, heads of household, and married couples filing jointly. Married individuals filing
separately are not eligible. To claim the credit, taxpayers must file a Massachusetts income tax return, even
if they have no income to report.
Cliff Effect refers to a situation in which a small increase in income gained from a raise or a job promotion
causes a sudden loss of public benefits or aid, resulting in a net decrease in overall resources for a person
or family. This means that despite working or earning more, the individual’s overall financial situation
worsens. The cliff effect can create a disincentive to advance in a career because while earnings may
increase slightly, it is not enough to offset the loss of crucial benefits and support systems.
Criminal Offender Record Information (CORI) is a state-managed criminal background check system
that collects and maintains records documenting an individual’s criminal history including arrests, charges,
convictions, and dispositions. CORI reports are used by authorized employers, licensing boards, and
government agencies to conduct background checks for purposes of employment, housing, and licensing.
Access to CORI is regulated by state law to protect individuals' privacy and limit the dissemination of
information.
Department of Early Education and Care (EEC) is the Massachusetts state agency within EOE
responsible for licensing and overseeing early childhood education and care programs, including
preschools, child care centers, and out-of-school-time programs. EEC also manages subsidies and
initiatives to support early learning and child development.
Department of Elementary and Secondary Education (DESE) is the state agency within EOE responsible
for overseeing public education from pre-kindergarten through grade 12, as well as adult education
programs. The agency administers and enforces education laws, allocates public funds to school districts
and adult education programs, and monitors school performance to ensure compliance with state
education standards.

Department of Higher Education (DHE) is the state agency within EOE responsible for implementing the
policies of the Board of Higher Education for public colleges and universities in the Commonwealth. The
DHE’s responsibilities include managing academic program approvals, monitoring institutional
performance, administering financial aid programs, and ensuring compliance with fiscal guidelines.
Department of Public Health (DPH) is the Massachusetts state agency within EOHHS responsible for
protecting and promoting public health through disease prevention, health care quality oversight, health
data collection, and regulation of health care providers and facilities.
Department of Transitional Assistance (DTA) is the Massachusetts state agency within EOHHS that
provides public assistance programs to low-income individuals and families, including food assistance
(SNAP), economic assistance (TAFDC and EAEDC), and employment support services.
Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) is a federal and state tax credit for low and moderate-income working
people intended to offset federal payroll and income taxes. The EITC is a refundable tax credit, which means
that if the amount of the credit is greater than the amount of tax owed, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS)
sends a tax refund for the difference. Massachusetts has established a state-specific EITC to supplement
the federal credit. The Massachusetts credit amount is 40% of the federal EITC that a taxpayer qualifies for.
Emergency Aid to Elders, Disabled and Children (EAEDC) is a state-funded program that provides cash
benefits and MassHealth coverage to eligible individuals who are unable to work due to age, disability, or
caregiving responsibilities. The program helps cover basic living expenses such as food, housing, and
utilities. Benefit amounts are determined based on household composition and living arrangements, with
possible deductions for work-related expenses and dependent care.
English for Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL) refers to educational programs or courses designed to
teach English language skills to individuals whose first language is not English, aiming to improve their
proficiency for communication, education, and employment.
Executive Office of Aging & Independence (EOAI) is the Massachusetts state agency that supports older
adults and caregivers by overseeing services such as home care, nutrition, housing, protective services, and
programs that promote independence and well-being for adults aged 60 and older.
Executive Office of Economic Development (EOED) is the Massachusetts state agency responsible for
advancing economic growth, job creation, and business development through policies, programs, and
partnerships that support industries, workforce development, and innovation across the state.
Executive Office of Education (EOE) is the Massachusetts state agency that oversees early education,
K–12 public education, and higher education. It coordinates education policy and programs across the
Department of Early Education and Care, the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education, and the
Department of Higher Education.
Executive Office of Health and Human Services (EOHHS) is the Massachusetts state agency responsible
for overseeing and coordinating health and human services programs, including Medicaid (MassHealth),
public health, social services, behavioral health, and services for children, older adults, and individuals with
disabilities.

Executive Office of Housing and Livable Communities (EOHLC) is the state agency responsible for implementing
housing policies, administering emergency and affordable housing programs, enforcing housing regulations, and
allocating funds to municipalities and organizations to support housing development and preservation.
Executive Office of Labor and Workforce Development (EOLWD) is the state agency responsible for enforcing
labor laws, administering unemployment benefits, overseeing workers' compensation, ensuring workplace safety,
and providing workforce training and development programs.
Executive Office of Public Safety and Security (EOPSS) is the state agency responsible for developing
policies, allocating budgets, and supporting the activities of its constituent public safety agencies, including
law enforcement, emergency management, homeland security, and fire services.
Family Self-Sufficiency Program (FSS) is a voluntary program administered by public housing agencies
(PHAs) that helps residents increase their earned income and reduce dependency on public assistance
through case management and financial incentives, including escrow savings accounts. Savings are used
for purposes such as homeownership, education or business development.
Federal Poverty Level (FPL) is a measure of income issued annually by the U.S. Department of Health
and Human Services that defines the minimum income threshold a household needs to meet basic living
expenses. It is used to determine eligibility for various federal and state assistance programs, such as
Medicaid, food assistance, and subsidized health insurance. The FPL varies by household size and is
adjusted each year for inflation.
Healthy Incentives Program (HIP) is a Massachusetts state program that aims to increase access to
healthy foods and support local agriculture by providing Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP)
recipients with incentives to purchase local fruits and vegetables at participating vendors, including farmers'
markets, farm stands, mobile markets, and CSA programs. The program offers a dollar-for-dollar match,
meaning that for every dollar spent on eligible produce, an equal amount is credited back to the recipient’s
Electronic Benefit Transfer (EBT) card at the time of purchase, up to a monthly cap based on household size.
Individual Taxpayer Identification Number (ITIN) is a 9-digit tax processing number issued by the
Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to individuals who are required to have a U.S. taxpayer identification number
for federal tax purposes but are not eligible for a Social Security Number (SSN). ITINs are used primarily by
nonresident aliens, their spouses, and dependents to file federal tax returns and comply with U.S. tax laws,
granting these individuals to ability to pay taxes and claim certain tax benefits.
Matched Savings Accounts are savings accounts in which deposits made by an individual are matched by
a designated entity, up to a specified limit, to encourage asset building for purposes such as
homeownership, education, or business development.
Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) is the state agency within MassDOT responsible for
operating and maintaining public transit services in the Greater Boston area, including subway, bus, commuter
rail, and ferry services, by managing transit infrastructure, schedules, fares, and safety regulations.

Massachusetts Rental Voucher Program (MRVP) is a state-funded program that provides rental
subsidies in the form of vouchers paid directly to landlords for low- and moderate-income households who
meet eligibility criteria based on income and household size.
MassHealth is the Massachusetts Medicaid program that provides health insurance coverage to low- and
moderate-income individuals and families who meet eligibility criteria based on factors such as income,
household size, age, disability status, and citizenship or immigration status. MassHealth covers a broad
range of medical services including doctor visits, hospital care, prescription drugs, and preventive care.
Residential Assistance for Families in Transition (RAFT) is a state-funded program that provides short-
term financial assistance to low-income families and individuals who are at risk of experiencing or currently
experiencing homelessness or housing instability. The program helps cover housing-related costs such as
rent, security deposits, and utility payments, among others, to promote housing stability.
Subsidy refers to direct or indirect financial assistance, often provided by the government, for individuals
or organizations to reduce the cost of goods or services and support activities that serve a public or
economic interest. Subsidies can take various forms, including direct cash payments, tax credits or
exemptions, or interest-free or reduced-interest loans, among others.
Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), formerly known as Food Stamps, is a federal
program administered by the U.S. Department of Agriculture and managed at the state level that provides
low-income individuals and families with monthly benefits to help purchase food. SNAP eligibility is based
on criteria including income and household size, and benefits are issued through an Electronic Benefit
Transfer (EBT) card that can be used at authorized retailers to buy approved food items.
Supplemental Poverty Measure (SPM) is an alternative to the Official Poverty Measure (OPM) used by
the U.S. Census Bureau to provide a more comprehensive assessment of economic need. It incorporates
additional factors beyond a household’s pre-tax cash income, such as tax payments, government
assistance, work-related expenses, medical costs, and geographic cost-of-living differences. While the
OPM is used to determine the Federal Poverty Level (FPL) for program eligibility, the SPM is primarily used
for research and policy analysis to assess the effectiveness of anti-poverty programs.
Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) is a fixed block grant that the federal government provides
to states to design and operate programs aimed toward helping families experiencing low-income achieve and
maintain stability. In Massachusetts, the TANF program is administered by the Department of Transitional
Assistance (DTA) under the name Transitional Aid to Families with Dependent Children (TAFDC).
Transitional Assistance for Families with Dependent Children (TAFDC) is a state and federally funded
program that provides cash assistance to low-income families with children and pregnant individuals.
Universal School Meals Program (USM) is a Massachusetts state program that provides free breakfast
and lunch to all students in public schools, regardless of family income, aimed at addressing food insecurity.
USM is permanently funded through the state budget and covers one nutritious breakfast and lunch per
student each school day. The program has led to increased student consumption in school meals and is
estimated to save families an average of $1,200 per student annually.
Women, Infants & Children Program (WIC) is a federal program administered by the U.S. Department of
Agriculture and managed at the state level that provides nutritional support, education, and access to
healthy foods for low-income pregnant and postpartum individuals, infants, and children up to age five.
Eligibility is based on income, nutritional risk, and residency, and benefits include food vouchers, nutrition
56 counseling, and breastfeeding support.
