IV. Microstamping
Gun violence is a public health crisis in the United States,2 with almost 47,000 Americans dying each
year from gun-related injuries.3 Meanwhile, half of gun crimes go unsolved in the United States, with that
rate continuing to increase over the last forty years.4 Pursuant to the 2024 Gun Safety Law, the
Commonwealth of Massachusetts requires all firearms possessed, manufactured, or assembled in the state
to be registered.5 Guns rarely are left at the scene of a crime, making their registration insufficient for
solving crimes, whereas cartridge casings often remain. As such, this Commission explored
microstamping in the hopes that it may prove helpful in solving gun crimes and preventing gun deaths.
The 2024 Gun Safety Law, in its charge to this Commission, defines microstamping as follows: “a
microscopic array of characters identifying the make, model, or serial number of a firearm, etched or
otherwise imprinted in 2 or more places on the interior surface or the internal working parts of the
firearm, that are transferred by imprinting on each cartridge case when the firearm is fired.”6 In other
words, intentional firearm microstamping (“IFM” or “microstamping”) involves the creation of an
indentation mechanism on a firearm’s firing pin, which in turn creates indentations on each fired bullet
casing with a code linked to that firearm. Law enforcement then can use microstamped bullet casings
recovered at crime scenes to identify the firearm from which they were discharged. This allows for a
process for tracing firearms used in gun crimes in Massachusetts.
Intentional firearm microstamping may offer a more precise way to identify firearms used in gun crimes
than law enforcement’s current methods. Traditional ballistics investigation relies on detecting random
imperfections found on bullet casings (unintentional firearm microstamping) and analyzing them (firearm
and toolmark examinations and analysis) by the National Integrated Ballistic Information Network
(“NIBEN”), a program of the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. Further, to
properly identify the firearm used in a crime, said firearm must be recovered at the scene and compared to
the bullet casings found. Conversely, with microstamping, only bullet casings with their IFM code
detectable need to be recovered from a crime scene to determine the firearm used. Todd Lizotte, one of
the Commission’s members, is a co-creator of microstamping.7
This identification method may serve as another tool and opportunity for law enforcement to investigate,
solve, and prosecute gun crimes. With a positive identification of an IFM code, investigations may lead
directly to the firearm involved in a crime and further empower law enforcement to link separate crimes.

As such, law enforcement may be able to connect individuals involved with other criminals and crimes,
such as irresponsible or illegal gun dealers, human traffickers, and drug smuggling operations. While the
technology does not remove all human bias, the purposeful characters of a firearm’s IFM code create a
more direct link that is less open to interpretation (and therefore less error) than unintentional firearm
microstamping. The technology is also commercially available, with no patent restrictions on its adoption
and use by third parties. Further, intentional firearm microstamping uses laser printing technology that is
already in wide use. These factors contribute to a promising outlook for the use of intentional firearm
microstamping in solving gun-related crimes.
While unintentional firearm microstamping has been the standard to identify firearms used in gun crimes,
there is debate in the scientific and legal communities about the reliability of toolmark examinations and
their admissibility in court. In 2009, a National Research Council report determined that conclusive
identifications of firearms using firearm and toolmark analysis were without a strong scientific or
statistical foundation.8 Similarly, a 2016 report by the U.S. President’s Council of Advisors on Science
and Technology offered skepticism regarding the reliability of firearm and toolmark examinations.9
Furthermore, several court rulings over the last two decades have limited firearm and toolmark analysis as
admissible evidence and testimony due to doubts raised surrounding their scientific rigor.10 These reports
and rulings pose issues for law enforcement and prosecutors, casting a shadow over their work to make
communities safer. Intentional firearm microstamping could offer more definitive conclusions if
implemented on a large scale.
Intentional firearm microstamping, like unintentional firearm microstamping, has limitations. Primarily,
the wearing down of the microstamped firing pin in a firearm over time may prove an impediment to
properly identifying the code and, therefore, the firearm. There is also the potential for unauthorized
replacement or tampering with a firearm’s firing pin. Nonetheless, in such circumstances, it may be
possible for unintentional firearm microstamping to be used to identify the firearm used in a crime. It is
also important to note that no other state has fully implemented state laws regarding intentional firearm
microstamping, though several states that have passed microstamp statutes were studied by the
Commission.11
Along with the intentional firearm microstamping that the Commission explored, there is another form of
microstamping commonly known as the “Miami Barrel.” The Miami-Dade Police Department worked in
conjunction with firearm manufacturer Glock GmbH to create this microstamping mechanism on the
Glock pistols the Department uses. Miami Barrels create indentations on a fired bullet as it passes through
the barrel, instead of the mechanism being the firing pin. Unlike the traditional intentional firearm
microstamping, the Miami Barrel was created to identify bullets fired by a police officer in officer-

involved shootings. The intent there was to create more accountability for police officers who discharge
their weapons while on duty. The technology has considerably less implementation and testing than
traditional intentional firearm microstamping.12
V. Personalized Firearms
In 2023, 463 people died and over 27,000 people were injured in the United States due to accidental
firearm discharges. Separately, over half of the aforementioned 47,000 Americans killed by firearms
annually were Americans who committed suicide. Firearm discharges by those with mental health issues
were a significant concern of the Commission. Unauthorized use of a firearm is a common characteristic
of school shootings, with three-quarters of school shooting perpetrators taking the firearm that belonged
to a family member. For most of the century so far, gun deaths have been the leading cause of death for
children under the age of 18.13 As such, this Commission explored personalized firearms in the hopes that
the technology may prove helpful in preventing gun injuries and deaths.
The Commission’s authorizing statute defines personalized firearms as follows: “a firearm manufactured
with incorporated design technology or converted with such technology so that it: (i) allows the firearm to
be fired only by an authorized user; or (ii) prevents any of the safety characteristics of the firearm from
being readily deactivated.” Personalized firearms use biometric data to limit the use of a firearm to its
owner and any trusted users that the owner designates. This feature prevents discharge by unauthorized
users, whether accidental or intentional.
At present, only two American firms are confirmed to manufacture personalized firearms, Biofire and
Lodestar Technology. Lodestar has announced a 9mm handgun design, but its firearm has yet to reach the
market, and the firm did not respond to inquiries from the Commission. Kai Kloepfer, founder and CEO
of Biofire, informed the Commission that his company is currently the only American manufacturer of
personalized firearms. Biofire, a venture-backed startup based in Colorado, unveiled its first personalized
firearm in April 2023: a 9mm semiautomatic handgun. A single charge of this firearm’s battery can last
up to a month, and several alerts will notify the firearm owner before the battery fully depletes.14 In
February 2025, the Massachusetts Firearm Control Advisory Board voted to place Biofire’s personalized
firearm on the State’s Approved Firearms Roster.15
Biofire does not have access to biometric data present in its firearms, and that data are wiped when
ownership of a personalized firearm is transferred. If the owner of a Biofire personalized firearm passes
away unexpectedly and has not designated any other trusted users, the firearm can no longer be used.
While Biofire may not retain biometric data for its product, data retention remains a significant concern
should other manufacturers enter the personalized firearm market. Biofire is currently the only American
company offering personalized firearms, with only one model currently available, resulting in limited

adoption at present. Mr. Kloepfer stated to the Commission that manufacturing a personalized firearm is
four times the cost of a traditional firearm, discouraging other manufacturers from entering the market.
There was some discussion about a personalized firearm mandate; however, Mr. Kloepfer pointed out that
both Biofire’s philosophical objections and the nascence of the industry would make such a mandate
difficult to enforce.
The Commission acknowledged the degree to which personalized firearms may address gun deaths and
injuries. Personalized firearms offer the potential for safe legal gun ownership without the risk of
unauthorized discharge by children, people who want use the firearm for illicit purposes, and individuals
experiencing mental-health crises.
VI. Legislation in Other Jurisdictions
The Commission explored the laws of three states that have, as of the completion of this report, passed
legislation regarding microstamping. New Jersey, California, and New York have yet to fully implement
their microstamping requirements, but processes for doing so in all three are underway. The Commission
also reviewed New Jersey’s state law regarding personalized firearms.
New Jersey
New Jersey enacted microstamping legislation in 2022, directing the State Attorney General’s Office to
investigate the viability of microstamping technology and to designate a microstamping examiner to
create and oversee a statewide microstamp roster.16 Following enactment of the law, the Attorney General
designated the Statewide Affirmative Firearms Enforcement Office (SAFEO) to conduct the viability
investigation and further designated the Senior Investigator of SAFEO to serve as the microstamping
examiner. In 2024, the New Jersey Attorney General’s Office determined that microstamping is viable,
prompting the regulation promulgation process to begin.17 New Jersey’s statutory scheme encourages gun
manufacturers to join the state microstamping roster. In 2023, the Attorney General issued Performance
Standards and Qualifying Criteria for the microstamping examiner to use with applicant-proposed
firearms. Once the microstamping examiner approves a microstamp-enabled firearm for inclusion on the
state roster, gun retailers statewide will be required to stock at least one gun from that roster. Any person
who purchases a microstamp-enabled firearm from a licensed retail dealer shall be eligible for a rebate of
10 percent of the purchase price up to a maximum of $30. The state also established a Microstamp Fund
for law enforcement agencies to purchase microstamp-enabled firearms.
New Jersey adopted personalized firearm legislation in 2002, the Childproof Handgun Law, which
dictates that all handguns sold in the state must be personalized firearms.18 This law was revised in 2019
to require the state to develop an approved roster of personalized firearms. Following the implementation
of this roster, firearms manufacturers within the state are required to keep at least one personalized
firearm in stock.19

California first passed microstamping legislation in 2007, requiring all new handgun models
manufactured or sold in California to be equipped with microstamping technology. Legal challenges
brought by firearm manufacturers and gun rights groups, including the National Foundation for Sports
Shooting (represented on this Commission), have delayed implementation of the 2007 law.20
In 2023, California enacted a new microstamping law. Beginning January 1, 2028, licensed firearm
dealers will be prohibited from selling, offering for sale, exchanging, giving, transferring, or delivering a
semiautomatic pistol, unless the firearm has been certified as a microstamping-enabled pistol by the
pistol’s manufacturer, a licensed firearms dealer, or a gunsmith that services the pistol to install a
qualifying microstamping component – if the state’s Department of Justice (CDOJ) has determined (1)
that microstamping is technologically viable and (2) that microstamping components or microstamping-
enabled semi-automatic firearms are available.21 In July 2025, the California Attorney General’s Office
announced that the CDOJ determined that microstamping is technologically viable, satisfying the first of
the two determinations necessary for the law’s 2028 mandate to take effect.22 California’s microstamping
law further directs the CDOJ to provide written guidance by September 1, 2025, concerning qualifying
criteria and performance standards for microstamping components; to accept applications for licensure of
entities to produce the microstamping component by January 1, 2026; and to provide grants or enter into
contracts for developing and manufacturing microstamping components that meet its performance
standards and make the components available for sale or other distribution by July 1, 2026. California’s
microstamping law additionally directs the CDOJ to determine by July 1, 2027, whether microstamping
components are available at commercially reasonable prices from licensees producing microstamping
components and/or whether microstamping-enabled firearms are available for purchase in California. The
legislature empowered the CDOJ to adopt rules and regulations to carry out the law. The law further
prohibits a person from modifying a microstamping-enabled pistol or microstamping component with the
intent to prevent the production of a microstamp.
New York
New York passed a microstamping law in 2022 to require that all new semi-automatic handguns sold,
exchanged, transferred, or delivered in the state have microstamping technology in compliance with state
standards established by the Commissioner of the Division of Criminal Justice Services (DCJS).23 The
law established a statutory timeline for DCJS to investigate and certify the technological viability of
microstamped-enabled pistols, with such certification leading to a subsequent statutory timeline for DCJS
to establish performance standards, verification processes, and training and licensure for the servicing of
firearms and their components. The legislature further empowered DCJS to issue regulations to carry out

dismissed the NSFD’s 2018 challenge. A 2023 case is ongoing. See, e.g., Pena v. Lindley, No. 15-15449; Boland v.

the provisions of the law. DCJS currently is exploring the feasibility and viability of the technology.24
The anticipated annual cost to oversee the microstamping requirements is estimated to be roughly
$500,000. The law further prohibits a person from modifying a microstamping-enabled pistol or
microstamping component with the intent to prevent the production of a microstamp.
VII. Recommendations and Findings of the Commission
Microstamping
The Commission finds that microstamping technology offers a compelling possibility of contributing to
more solved firearm crimes and, as such, providing law enforcement with an additional tool for the
investigation and prosecution of firearm crimes. As such, the Commission recommends that the
Massachusetts General Court pursue microstamping legislation, modeled on the laws of California and
New York, that accomplishes the following:
1. Directs the Executive Office of Public Safety and Security (EOPSS) to determine the feasibility
and viability of microstamping technology, including a review of the recommended forensic
process to recover microstamp data from crime scene evidence and analyses of the recovery
process, required or recommended laboratory equipment needed to regenerate and/or recover
data, specialized training for forensic practitioners, and a review of the time necessary to
complete data recovery;
2. Directs EOPSS to establish standards and criteria for testing microstamp-enabled firearms;
3. Requires that all semi-automatic handguns newly registered in the Commonwealth be equipped
with microstamping technology upon a finding by EOPSS that microstamping technology meets
feasibility and viability criteria, pursuant to regulations promulgated by EOPSS;
4. Establishes penalties for handgun manufacturers, distributors, and merchants that are non-
compliant with the law;
5. Establishes penalties for individuals who tamper with microstamping technology within a
microstamp-enabled firearm;
6. Directs EOPSS to establish training and licensure for individuals and entities to service
microstamp-enabled firearms; and
7. Appropriates the funding necessary to support this work, including with for the feasibility and
viability analyses and any necessary upgrades to State data systems and lab efforts.
Personalized Firearms
The Commission finds that personalized firearms offer a significant possibility of reducing firearm
accidents and deaths. Given the higher price of these firearms, the Commissione recommends that the
Massachusetts General Court pursue sales tax exemptions to encourage their purchase. Separate
majorities of the Commission members supported creating either (1) a sales tax exemption, which sunsets
after five years, for the purchase of a personalized firearm or (2) a sales tax exemption, which sunsets
after five years, for the purchase of a personalized firearm with the trade-in of a non-personalized firearm.
In both cases, the Commission recommends the Commonwealth study the rate of personalized firearm
purchases during the sales tax exemption period.

Appendix A
Commissioner Vote Record on Final Report
13

The Chairs separated the special commission’s recommendation into three distinct recommendations and
members voted YEA or NAY on each. The specific recommendations and member votes are as follows:
Microstamping
The Commission finds that microstamping technology offers a compelling possibility of contributing to
more solved firearm crimes and, as such, providing law enforcement with an additional tool for the
investigation and prosecution of firearm crimes. As such, the Commission recommends that the
Massachusetts General Court pursue microstamping legislation, modeled on the laws of California and
New York, that accomplishes the following:
1. Directs the Executive Office of Public Safety and Security (EOPSS) to determine the feasibility
and viability of microstamping technology, including a review of the recommended forensic
process to recover microstamp data from crime scene evidence and analyses of the recovery
process, required or recommended laboratory equipment needed to regenerate and/or recover
data, specialized training for forensic practitioners, and a review of the time necessary to
complete data recovery;
2. Directs EOPSS to establish standards and criteria for testing microstamp-enabled firearms;
3. Requires that all semi-automatic handguns newly registered in the Commonwealth be equipped
with microstamping technology upon a finding by EOPSS that microstamping technology meets
feasibility and viability criteria, pursuant to regulations promulgated by EOPSS;
4. Establishes penalties for handgun manufacturers, distributors, and merchants that are non-
compliant with the law;
5. Establishes penalties for individuals who tamper with microstamping technology within a
microstamp-enabled firearm;
6. Directs EOPSS to establish training and licensure for individuals and entities to service
microstamp-enabled firearms; and
7. Appropriates the funding necessary to support this work, including for the feasibility and viability
analyses and any necessary upgrades to State data systems and lab efforts.

Personalized Firearms
The Commission finds that personalized firearms offer a significant possibility of reducing firearm
accidents and deaths. Given the higher price of these firearms, the Commissioner recommends that the
Massachusetts General Court pursue sales tax exemptions to encourage their purchase. In both cases, the
Commission recommends the Commonwealth study the rate of personalized firearm purchases during the
sales tax exemption period.
