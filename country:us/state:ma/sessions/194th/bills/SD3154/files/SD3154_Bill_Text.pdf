DRAFT Flood Risk Mapping Resource Assessment August 2025
and Recommendations: A Report to the Massachusetts Legislature
I. Introduction
Bill S.2967, An Act Promoting a Clean Energy Grid, Advancing Equity and Protecting
Ratepayers (Climate Bill), signed into law on November 20, 2024, reforms the siting and
permitting of clean energy facilities, while responsibly reforming the gas distribution system.
It vastly expands the electric vehicle (EV) charging network, incentivizes innovative
technologies such as battery storage, fusion energy, advanced metering and meter socket
adapters, includes measures to protect residents from high energy costs, and equips state
agencies with the mandate to fight climate change.1
Section 125 of the Climate Bill requires the Secretary of Energy and Environmental Affairs
(EEA) to (1) conduct a review of existing flood risk mapping resources, (2) conduct an
assessment of the need for and feasibility of creating additional flood risk mapping
resources to identify areas of vulnerability across the Commonwealth, and (3) develop
associated recommendations, including any legislation or funding necessary, to be
submitted to the legislature by August 18, 2025. Appendix A includes the full text of Section
125.
Section 125 reflects the importance of accurate and comprehensive flood hazard
information, including mapping, to support a wide range of activities. These include land use
planning, zoning, infrastructure and building siting, strategy for maintenance and retrofits,
as well as strategic initiatives to proactively address the evolving flood exposure profile of
Massachusetts’ existing building stock, infrastructure systems, and natural resources. With
comprehensive and accurate flood hazard information, these activities can minimize the
impact of flooding on Massachusetts’ housing stock, infrastructure resilience, public health,
safety, and financial security.
To provide the Massachusetts Legislature with the information required under Section 125,
this Report provides an inventory of and details the scope and limitations of existing sources
of flood risk mapping resources developed and maintained both within and outside of EEA,
summarizes ongoing initiatives to develop and / or effectively deploy additional resources,
and outlines a set of recommendations for funding necessary to effectively support these
and future efforts.
II. Review of Existing Flood Risk Mapping Resources
A multitude of flood information resources exist and are used within the Commonwealth for
various purposes related to planning, design, communication and risk mitigation. These
resources address flooding associated with groundwater, rivers and streams, stormwater or
pluvial (i.e. urban or stormwater), and coastal, tidal, and storm surges.

DRAFT Flood Risk Mapping Resource Assessment August 2025
and Recommendations: A Report to the Massachusetts Legislature
This Report identifies data that are used to calibrate and validate flood models and used to
map flooding, including data on observed precipitation, streamflow, coastal water level, and
documented flood locations. The Report also identifies resources that can be used to drive
flood model runs to map flooding for particular events of interest, for example, the 100-year
flood. Most importantly, this Report summarizes resources which map past and projected
future flood risk.
These resources are produced by federal entities, state entities, local and regional
governments, as well as private entities and nonprofit groups such as watershed
organizations. These existing resources and products have been summarized below, where
they are organized in order of the producer of each resource.
Many of the flood information resources used broadly in Massachusetts are produced or
supported by federal sources. These include resources produced by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA), the United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), the
United States Geological Survey (USGS), the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration (NOAA), and others. Several of these federal flood risk information products
and supporting resources are under active development and their future release date is
unknown. A number of flood information resources are produced within the Executive Office
of Energy and Environmental Affairs and other state agencies, such as the Massachusetts
Department of Transportation (MassDOT). Flood risk mapping resources are also produced
by local entities, regional government entities, and nonprofit organizations such as
watershed groups. These flood information resources reflect the special capabilities,
capacity, and resources available to their producer, such as local knowledge or insights,
expertise, and federal resources and standards.
A. Federally-Produced Resources
i. NOAA and USGS: Tide Stations
NOAA and USGS maintain tidal monitoring stations at coastal locations nationwide,
including several in and near Massachusetts’ coast. Data from the tide stations (6 NOAA, 4
USGS) are collected and posted publicly in real time; data may be publicly displayed as
“provisional” until they have been reviewed and quality-checked. Tide station data include
long-term coastal water level time series. In addition, NOAA provides mean sea level
estimates and other information on water level variability and record highs and lows.
Page 4

and Recommendations: A Report to the Massachusetts Legislature
Figure 1: (a) NOAA Tide Gage Locations by Data Monitored; (b) USGS Tide Gage
Locations
These data are useful for understanding trends in sea level and tidal variability,
understanding how storms affect coastal water levels (surge), and supporting coastal flood
model development.
ii. USGS: Hydrologic Monitoring Network, High Water Marks and
StreamStats Application
USGS monitors
precipitation,
streamflow and
groundwater at over 200
locations throughout
Massachusetts funded
cooperatively by EEA and
USGS. In addition, as
part of the streamflow
monitoring program,
USGS collects high
water marks during and
after flood events.
Measured data is shown
on the website in real
time; data may be
shown as provisional
until they have been Figure 2: USGS Stream Gage Locations
Page 5

DRAFT Flood Risk Mapping Resource Assessment August 2025
and Recommendations: A Report to the Massachusetts Legislature
quality-reviewed, which
typically happens within
weeks and up to a few
months.
These data are used for
critical operational
purposes such as weather
and flooding forecasting,
dam management and
drought monitoring. These
data are also the basis of
numerous special studies,
models and tools that serve
to understand and adapt to
a changing climate
including intense and
erosive precipitation Figure 3: USGS Groundwater Monitoring Locations By Monitoring Type
events, flash flooding, and (real-time data collection vs. discrete measurements)
flash droughts. Other
important functions that the state performs and for which data are critical include the
determination of Total Maximum Daily Loads (TMDLs) for polluted water bodies;
implementation of the Wetlands Protection Act (WPA); implementation of the National
Pollutant Discharge Elimination
System (NPDES) permitting; water
allocation decisions; design of
roads, culverts, bridges, and septic
systems; design and review of
stormwater management systems,
among others.
USGS also maintains a StreamStats
tool that allows users to view
streamflow statistics, including
flood flow statistics, at any location
on a river or stream in
Massachusetts. These streamflow
statistics can be used as inputs to
models that generate maps of
riverine flooding for particular flood
flow return periods (e.g. 100-year
flood, 50-year flood). This tool does
not currently provide climate-
informed streamflow statistics.
Figure 4: StreamStats Tool Example Watershed Delineation StreamStats can be used to identify
Page 6

DRAFT Flood Risk Mapping Resource Assessment August 2025
and Recommendations: A Report to the Massachusetts Legislature
streamflow statistics which reflect patterns of streamflow, but do not account for trends in
streamflow over time or future climate change influence on streamflow.
iii. NOAA: Atlas 14
NOAA publishes a nation-wide atlas of precipitation frequency relationships. NOAA Atlas 14
is the latest federal data source of this variety. The statistical estimates published in NOAA
Atlas 14 are based on precipitation gage data collected through the period of record, up until
2012. NOAA Atlas 14 Volume 10, which covers northeastern states including
Massachusetts, was published in 2015 and revised in 2019. Precipitation frequency data
relate precipitation depths (amount of precipitation, typically in inches) by location,
duration, and chance of occurrence. Estimates of the depth of precipitation within a
particular duration (e.g. two hours, 24 hours, etc.) that has a particular chance of occurrence
or exceedance each year are used in a broad variety of design and risk assessment contexts.
The estimates assume the chance of extreme precipitation with a particular depth and
duration are static and have not changed over time.
Funded by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, NOAA has been developing an Atlas 15 which
would (a) account for trends in extreme precipitation during the period for which gages have
been collecting precipitation data until present, and (b) develop a methodology for adjusting
extreme precipitation frequency relationships to account for future trends and climate
change. Precipitation frequency relationship resources can be used to drive flood models
and map flooding which would occur under particular precipitation events.
iv. USACE: National Levee Database
USACE maintains a database on all known levees in the United States. The database
includes information on levee age and condition, as well as the areas, populations, and
assets protected by levees. The data is updated continuously in cooperation with federal,
state, tribal, and local agencies.
The database is useful for flood risk management and for configuring hydraulic models that
may be used to map flooding.
v. USACE: National Inventory of Dams and Dam Inundation Mapping
USACE maintains a database of dams nationwide, including both federal- and state-
regulated dams with either high hazard potential, significant hazard potential, or dams that
meet specific height and reservoir size requirements. The majority of dams in the database
are state-regulated. The database is continually updated in cooperation with outside
entities, primarily state dam regulating entities such as the Massachusetts Office of Dam
Safety, to improve its completeness.
Page 7

DRAFT Flood Risk Mapping Resource Assessment August 2025
and Recommendations: A Report to the Massachusetts Legislature
The database includes an interactive web tool allowing users to view areas which could be
inundated if the dam were to malfunction or fail for some dams in the database. Not all dams
(especially smaller dams) are included in the database, and not all dams in the database are
associated with inundation maps in the tool.
Dams included in the database may be used to support development of hydrologic and/or
hydraulic models which are used to map riverine flooding. The dam inundation mapping in
the database, when available, may be used to understand places that could be at risk of
flooding in the event of dam failure.
vi. FEMA: Flood Insurance Studies
FEMA Flood Insurance Studies (FIS) are detailed reports on flood studies conducted by
FEMA or in compliance with FEMA standards to map FEMA flood zones. The studies, typically
conducted by county, contain more detailed information on flood risk than typically provided
in FEMA flood maps. FIS can be consulted individually by county through FEMA’s Map
Service Center. FIS are paper or pdf documents that include some technical engineering
maps and cross sections of flood depths at different points along a river or coast. FIS are
typically conducted and updated county by county. Once published, FIS remain effective for
decades. The currently effective FIS in several western Massachusetts counties were
published in the 1980s. Estimates of the 100-year and 500-year flood flow in FIS reports are
based on variable periods of record. For example, the FIS for Deerfield, MA uses Deerfield
River streamflow records which begin in 1914 at one gage and 1941 at a second gage; the
study does not reflect any streamflow data or flood events occurring after 1980, when the
study was published. Flood flow estimates in the Essex County FIS, revised 2025, are based
on 14-84 year records from several stream gages for which records exit. Streamflow records
used in the study begin at points between 1931 through 2001; flood events and stream gage
data collected after 2015 were not considered.
These graphics, tables, and charts may be consulted by technical experts to derive forcing
scenarios for coastal storm surge and/or riverine flood modeling and mapping. Technical
experts may also use the FIS to develop an understanding of coastal or riverine flood risk at
a particular point in space.
vii. FEMA: National Flood Hazard Layer
The National Flood Hazard Layer (NFHL) is a geospatial database containing maps of flood
hazard areas identified through FEMA FIS and Letters of Map Change (LOMC). The maps
delineate areas exposed to a 1% annual chance (100-year flood) and 0.2% annual chance
(500-year flood) coastal or river flood, as well as several technical/regulatory zones within
these categories. The floods are mapped using estimates of the chance of flooding based on
past sea levels and precipitation and streamflow patterns. However, they do not account for
sea level rise or trends in precipitation or streamflow and do not account for future climate
change influence on sea levels, precipitation, and streamflow. The products do not map
Page 8

DRAFT Flood Risk Mapping Resource Assessment August 2025
and Recommendations: A Report to the Massachusetts Legislature
flooding on small streams. The maps also do not represent pluvial (urban or stormwater)
flooding that is caused by high rates of precipitation away from streams and rivers.
Haz
Figure 5: National Flood Hazard Layer detail; Boston Harbor
FEMA updates the NFHL continuously as new FIS studies and updates are completed. A
cohesive version of the NFHL for Massachusetts is hosted at MassGIS and updated upon
request; typically several years apart.
The FEMA National Flood Hazard Layer is an important digital spatial data resource that
maps two levels of riverine or coastal storm surge flood risk in a way that is broadly
accessible. While the primary use case for this dataset is flood insurance regulatory
information and support, the dataset is also used broadly for understanding areas exposed
to river and storm surge flood risk.
viii. FEMA: Non-Regulatory Products
FEMA has initiated an effort to publish additional flood map datasets as non-regulatory
products that are not used in insurance determinations. These products include mapped
flood depth and flood velocity digital spatial datasets based on modeling. Through the Future
of Flood Risk Data Initiative, FEMA may continue to expand these offerings with additional
spatial coverage and additional types of mapped flood data and mapped flood scenarios
provided as raster and network datasets.
These products include maps of riverine and coastal storm surge flood extent and depth for
a variety of forcing scenarios. Some products may also map the chance of flooding over
Page 9

DRAFT Flood Risk Mapping Resource Assessment August 2025
and Recommendations: A Report to the Massachusetts Legislature
space. The products are under development, though none have been developed for
Massachusetts at this time.
B. State-Produced Resources
i. EEA: MyCoast King Tide and Coastal Storm Reports
In 2009, the Massachusetts Office of Coastal Zone Management (CZM) standardized real-
time reporting of moderate to major coastal storm damages with the development of an
online form and database for the Massachusetts Rapid Response Coastal Storm Damage
Assessment Team. In 2013-2014, the MyCoast platform was launched with mobile
applications to more broadly collect photos and document flooding and other impacts from
coastal storms and King Tides (or higher than normal tides). The crowd-sourced database
includes locations and water levels of impacts. MyCoast data on damages to infrastructure,
homes, businesses, and natural resources is used to inform emergency response and
recovery, weather warnings and forecasts, scientific studies and modeling (e.g., storm surge
and wave overtopping of seawalls), and resilience planning and projects. While MyCoast has
over 1,500 registered users along the Massachusetts coast, additional coverage is needed
to support and validate mapping of riverine flooding, pluvial (urban or stormwater) flooding,
tidal river flooding, and coastal compound flooding. The MyCoast platform does not contain
any information on storm and flood impacts outside of the coastal region.

Page 10

DRAFT Flood Risk Mapping Resource Assessment August 2025
and Recommendations: A Report to the Massachusetts Legislature
Reports of flooding in the database may be used to support the development and validation
of coastal storm surge flood models which map coastal storm surge flood risk, riverine flood
models which map riverine flood risk in coastal areas, and stormwater models which map
pluvial flood risk in coastal areas. The flood reports in the database may also be used to
support the development and validation of flood models that represent interactions
between each type of flooding (“compound flooding”) which map compound flood risk in
coastal areas.
ii.Statewide Flooding and Environmental Justice Vulnerability Assessment
This project involves collecting existing spatial flood risk information from a variety of
sources, including the Massachusetts Coast Flood Risk Model (MC-FRM), FEMA flood maps,
and local stormwater modeling studies and knowledge, and engaging with municipalities
that contain state-designated Environmental Justice (EJ) neighborhoods to characterize past
flooding, understand flood issues and potential flood mitigation strategies in those
communities through a community-driven framework.

Page 11

DRAFT Flood Risk Mapping Resource Assessment August 2025
and Recommendations: A Report to the Massachusetts Legislature
This project involved collecting modeled, documented, and crowd-sourced areas prone to
flooding into a GIS dataset which is framed in a web map product. The dataset combines
existing modeled coastal flooding, riverine flooding, and pluvial flooding extents created
through a variety of modeling studies such as FEMA flood maps, MC-FRM products, and
local/regional hydrologic and hydraulic model studies. Documented flood-prone areas
produced for municipal Hazard Mitigation Plans, compiled by municipal committees that
typically include emergency services, public works, and/or city or town engineers are also
included. Lastly, the data products include the results of a map-based survey distributed to
participating communities to further identify locations known for flooding.
These data products are useful for understanding vulnerabilities to flooding at the local level,
where flooding may occur in the future as identified through the localized studies
incorporated, and for identifying and prioritizing areas for flood mitigation. The data products
are also useful supporting resources for flood modelling projects that seek to expand upon
the types of flooding and scenarios depicted in FEMA flood maps (FEMA maps display
modeled riverine and coastal flood areas based on historically based static estimates of
flood probability). Documented areas of past flooding collected through this project,
especially areas of stormwater flooding, can be used to calibrate and validate hydrologic
and hydraulic flood models which are used to generate flood maps, especially those
mapping future flood conditions and stormwater flooding away from rivers, streams, and
coastal water bodies. The mapped flood areas collected through this project will be used in
several ongoing state flood modelling projects.
iii.EEA: Temperature and Precipitation Projections
In the Climate and Hydrologic Risk Project, EEA collaborated with researchers at USGS, Tufts
University, and Cornell University to develop resources to help EEA better understand
evolving hydrologic risks under future climate conditions. Phase 1 of this project developed
temperature and precipitation projections at a Massachusetts watershed scale.
Page 12

DRAFT Flood Risk Mapping Resource Assessment August 2025
and Recommendations: A Report to the Massachusetts Legislature
The projections are based on Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) 5 climate
modeling experiments. Projections based on the greenhouse gas Representative
Concentration Pathway (RCP) 8.5 are posted publicly; projected statistics for RCP 4.5 are
available upon request. They cover four future decades and include temperature and
precipitation statistics representing average conditions as well as how both high and low
extremes (cold and extreme heat; drought and heavy precipitation) may change in the future.
The projected statistics are applicable to a wide variety of climate adaptation applications.

and Recommendations: A Report to the Massachusetts Legislature
The projected precipitation design storms are a key input to mapping future precipitation-
driven flooding, including both riverine and pluvial flooding. These projected values may also
be used to map compound riverine/storm surge flood scenarios and/or stormwater/coastal
storm surge flood scenarios.
iv.EEA: Dam Inundation Mapping
Massachusetts Dam Safety Regulations, promulgated by the Massachusetts Department of
Conservation and Recreation (DCR) Office of Dam Safety, require owners of Significant and
High Hazard Dams to prepare Emergency Action Plans (EAPs). The Office of Dam Safety has
jurisdiction over dams which are not federally owned. “High Hazard Dams” are dams for
which dam failure or mis-operation would likely cause loss of life. “Significant Hazard Dams”
are dams for which dam failure or mis-operation would likely not cause loss of life, but could
cause economic losses, disrupt lifeline facilities, cause environmental damage, or other
important impacts. EAPs must contain dam failure inundation maps, which identify areas
downstream that could be impacted by flooding in the event of a dam failure under different
scenarios.
The High Hazard Potential Dam (HHPD) EAP is required to provide both a “Sunny Day” and
“Wet Weather” Scenario inundation mapping. The term “Sunny Day” scenario represents
failure or mis-operation impacts when the dam is storing a normal amount of water (“normal
pool”) and there is no streamflow at the dam at the time of failure or mis-operation. The term
“Wet Weather” scenario refers to conditions in which dam failure or mis-operation occurs
during the dam’s design peak streamflow with correlating streamflow downstream of the
dam. The Significant Hazard Potential Dam (SHPD) EAP inundation mapping is a result of a
“Max Pool” Scenario, where the dam is storing the maximum amount of water (filled to the
top of the embankment) and allowed to fail, with no streamflow downstream of the dam prior
to the dam’s failure or mis-operation. These inundation maps are available in the PDF or
paper EAP documents and are available to emergency managers and MEMA. They are not
posted publicly, though members of the general public can access EAPs via public
information request.
The Office of Dam Safety is in the process of digitizing EAP inundation maps into digital
spatial datasets.
v.MassDOT: Flood Risk Assessment
MassDOT has an ongoing project (also sometimes referenced as the Climate Adaptation and
Vulnerability Assessment (CAVA)) that includes modeling projected riverine flooding to
quantify risks to a range of critical transportation assets and support identification and
prioritization of capital resiliency investments. The project involves modeling streamflow
and flow statistics for all Strahler order 2 + rivers and streams in the state, and modeling the
hydraulics (flow dynamics, flood velocity, and flood inundation) at regular intervals along the
stream network and in the immediate vicinity of each asset in the project. The modeling uses
Page 14

DRAFT Flood Risk Mapping Resource Assessment August 2025
and Recommendations: A Report to the Massachusetts Legislature
climate change inputs recommended by the Federal Highway Administration, that are based
on the 50th percentile of the RCP 8.5 ensemble and the 90th percentile of the RCP 4.5
ensemble, to model future riverine flooding outcomes under a range of future decades and
design storms. The project is complete for three watersheds comprising approximately 10%
of the state and is proceeding for the remainder of the state.
Products from the project include:
• Estimates of future flood flows for all Strahler order 2+ streams for a range of time
horizons and return periods
• Maps of riverine flood depth, flood extent, flood elevation, and erosion hazard along
Strahler order 2+ streams for a range of time horizons and return periods
• Quantification of transportation asset exposure and risk, and identification of higher-
risk assets
• Methodologies for evaluating the cost-effectiveness of resilience solutions and case
study applications at a range of assets
vi.MassDOT and EEA: Massachusetts Coast Flood Risk Model Data Products
The MC-FRM was commissioned by MassDOT and developed by the Woods Hole Group
(WHG) to understand future coastal flood risks to transportation assets under higher future
sea levels and enhanced coastal storm scenarios. CZM subsequently worked with WHG to
produce publicly facing data layers, maps, and training materials for broader application and
coastal risk management. The model was used to create high-resolution flood maps across
the entire Massachusetts coast that demonstrate (a) annual probabilities of coastal storm
flooding, and (b) elevations and depths of flooding expected for several specified coastal
flood return periods under three future time periods and sea level rise combination
scenarios. The model also produced several outputs related to shorelines and wave action
for technical users. While focused on sea level rise and storm surge, MC-FRM also
incorporates freshwater discharge at major estuarine rivers. The model does not currently
include several other important drivers of coastal flooding which interact with sea level rise

flooding in Boston Harbor communities under a 2050 sea level scenario.

and storm surge flooding such as stormwater (pluvial) flooding or groundwater changes
under future sea level.
Several state web pages and tools feature MC-FRM-based maps which, under several future
sea level scenarios, include maps representing coastal storm surge flood probability and
depth of flooding for selected flood risk levels.
C. Regional and Local Resources
i.Municipal Governments: Locally Identified Flood Areas
Municipalities are required to produce local Hazard Mitigation Plans (HMPs) in order to be
eligible for FEMA funding; the HMPs must be updated every five years. The HMPs must
include assessments and mapping of a variety of natural hazards that impact or could
conceivably impact the municipality and prioritize actions to address these hazards. Part of
Page 16

DRAFT Flood Risk Mapping Resource Assessment August 2025
and Recommendations: A Report to the Massachusetts Legislature
the process involves documenting areas known to municipal staff to be flood prone.
Municipal and community surveys on flood-prone locations are also sometimes issued by
watershed organizations and other regional entities.
Maps of flood-prone areas are useful for targeting flood risk management measures; they
may also be used in calibration of flood models. These HMPs may be posted on municipal
websites and from the Massachusetts Emergency Management Agency (MEMA) by request.
Locally identified flood area maps in HMPs are available in paper report or pdf report format.
Spatial data for use in other mapping or analysis applications may be available by request
from the HMP producer (typically a private consulting firm, a Regional Planning Agency
(RPA), or in some cases municipal staff).
ii.Various Local and Regional Entities: Local and Regional Stormwater Studies
Several municipalities, coalitions of municipalities, and other regional entities such as
watershed organizations have been conducting their own flood studies to map river and/or
stormwater flooding in their area. The studies are conducted with a range of goals, which
include mapping flooding for planning purposes, understanding how to mitigate flooding,
and others. The studies use a wide range of modeling methods and model a wide range of
scenarios, including scenarios based on projected climate change.
Various geospatial datasets and web maps/tools displaying modeled flooding resulting from
these studies are available publicly or by request. Some examples include products
developed by the Charles River Watershed Association, Franklin Regional Council of
Governments, city of Medford, Mystic River Watershed Association, Neponset River
Watershed Association, and the Metropolitan Area Planning Council.
III.Ongoing State Projects and Initiatives
EEA, in coordination with the Resilient Massachusetts Action Team (RMAT), has conducted
several initiatives which serve to further assess and characterize the state’s existing flood
risk mapping resources and the need for additional products. These include the
development of the 2022 Massachusetts Climate Change Assessment, the 2023
ResilientMass Plan, and engagement supporting the development of the Climate Resilience
Design Standards Tool, which allows users to screen proposed projects for exposure to
mapped climate risks including flooding.
In addition, EEA is currently conducting four initiatives that, combined with the completed
initiatives mentioned above, provide the inputs to this Report.

A. Streamflow Projections and Temperature and Precipitation
Projections Update
Summary
In Phase 2 of the Climate and Hydrologic Risk Project, EEA is updating projected
temperature, precipitation, and streamflow statistics for Massachusetts. The project relies
on meteorological and streamflow monitoring data from federal sources, such as the USGS
stream gage data. Phase 1 of the project developed the projected temperature and
precipitation statistics that were used in the 2022 MA Climate Change Assessment.
Phase 2, currently underway, and a first-in-the-nation effort, will update the projected
temperature and precipitation projections and produce streamflow projections for the first
time in Massachusetts.
Phase 2 involves several methodological improvements relative to Phase 1:
• Phase 2 projections are based on the latest generation of climate model simulations
from CMIP 6. Phase 1 projected temperature and precipitation statistics were based
on CMIP 5.
• Inclusion of additional greenhouse gas concentration scenarios (SSP 5-4.5; SSP
3-7.0; SSP 5-8.5)
• Climate model ensemble downscaled to local conditions using improved statistical
downscaling technique which better accounts for precipitation extremes relative to
statistical downscaling method available in Phase 1
• Improved cutting-edge post-processing technique used to generate projected
statistics, which will account for both thermodynamic changes (change in average
temperature and impact on extreme precipitation) and dynamic changes to
Massachusetts climate (accounting for large-scale shifts in weather regimes
affecting Massachusetts derived from climate model simulations)
• Improved spatial resolution in the resulting projections
Relevant Products
This project will produce updated temperature and precipitation statistics to reflect the most
recent generation of climate model simulations from CMIP6 and add several new projected
meteorological and hydrological statistics to the products. These include:
• Twenty-one new temperature or precipitation statistics
• Peak streamflow statistics, including the discharge of the 2-, 5-, 10-, 25-, 50-, 100-,
200-, and 500-year return period flood flows
• Low flow streamflow statistics, including the 7-day 10-year low flow and the 7-day
2-year low flow
Page 18

DRAFT Flood Risk Mapping Resource Assessment August 2025
and Recommendations: A Report to the Massachusetts Legislature
When complete, these projected streamflow statistics (e.g. 2050 100-year flood flow, in
cubic feet per second) may be used to model riverine flooding under projected future
scenarios. The projected design precipitation values (e.g. 2050 24-hour 100-year
precipitation depth) can be used as key inputs to riverine and pluvial (urban or stormwater)
modeling and mapping studies, as well as compound flood modeling and mapping studies.
Timeline
The project will conclude mid-2026.

C. Groundwater Flooding Risk Assessment and Mapping
Summary
With increasing precipitation and sea level rise, groundwater elevations are rising and are
projected to continue to rise under climate change. Groundwater rise impacts include
flooding of basements, septic systems, water and wastewater infrastructure, and
underground utilities; damage to foundations; destabilization of roads; mobilization of
historical subsurface contamination; and drowning of agricultural lands and forests. DCR
engaged with the University of Massachusetts at Amherst and developed an initial statewide
groundwater model to estimate average annual, historical and future groundwater depths
across the state (except the Islands) based on 70 groundwater monitoring points. The
Massachusetts projections of future precipitation (derived from the Climate and Hydrologic
Risk Phase 1 project) were used to define future increases in recharge. Sea level rise
projections were from the same data source as the one used for the MC-FRM.
Relevant Products
The project will produce maps and GIS layers of (a) depth to water categories across the
state under historical and potential future recharge and sea level scenarios, and (b) areas
where the estimated groundwater levels are likely to cause impacts. Impacts under each
scenario are assessed for different land uses such as farmland and forests, basements and
subsurface infrastructure based on building footprints, and EJ populations.
The project will produce maps of estimated groundwater depth categories under current and
future conditions showing locations of potential flooding. The project’s estimated
groundwater levels could also serve as key driving inputs to river and pluvial (urban or
stormwater) modeling and mapping studies. Future phases may incorporate flood location
insights from the Flooding and Environmental Justice project.
Timeline
Products and reports are expected in December 2025.

D. Riverine and Pluvial Flood Modeling and Mapping
Summary
This project is a collaborative effort between EEA and the USGS. The most publicly available
flood maps, produced by FEMA for the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), represent
riverine and coastal flood areas based on static, unchanging estimates of coastal flood risk.
Flood maps which reflect trends in flooding, future flooding, and pluvial (urban/stormwater)
flooding away from rivers and streams are necessary to support comprehensive flood risk
management and climate adaptation in Massachusetts.
This project aims to develop methods and standards for flood risk modeling and mapping to
identify areas vulnerable to current and future flooding across the Commonwealth. The
project will pilot those methods in several hydrologically diverse locations, refine the
methods based on findings from the pilot, and in FY 2027 will deploy the methods in some
parts of the Commonwealth, as feasible within project budget and based on findings from
the pilot phase.
The project’s direction is heavily informed by a User Advisory Group and a Technical Advisory
Group. The User Advisory Group is representative of the likely user audience for flood map
products, such as representatives from multiple state agencies, nonprofit organizations,
regional entities, and private engineering consultants. The Technical Advisory Group is
composed of flood modelling and flood mapping experts from diverse backgrounds,
including federal agencies such as USGS, FEMA, and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers
(USACE); state agencies, academia, private research and development, and private
engineering consultants. The project will incorporate and map flooding caused by the
projected peak flow statistics and projections developed through the Climate and
Hydrologic Risk Project, Phase 2. Flood location insights from the Flooding and
Environmental Justice project and any other documented past flood location mapping will
be used to validate modelling conducted in this project.
Relevant Products
A key outcome of this project is insights from engaging with a broad range of flood map users
at the local and regional level around needs for projected river and stormwater flood maps
and data. The project will produce tiered modeling standards, each tier requiring
increasingly detailed levels of data inputs, for riverine and pluvial flooding, guidelines on
selecting a modeling standard tier, and riverine and pluvial flood maps across key
watersheds in the state.
Timeline
The project launched in June 2024 and will end in mid-2027.

E. Planning and Coordination: Coastal Flooding Strategy
Summary
To facilitate planning and coordination along the coastal zone, the ResilientCoasts Initiative
was launched by EEA’s Coastal Zone Management Office in November 2023 to develop a
comprehensive framework for coastal resilience. This effort is mapping vulnerability and risk
across the coast, identifying Coastal Resilience Districts, providing guidance on place-
based coastal resilience measures, and recommendations for coastwide strategies.
ResilientCoasts relies on the MC-FRM, which is a dynamic model developed for the
Commonwealth to project impacts of coastal flooding accounting for sea level rise this
century. Data products used in ResilientCoasts Phase I include the probability of flooding in
each year (present day, 2030, 2050, and 2070) and water depths associated with the 1%
(100-year), 0.5% (200-year), and 0.1% (1000-year) annual exceedance probability levels.
Relevant Products
The project involves broad engagement, which will identify (1) existing flood risk mapping
resources and (2) the need for additional resources. Related work involves development of
additional geospatial data on future mean high-water shorelines, which could be used to
map future inundation under higher sea levels.
Timeline
The ResilientCoasts Draft Plan was released in May 2025 for public review and comment.
The plan will be finalized and released in the Fall of 2025. All final data layers associated with
the plan will be made publicly available via an online map viewer. Additional MC-FRM
products to support place-based coastal resilience measures including future mean high-
water shorelines are being developed and are expected to be available Fall 2025.
F. Planning and Coordination: Floodplain Framework Development
Summary
This interagency coordination initiative led by Massachusetts Water Resources
Commission’s floodplain management staff brings together staff across state agencies and
executive offices who are involved in floodplain planning and development, flood risk
management, flood recovery, and flood response for all types of flooding. The project
synthesized state entity knowledge, practice, needs, and goals for floodplain management
Page 22

DRAFT Flood Risk Mapping Resource Assessment August 2025
and Recommendations: A Report to the Massachusetts Legislature
and in the coming years seeks to operationalize an inter-agency framework around
floodplain management.
Relevant Products
This effort will generate a report that outlines potential coordination and management
strategies and include examination of existing resources, regulations, and policies. Over the
next year, the project will also define roles and responsibilities for the numerous actions
required to steward floodplains in general and will include floodplain restoration priorities as
well as flood mitigation priorities.
Timeline
The project was launched in 2024. Phase I concluded in FY25; Phase II will begin in 2026.
IV. Assessment of Needs/Feasibility of Developing New
Flood Risk Mapping Resources and Recommendations
As outlined above, over the past five years the state has made several investments in studies
and projects that have resulted in a better understanding and characterization of
precipitation and floods in Massachusetts. The products that have been generated are being
used in state-, regional- and municipal-level planning. Several past and ongoing initiatives at
EEA have assessed the need for additional flood information resources or are in the process
of doing so. However, more of such efforts are needed to fully characterize floods and
develop tools and resources at more local scales to help with planning, design, and
development of mitigation strategies to deal with floods.
This section provides an overview of possible additional risk assessment, modeling, and
mapping resources that could aid in the understanding and mitigation of coastal, riverine,
pluvial, and groundwater flooding and their combined effects.
A. Consolidated Database of Past Flood Locations; Development of
an Online Reporting Tool for Crowd-Sourcing Real-Time Flood
Locations
Needs
Cataloguing location and extent of flooding at the local scale as it occurs and characterizing
the extent of impacts and losses helps to inform the state’s understanding of flood risk and
Page 23

DRAFT Flood Risk Mapping Resource Assessment August 2025
and Recommendations: A Report to the Massachusetts Legislature
impacts. Records of past flooding are important resources for calibrating and validating
flood models, especially models which map stormwater (pluvial) flooding that occurs away
from rivers and streams. Currently, the MyCoast King Tide and Coastal Storm Reporter tool
addresses this need in the Commonwealth’s coastal areas and the MassDOT App targets
flooding which occurs at the agency’s infrastructure, but there is no statewide tool for
collecting flood impact reports as they occur and no comprehensive statewide database of
past flood locations. Flood reports in the tool/database could be used to support disaster
assistance requests, identify priorities for flood mitigation and minimization, and support
flood modeling studies.
Conversations on this need and potential next steps have begun among EEA staff; however,
no funding has yet been identified or project scoped.
Recommendations
1. Develop a statewide online flood reporting tool
2. Collect and standardize locally identified flood area digital GIS data from municipal
Hazard Mitigation Plans and enhanced by any other local lived experience; post this GIS
resource on state web platforms such as MassGIS
B. Statewide Riverine Flood Mapping Products
Needs
Across the Commonwealth there is a need for uniform and complete riverine flood maps
statewide. In addition to uniform coverage and quality statewide which is necessary for
policy and planning purposes, it is important to many applications of riverine flood mapping
that riverine flood maps are up to date, cover rivers and streams of smaller drainage area,
and include a wide range of flood return periods and climate change scenarios. These needs
have been identified through the development of a MEPA resiliency policy, the ongoing
development of guidance for siting clean energy infrastructure and housing, 2022 MA
Climate Change Assessment, the 2023 ResilientMass plan, the development and periodic
re-assessment of the Climate Resilience Design Standards tool, and through other
initiatives. The needs have been further defined and clarified through initial engagement for
the Riverine and Pluvial Flood Mapping project.
FEMA flood hazard areas map the 100- and 500-year flood areas based on past estimates of
flood risk. The 100-year flood area and FEMA 100-year flood elevations are the basis of many
existing regulations, including local floodplain ordinances and elevation requirements in
building code. FEMA provides Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs), available throughout
Massachusetts, which can be used to determine whether a site or building is located within
a flood hazard area. FEMA also provides a FEMA National Flood Hazard Layer (NFHL), which
maps some of the FEMA flood hazard areas in Massachusetts in a digital format suitable for
Page 24

DRAFT Flood Risk Mapping Resource Assessment August 2025
and Recommendations: A Report to the Massachusetts Legislature
web mapping. Other flood hazard areas can only be identified by consulting location-
specific FIRMs in paper or pdf format. Approximate digitizations of these paper flood maps
exist in these areas, but these may not include full flood zone designation detail and are not
suitable for site-specific determinations. Other areas of the state not yet covered by the
NFHL are the subject of recent FEMA flood studies which have not yet been approved by the
community. It is important to expand the National Flood Hazard Layer to cover all of
Massachusetts so that the impacts of proposed policy based on FEMA flood zone
designations may be studied and quantified, for local and community planning purposes,
and for individuals’ awareness of local flood hazard.
Because FEMA flood hazard areas are the basis of many policies and regulations which seek
to protect the Commonwealth from flood damage, but FEMA flood hazard areas are based
on past estimates of flood risk, it is also important to develop flood maps which account for
future increases in flooding and area in floodplains under climate change. While mapping
future 100-year flood elevations is important, it is a time-consuming and expensive
endeavor. In the meantime, existing FEMA 500-year flood areas and elevations could serve
as a proxy for greater area exposed to the 100-year flood in the future. While the National
Flood Hazard Layer does not contain 500-year flood elevations, augmenting existing maps
of 500-year flood areas with elevations from FEMA Flood Insurance Studies would be
feasible to achieve within a shorter time frame as a temporary proxy and basis of flood
adaptation.
Two ongoing projects highlighted above also address part of this need - the ongoing Climate
and Hydrologic Risk Project Phase II will develop projected design flood discharge; and the
Riverine and Pluvial flood mapping project which will model how projected design flood
discharge translates to flood extent (area of floodplains) and depth. However, the project
does not have sufficient funding to provide statewide riverine flood mapping coverage. Even
with funding available, achieving uniform statewide coverage would be a lengthy process.
Recommendations
1. Extend the Riverine and Pluvial Flood Mapping project to achieve full statewide
coverage
2. Support FEMA Flood Insurance Study (FIS) updates, particularly in Hampshire,
Hampden, Franklin, and Berkshire counties
3. Sustain, or if possible, expand funding for MassGIS and EOEEA GIS software and
personnel to ensure timely updates and functioning web map and data services
4. Develop publicly available resources for flood elevation of FEMA 500-year flood
areas
5, Continue funding for river and stream gages statewide. Fund the addition of new river
and stream gages at key gaps in the monitoring network for better model calibration
and validation.

C. Statewide Pluvial (Stormwater) Flood Mapping Products
Needs
Stormwater flood maps exist piecemeal statewide as the result of local and regional
modeling projects; however, coverage is very limited spatially and the modeling methods
and modeled scenarios vary widely. Pluvial flood data products that map a wide range of
storm scenarios and return periods, map climate change scenarios, and which are produced
using a standard set of methods are needed. This need for pluvial flooding was identified
through the 2022 MA Climate Change Assessment and 2023 ResilientMass plan, the
development and periodic reassessment of the Climate Resilience Design Standards tool
(used for screening projects for climate risks and making initial climate-informed design
recommendations), in the Floodplain Framework effort, and other initiatives. The needs
were further refined and clarified through initial engagement for the Riverine and Pluvial
Flood Mapping project.
The ability to provide statewide pluvial flood mapping products is contingent on several
ongoing products, including (1) the ongoing Climate and Hydrologic Risk Project Phase II,
which will develop projected design precipitation events, and (2) the Riverine and Pluvial
Flood Mapping project, which will establish a standard for pluvial flood mapping and develop
pluvial flood maps in several locations within the Commonwealth. However, the project
does not have sufficient funding to provide statewide pluvial flood mapping coverage, and
the lack of detailed digitized stormwater infrastructure information statewide limits the
ability to map flood risk accounting for this infrastructure.
Recommendations
1. Support the development of municipal stormwater infrastructure data through a
grant program, potentially as part of an existing related program. These data are key
inputs for pluvial flood modeling which require information on stormwater
infrastructure location, elevation, shape, and size. Municipalities rarely have these
data available (i.e., they mostly only have location data) in an electronic/digitized
form.
2. Extend the Riverine and Pluvial Flood Mapping project to achieve greater statewide
coverage of pluvial flooding. We also recommend providing the modeling standards
produced through the project as part of state solicitation materials for grants that
fund flood studies so that all such flood studies are compatible and can be integrated
into statewide flooding platform produced through the Riverine and Pluvial Flood
Mapping project
Page 26

and Recommendations: A Report to the Massachusetts Legislature
D. Coastal Flood Mapping Products
Needs
The ResilientCoasts Initiative and other statewide initiatives, such as MassDEP’s wetlands
regulations update process, identified several needs regarding coastal flood mapping
resources:
• Additional technical analysis to improve and update MC-FRM with additional data
and information
• Incorporation of coastal water conduit and infrastructure in the MC-FRM to better
reflect the hydraulics and extent of coastal flooding in future coastal flood maps
• Regularly update MC-FRM so that it may be more suitable as a basis for coastal
regulations
• Mapping of compound flood risk that can be incorporated into later phases of
ResilientCoasts and used to update municipal and regional flood risk2
Recommendations
1. Conduct additional technical analysis to improve and update the MC-FRM with additional
data and information. Update the MC-FRM with additional water infrastructure
information and future coastal flooding.
E. Statewide Groundwater Flood Mapping Products
Needs
Initial results from the Statewide Groundwater Flooding Risk Assessment and Mapping
project established that modeling at the statewide scale with a static groundwater model
that estimates average annual levels yields too much uncertainty to provide design
appropriate estimates of current and future groundwater levels. There is a need for
statewide, groundwater flood mapping products that are of sufficient temporal and spatial
resolution to inform siting, assess impacts, and develop adaptation policy and design given
the extensive potential impacts of groundwater rise on subsurface infrastructure (utilities,
septic systems, basements, foundations), historical contaminant mobilization potential and
loss of arable lands and forests.
2 Referenced below under “Compound Flooding” needs.
Page 27

DRAFT Flood Risk Mapping Resource Assessment August 2025
and Recommendations: A Report to the Massachusetts Legislature
Recommendations
1. Enhance the statewide model from static to transient to allow for the estimation of high
groundwater levels rather than only average annual levels. This model and its results will
provide a near-term product with statewide coverage that can guide adaptation planning
or be downloaded and further refined by local entities to estimate groundwater levels with
sufficient accuracy for adaptation design
2. Conduct high temporal and spatial resolution modeling to determine appropriate
regional scale for models that will produce groundwater level estimates of sufficient
accuracy to support adaptation design
3. Build out coverage of the state using high resolution modeling to provide future
groundwater level estimates accurate enough for adaptation design.
4. Publish all groundwater elevation maps and guidance on their use in flood adaptation to
the ResilientMass Maps and Data Center in user-friendly web tools. Publish all models as
downloadable files for site-specific use.
5. Continue full funding for groundwater monitoring wells and expand the groundwater
monitoring network with sites at current gaps.
F. Statewide Compound Flood Modeling
Needs
Flood maps representing areas at risk of flooding caused by compound riverine and coastal
flood events are needed for flood risk management in coastal areas. This need was identified
through the Riverine and Pluvial Flood Mapping Project, which will account for interactions
between riverine and pluvial (urban or stormwater) flooding and coastal water levels through
a simplified methodology, as well as through the ResilientCoasts initiative modeling.
The need is being partially addressed by the Riverine and Pluvial flood mapping project;
however, (1) that project does not have sufficient funding to provide statewide riverine flood
mapping coverage, and (2) the project is taking a simplified approach to modeling the
interaction between river and stormwater flooding and high coastal water level, and more
detailed modelling of compound flood processes may be needed to better support decision-
making.
Recommendations
1. Further clarify the need for compound flood map resources, if any, beyond those to
be produced through the Riverine and Pluvial Flood Mapping project through
initiatives such as the ResilientCoasts Strategy and ResilientFloodplains initiative.
Page 28

DRAFT Flood Risk Mapping Resource Assessment August 2025
and Recommendations: A Report to the Massachusetts Legislature
2. Ground-truth the compound flood maps developed through the Riverine and Pluvial
Flood Mapping project relative to documented past compound flooding through the
MyCoast coastal storm impacts database, the Flooding and Environmental Justice
project, and any other sources of information on past flooding.
3. In future phases of the Massachusetts Coast Flood Risk Model (MC-FRM)
development, assess opportunities to incorporate more robust representation of
compound flooding processes and develop detailed cost estimates for doing so in
future model and map updates.
G. Statewide River Corridor Mapping
Needs
Studies and maps depicting areas where rivers could migrate to in the future given existing
fluvial geomorphologic trends are needed. This need was identified through the Riverine and
Pluvial Flood Mapping project; however, work to address this need is not within the scope of
that project. Maps showing where river corridors could shift given natural processes, and
increased precipitation causing erosion, sediment transport, etc. are important resources
for local and regional land use planning.
Recommendations
1. Review river corridor mapping methods applied in other New England states and
refine methodology for Massachusetts’ needs
2. Develop the maps depicting the migratory path and extent of the changing river
corridors over time
3. Establish a pathway toward incorporating river corridor migration areas in state,
regional, and local land use planning
H. Statewide Flooding and Environmental Justice Vulnerability
Assessment
Needs
The Statewide Flooding and Environmental Justice Vulnerability Assessment Project, that
concluded June 30, 2025, established an approach for engaging with environmental justice
communities, built collaborative networks, and began building a statewide crowd-sourced
flood map database. The Project identified the following main needs:
(1) Continue community engagement in the three pilot communities that are part of the
current study. Add additional pilot communities with high flood vulnerabilities.
Page 29

DRAFT Flood Risk Mapping Resource Assessment August 2025
and Recommendations: A Report to the Massachusetts Legislature
(2) Collaborate with local colleges and universities to leverage existing engagement and
flood assessment tools, thereby fostering academic partnerships and expanding
direct community support.
(3) Expand the approach (that is currently focused in EJ areas, which are primarily urban
and suburban areas) to rural communities vulnerable to flooding. Collect existing
flood maps and community knowledge of flood-prone areas and develop mitigation
designs tailored to the unique challenges and characteristics of rural environments3.
Recommendations
1. The project should continue to build upon the successful foundational work over the
past two years, emphasizing deeper community engagement, the specific needs of
rural communities, project implementation, and knowledge transfer. Future work
should include additional pilot communities, characterizing flood vulnerabilities in
rural communities, and engaging with local institutions.
I. Vulnerability Assessment of the Agricultural Sector to Flooding
Needs
The agricultural sector has been impacted by precipitation-driven flooding throughout
Massachusetts’ history and during recent events such as Hurricane Irene and the floods of
July 2023. It can be desirable to locate crop lands near rivers, as floodplains such as but not
limited to the Connecticut River Valley contain fertile soil and topographically favorable land
for farming. However, the vulnerability of farms in these areas to floods increases as the
Northeast US faces more frequent and severe intense precipitation.
Recommendations
1. Engage the agricultural sector in ongoing flood vulnerability assessment and
planning efforts as well as flood map resource development projects to ensure that
policy, executive actions, and new data products reflect the needs of the agricultural
sector to address flooding.
2. Further clarify the need for flood map resources in the agricultural sector through
state planning initiatives,
3 Documentation of flood-prone locations in rural areas would support ongoing flood modelling and mapping
initiatives including updates to the MC-FRM and riverine and pluvial flood mapping.

Conclusions
Over the last 10 years Massachusetts has taken significant steps to understand and
characterize floods and strengthen floodplain management in response to changing
precipitation patterns and increased flood risks. High-intensity, short-duration storm events
are now among the most pressing natural hazards facing the Commonwealth—an issue
highlighted in the ResilientMass Plan. Recognizing this, state agencies have been prioritizing
projects and programs and have been coming together to align flood-related policies, data,
and planning efforts.
This report provides a summary of existing and available data, maps and products related to
precipitation, streamflow and flooding that are readily available to state agencies and the
public. The report also provides a summary of several ongoing studies and projects that are
developing cutting-edge and state-of-the-art methods and products as building blocks that
showcase existing and future riverine, pluvial (urban), and groundwater flooding. EEA and
MassDOT have invested significant resources through dedicated staff time and their capital
and operating budgets, along with some federal support to develop these products. We have
made noted strides and progress and have developed mapping resources and tools for
better planning and management of floods across the Commonwealth.
However, it will take further coordination among state agencies and a combination of funding
sources in the future to meet the needs and fully realize our vision for Massachusetts
floodplains - to be healthy, resilient and functionally beneficial for the natural environment
and all living beings, with no damages to the built environment or the people who are
impacted by flooding. As we continue to implement the studies highlighted in Section III and
initiate new projects and studies outlined in Section IV we will look to existing authorizations
and authorities at EEA. This would include authorization outlined in the Mass Ready Act filed
by Governor Healey in June 2025, development and implementation of the Resilient Mass
Plan, implementation of ResilientCoasts, and the other broad authority that Massachusetts
Water Resources Commission at other programs at EEA currently have related to flood
management and flood loss prevention. We would also look to future capital, operating
budgets as well as seek opportunities and resources at the federal level to guide floodplain
management, and resilience efforts in Massachusetts.
