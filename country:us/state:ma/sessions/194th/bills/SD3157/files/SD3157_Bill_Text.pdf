CHIEF ADMINISTRATIVE MAGISTRATE www.mass.gov/dala
Greetings:
I am pleased to share the Division of Administrative Law Appeals’ 2024 Annual Report,
which highlights the work of our General Jurisdiction Unit (GJU) and Bureau of Special
Education Appeals (BSEA). Though we are a small agency, DALA plays an essential role in
state government by resolving disputes that directly impact the lives, livelihoods and rights of
individuals, families and businesses across the Commonwealth.
The GJU provides a fair, independent and accessible forum for resolving a wide range
of administrative disputes. Building on progress from prior years, the GJU in 2024 resolved
cases more swiftly and effectively – cutting average case resolution times by more than half,
reducing the median resolution time by over 50%, and resolving hundreds more cases than
were filed. The division also launched several initiatives to make our communications clearer,
expand language access, and help the public better understand the appeals process.
The BSEA continued to serve families and school districts through impartial mediations,
due process hearings and facilitated team meetings. In addition to handling over 1,300
mediation requests, over 275 facilitation requests and nearly 430 hearing requests, the BSEA
continued its outreach efforts – offering nearly 50 free informational presentations and
updating its website and resource materials to improve accessibility. These efforts reflect the
BSEA’s longstanding leadership in special education dispute resolution, both in Massachusetts
and nationally.
A special thanks to Jennifer Ngo, Laila Djazaerly, Alexandra Brown, Rebecca Stone,
Yakov Malkiel and Siva Gnanapradeepan for their contributions to this report.
Sincerely,
Natalie S. Monroe

Division of Administrative Law Appeals: 2024 Annual Report 3

ABOUT DALA: MISSION AND STRUCTURE
The Division of Administrative Law Appeals (DALA) is a quasi-judicial agency
that hears and resolves challenges to decisions made by Massachusetts state agencies, as
well as disputes among parents, school districts, private schools and state educational
agencies.
At the heart of DALA’s mission is a commitment to protecting the due process
rights of everyone who appears before the agency. In support of that mission, DALA’s
core objectives are to:
• Provide a neutral forum for the fair, equitable and independent resolution of
disputes.
• Ensure full and meaningful access for all individuals and organizations who come
before the agency.
• Treat all participants with fairness, dignity and respect throughout the mediation,
facilitation and hearing processes.
• Issue clear, well-reasoned decisions based solely on the facts and applicable law.
DALA is comprised of two units: the General Jurisdiction Unit and the Bureau of
Special Education Appeals. At the end of 2024, DALA had 33 employees.
THE GENERAL JURISDICTION UNIT
The General Jurisdiction Unit (GJU) hears challenges to decisions made by other
state agencies. Cases come to the GJU in two ways:
• By statute, requiring that certain types of cases be heard at DALA; and
• By agency request, with the approval of DALA’s Chief Administrative
Magistrate and the Secretary of Administration and Finance.
The GJU currently hears matters from approximately 20 state agencies and boards,
including the Contributory Retirement Appeal Board,1 the Board of Registration in
1 While cases are referred to DALA from the Contributory Retirement Appeal Board, they
involve decisions from every public pension system in Massachusetts—such as local retirement
boards and the State Board of Retirement—as well as by the Public Employee Retirement
Administration System.
Division of Administrative Law Appeals: 2024 Annual Report 4

Medicine, the Department of Public Health, the Department of Early Education and Care,
and the Fair Labor Division of the Attorney General’s Office. The GJU also hears appeals
from decisions issued by specially created municipal permitting districts, which
consolidate multiple local permits into a single decision for designated “priority
development sites.” Thus, to the extent that Massachusetts has a “central administrative
panel,” the GJU fills that role.
This centralized structure benefits the Commonwealth in several important ways.
It ensures that cases are handled by experienced adjudicators using consistent
procedures, and it reduces the need for individual agencies to staff and manage their own
hearings. This model also fosters trust in government by providing a neutral forum for
appeals of agency decisions, reinforcing the fairness and transparency of the process for
all parties involved. Through this consolidated approach, the Commonwealth promotes
fairness, efficiency and the responsible use of public resources.
At the end of 2024, the GJU had a team of ten magistrates, three administrative
staff and a fiscal manager.
A. The Adjudicatory Process
Although DALA’s name refers to “appeals,” the GJU functions more like a trial
court. Parties may file motions, conduct discovery, subpoena evidence, and participate
in evidentiary hearings where they may present witnesses and other relevant evidence.
The individual, agency or organization that initiates a case before the GJU is
referred to as the petitioner—similar to a plaintiff in a civil lawsuit. The opposing party
is the respondent, analogous to a defendant in civil litigation.
Each case is assigned to an impartial administrative magistrate, who oversees the
proceedings—from prehearing conferences and motion rulings to managing discovery,
conducting the evidentiary hearing, and issuing the written decision. The magistrate’s
final decision is binding on the parties and, depending on the case type, the decision may
be appealed to another agency or to the Massachusetts Superior Court.2
Cases before the GJU may resolve in several ways. Appeals may be dismissed on
procedural grounds, such as the failure to meet a statutory filing deadline, the failure to
state a claim or lack of jurisdiction. Others may be resolved through summary decision,
2 In certain types of cases, the magistrate issues a recommended decision to the agency
whose action is being appealed. The agency then reviews the recommendation and
issues the final, binding decision.
Division of Administrative Law Appeals: 2024 Annual Report 5

which—like summary judgment in civil litigation—is appropriate when there are no
genuine issues of material fact and the case can be decided as a matter of law. If a case
proceeds to a full evidentiary hearing, the assigned magistrate will issue a written
decision based on the evidence presented and the applicable law. In still other cases, the
parties reach a settlement, or the petitioner may voluntarily withdraw their appeal.
The chart below shows how cases resolved in 2024. The largest portion were
dismissals (41%), followed by cases that were resolved through a final decision (22%) or
that were withdrawn (26%). Summary decisions (4%), settlements (4%) and
recommended decisions (3%) made up smaller portions. Data regarding the resolution
of some cases was not available and is therefore not reflected in this chart.

B. 2024 in Review
1. Caseload Overview
In 2024, the GJU received 504 new cases. These matters range in complexity, from
straightforward disputes resolved quickly to highly complex cases requiring expert
testimony, lengthy hearings and extensive legal briefing.
Division of Administrative Law Appeals: 2024 Annual Report 6

As in past years, the majority of new cases (73.81%) related to public employees’
pensions, such as challenges to the calculation of an individual’s pension or the denial of
an application for a disability retirement. The second largest category of new cases
(7.14%) came from citations issued to employers for alleged violations of the Fair Wage
Act, M.G.L. ch. 149 and 151, such as for the failure to pay wages or overtime. See
Appendix A for a breakdown of new cases filed each month in 2024, categorized by
appeal type.

2. Resolving Cases More Quickly
DALA is committed to resolving cases as efficiently as possible, particularly given
the nature of the matters the GJU handles. These cases often have a direct impact on
people’s lives and on business operations. Magistrates may be asked to decide, for
example, whether a public employee is entitled to a public pension, whether a physician
will be allowed to retain their medical license, or whether a business may continue
operating. Beyond individual outcomes, GJU decisions shape public expectations,
influence agency practices and guide legal compliance, often helping to prevent future
disputes.
In 2024, the GJU built on prior efforts to strengthen efficiency, significantly
accelerating case resolutions and reducing the number of pending matters. Specifically,
in 2024, the GJU:
• Resolved 60% of the cases that had been pending since 2021 or earlier as of
January 1, 2024.
• Reduced the average case-resolution time by 58% (from 1,727 days in 2023
to 983 days).
• Reduced the median case-resolution time by 53% (from 983 days in 2023 to
463 days).
• Ended the year with 17% fewer pending cases than at the start of the year.
The GJU also kept pace with new filings, and in fact exceeded them:
• Outpaced new case filings, resolving 856 cases—352 more than were filed
in 2024.
 Includes resolving 143 more retirement cases than were filed.
• Resolved 53% of cases that were filed in 2024.
Appendix B provides a breakdown of all cases closed in 2024 by case type.
Appendix C lists the subset of cases that were both filed and resolved in 2024, also
categorized by case type.
Division of Administrative Law Appeals: 2024 Annual Report 8

C. Additional Accomplishments and Highlights
1. Clearing the Rate-Setting Case Backlog
In 2024, the GJU successfully concluded a multi-year initiative to eliminate a
backlog of nursing home rate-setting cases; these cases concern the rate of reimbursement
for services nursing homes provide to patients who receive Medicaid benefits. Many of
the cases had been filed years ago but then were not pursued. In 2022, the GJU had over
2,400 open rate-setting cases. Through the efforts of its magistrates and program
coordinators, the GJU ended 2024 with just 93 cases, many of which are scheduled for
hearings or are stayed at the parties’ request.
2. Expanding Language Access and Plain Language Communication
DALA is committed to ensuring that everyone can meaningfully participate in its
proceedings. In furtherance of this commitment, the GJU began including a language
access notice with every GJU order, notice and decision, and the division established a
dedicated email address for parties to request language assistance. These efforts have led
to the earlier identification of language needs and an increase in requests for both
translation and interpreter services.
We also launched a plain language initiative, rewriting commonly used forms—
including acknowledgment forms and hearing notices—to ensure that the division
provides clearer communications to all parties. These revised documents have also been
translated into Spanish, Haitian Creole, Chinese, Vietnamese and Portuguese—the five
most widely spoken languages in Massachusetts after English.
3. Enhancing Transparency and Digital Access
This year, we also improved DALA’s websites and online tools to better serve the
public. In the GJU, we developed a glossary of frequently used words and phrases, and
we began publishing decisions in HTML format, making them easier to search and more
accessible for individuals with vision impairments. Further, the glossary has been
translated into Spanish, Haitian Creole, Simplified Chinese, Vietnamese and Portuguese,
providing broader access to key terminology used in GJU proceedings.
We are also partnering with other state agencies on a multi-year procurement for
a new, integrated docket system that will transform case management at the agency. This
system will improve internal tracking and processing of cases, and for the first time,
provide public-facing features that allow litigants and representatives to file documents
Division of Administrative Law Appeals: 2024 Annual Report 9

and view case dockets online. This expanded functionality will make it significantly
easier for the public to interact with the agency.
4. Educational Outreach
DALA is committed to helping attorneys and members of the public better
understand the administrative hearing process and developments in administrative law
so they can be well prepared when appearing before DALA or other administrative
agencies. In recent months, GJU magistrates presented a Massachusetts Continuing Legal
Education program titled “A Lawyer’s Roadmap to the Division of Administrative Law
Appeals: Unlocking the Secrets of Administrative Law.” They also participated in conferences
and seminars hosted by the Massachusetts Association of Contributory Retirement
Systems and the Social Law Library, including a training focused on best practices for
handling administrative hearings, and another on advanced legal writing.
Division of Administrative Law Appeals: 2024 Annual Report 10

THE BUREAU OF SPECIAL EDUCATION APPEALS
The Bureau of Special Education Appeals (BSEA) conducts mediations, hearings
and facilitated meetings to resolve disputes among parents, school districts, private
schools and state agencies. The BSEA derives its authority from both federal law (the
Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, “IDEA”) and Massachusetts law (Chapter
71B of the Massachusetts General Laws, “Chapter 71B”).
A parent3 or a school district may request a mediation or hearing on any matter
concerning the eligibility, evaluation, placement, Individualized Education Program,
provision of special education or procedural protections for students with disabilities, in
accordance with state and federal law. In addition, a parent may request a hearing on
issues involving the denial of a free appropriate public education guaranteed by Section
504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.
Mediations, hearings and facilitated meetings are conducted by impartial and
specially trained mediators and hearing officers. At the close of 2024, the BSEA was
comprised of six hearing officers (all of whom are attorneys), five mediators, a
coordinator of mediation, a scheduling coordinator, four administrative staff, a fiscal
manager and a director.
The BSEA is federally funded through a grant managed by the Department of
Elementary and Secondary Education (DESE). In 2010, the Legislature transferred the
BSEA to DALA from DESE to ensure independence from any educational agency that
could be a party to, or interested in, the matters that come before the BSEA. See Chapter
131 of the Acts of 2010.
A. Overview and 2024 Activity
In Massachusetts, a public school district is responsible for developing an
Individualized Education Program (IEP) for a student with a disability who is found
eligible pursuant to the IDEA or Chapter 71B. An IEP is a “road map” and “contract,”
which is prepared by an interdisciplinary team, and which sets forth the goals, objectives,
services, placement and accommodations necessary to provide an eligible student with a
free appropriate public education (FAPE) in the least restrictive environment.
3 As used in this report, “parent” refers to the father, mother, foster parent or legal guardian of a
child; a person acting as a parent of a child; or an educational surrogate parent appointed in
accordance with federal law.
Division of Administrative Law Appeals: 2024 Annual Report 11

If the parent of a student rejects or does not respond to a proposed IEP, the school
must notify the BSEA. The BSEA then sends a packet of information to the parents and
school district notifying them of their dispute resolution options, including mediation
and a due process hearing. Parents and school districts are not required to request a
BSEA mediation or hearing. After receiving this packet, therefore, the parents and school
district may or may not contact the BSEA to request mediation or file a written request
for a hearing.
In most instances involving a rejected IEP, the families and school districts work
collaboratively to resolve the rejections. As a result, only a small percentage of the
rejected IEPs that the BSEA receives ultimately lead to a mediation, settlement conference
or full evidentiary hearing. If the BSEA receives no request to schedule a mediation or
hearing within three months of sending the packet of information, the matter is closed.
1. Rejected IEPS and Outreach
In 2024, the BSEA received approximately 14,577 notifications of rejected IEPs
from public school districts across Massachusetts.4 As required, the BSEA mailed
informational packets to parents outlining their due process rights and dispute resolution
options.
In response to feedback asking that the cover letter in these packets be made more
accessible and understandable, the BSEA worked with stakeholders to develop a
simplified cover letter. The new letter —designed to clearly communicate rights in a user-
friendly format—was rolled out in early 2025. See Appendix D.
2. Mediations
a. How Mediation Works: A Brief Overview
A parent or school district may contact the BSEA to request mediation. As
discussed above, parties often learn about this option through the informational IEP
packets that the BSEA sends out. They also may learn about mediating at the BSEA in
other ways, such as from the school district, from another parent, by attending one of the
BSEA’s informational sessions, or by visiting our website.
4 The BSEA has historically reported data by fiscal year. Beginning in 2024, the BSEA is now also
reporting data by calendar year. Due to the differing timelines, calendar year and fiscal year data
will not always directly align. Comparative calendar-year data for 2024 and 2025 will be provided
in next year’s report. Fiscal year reporting will also continue as required by state and federal
regulations.
Division of Administrative Law Appeals: 2024 Annual Report 12

When the BSEA receives a mediation request, a mediator gathers relevant
information and shares the request with the other party. If both parties—the school
district and the parent—agree to mediate, they sign a written agreement to mediate. The
mediator then works with them to schedule the session, which may be held remotely or
in person, depending on their preference. During the mediation, the mediator facilitates
a collaborative process to help the parties reach a mutually acceptable, signed agreement.
b. Mediation Requests and Resolutions
The BSEA continued to deliver high-quality mediation services in 2024. In 2024,
the BSEA received 1,301 mediation requests and conducted 765 mediations, including
some that had been requested in 2023. Of the 1,301 requests, 503 did not proceed—either
because a party declined mediation or because the issue was resolved outside of
mediation. At the end of 2024, 95 requests remained pending and were subsequently
closed in early 2025.
Of the 765 mediations the BSEA conducted, 628 (82%) resulted in agreements
between parents and school districts. As indicated in Figure 3, the BSEA receives more
requests for mediation, per student count, than any other state. Further, as shown in
Figure 4, the BSEA mediators have one of the highest agreement rates in the nation, well
above the national average.
Figure 3. Requests for Mediation. Reproduced from Cadreworks.org.5
5 Figures 3 and 4 reflect data from the 2022-2023 school year, which is the most recent year for
which CADRE has published information. The BSEA’s data for 2024 is consistent with that in
Division of Administrative Law Appeals: 2024 Annual Report 13

Figure 4. Mediated Agreement Rate. Reproduced from Cadreworks.org
3. Due Process Hearings and Settlement Conferences
a. Formal Resolution of Special Education Disputes
In addition to mediation, parents and school districts may request that the BSEA
conduct a due process hearing. At the BSEA, this is a formal administrative adjudicatory
proceeding in which parties present evidence—testimony under oath and documents—
to an impartial hearing officer to resolve the disputed issues. The hearing officer audio
records the hearing and/or uses a court stenographer to create a transcript. Upon request,
the BSEA issues subpoenas and provides interpreters, translators and transcripts at no
cost to the parties.
A hearing may address disputes involving the eligibility, evaluation, placement,
IEP, provision of special education, or procedural protections of state and federal law for
students with disabilities. The BSEA’s jurisdiction in these matters extends to parents,
students, public school districts, private schools and state agencies throughout
Massachusetts.
Each matter is assigned to an impartial hearing officer who oversees the case, from
conducting the prehearing conferences to issuing the final decision. When a matter
Figures 3 and 4. Further, for readability, the charts have been truncated to exclude states with
the fewest mediation requests and lowest agreement rates.
Division of Administrative Law Appeals: 2024 Annual Report 14

proceeds to a full evidentiary hearing, the hearing officer presides over the hearing,
reviews the evidence presented and issues a binding written decision based on relevant
state and federal law. A party may appeal the decision to the Massachusetts Superior
Court or the United States District Court within 90 days of issuance.
b. Resolution of Hearing Requests in 2024
Most hearing requests filed with the BSEA resolve before reaching a full hearing.
In some cases, the parties withdraw their requests for a hearing. In others, the parties
reach a settlement, either outside the BSEA process or through a BSEA prehearing
conference, mediation or settlement conference. Cases that are not resolved through one
of these avenues proceed to either a dispositive ruling or a full evidentiary hearing, after
which the hearing officer issues a decision on the merits.
In 2024, the BSEA received 427 hearing requests. BSEA hearing officers conducted
21 full hearings, resulting in 21 decisions. Hearing officers also issued 77 substantive
written rulings in 2024.
Additionally, the BSEA held settlement conferences in 35 cases that were filed for
hearing in 2024. In 32 of these conferences (91%), the parties reached a settlement.
4. Facilitated Team Meetings
To support early dispute resolution and keep conflicts from escalating, the BSEA
also provides facilitators for IEP and 504 Accommodation Plan team meetings. An IEP
team meeting is a required meeting to discuss the educational programming and
supports for a student with disabilities. A 504 Accommodation Plan is a formal plan
developed under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act to ensure that a student with a
disability has equal access to education by providing necessary accommodations and
support. These meetings include both school staff and the student’s parents.
The BSEA offers facilitators to attend and support clear and effective team
communication and productivity. The BSEA provides this service at no cost to the parties.
The BSEA received 288 requests for facilitated meetings and conducted 151
facilitations in 2024, with approximately 80 requests unmet due to staff shortage.
Previously, BSEA’s mediators conducted all facilitations. Due to steadily growing
demand for the BSEA’s services, the unit hired a full-time facilitator, who joined the BSEA
in April 2025.

B. Outreach, Accessibility and National Recognition
The BSEA is committed to ensuring that parents and school districts both
understand and can easily access their rights. In support of this value, in 2024, the BSEA
updated its forms and publications and issued a new mediation reference manual, with
an eye toward increased accessibility and to ensure full technical compliance with federal
law. The forms and publications appear on our website in multiple languages and have
6 The 765 mediations held in 2024 include some that had been requested in 2023.
Division of Administrative Law Appeals: 2024 Annual Report 16

been screened for accessibility. The BSEA also issued a hearing officer manual and an
office procedure manual to assure consistency and quality of performance.
In addition, the BSEA developed a public hearing protocol and augmented our
technology in response to the increased number of public hearing requests received.
The BSEA also offered nearly 50 free informational presentations and trainings,
both in person and online. These sessions reflect our ongoing commitment to making
special education dispute resolution more accessible and better understood. They were
part of a broad and dedicated outreach initiative to a diverse range of groups across the
Commonwealth, with offers to present to over 500 groups and organizations, including
family groups, Special Education Parent Advisory Councils, school personnel, charter
schools, special education collaboratives, legal services groups, state agencies, attorney
groups, and organizations such as the Federation for Children with Special Needs and
Boston Children’s Hospital advocacy programs.
Topics included how to access mediation, facilitation and due process hearings;
understanding your rights in dispute resolutions; and building communication skills to
reduce conflict. To make these presentations as inclusive as possible, we offered them in
English, Spanish, Chinese and other major languages spoken in Massachusetts.
Finally, Massachusetts continues to be recognized as a national leader in special
education mediation. In fall 2024, the BSEA was selected to present at the 2025 National
Symposium of CADRE (the Center for Appropriate Dispute Resolution in Special
Education). Our staff will lead two workshops:
• Mastering High-Stakes Facilitation in Difficult Dynamics: Achieving Team Goals
• Advanced Mediation Techniques: Bridging the Gap Between Parents and School
Districts
