Re: Facility Inspection – Souza-Baranowski Correctional Center, Shirley
Dear Superintendent Kennedy:
The Massachusetts Department of Public Health’s, Bureau of Climate and Environmental Health (BCEH)
reorganized and consolidated its seven programs into six divisions. The Community Sanitation Program is now
the Division of Environmental Health Regulations and Standards (EHRS). Our division continues to support
correctional facilities and has added expertise for indoor air quality assessments for schools and other municipal
and state facilities. EHRS also used this opportunity to revise and update the format of the correctional bi-
annual inspection reports. This revised format clarifies new and repeat deficiencies outlined in regulation 105
CMR 451.000 and organizes deficiencies based on the 451.100, 451.200 and 451.300 series of provisions, as
well as other conditions that may constitute a threat to health and safety.
Throughout this process we understand there has been a delay in receiving your inspection report and we
appreciate your patience and understanding as we finalize the new report template. As you receive your reports,
please feel free to contact me if you have any questions or concerns.
Sincerely,
Amy Riordan, MPH
Senior Advisor, EHRS, BCEH

Re: Facility Inspection – Souza-Baranowski Correctional Center, Shirley
Dear Superintendent Kennedy:
The Massachusetts Department of Public Health’s, Bureau of Climate and Environmental Health (BCEH)
reorganized and consolidated its seven programs into six divisions. The Community Sanitation Program is now
the Division of Environmental Health Regulations and Standards (EHRS). Our division continues to support
correctional facilities and has added expertise for indoor air quality assessments for schools and other municipal
and state facilities. EHRS also used this opportunity to revise and update the format of the correctional bi-
annual inspection reports. This revised format clarifies new and repeat deficiencies outlined in regulation 105
CMR 451.000 and organizes deficiencies based on the 451.100, 451.200 and 451.300 series of provisions, as
well as other conditions that may constitute a threat to health and safety.
Throughout this process we understand there has been a delay in receiving your inspection report and we
appreciate your patience and understanding as we finalize the new report template. As you receive your reports,
please feel free to contact me if you have any questions or concerns.
Sincerely,
Amy Riordan, MPH
Senior Advisor, EHRS, BCEH

Re: Plan of Correction – Souza-Baranowski Correctional Center, Shirley
Dear Superintendent Kennedy:
The Massachusetts Department of Public Health, Division of Environmental Health Regulations and Standards
(EHRS) has received your Plan of Correction in response to my inspection on December 3, 4, 5, and 6, 2024.
After review, the EHRS finds the plan addresses all the deficiencies noted in the report with the following
exceptions:
1. Your Plan of Correction states the floor repair project within the Main and Culinary Kitchen is out for
bid. While the EHRS recognizes the complexities of managerial and budgetary constraints, we cannot
approve any items that do not identify a reasonable time frame for repair. The EHRS remains concerned
with the floor damage in the Main and Culinary Kitchen and asks you to provide a plan describing the
interim measures you have implemented to ensure the health and safety of inmates and staff. In addition,
we ask to be kept appraised of the capital funding progress.
2. Please provide a specific corrective action and estimated date of completion for:
a. Backflow preventer rusted in the Inmate Bathroom # D1-23 in the Gym;
b. Ceiling leaking in the Inmate Weight Room # D1-11;
c. Interior of toilet bowl rusted in cell # 26, 33, 36, and 40 in the G1 Cell Block; and
d. Dead flies on the ceiling in shower # 1 in the G1 Cell Block.
3. Please confirm the temperature has been properly adjusted to meet the regulatory requirements at the:
a. Handwash sink in the Female Bathroom # C1-37 in Voc. Ed/Barber Shop;
b. Handwash sink in the Inmate Bathroom in the Mosque;
c. Shower # 6 in L1 Cell Block; and
d. Shower # 2 in the H2 Cell Block.
4. In regards to the issue of overcrowding, the CSP appreciates the limitations of correctional facilities and
the need to accommodate the ever-increasing population; however we remain concerned with the
overcrowded conditions.
