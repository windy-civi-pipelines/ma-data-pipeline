Dear Mr. Hurley:
Pursuant to G.L. c. 272, § 99R, I hereby submit this report to the General Court on behalf of the
Office of the Attorney General for the 2020 calendar year.
During 2020, the Attorney General submitted 15 applications for electronic surveillance warrants
to Justices of the Superior Court. Justices of the Superior Court granted all 15 of these applications for
electronic surveillance. Each of the resulting warrants authorized electronic surveillance for up to 15 days.
The Attorney General submitted 9 grants for renewal. A total of 48,727 interceptions were made pursuant
to these warrants. Of those 48,727 interceptions, 21,116 were pertinent interceptions. The designated
offenses for which electronic surveillance was conducted included violations of: G.L. c. 94C, §§ 32, 32A,
32E, 40; G.L. c. 268, § 1; and G.L. c. 271, § 17.
In 2020, no indictments were issued, and no guilty pleas were entered in cases that involved
wiretap evidence. In addition, there were no jury trials that included the presentation of electronic
surveillance.
If you have any questions, you can reach me at 617-963-2245.
