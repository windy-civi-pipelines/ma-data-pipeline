Net State Tax Revenues Exceeded Allowable State Tax Revenues
For the period of July 1, 2024 through June 30, 2025
The Honorable Diana DiZoglio
Auditor of the Commonwealth
State House‐ Room 229
Boston, MA 01333
August 29, 2025
Dear Auditor DiZoglio:
Chapter 62F of the Massachusetts General Laws (added by St. 1986, c.555, s.2) imposes a limitation on the growth of state tax revenues. The law
requires that the Department of Revenue submit a report to the State Auditor on the net state tax revenues and the allowable state tax revenues
for each fiscal year.
This report is submitted for your review. The calculations, as well as the methodology behind the calculations, are provided to enable you to
certify their accuracy and to independently determine whether the FY25 net state tax revenues exceed allowable state tax revenues.
Pursuant to subsection (d) of section 2BBBBBB of section 17 of chapter 29, 4% income surtax revenues shall not be subject to the allowable state
tax revenue limitations established by chapter 62F. The Department of Revenue shall estimate on or before September 1, for the preceding fiscal
year, the amount of revenue to exclude from the chapter 62F calculation and shall include that estimate in the report submitted to the State
Auditor pursuant to subsection (a) of section 5 of said chapter 62F; provided that this estimate shall be final. The Department of Revenue
estimates that FY25 net state tax revenues include $2,987,020,296 in tax revenue collected from the 4% income surtax.
As you will see in the report, total FY25 net state tax revenues excluding 4% income surtax revenue totaled $41,681,702,279 which is below FY25
allowable state tax revenue of $46,384,735,613 by $4,703,033,334.

Dear Auditor DiZoglio:
Chapter 62F of the Massachusetts General Laws (added by St. 1986, c.555, s.2) imposes a limitation on the growth of state tax revenues. The law
requires that the Department of Revenue submit a report to the State Auditor on the net state tax revenues and the allowable state tax revenues
for each fiscal year.
This report is submitted for your review. The calculations, as well as the methodology behind the calculations, are provided to enable you to
certify their accuracy and to independently determine whether the FY25 net state tax revenues exceed allowable state tax revenues.
Pursuant to subsection (d) of section 2BBBBBB of section 17 of chapter 29, 4% income surtax revenues shall not be subject to the allowable state
tax revenue limitations established by chapter 62F. The Department of Revenue shall estimate on or before September 1, for the preceding fiscal
year, the amount of revenue to exclude from the chapter 62F calculation and shall include that estimate in the report submitted to the State
Auditor pursuant to subsection (a) of section 5 of said chapter 62F; provided that this estimate shall be final. The Department of Revenue
estimates that FY25 net state tax revenues include $2,987,020,296 in tax revenue collected from the 4% income surtax.
As you will see in the report, total FY25 net state tax revenues excluding 4% income surtax revenue totaled $41,681,702,279 which is below FY25
allowable state tax revenue of $46,384,735,613 by $4,703,033,334.
