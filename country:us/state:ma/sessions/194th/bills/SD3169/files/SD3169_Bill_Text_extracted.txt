Honorable Michael Rodrigues, Chair

Dear Committees on Ways and Means:
In accordance with Section 2E of Chapter 140 of the Acts of 2024, and Section 128 of Chapter 248
of the Acts of 2024 I am submitting a revised Fiscal Year 2025 transfer schedule for the Medical
Assistance Trust Fund. The revised schedule reflects a reduction in the transfer amount. Delayed
approval by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services of a State Plan Amendment resulted
in MassHealth expending less than appropriated in Fiscal Year 2025.
• 1595-1068-- Medical Assistance Trust Fund, where the transfer provides an operating subsidy
from the General Fund to the Medical Assistance Trust Fund for the MassHealth provider
payment account for services provided; for public hospital transformation and incentive
initiative payments; or, for Medicaid care organization payments under 42 CFR 438.6(c).
Monthly transfer amounts are shown in the attachment.
I will notify you if additional changes are made to the schedule. If you have any questions or
concerns, please contact me.
Sincerely,
William McNamara
Comptroller of the Commonwealth
