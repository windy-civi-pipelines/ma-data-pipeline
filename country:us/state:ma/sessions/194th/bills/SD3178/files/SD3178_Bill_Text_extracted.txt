Report on the Applicability of Chapter 23B Section 30 Paragraph (G) (values as of 9/4/25)
Line item 7004-0101 of the General Appropriations Act (GAA) for FY2026 requires reporting
on the applicability of Chapter 23B Section 30 Paragraph (G) by September 15, with the
following reporting requirements on the EA system. As stated by the “Extension of Declaration –
Emergency Assistance Family Shelter” issued on July 11, 2025, the EA Family shelter system
cannot meet all current and projected demand without the policies put in place through this
Declaration, considering the facts and circumstances existing in the Commonwealth. These
include continued economic uncertainty, high housing costs, and reduced federal support for the
populations served by the EA program, all of which affect current and projected demand for the
program. The statutory requirement in Section 8 of Chapter 1 of the Acts of 2025 requires total
capacity of the EA system to not exceed 4,000 families by December 31, 2025, continuing at
least through December 31, 2026, and the FY2026 GAA provided $276.4 million for EA Family
Shelters and Services.

Report on the Applicability of Chapter 23B Section 30 Paragraph (G) (values as of 9/4/25)
Line item 7004-0101 of the General Appropriations Act (GAA) for FY2026 requires reporting
on the applicability of Chapter 23B Section 30 Paragraph (G) by September 15, with the
following reporting requirements on the EA system. As stated by the “Extension of Declaration –
Emergency Assistance Family Shelter” issued on July 11, 2025, the EA Family shelter system
cannot meet all current and projected demand without the policies put in place through this
Declaration, considering the facts and circumstances existing in the Commonwealth. These
include continued economic uncertainty, high housing costs, and reduced federal support for the
populations served by the EA program, all of which affect current and projected demand for the
program. The statutory requirement in Section 8 of Chapter 1 of the Acts of 2025 requires total
capacity of the EA system to not exceed 4,000 families by December 31, 2025, continuing at
least through December 31, 2026, and the FY2026 GAA provided $276.4 million for EA Family
Shelters and Services.
