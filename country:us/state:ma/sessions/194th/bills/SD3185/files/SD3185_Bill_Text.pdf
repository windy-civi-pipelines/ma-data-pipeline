Firearm-Related Activity in Massachusetts 2022-2023
Overview
Section 18 ¾ of Chapter 6A of the Massachusetts General Laws mandates that a report be completed by
the Executive Office of Public Safety and Security (EOPSS) detailing the prevalence of firearm-related
crimes, the number of arrests, prosecutions, and points of origins of these illegal firearms. This report will
provide statistics on the state of illegal firearms in the Commonwealth for the time period of 2022-2023 to
determine if recent laws have had an effect on the number of illegal firearms in the Commonwealth, the
number of crimes committed with a firearm, and prosecutions related to these violations. The governing
statute requires that EOPSS:
(10) …develop a biennial report to be sent to the clerks of the House of Representatives and Senate, the
House and Senate committees on ways and means and the House and Senate chairs of the joint committee
on public safety and homeland security not later than March 1 of every even-numbered year. The report shall
contain, but not be limited to, the following information: (i) statistics related to firearms crimes; (ii) arrests
and prosecutions of firearms-related offenses, to serve as an examination of the effectiveness of the
commonwealth's firearms-related regulations; (iii) aggregate data on the source of firearms that have been
confiscated and identified as being used in a crime or in an attempted or completed suicide during the report
period, including aggregate information on the manufacturer, state of origin and last known point of sale,
transfer, loss or theft of such firearms; (iv) an explanation of substantial changes in state and federal
firearms-related laws and firearms-related statistics in the commonwealth; and (v) the effectiveness of
section 128B of chapter 140.
Methodology and Data Collection
Currently, the data requested is not located within a single data set. For this report, crime statistics and
arrest statistics were compiled by utilizing National Incident Based Reporting System (NIBRS) data, which
is voluntarily submitted to the Executive Office of Public Safety and Security and ultimately to the FBI by
local, state, campus, and hospital police agencies. NIBRS data includes the nature and types of specific
offenses in the incident, characteristics of the victim(s) and offender(s), types and value of property stolen
and recovered, and characteristics of persons arrested in connection with a crime incident; not all police
agencies submit crime data using NIBRS. It should be noted that in NIBRS data, it is possible to report
multiple offenses, crimes, victims and weapons within one incident. For this report, data shall be reported
as the total number of crimes where firearms were utilized during all of the offenses, unless otherwise noted.
Information about homicides with a firearm and suicides with a firearm was compiled from the
Massachusetts Office of the Chief Medical Examiner (OCME). In order to examine case statuses and
prosecutions of firearm cases, data was received from the Massachusetts Trial Court. Information about
firearms confiscated or recovered was received from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and
Explosives (ATF).

Going forward, EOPSS will continue to work with municipal police departments, the Massachusetts State
Police (MSP), the Commonwealth Fusion Center (CFC), and federal partners to maintain a dataset where
this information may be more readily available. In addition, the Massachusetts State Police utilize a data
collection tool in the Criminal Justice Information Services (CJIS) environment to collect data on firearm
recoveries and seizures in the Commonwealth. This system, referred to as the Crime Gun Tracking System,
allows law enforcement to enter data in the field in relation to the criminal incidents and the firearms
associated with crimes. This data collection tool is currently being revamped to enhance analysis
capabilities. In addition to this report, the Massachusetts State Police also publish an annual report regarding
firearms used in crimes based upon this collection tool. EOPSS is also in the process of adding a data point
to collect information on non-fatal shootings in NIBRS via the injury type field.
Limitations of the Data
As mentioned above, it is difficult to locate and merge data that does not reside within a structured data
environment. While NIBRS reporting now covers more than 98% of the Commonwealth’s total population,
some smaller agencies still do not report. Massachusetts State Police began reporting to NIBRS in 2021
and manually enter reports into the Sidearm system. For the purpose of this report, agencies that failed to
submit data or are not contributing NIBRS data for either year were excluded for the crime and arrest
statistics, unless otherwise noted. Overall, NIBRS statistics were available for 384 Massachusetts police
agencies.
With respect to prosecution, criminal charges involving firearms were examined for the years 2022-2023.
It should be noted that this will not reflect all firearm-related arrests from this time frame, but only those
resulting in prosecutions completed during these years, as some of the 2022-2023 arrests will not yet have
been adjudicated. At the time of the writing of this report, ATF data was not available for 2023, so only
2022 data is included in the Origins of Firearms section.
Statistics on Firearm-Related Crimes
Since in some cases, it is possible to convert NIBRS data to UCR data, this methodology was utilized to
provide a count of Homicides, Robberies and Aggravated Assaults with a Firearm across the
Commonwealth for all agencies that submitted NIBRS data. These are the only three categories where it is
possible to extract weapons data from UCR. The data is then converted to summary, to compare against
historical data, where NIBRS data was not available for all of the agencies. The number of Robberies with
a Firearm continued to decrease from 1,400 incidents in 2016 to approximately 1,000 in 2018, dropping
again to 615 in 2021, and 563 in 2023. Aggravated Assaults with a Firearm did remain consistent in this
3 Firearm-Related Activity in MA | EOPSS

two-year timeframe after jumping by over 600 incidents between 2019 and 2020. The number of homicides
includes two justifiable homicides which are not included in the NIBRS counts.

Data Source: MA NIBRS Data
For the time period 2022-2023, there were 13,414 crimes in which firearms were utilized, up from 11,805
in 2020-2021. In 2022, 6,758 crimes were committed with a firearm, while in 2023, 6,656 crimes were
committed with a firearm. When reporting NIBRS, the FBI allows for 15 crime types to include a reference
to the use or presence of a firearm. There was a substantial increase of over 1,600 incidents when compared
to 2020–2021. This increase was due in large part to an increase in Weapons Law Violations.

Data Source: MA NIBRS statistics. Data is a count of crimes where a firearm was listed as the weapon
involved.
As seen in Figure 2, Weapon Law Violations were the most frequent incident type. These incidents are
typically for violating laws related to the manufacturing, selling, purchasing, transporting, possessing,
concealing, or using of firearms. Common incidents within this category are arrests for Unlawful Possession
of a Firearm, and incidents of shots fired. Aggravated Assaults with a firearm could be Non-Fatal shootings,
pistol whippings, threats with a firearm, or cases of shots fired at an intended target. The 2022 and 2023
numbers are fairly consistent with the prior two-year period.

The remaining crime type with a significant number of firearms used was Robberies with 1,193, down from
1,398 in 2020-2021. Robberies encompass street, commercial, home invasion and carjacking robberies. It
should be noted that the 2020-2021 time period included the COVID-19 Pandemic, which impacted crime
statistics in various ways. Assaults and frauds increased significantly, while other crimes like Robbery and
Burglary declined. It is also possible that the increase in Weapons Law Violations was impacted by the end
of the Pandemic. While capturing homicide data utilizing NIBRS data is possible, for this report it was also
assessed utilizing OCME data to go into in greater depth and is detailed later in this report.

Sorting the firearm data by reporting agency reveals that the larger cities have more crimes with firearms,
even when considering it on a per capita basis. This is the first time that Boston has not had the most firearm
incidents since the inception of this report, which utilized data going back to 2014. In this period,
Springfield reported 2,387 crimes with a firearm, followed by Boston (2,055), Worcester (676), Brockton
(604), Holyoke (537), New Bedford (426), Fall River (359), Lawrence (325) and Lowell (306). It should
be noted that although both cities were in the top 10, Worcester and Lowell failed to submit all twelve
months of 2023 data, so it is likely they would have even more incidents had the dataset been complete.
(See Appendix Table 1 for a complete Town / City list) Overall, this list remains incredibly consistent over
the reporting years. Springfield had consistently reported the second amount of firearm crimes until this
year, and their total has increased over 700 incidents vs 2018–2019. When rates of firearm incidents for
2023 are calculated per 100,000 residents, the numbers are similar, although Holyoke moves to the first
position with a rate of 888.13/100,000; followed by Springfield (867.48), Brockton (284.33) and Fitchburg
(239.29). Boston drops down to the 17th position when utilizing this method, while the small towns of

Southbridge, Bridgewater, Greenfield, Warren, Freetown, New Marlboro and Plympton moved into the top
20 on a per capita basis.
Homicides and Suicides with a Firearm
Homicides and suicides with a firearm were examined to determine the prevalence of firearm-related deaths
in the Commonwealth. Looking at the last five years, the average number of homicides with a firearm is
107 per year, while the average number of suicides is 142. On average, approximately 250 lives are taken
with a firearm every year in the Commonwealth, with the average age of a homicide victim being
approximately 31.6 years old, and the average age of a person committing suicide with a firearm is 52.4.
The average age of females committing suicide with a firearm is lower, where the 2020-2021 average was
46, while the male average was 53. Firearm-related deaths are far more common among males. Over the
last two years, 93% of suicides with a firearm have been committed by men, while 88% of victims fatally
shot by others have been men.

When looking at where these homicide incidents took place during 2022-2023, only five cities had more
than 10 firearm-related homicides: Boston (60), Springfield (45), Brockton (13), Worcester (12) and Lynn
(11). (See Appendix Table 2 for a complete list.) Boston, Springfield and Worcester are consistently on this
list. However, this is the first year for Worcester and Lynn. In 2020–2021, homicides with a firearm were
reported in 54 cities and towns. For 2022–2023, homicides with a firearm were reported in 52 jurisdictions.
Boston breaks down the city into police precincts. The precincts of B2, B3 and C11, which make up the
neighborhoods of Roxbury, Mattapan and Dorchester each also had over 10 homicides with a firearm. B2
(Roxbury), accounted for 12, while B3 (Mattapan and North Dorchester), had 19 homicides and C11
(Dorchester) had 15 homicides. (For a full list of Boston district homicides, see Appendix Table 2B).

Boston Shootings Data
Among the reporting agencies, Boston had the second-most firearms used in crimes, the most deaths, and
readily publishes data on shootings, so this data was chosen to be examined in further detail. For the past
five years, on average, 200 individuals have been shot in Boston per year. This number has come down by
over 25 victims since the previous report. These numbers have also fluctuated over the current five-year
span. 2023 resulted in the fewest total shootings, while 2021 had the fewest homicides. There was a
difference of 119 victims being shot between the high year of 2020 and the low year of 2023. 2022 and
2023 also represent the fewest total shootings since Boston Police began publishing data in 2015.

Firearm-Related Arrest Statistics
NIBRS data contains clearance information along with the firearm data. An incident can be “cleared” in
several ways. The most common way for a case to be cleared is with an arrest: the charging either of an
adult or juvenile. Another way a case can be cleared is by “exceptional clearance.” When a case is cleared
exceptionally, an arrest does not take place despite probable cause existing to make such an arrest. Reasons
for an exceptional clearance may include: death of an offender, the decision of the prosecutor not to go
forward, the offender is in custody in another jurisdiction, the victim refuses to cooperate, or a juvenile is
handled without being brought into custody. In 41.4% of the firearm offenses submitted, an arrest was made
or the offense was cleared exceptionally.

Prosecutions for Firearm Charges
For the time period of 2022-2023, 23,738 criminal charges related to firearms were brought forward in the
Commonwealth: 12,248 in 2022, and 11,490 in 2023. The most common charges did not change as
7 Firearm-Related Activity in MA | EOPSS

compared to the previous reporting period of 2020-2021. The seven most common charges still all have
above 800 total charges and range from over 4,000 charges to 840 charges. There was an increase in charges
between 2020–2021 vs 2022–2023 of 1,157 charges.

Crime Guns in Massachusetts
M.G.L. c. 140, § 131Q requires the entry of recovered crime guns into the Commonwealth Fusion Center’s
Crime Gun Tracking System. The law directs firearms licensing authorities within the Commonwealth to
annually report to the Colonel of the Massachusetts State Police certain data related to crime gun seizures
within their jurisdiction. For the years 2022 and 2023, information was submitted on 4,900 firearms and
arrests were made in approximately 73% of the seizures. The 4,900 recoveries were an increase of over 600
seizures vs the previous period of 2020-2021.

Data Source: ATF
It is often believed that the bulk of crime guns coming into the Northeast are brought up from the southern
states, however, for 2022 the top 3 states were within New England. Of the 3,665 firearms traced, 3,032
(83%) were determined to be handguns (pistol or revolver). Based upon these recoveries, the leading
calibers also corresponded to handguns, with the exception of the shotgun:
 9 mm (1630)  .380 cal (238)
 .40 cal. (329)  .38 cal (123)
 .22 cal. (298)  12 gauge (120)
 .45 cal. (244)
One measure that is often examined after a crime is how long after the original purchase of the firearm was
it used in a crime (time-to-crime). For 2022, the average for Massachusetts was 7.88 years, while the
national average was 6.34 years. Of the traced firearms in Massachusetts in 2022, 1,317 had a time-to-crime
of 3 years and over; 483 firearms had a time-to-crime of one year or under.
Firearm Licenses
Firearm licenses were examined several ways and all displayed similar trends across the years. When
reviewing new applications for the years 2010-2023, 2013 had significantly higher applications than every
other year with 41,427 applications. It should be noted that nationwide, at the time, 2013 had the highest
number of National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) checks in the history of the
program according to the FBI, which was indicative of higher gun sales nationwide. Following 2014, NICS
checks steadily increased. In 2020 and 2021, the FBI again reported its highest number of NICS background
checks with 39.6 million and 38.7 million. In 2022, this number fell off to approximately 31.6 million
checks. In Massachusetts, there was also a steep increase in new licenses. In 2020-2021, there were
approximately 98,704 new license applications received, while in 2022-2023 the numbers fell to 69,241
9 Firearm-Related Activity in MA | EOPSS

new applications. During the years, 2022-2022, over 178,000 applications for firearm licenses were
received and as of 1/1/24, over 542,000 licenses were active in the Commonwealth.

Firearm Sales
According to the Firearms Records Bureau data, firearm sales increased each year from 2006 to 2013, from
41,160 sales in 2006 to 110,350 sales in 2013. After 2013, the number of sales decreased to 102,081 in
2014 while 2015 produced 108,290 sales. The 2016 numbers were the highest the Firearms Record Bureau
has recorded while the 2017 numbers were more consistent with data from 2013-2015. The numbers
continued to decrease in 2018 and 2019 with dealer sales below 100,000. The 2020 and 2021 numbers
mirrored the license application numbers where there was a significant increase to over 140,000 dealer sales
in 2021. The 2022 and 2023 data fell to approximately 115,000 and 111,000 sales respectively. Personal
transfers have hovered between 20,000 - 25,000 transfers per year over the past ten years.
