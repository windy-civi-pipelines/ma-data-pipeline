Commonwealth Project Safe Neighborhood Initiative to the House and Senate Committees on
Ways and Means.
OGR is a state agency that is part of the Executive Office of Public Safety and Security (EOPSS).
EOPSS is responsible for the policy development and budget oversight of the secretariat’s
agencies, independent programs, and several boards which aid in crime prevention, homeland
security preparedness, and ensuring the safety of residents and visitors in the Commonwealth. The
agencies that fall under EOPSS are:
• Massachusetts State Police
• Massachusetts Emergency Management Agency
• Sex Offender Registry Board
• Department of Fire Services
• Department of Criminal Justice Information Services
• Department of Correction
• Parole Board
• Office of the Chief Medical Examiner
• State 911 Department
• Massachusetts State Police Crime Lab
• Municipal Police Training Committee
• Massachusetts National Guard
• Office of Grants and Research
• Massachusetts Public Safety Broadband Office
In addition to managing and administering state-funded criminal justice, homeland security, and
traffic safety grant programs, OGR is the State Administering Agency (SAA) for federal grant
funding received by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts from the Department of Justice (DOJ),
Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), and the National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration (NHTSA). In total, the agency manages more than $279 million in grant funds
annually. Additionally, OGR’s Research and Policy Analysis Division (RPAD), which houses the
Massachusetts Statistical Analysis Center, utilizes research and evaluation to promote public
safety in the Commonwealth by informing criminal justice and public safety policy. The goals of
the OGR include:
• Improving community safety and local preparedness by providing resources to
communities based on need;
• Investing in evidenced based innovative programs;
• Granting awards based on national and state priorities;
• Fostering collaboration across jurisdictions by delivering grant dollars with a regional
approach;
• Making funding decisions based upon research, empirical data, and best practices; and
• Ensuring the grant awarding process is transparent and in compliance with federal
and state guidelines.
This document serves as the report authored by OGR regarding the FY25 Commonwealth Project
Safe Neighborhood Initiative.
