The Office of Grants and Research (OGR) is pleased to submit this report on the FY25 Human
Trafficking Enforcement and Training Grant Program to the House and Senate Committees on
Ways and Means.
OGR is a state agency that is part of the Executive Office of Public Safety and Security (EOPSS).
EOPSS is responsible for the policy development and budget oversight of the secretariat’s
agencies, independent programs, and several boards which aid in crime prevention, homeland
security preparedness, and ensuring the safety of residents and visitors in the Commonwealth. The
agencies that fall under EOPSS are:
• Massachusetts State Police
• Massachusetts Emergency Management Agency
• Sex Offender Registry Board
• Department of Fire Services
• Department of Criminal Justice Information Services
• Department of Correction
• Parole Board
• Office of the Chief Medical Examiner
• State 911 Department
• Massachusetts State Police Crime Lab
• Municipal Police Training Committee
• Massachusetts National Guard
• Office of Grants and Research

In addition to managing and administering state-funded criminal justice, homeland security, and
traffic safety grant programs, OGR is the State Administering Agency (SAA) for federal grant
funding received by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts from the Department of Justice (DOJ),
Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), and the National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration (NHTSA). In total, the agency manages more than $279 million in grant funds
annually. Additionally, OGR’s Research and Policy Analysis Division (RPAD), which houses the
Massachusetts Statistical Analysis Center, utilizes research and evaluation to promote public
safety in the Commonwealth by informing criminal justice and public safety policy. The goals of
the OGR include:
• Improving community safety and local preparedness by providing resources to
communities based on need;
• Investing in evidenced based innovative programs;
• Granting awards based on national and state priorities;
• Fostering collaboration across jurisdictions by delivering grant dollars with a regional
approach;

• Making funding decisions based upon research, empirical data, and best practices; and
• Ensuring the grant awarding process is transparent and in compliance with federal and
state guidelines.
This document serves as the report regarding the FY25 Human Trafficking Enforcement and
Training Grant Program.
Program Overview
Pursuant to Fiscal Year 2025 General Appropriation Act, Chapter 140 of the Acts of 2024, OGR
released an Availability of Grant Funds (AGF) inviting district attorney’s offices to apply for
funding in support of their efforts to combat human trafficking and enhance their capacity to
identify, assist, and provide referral services to those most impacted. The relevant appropriation
language states:
8000-0605 For efforts to combat human trafficking, including a competitive grant program to
be administered by the executive office of public safety and security; provided, that not later
than March 3, 2025, the executive office shall submit a report to the house and senate
committees on ways and means detailing expenditures from this item, including a list of grant
recipients[.]
Preference was given to applications that demonstrated greatest need, outlined a comprehensive
plan proposing programs and activities that directly correlate to addressing such need, and
proposed activities that targeted geographical locations that demonstrated high-risk or high levels
of human trafficking. Applicants were permitted to sub-award funds to outside entities to assist
with any enforcement and suppression efforts, such as a local police department, as well as outside
entities to assist with prevention and intervention services such as a nonprofit that implements
survivor support programs within the county. OGR strongly encouraged applicants to demonstrate
a collaborative, community-wide stakeholder effort as part of their proposal.
Applicant Eligibility
Only a Massachusetts District Attorney’s Office was eligible to apply for this grant program,
though applicants were allowed to subaward funds to outside entities to assist in enforcement,
prevention and intervention efforts. Only one application per District Attorney’s office was
permitted.
Allowable Funding Purposes and Costs
Allowable expenses under this grant program included:
• Human Trafficking Special Prosecutor;
