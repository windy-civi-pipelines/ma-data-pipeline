hardening and other security enhancements to nonprofit organizations that are at high
risk of terrorist attacks or hate crimes, as defined under section 32 of chapter 22C of

and security shall submit a report to the house and senate committees on ways and
means that shall include, but not be limited to, the: (i) number of grant applicants; (ii)
successful grant applicants; (iii) criteria used to evaluate grant applications; and (iv)
amount of funds awarded to each grant recipient; provided further, that not less than
$50,000 shall be expended to the Springfield Jewish Community Center, Inc. in
Longmeadow to upgrade and purchase new lighting for the parking lot areas to ensure
safety and security; provided further, that not less than $500,000 shall be expended by
the executive office for a security personnel program to be piloted at nonprofits that
have demonstrated to be at high risk for terrorist attacks or hate crimes; and provided
further, that the participating nonprofits shall contribute matching funds to the pilot
program equal to $1 for every $1 contributed by the commonwealth.
Funding allocated by the Legislature was distributed through the FY25 Commonwealth Nonprofit
Security Grant Program and the FY25 Commonwealth Nonprofit Security Personnel Grant
Program.
Applicant Eligibility
Massachusetts 501(c)(3) nonprofit organizations were eligible to apply for both programs. A
nonprofit was required to demonstrate that they face a high risk of a terror attack or hate crime to
be eligible for funding. Only one application per nonprofit was accepted for consideration of
funding. A nonprofit was permitted to submit separate applications seeking funds for multiple
locations in separate communities.
Allowable Funding Purposes
For the Commonwealth Nonprofit Security Grant Program, applicants were permitted to request
funding for physical security enhancement equipment and/or inspection and screening systems.
Eligible purchases included but were not limited to exterior doors and door locks (with single
secure entry points), surveillance video cameras, site alarms, internal public address systems,
tourniquets or other emergency first aid equipment, security fencing, lighting, and access control
systems.
Organizations seeking funds through the Commonwealth Nonprofit Security Personnel Grant
Program were permitted to request funding for qualified and trained security personnel. Funds
could not be spent to purchase equipment, uniforms or other items for security personnel or for
services provided by on-duty law enforcement personnel.

Competitive application processes for both grant programs were held according to the following
schedule:

Of those applications, three were found to be duplicative and one applicant was ineligible for the
program. A total of 31 applications were received for the FY25 Commonwealth Nonprofit Security
Personnel Grant Program.

received and paid for within the anticipated grant period;
• A detailed, reasonable, and complete budget; and
• An overall assessment of applicant risk of hate crimes and terrorist incidents.

In accordance with the grant programs’ authorizing statute, an additional $50,000 was awarded to
the Springfield Jewish Community Center, Inc., in Longmeadow to allow for the purchase of
improved lighting for the organization’s parking area.
Disbursement
The full award amount was rendered once a contract was executed and all contract documents
approved. To help ensure compliance with grant rules and regulations, OGR scheduled a Technical
Assistance Webinar with all the awardees to review quarterly programmatic and financial
reporting.
A total of $235,000 was initially set aside for OGR administration but subsequently reduced to
$188,000 through mid-year cost saving efforts.
Contracting
In December 2024, all grant recipients were sent contracting materials. These materials included
a Standard Contract, Contractor Authorization Signature Listing Form, OGR Subrecipient Grant
Conditions, and additional materials.
Upon approval of the contracting forms, each grantee was sent a copy of its executed Standard
Contract, its formal notification to begin incurring costs.
