the terms of its organizational certificate were approved by the Commissioner of Insurance. As of
December 31, 1981, capital investments aggregating $100,000,000 were made by the then Partners
in the following amounts:

Our Investments to date total to 368 businesses located throughout the state. 274 of
these companies are small businesses and have received in aggregate . A business
description of investments completed during the past year is included in Appendix I. All
