Solar Canopy Working Group Supplemental Report
Executive Summary
The Massachusetts Solar Canopy Working Group convened in March 2025 under An
Act Promoting A Clean Energy Grid, Advancing Equity and Protecting Ratepayers
(”The 2024 Climate Act”) to develop recommendations to encourage the construction
and operation of solar power canopies across the Commonwealth. These structures –
typically installed over parking lots, transit hubs, and other developed spaces – can
generate clean electricity, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and provide valuable
co-benefits such as shading, snow and rain protection, and integration with electric
vehicle (EV) charging and energy storage.
Over the course of four public meetings and additional stakeholder outreach, the
Working Group examined financial, technical, and regulatory challenges, and studied
successful canopy projects in Massachusetts and beyond. This report discusses the
group’s findings, partially illustrated through two case studies, and provides detailed
recommendations to further unlock the potential of solar canopies to help meet the
state’s climate goals.
Background
The 2024 Climate Act directed the Department of Energy Resources (DOER) to
establish the Solar Canopy Working Group to “develop recommendations for
regulatory and legislative changes that may be necessary to encourage the
construction and operation of solar power generating canopies.” The Act called for
recommendations that contribute to greenhouse gas emission limits set under
Chapter 21N of the General Laws and support canopy development in a cost-
effective way.
The statute required the group’s report to be submitted by June 31, 2025. On June
30, DOER provided the Legislature with an initial report outlining the Working
Group’s substantial progress, its broad engagement with stakeholders, and its plan to
deliver a final supplemental report later in the year. That initial report highlighted
early findings, including that recent updates to the Solar Massachusetts Renewable
Target (SMART) program already address several key barriers by improving eligibility,
flexibility, and compensation for canopy projects. The group committed to finalizing
further policy and program recommendations in three main categories: financial
assistance, permitting and interconnection improvements, and additional supports.

Public Meetings & Outreach
The Solar Canopy Working Group met four times between March and June 2025 in a
hybrid format open to the public. Each meeting built upon the last, moving from
background and context to specific project examples and draft recommendations.
Kickoff – March 28, 2025
The brief kickoff meeting introduced the Working Group members, reviewed the
statutory charge, and confirmed the meeting schedule and scope of work. Members

discussed the state’s climate goals, the role of solar canopies in meeting them, and
the need to balance cost-effectiveness with public benefit. DOER staff presented a
high-level overview of current state policies affecting canopy development.
Meeting #1 – April 18, 2025
This session provided a deeper dive into current incentive structures and barriers to
canopy deployment. DOER presented on the SMART program, including incentive
adders for canopy projects and proposed updates under development. The group
also heard from DOER’s Leading by Example team on their experience assisting the
deployment of solar canopy projects on state-owned sites, including one sited at
Framingham State University. A representative from Solect Energy outlined common
challenges faced by canopy developers, including interconnection delays, high
upfront costs, and local permitting hurdles. The group discussed how these barriers
affect financing and project timelines.
Meeting #2 – April 25, 2025
The second full meeting highlighted innovative solar canopy designs and
applications. DOER shared examples of non-traditional canopy configurations, such
as those integrated into public plazas and bus stops. The group identified strengths,
weaknesses, opportunities, and threats within the Commonwealth’s solar canopy
landscape. Members discussed how standardizing design and safety guidelines
could reduce costs and improve permitting outcomes. Technical experts spoke about
the role of storage and EV charging in increasing project value, while municipal
representatives shared canopy development experiences in their communities.
Meeting #3 – May 9, 2025
This meeting centered on examining real-world case studies. Officials from the Town
of Lexington and the Town of Maynard presented on their municipal canopy projects,
detailing site selection, financing approaches, procurement strategies, and public
engagement. Both projects experienced interconnection challenges, which sparked
discussion about flexible interconnection standards and more predictable utility
timelines. The group also reviewed research, including a Yale University study on
Connecticut’s canopy potential and a Wired article on distributed solar trends.
Members noted the importance of aligning state incentives with actual economic
conditions to ensure project viability.
Meeting #4 – June 5, 2025
The final meeting focused on refining draft recommendations. DOER staff walked
members through a working draft, with structured discussion on financial assistance
mechanisms, permitting and interconnection improvements, and additional supports.

Public comment was invited; remarks included support for canopy adoption from
environmental advocates and suggestions for ensuring equitable access to benefits
across the Commonwealth. Members agreed on the need for clear guidance,
municipal technical assistance, and proactive public outreach to build awareness of
canopy benefits.
Additional Outreach
In addition to these public meetings, the Chair and DOER staff, including from the
newly established Clean Energy Siting & Permitting Division, conducted targeted
outreach to ensure all relevant perspectives were considered despite the tight
statutory timeline. This included additional research and conversations with:
• Senator Joanne Comerford and Representative Natalie Blais, sponsors of the
original legislative language creating the Working Group;
• Advocacy organizations, such as Elders Climate Action and Climate Action
Now;
• Researchers from Yale University and the University of Massachusetts;
• Staff from the University of Massachusetts, the Massachusetts Department of
Transportation, the Metropolitan Area Planning Council (MAPC), and the
Franklin Regional Council of Governments.
Feedback from these stakeholders informed the group’s deliberations and helped
ensure the recommendations addressed a broad range of technical, economic, and
community considerations.
Case Studies
Framingham State University Solar Canopy Project
Framingham State University recently completed the installation of a 720-kW solar
canopy over their Salem End parking lot, a $3 million project supported by a
$436,000 Leading by Example grant. Developed through a public–private
partnership, the canopy provides covered parking for students, faculty, and visitors,
along with four EV charging stations, pre-wiring for ten more, and battery storage.

The system is paired with roughly 750 kWh of battery storage, enabling it to produce
about 800,000 kWh of electricity each
year while providing backup power
during outages. In addition to lowering
greenhouse gas emissions, the project
is expected to save the university
approximately $300,000 over its 20-
year life. Its completion reflects a multi-
year effort involving campus
leadership, state officials, and local
partners to integrate renewable energy

without disrupting daily operations.
Lexington Police Station Solar Canopy Project
Lexington recently approved the
installation of a solar canopy over
part of its new police station’s
parking area. The project, funded
through municipal bonds, is
designed to resemble a
19th‑century train station to meet
Historic District Commission
requirements.

The system is paired with 750
kWh of battery storage to help the station meet its goal of net-zero operation by
enabling peak demand reduction, backup power, and fast charging for the
anticipated all-electric police vehicle fleet. The project will receive state incentives
across the SMART, Connected Solutions, Clean Peak Standard, and Alternative
Portfolio Standard programs. Despite difficult design constraints and with stakeholder
coordination, the project is currently projected to generate millions in positive cash
flow over its 30-year lifespan, with an estimated payback period of 10 years.
Findings and Recommendations
While recent updates to the SMART program address some of the largest barriers to
cost-effective canopy development, the Working Group identified additional steps to
6

Solar Canopy Working Group Supplemental Report
fully unlock the potential of these projects. Recommendations are grouped into three
categories.
Financial Assistance
• Support SMART program revisions, including the proposed annual
reassessment of base compensation and adder incentive levels based on real-
time economic trends. Ensure unique canopy types are eligible for SMART
incentive adders. Consider providing earlier incentive rate locks for public
entity projects. Consider improving the compensation structure for standalone
projects that captures the full value of solar canopy projects not serving on-site
load.
• Create a competitive grant program for innovative small-scale solar canopy
projects, including bus shelters, gazebos, and solar trees. Consider making
relevant technical assistance or engineering studies eligible for funding for
government entities. Consider providing preference to projects that use
registered apprenticeship programs and/or pay prevailing wages.
• Establish a state revolving loan fund to provide municipalities and other
government entities (including Councils of Governments) with assistance for
up-front development and capital expenses incurred during the development
of solar canopy projects.
• Support the ongoing statewide development of storage and electric vehicle
time-of-use rates and tariff schedules to sufficiently compensate the grid
benefits of peak demand reduction and fairly compensate for the grid impacts
of charging and discharging. Consider additional opportunities to compensate
standalone solar plus storage projects for their peak demand reduction to a
local area, including incorporating such projects into statewide integrated
resource planning.
• Exempt solar canopy projects from the individual and aggregate net metering
capacity limits for public facilities.
• Enact rules for an Electric Distribution Company (EDC) to share the capital
costs with and across developers of replacing service equipment (including
transformers), when an upgrade is needed to enable a beneficial distributed
energy resource project, if said equipment is under a minimum remaining
useful life.
• Develop a grant program to assist in the funding of technical feasibility,
review of easement and access rights, and utility interconnection studies for
qualified solar canopy applications.

Permitting and Interconnection Improvements
• Update the model local solar bylaw to include solar canopy projects and
conduct municipal outreach to facilitate its adoption. Consider including an
expedited permitting process for solar canopy projects sited on previously
developed land and determined by the local building commissioner to not
negatively impact drainage, traffic flow, or sight lines. Minimum setback
requirements for solar canopy projects should be established that are less than
those for large, ground-mounted solar projects. Consider, in the Green
Communities program or forthcoming Siting & Permitting regulations,
incentivizing or otherwise rewarding municipalities that adopt said model
bylaw.
• Develop state-recommended standards for height, materials, electrical
installation, and other safety concerns of solar canopy projects.
• Charge the Interconnection Implementation Review Group2 with
developing a consensus for statewide Flexible Interconnection standards.
• Encourage EDCs to create a standard Grant of Easement template, in
instances of project overlap with utility infrastructure, to provide landowners
with financeable site control while minimizing the likelihood of future
excavation.
• Authorize longer SMART application timelines and standard good cause
extensions for public entity projects.
• Enact rules for the EDCs to extend interconnection application timelines
and provide standard extensions for cause – including but not limited to
complications to site access, supply chain, and local permitting – for canopy
projects.
Additional Supports
• Consider a statewide mandate that a solar canopy feasibility study be
conducted, with reasonable exceptions, prior to new construction of parking
lots of a minimum size.
2 The Interconnection Implementation Review Group (IIRG) was established by the Department of
Public Utilities (DPU) through order 19-55-F on June 6, 2023. The IIRG’s scope is limited to Distributed
Generation (DG) interconnection in Massachusetts and processes overseen by the DPU.

Solar Canopy Working Group Supplemental Report
• Consider an amendment to the specialized opt-in stretch building code to
include solar canopy-readiness for new construction of parking lots of a
minimum size.
• Consider, if determined to be cost-effective, a statewide procurement of solar
canopy projects over private parking lots of a minimum size, as opted into by
the private landowners. Projects should align with Executive Orders 638 and
641, the 2024 Climate Act, and the 2018 Commonwealth Apprenticeship
Expansion Strategic Plan. Consider providing preference for vendors that use
registered apprenticeship programs.
• Conduct a study, in collaboration with an academic research partner (e.g.
University of Massachusetts’ Clean Energy Extension), on the indirect impacts
of solar canopy projects including to the urban heat island effect, fleet
maintenance, embodied carbon, and water evaporation.
• Produce an addendum report to the Technical Potential of Solar Study to
specifically identify and quantify the potential for solar canopies over parking
lots across the Commonwealth.
• Publicize solar canopy success stories, especially projects conducted by
municipalities.
• Create a guide for developing solar canopy projects, with particular
explanation of how to develop canopy-based microgrids with storage and
electric vehicle charging infrastructure. Include a directory of existing projects
to date. Support and participate in MAPC’s forthcoming development of a
solar canopy resource guide.
• Offer technical assistance for designing and developing solar canopy
microgrids, with storage and electric vehicle charging infrastructure.
• Support MassDOT’s feasibility study to procure solar within their right-of-way,
including but not limited to solar canopies over highways, medians, and rest
area parking lots. Fund feasible and cost-effective projects in a timely manner.
Conclusion
The Solar Canopy Working Group’s recommendations are designed to remove
barriers and accelerate the adoption of solar canopies in Massachusetts. By focusing
on financial incentives, technical assistance, streamlined permitting, improved

interconnection processes, and additional support measures, the Commonwealth can
unlock the full potential of these projects.
Solar canopies turn existing developed areas into clean energy assets; helping
Massachusetts meet its climate targets, strengthening the electric grid, and creating
visible, tangible examples of the clean energy transition in communities across the
state.
