Honorable Clerk of the House, Clerk of the Senate, Senate Ways and Means Committee Chair
and members, and House Ways and Means Committee Chair and members,
Pursuant to subsection (e) of Section 2EEEEEE of Chapter 29 of the Massachusetts General
Laws, as inserted by Chapter 214 of the Acts of 2024, An Act to Provide for Competitiveness and
Infrastructure Investment in Massachusetts (the “Act”) and with Section 3 of the Act, I write to
report on the activities of and expenditures from the Commonwealth Federal Match and Debt
Reduction Fund (the “Fund”) for debt defeasance and matching funds for federal programs as of
June 30, 2025.
State Match
The Act aims to enhance the competitiveness of Massachusetts in winning federal funds and to
provide for the infrastructure needs of the Commonwealth. It makes up to $750 million available
in the form of matching funds and technical assistance for Massachusetts entities competing for
federal funds. It also provides tools to help reduce the Commonwealth’s indebtedness.
The Executive Office for Administration and Finance (“A&F”) has effectively leveraged this
historic legislation to support critical investments in Massachusetts. To date, we have made
commitments to or advanced the review of applicants to the Fund that further key administration
goals. This activity includes, but is not limited to, more than $342 million toward economic
development projects, more than $150 million toward transportation projects, and more than
$35 million toward climate-focused projects.

Additionally, $72 million of the total funds we have committed or advanced in review are
dedicated to municipalities across the state to support their efforts to make our roads safer, our
firefighters better equipped to respond to emergencies, and our schools more energy efficient.
The following table summarizes state commitments and federal dollars leveraged along with
resulting expenditures made to successful awardees of federal programs.

Reducing the Commonwealth’s Indebtedness
The Act also authorizes expenditures from the Fund for reducing the Commonwealth’s
indebtedness through varied means, including the defeasance of outstanding bonds. A&F,
working closely with the MBTA and the Treasurer’s Office, strategically leveraged this
authorization to pay off approximately $200 million in outstanding debt that would have
otherwise been repaid through the operating budgets of the MBTA and the Commonwealth.
Specifically, funds were used to defease Commonwealth General Obligation bonds used to fund
various capital projects throughout Massachusetts and Commonwealth-guaranteed General
Transportation System Bonds issued by the MBTA for transit projects. In addition to generating
budgetary savings, these bond defeasances also reduced the Commonwealth’s overall long-term
liabilities, which rating agencies and investors consider when analyzing the Commonwealth’s
credit.
