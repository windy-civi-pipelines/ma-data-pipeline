Deliverable #1: Defining Primary
Care Services, Codes, and Providers
Introduction
High-quality primary care encompasses an array of vital services that can meaningfully shape patient
outcomes and can lower overall health care expenditures while improving population health. The core
functions that characterize effective, person-centered primary care are first-contact care, continuity of care,
comprehensive care, and coordination of care.1 These four pillars of primary care represent the foundation of
a high-functioning health care system, yet primary care remains both overburdened and undervalued in
Massachusetts and throughout the United States.
Data-driven policy changes, investments, and market reforms are needed to address these significant
challenges and improve the Commonwealth’s primary care system. Recent research by the Massachusetts
Health Policy Commission (HPC) found that primary care spending in Massachusetts grew half as fast as
spending on all other medical services from 2017-2022, 11.8 percent compared to 24.7 percent.2
Transparent, comprehensive expenditure data on primary care services in Massachusetts are essential to
inform these reforms, and are also critical for setting and tracking investment improvement targets.
Understanding the importance of measuring primary care for evidence-based reforms, nearly 20 states have
developed methods for measuring primary care spending. While there is no national consensus for measuring
primary care spending and variation exists in data specifications across states (e.g. California, Connecticut,
and Rhode Island), total primary care expenditures are generally measured by collecting data on primary care
services delivered by primary care providers.3 In Massachusetts, the Center for Health Information and
Analysis (CHIA) measures primary care spending using a similar means.
CHIA’s methodology for measuring primary care expenditures was developed in 2019 by leveraging standard
billing codes, aligning with other states’ approaches, and a public listening session with stakeholders.4 Since
2020, CHIA has collected summary-level data from health insurers to measure overall spending on primary
care and behavioral health services covered by insurance. The recent Massachusetts Primary Care Dashboard
published by CHIA in collaboration with the Massachusetts Health Quality Partners found that, in 2023, the
share of primary care spending declined across payer types, with the exception of MassHealth, which had the
highest percentage of spending on primary care (7.5 percent).5
Once a method for measurement is established, many states have pursued investment targets for primary
care system improvement. This is a topic of active consideration by the Massachusetts Primary Care Access,

Delivery, and Payment Task Force (PCTF) and recommendations for a primary care spending target will be
forthcoming, pursuant to Chapter 343 of the Acts of 2024. The PCTF is charged with developing a series of
recommendations to stabilize and strengthen the primary care system across Massachusetts, including the
first statutory deliverable to define primary care services, codes, and providers in Massachusetts outlined
below.
Primary Care Task Force Recommendation: Statutory Deliverable #1
CHIA has already developed and implemented a highly credible and robust process for defining and
measuring primary care spending in Massachusetts. The PCTF recommends that Massachusetts rely on
CHIA’s technical expertise and experience to continue this foundational measurement work, critical for
informing policies to increase investment in primary care and other strategies to strengthen primary care
access, delivery, and financial stability. To effectuate this goal, the PCTF further recommends the following:
• Designated Agency: The Legislature should codify CHIA as the agency responsible for defining,
measuring, and reporting on primary care spending in Massachusetts and authorize CHIA to require
such reporting from payers and providers as is necessary for these purposes.
• Transparent Methodology: The Legislature should require that CHIA develop and publicly post its
detailed methodology and data specifications for defining and measuring primary care spending
based on summary level reporting from commercial and public payers. The methodology should
incorporate a designated list of primary care services by codes, a list of provider types, and non-claims
payments to support primary care. In developing the methodology, CHIA should be informed by
methodologies used in other states, and to the extent appropriate, should align its methodology with
those used in other states, particularly those used in neighboring states, to allow for cross-state
comparisons. CHIA should include a comparison of its methodology to alternative approaches. CHIA
should finalize data specifications and require data collection within six months of the legislation’s
effective date.
• Annual Review Process: The Legislature should require that CHIA establish an annual process for
reviewing and revising as necessary its methodology for measuring primary care spending. The
process should include consultation with a Primary Care Advisory Body, other states, and experts.
• New Primary Care Technical Advisory Body. The Legislature should establish an ongoing primary care
technical advisory body to advise and provide technical input on CHIA’s data specifications,
methodology, measurement, and reporting. The Legislature should consider including the following
members to the advisory body: primary care providers, behavioral health providers, health systems,
community health centers, health plans, and government agency representatives, including HPC,
MassHealth, the Department of Public Health, the Division of Insurance, and technical experts in
health care spending measurement.
• Annual Reporting: The Legislature should require CHIA to report annually on spending on primary care
in Massachusetts, including as a share of total statewide health care expenditures, by member, by
insurance type, by a range of age groups, by payer, and managing clinician group6. HPC should include
primary care spending trends in its annual cost trends report, including complementary analyses
based on data from the All-Payer Claims Database (APCD), and make corresponding policy
recommendations.7
6 “Managing clinician group” has historically been referred to as “managing physician group” in CHIA and HPC reports.
7 If, in any year, CHIA makes substantial changes to their methodology for defining and measuring primary care, CHIA
should note caveats and implications for longitudinal analysis public report notes.
- 2 -

• Spending Target Measurement: CHIA’s annual reporting should be used for the purposes of setting a
primary care spending target (to be further defined by the PCTF in deliverable #3). CHIA should
consider the inclusion of pharmaceutical spending data as appropriate in the calculation in order to
ensure clear incentives and accountability for the state, market actors, and the public to be able to
track meaningful progress on spending targets (as recommended by the PCTF).
Summary of Current CHIA Methodology and Annual Update Process
• Modular Methodology: CHIA calculates spending on primary care by first classifying if the service is
(1) a specified service type (based on CPT/HPCPCS code) and (2) delivered by a primary care provider
type (based on taxonomy code). Service types and provider categories (physician, other professional,
facility) are modular and can be included or excluded in the total primary care measurement based on
purpose.
• Service Classification: The service types include problem-focused office visits, preventive office visits,
chronic care management, immunizations/injections, home/nursing facility visits, screenings and
assessments, and integrated behavioral health care. (Link to full list service codes available here
(pages 46-48). Also attached as appendix A.
• Provider Types: The designated provider types include a range of provider specialties including family
medicine, internal medicine, general practice, pediatrics, OB/GYN, adolescent, and geriatric medicine.
Professionals include physicians, registered nurses, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants.
(Link to full list provider types available here (pages 48-50). Also attached as appendix A.
• Insurance Type Covered: CHIA’s primary care analysis includes ~80% of Massachusetts residents
with primary medical coverage through private commercial insurance (including self- and fully insured,
and Connector plans), MassHealth, Medicare Advantage, and Senior Care Options (SCO), One Care,
Programs for All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly (PACE)
• CHIA’s current annual calendar for collecting and reporting on is detailed below:
Timeline Activity
Summer CHIA releases updated draft data specifications for comment period
Fall Payers report data to CHIA
CHIA performs QA and releases results to payers and providers
Spring Report released
Additional Policy Considerations
In developing this recommendation, the PCTF discussed a number of known limitations with the current
methodology as well as further considerations which CHIA should explore and seek to address in the future, to
the extent feasible, including:
• Inclusion of Original Medicare Data: While Medicare Advantage members as well as dually eligible
members are included in CHIA’s primary care spend methodology, primary care services covered by
original Medicare is excluded due to data availability. CHIA can explore Centers of Medicare and
Medicaid Services (CMS) data sources.
• Identification, measurement, and inclusion of services for patients that are delivered by primary
care providers but are not billed through insurance codes: Primary care providers often provide
- 3 -

services for which they are unable to bill through insurance, such as answering messages submitted
by patients through electronic patient portals after hours, providing behavioral supports or treatment
plan consultation with schools or other care team members, or assisting with social and behavioral
resource navigation. CHIA should explore ways to measure this unbilled primary care work.
• Consider inclusion of other professionals that provide services in a primary care setting: Non-
physician professionals, such as social workers, care coordinators, clinical pharmacists or patient
navigators may be members of care teams who provide services that enhance patient-centered
primary care delivery. CHIA should explore capturing delivery of these services as part of primary care
spending.
• Inclusion of spending on behavioral health integration and associated time spent on care delivery:
In addition to including behavioral health screenings and services, such as medication management,
CHIA should consider behavioral health services delivered through an integrated behavioral health
model in primary care spending.
• Measuring spending for primary care providers engaged in direct contracts with employers or who
offer services that are not reimbursed through the health insurance plans (e.g. direct primary care,
concierge): The market for concierge medicine and direct primary care has been increasing.8 As more
clinician and consumers opt for these models, CHIA may explore methods for measuring this
spending.
• Inclusion of OB/GYN provider spending only for primary care services (e.g. wellness visits but not
childbirth): Because most maternity care payments use global codes, CHIA’s current methodology
includes both pre-natal visits and labor and delivery services in primary care spending. CHIA should
consider refining the methodology to exclude childbirth.

examples, see page 28 of this manual.
• CHIA is newly including facility claims associated with free-standing or provider-based federally qualified health centers (FQHCs)
and outpatient hospital primary care delivery. Please see the Facility Claims Guidelines in section 4 of this data specification manual
for more information on identifying primary care facility claims.
2. Introduction
There is emerging interest in the Commonwealth to better measure expenditures on primary care and behavioral health services, as
reflected in recently enacted legislation, recommendations from state agencies, as well as support from patient advocates. These service
categories comprise an array of vital services that can meaningfully shape patient outcomes and are often associated with lower costs
and higher quality.
In 2025, Massachusetts enacted Chapter 343: An Act Enhancing the Market Review Process, which in addition to other market oversight
expansions, created a task force to study primary care access, delivery, and payment in the Commonwealth. Chapter 343 also charged
CHIA with collecting “data or information necessary for the Task Force to fulfill its duties…” and making this information publicly
available.1
1 Chapter 343 of the Acts of 2024 “An Act Enhancing the Market Review Process.” Available at https://malegislature.gov/Laws/SessionLaws/Acts/2024/Chapter343.
3

Additionally, in 2022, Massachusetts enacted Chapter 177: An Act Addressing Barriers to Care for Mental Health, expanding access to
behavioral health services, supporting the behavioral health workforce, and, among other initiatives, charging CHIA with monitoring
“costs, cost trends, price, quality, utilization, and patient outcomes related to behavioral health service subcategories.”2 Behavioral health
service subcategories include, but are not limited to: mental health, substance use disorder, outpatient, inpatient, services for children,
services for adults, and provider types as defined in M.G.L. c. 12C, § 10 Section 21A.
Consistent with CHIA’s mission to create and curate data assets that support evidence-based policy making and program oversight, the
agency is collecting more detailed information about primary care and behavioral health spending in the Commonwealth. The data
specifications outlined below supports these directives from the legislature, as well as and other future initiatives and policies related to
primary care and behavioral health.
Regulation 957 CMR 2.00 governs the methodology and filing requirements for health care payers to calculate and report this data to
CHIA. This Data Specification Manual provides additional technical details to assist payers in reporting and filing this data.
Payers are required to submit one Primary Care & Behavioral Health Expenditures (PCBH) file to CHIA annually: the file must include
final data for the prior calendar year. In the 2025 collection year, CHIA is requesting payers to submit final data for dates of service
in CY2024, with the option to submit CY2023 and CY2022 to correct any previous data submission errors. Files will contain
different tabs, including:
• Front page, including data confirmation, payer comments, and supplemental data collection
• Supplemental telehealth collection by service type
• Primary Care & Behavioral Health expenses by managing physician group
• Member months by managing physician group
• Summary tab, which automatically calculates totals with inputted data from the data entry tab
3. File Submission Instructions and Schedule
Payers will submit data using the Excel template provided using CHIA’s online submission platform at

Payers will submit PCBH information in accordance with regulation 957 CMR 2.00 on the following schedule:
Date Files Due
October 15, 2025 Required
• CY 2024 Final PCBH
Data Validation and Verification
Within the template, Tab E automatically calculates totals with data entered in Tabs C and D. It is the responsibility of the data
submitter to review this summarized information for accuracy before submitting the data to CHIA. In addition, the total expenditures
for a given physician group should equal the total expenditures for that same physician group as reported in the Total Medical
Expenses/Alternative Payment Methods (TME-APM) submission. CHIA will compare the totals reported in the PCBH data file and
the TME-APM data file to confirm consistency.
4. Data Submission Guidelines
4a. Overview
In accordance with 957 CMR 2.00, payers must report expenditures, including claims and non-claims-based payments, made to
providers for their member populations. These expenditures will be reported by mutually exclusive mental health (MH), substance use
disorders (SUD), primary care, or other service categories using the detailed code sets provided by CHIA. Expenditures will be
attributed to the members managing physician group, as applicable, regardless of whether that physician group delivered the services.
5

Expenses in the PCBH data submission should separately include incurred amount and member cost-sharing. For claims-based
spending, the sum of the total payer liability and member cost share columns should equal allowed claims. Payers should include only
information pertaining to Massachusetts residents, members for which they are the primary payer, and exclude any paid claims for
which it was the secondary or tertiary payer. Allowed claims should not be capped or truncated and should represent claims prior to the
impact of any reinsurance.
When reporting non-claims payments by the mental health, substance use disorders, primary care, or all other services categories, payers
should make determinations based on their contracts to report non-claims payments into the appropriate service area and non-claims
specific category. For payments that are unable to be separated out into mental health, substance use disorders, or primary care, the “all
other services” category should be used. For payments that may combine or be related to the provision of both primary care and mental
health and substance use disorders, payers should apportion or allocate payments into the primary care, mental health, and substance use
disorders service types; these payments should not be double counted. For all other non-claims payments that do not fall into one of the
aforementioned categories, the “all other services” category may be used.
When reporting capitation arrangements, payers should use fee-for-service (FFS) equivalents rather than reporting the arrangements
within the Non-Claims categories. Any balance can be included in the Non-Claims field.
Physician Group Guidelines
• Payers shall report Primary Care & Behavioral Health expenditures by Physician Group according to the following categorization of
Massachusetts resident members as of December 31st of the reporting year. Member months and spending for members who were
attributed to more than one physician group in a calendar year should be allocated based on the number of months associated with
each physician group:
1. Massachusetts members required to select a primary care provider (PCP) by plan design (as reported in all previous TME
filings)
2. Members not included in (1) who were attributed during the reporting year to a PCP, pursuant to a risk contract between
the payer and provider.
6

3. Members not included in (1) or (2), attributed to a PCP by the payer’s own attribution methodology3
4. Members not attributable to a PCP (aggregate line)
• Payers must calculate and report Primary Care & Behavioral Health expenses by Physician Group for any Physician Group for which
the payer has 36,000 Massachusetts resident member months or more for the specified reporting period. The number of member
months is determined by summing the total member months for a given product type and insurance category for the Physician
Group. Payers must report the CHIA numeric identifier, the “OrgID,” for all Physician Groups. Refer to Appendix A, Physician
Group OrgID List, for this identifier.
• Data must be reported in aggregate for all practices in which the Physician Group’s member months are below 36,000. This group is
to be identified as “Groups below minimum threshold” with an OrgID of 999996.
• Payers must report all incurred and member cost-sharing amounts for members regardless of whether services are provided by
providers located in Massachusetts.
Mutually Exclusive Guidelines
As outlined on pages 43 to 44 of the data specification manual, there is an established hierarchical structure for the allocation of
spending through the mental health, SUD, primary care, and all other service categories. Allocation of spending should be distinct
and mutually exclusive. For example, claims marked as MH ED/Observation should not appear in the MH Outpatient category.
Facility Claims Guidelines
For claims categorized to the MH/SUD Inpatient, MH/SUD Emergency Department/Observation, and MH/SUD outpatient facility
categories, the logic requires that the entire claim, including all claim lines, be attributed to the same service category. In the example
provided below (sourced from CHIA’s E-APCD data warehouse), although claim line 4 was the only claim line related with Emergency
Department/Observation facility, spending for the entire claim should be reported in the Emergency Department/Observation service
category.
3 Chapter 224 of the Acts of 2012 amended chapters 175 and 176 of the Massachusetts General Laws (M.G.L.) to stipulate that “to the maximum extent possible
[carriers] shall attribute every member to a primary care provider.” Please see M.G.L. C. 175 §108L, C. 176A §36, C. 176B §23, C. 176G §31 , and C. 176J §16.
7

4b. Capturing Behavioral Health Spending in Primary Care
Payers shall report payments identified in the following three categories to capture behavioral health services delivered in primary care
settings
• MH Outpatient: Primary Care Provider
• SUD Outpatient: Primary Care Provider
• Primary Care Behavioral Health Screening
Payments reported in each of these categories should be distinct from each other and not overlap. Payments should only include
professional claims. Payments reported in each of these categories will be summed to calculate Behavioral Health Spending in Primary
Care.
Payments reported in these categories also should be distinct from and not overlap other MH, SUD, or Primary Care categories. Payments
reported as MH Primary Care will be summed with other MH payments to calculate total spending on Mental Health services. Payments
reported as SUD Primary Care will be summed with other SUD payments to calculate total spending on Substance Use Disorder services.
4c. Capturing Primary Care Facility Claims
CHIA is including facility claims associated with free-standing or provider-based federally qualified health centers (FQHCs) and
outpatient hospital primary care delivery.
1. Outpatient Hospital Primary Care Delivery: To identify split claims billing for primary care practices owned by a hospital, please
complete the following steps:
8

a. Identify professional claims using the CHIA methodology that include place of service codes 19 (Off campus outpatient
hospital) and 22 (on campus outpatient hospital). Note: These place of service codes are already included in CHIA’s primary
care place of service code set.
b. For these professional claims where an office or wellness visit is coded with place of service 19 or 22 include facility claims that
meet the following criteria to identify primary care facility spend:
i. Claim is for the same member, payer, and date of service.
ii. The type of bill is Outpatient Hospital (13) A hospital outpatient clinic visit for assessment and management of a
patient (G0463) is identified. Note: This office type visit is included in CHIA’s primary care services code set.
iii. A hospital outpatient clinic visit for assessment and management of a patient (G0463) is identified. Note: This office
type visit is included in CHIA’s primary care services code set.
c. Include the spending associated with the service line for G0463.
2. Federally Qualified Health Center Primary Care Delivery: To identify facility claims where primary care has been provided by free-
standing or provider-based FQHCs, please complete the following steps:
a. Limit claims to those with a type of bill code that starts with 77.
b. Include only claims with HCPCS codes listed in CHIA’s primary care services (CPT PC) code set.
c. Include claims where the attending provider is listed in CHIA’s primary care provider types code set.
4d. Capturing Primary Care Minor Procedures Spending and Member Months
The codes listed below are intended to be used as guides and may not be exhaustive of all codes related to Primary Care Minor
Procedures. Please use the codes below to fill out Table A.3 Primary Care Minor Procedures on the front page of CHIA’s payer

Service Categories
General definitions of each service category are described below; however, payers should classify claims-based expenditures based on the
standard code sets provided by CHIA; coding logic and summaries of these sets are included in Appendix D. A reference table of all codes
is included in Appendix B. Expenditures shall be categorized into mutually-exclusive, hierarchal categories that distinguish: (1) Mental
Health Services, (2) Substance Use Disorder Services, (3) Primary Care Services and (4) All Other Services. Note that not all categories will
be applicable to each reported Physician Group; data submitters should only report lines for service categories that had expenditures.
Service categories for non-claims payments are included in each service type. If non-claims based payments cannot be attributed to mental
health, substance use disorders, or primary care service categories, all non-claims payments should be reported in the appropriate All
Other Services non-claims categories.
Mental Health (MH): Mental health services are classified based on ICD-10-CM Principal Diagnosis Code and combinations of Current
Procedure Terminology (CPT) Codes, Revenue Codes and Place of Service (POS) Codes. The logic for classifying MH services delivered
in a Primary Care (PC) setting also includes restriction by Provider Type. Data submitters will report expenses within the following
mutually exclusive spending service categories, based on logic outlined in Appendix D.
• MH Inpatient: All payments made for claims associated with services provided at an acute or non-acute inpatient facility with a
mental health principal diagnosis.
• MH Emergency Department and Observation: All payments made for emergency or observation services in an acute or
nonacute facility for claims with a mental health principal diagnosis.
• MH Outpatient: Primary Care Provider: Payments for outpatient MH face-to-face and telehealth services, including evaluation
and management and integrated mental health primary care services, with a mental health diagnosis and delivered by a primary
care provider included in Appendix D. Ancillary services should be excluded.
• MH Outpatient: Non-Primary Care Provider: Payments for outpatient MH specific services, including evaluation and
management, intensive outpatient services, and other diversionary care and residential treatment with a mental health principal
diagnosis, not included in MH Emergency Department and Observation and delivered by any provider type except primary care.
This category excludes care classified as MH Emergency Department and Observation and MH Primary Care. Ancillary services
should be excluded.
28

• MH Prescription Drugs: All payments made for prescription drugs prescribed to address mental health needs, based on the
specified set of National Drug Codes (NDC) listed in Appendix B.
• Non-Claims Population Health and Practice Infrastructure Payments: All prospective, non-claims payments paid to
healthcare providers or organizations to support specific care delivery goals; not tied to performance metrics. Does not include
costs associated with payer personnel, payer information technology systems or other internal payer expenses. Examples include
but are not limited to payments for care management, care coordination, population health, medication reconciliation, primary care
and behavioral health integration, social care integration, practice transformation, or EHR/HIT infrastructure and other data
analytics payments.
• Non-Claims Performance Payments: All bonus payments paid to healthcare providers or organizations for reporting data or
achieving specific goals for quality, cost reduction, equity, or another performance achievement domain. Examples include but are
not limited to retrospective and/or prospective incentive payments for pay-for reporting or pay-for performance.
• Non-Claims Shared Savings Payments and Recoupments: All payments to healthcare providers or organizations (or recouped
from healthcare providers or organizations) based on performance relative to a defined spending target. Shared savings payments
and recoupments can be associated with different types of budgets, including but not limited to episode of care and total cost of
care. Dollars reported in this category should reflect only the non-claims shared savings payment or recoupment, not the fee-for-
service component. Recouped dollars should be reported as a negative value. Examples include but are not limited to procedure-
related, episode-based payments with shared savings or risk of recoupments, condition-related, episode-based payments with
shared savings or risk of recoupments, or risk for total cost of care with shared savings or risk of recoupments.
• Non-Claims Capitation and Full Risk Payments: All per capita, non-claims payments paid to healthcare providers or
organizations to provide a defined set of services to a designated population of patients over a defined period of time. Examples
include but are not limited to payments for primary care capitation, professional capitation, facility capitation, behavioral health
capitation, global capitation, or payments to integrated, comprehensive payment and delivery systems.
• Non-Claims Other Payments: Any other payments to a healthcare provider or organization not made on the basis of a claim for
health care benefits and/or services that cannot be properly classified elsewhere. This may include retroactive denials,
overpayments, and payments made as the result of an audit.

Payers should report physician group data based on their individual contracting structures with
providers.
Appendix B: Service Categorization Code Lists
Please visit: https://www.chiamass.gov/payer-data-reporting-primary-and-behavioral-health-care-
expenditures.
Payers should use these lists as reference tables in conjunction with the methodology and
coding logic outlined in Appendices C and D. Note, these reference tables separately identify
service codes and provider types to facilitate data compilation; however, for categorization of
claims, payers should follow the methodology outlined in Appendix D, in which claims are
categorized by combinations of service codes and provider types.

Appendix C: Payment Allocation Methodology
C.1: Medical Claims Allocation
Allocate spending sequentially through the specific service categories based on the code sets available in Appendices B&D
43

C.2: Pharmacy Claims Allocation
Allocate pharmacy claims spending based on the NDC codes provided in Appendix B.
C.3: Non-Claims Allocation
Allocate non-claims payments into the below categories by service type. If non-claims cannot be separated into Behavioral Health or Primary
Care, the “All Other” service type should be used in combination with the spending categories below. For payments that may combine or be
related to the provision of both primary care and behavioral health services, payers may apportion or allocate payments into the primary care
and behavioral health service types; these payments should not be double counted. Alternately, the “all other services” categories may be
used.

Appendix D: Summary of Code Lists and Coding Logic
The tables below summarize the code lists found in Appendix B, and include the combinations of code type required for spending service categories
within each Service Type. For “professional” measure categories below, it should be noted that physician and other professional types are reported
separately using the provider type field outlined in the Data Dictionary.
