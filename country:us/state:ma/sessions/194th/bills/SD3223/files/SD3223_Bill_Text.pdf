Dear Chair Rausch, Chair Lewis, and members of the Joint Committee on Municipalities and Regional
Government:
The Massachusetts Department of Agricultural Resources submits the following report on the licensing of
kennels in Massachusetts to the Joint Committee on Municipalities and Regional Government, in accordance
with Chapter 213 of the Acts of 2024:
Not later than July 1, 2025, the department shall file a report with the joint committee on municipalities and
regional government on the number of kennel licenses issued, the type of kennel licenses issued,
municipalities not in compliance with the license requirements and any related legislative
recommendations.
The breakdown of kennel licenses issued are:
• Total Kennels Reported in Massachusetts – 1,370
• Commercial Boarding and Training Kennels – 415
• Commercial Breeder Kennels – 41
• Domestic Charitable Corporation Kennel – 31
• Personal Kennels – 822
• Veterinary Kennels – 23
• Unspecified kennel type – 38
In regard to compliance:
• 229 Municipalities provided an acceptable report to the Department by June 1, 2025.
• 107 Municipalities failed to provide any data related to the issuance of kennel licenses within their
respective cities and towns.
• An additional 15 Municipalities attempted to provide records, but they were in an unsupported format
and could not be read by the Department and so are considered to be non-compliant.
• The towns that failed to respond or responded with data that could not be read, are:
o Acton, Acushnet, Adams, Agawam, Amesbury, Athol, Auburn, Avon, Ayer, Barre, Becket,
Bedford, Blackstone, Braintree, Bridgewater, Brimfield, Brockton, Brookfield, Brookline,
Carlisle, Cheshire, Chester, Chilmark, Colrain, Conway, Deerfield, Dennis, Dover, East
Bridgewater, East Longmeadow, Florida, Framingham, Gill, Gloucester, Gosnold, Grafton,
Halifax, Hancock, Haverhill, Holland, Hopedale, Hubbardston, Hull, Kingston, Lawrence, Lee,
Lenox, Lexington, Lincoln, Longmeadow, Lowell, Lynn, Lynnfield, Malden, Marlborough,

Marshfield, Maynard, Melrose, Middlefield, Millville, Monroe, Monson , Montague, Monterey,
Nahant, Nantucket, New Ashford, New Bedford, New Braintree, New Salem, North Adams,

Whitman, Wilbraham, Winthrop.
The statute does not provide any enforcement authority to the Department. Given the large number of towns out
of compliance, consideration should be given to this addition.
Sincerely,
Ashley Randle
Commissioner
