Number of Upgrades Completed and Certified in Accordance with the Act
The requirement to upgrade home heating systems to prevent releases took effect of September
30, 2011. The requirement was originally set to take effect on July 1, 2010, but the date was
extended in 2010. The certifications of the upgrades are filed with the local fire departments in
each city and town. The Department is unable to provide information as to the number of
certifications that have been made.
Number of Liquid Fuel Endorsements Purchased by Homeowners in the Previous Year
Effective July 1, 2010, insurers licensed to write and engage in writing home insurance in
Massachusetts were required to make available liquid fuel endorsements to homeowners
whose home heating oil systems comply with the upgrades required by Chapter 453. Purchase
of such liquid fuel endorsements by homeowners is optional. The Division of Insurance collects
data on the number of liquid fuel endorsements purchased or renewed each calendar year from
the Fair Access to Insurance Requirements (FAIR) Plan and the top 25 insurance companies
writing home insurance coverage in Ma ssachusetts in the past year and provides this data to the
Department for inclusion in this annual report.
2 The 2011 release numbers include 20 releases associated with the tornado and flooding events in western and central
Massachusetts in June and August of that year.

As indicated in the “Annual Change in the Number of Liquid Fuel Policy Holders with Statutory
Coverage” graph and the data in Table 1 below, the Division of Insurance reported a drop in the
number of liquid fuel policies during each calendar year for which it has tracked this information,
pursuant to section 7 of Chapter 453, between the years of 2012 and 2018. In calendar year
2019, the annual change in the number of policyholders with statutory coverage increased for
the first time by 14%3 and increased each year through 2023. In calendar year 2024, the annual
change in the number of policyholders with statutory coverage decreased by 3.2%.

3 The annual increase in the number of policyholders with statutory coverage starting in calendar year 2019 likely reflects local
television reports and related print news articles which have highlighted the financial and emotional impact of home heating oil spills
on uninsured Massachusetts homeowners and encouraged homeowners to add the optional coverage for oil spills to their home
insurance plans. Initial report: C10 Boston, February 4, 2019, “Costly Heating Oil Spill Nightmares Leave Homeowners Devastated”

* This reports the number of endorsements reported to the Division of Insurance by the top 25 home insurance
carriers and the FAIR Plan. The number of year-end policies differs from what was reported for the start of the
following calendar year due to shifts in which companies are part of the top 25 carriers. Thus, changes within each
calendar year may be more informative when looking at trends than year-to-year comparisons of absolute
numbers.
Department Recommendations Relative to Responding to Home Heating Oil Releases
The Department continues to work with homeowners to assist them with managing cleanups in
the event of a release, including using its contractors to address situations that pose health risks
or conditions that are likely to cause additional environmental damage if not mitigated in a
timely way. The Department notes that the work conducted by its contractors is subject to cost
recovery from the homeowner.
A homeowner’s ability to respond to the release is often dependent on the extent to which the
cleanup work is covered by the homeowner’s insurance. Of the 1,380 parties that have asserted
to the Department a “financial inability” to complete the required assessment and cleanup of an
oil or hazardous materials release regulated under MGL c. 21E and the Massachusetts
Contingency Plan (or “MCP” at 310 CMR 40.0000), 389 (28%) are homeowners who have
Page 4 of 4
experienced a home heating oil release. The lack of financial resources available to many of
these homeowners to complete the necessary response actions affects their ability to fully
restore the condition and value of their residential properties and to eliminate risks to human
health and the environment.
The Department supports efforts by insurers and home heating oil delivery companies to raise
awareness among residential home heating oil consumers about the availability of optional
liquid fuel endorsement coverage.
