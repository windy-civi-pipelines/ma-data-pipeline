Dear Speaker Mariano. President Spilka, House Clerk Carroll, and Senate Clerk Hurley:
This letter is written with regard to my office’s current performance audit of the Massachusetts
General Court (2025-0070-3S).
The Generally Accepted Government Auditing Standards (GAGAS), commonly referred to as
the "Yellow Book,” are produced in the United States by the Government Accountability Office
(GAO). The standards apply to both financial and performance audits of government agencies.
Our audit is being conducted in accordance with these standards. The scope of our audit is state
contracting and procurement procedures, the use of taxpayer-funded nondisclosure agreements,
and a review of your balance forward line item - including a review of all relevant financial
receipts and information. The audit period covers Fiscal Years 2021, 2022, 2023 and 2024 (July 1,
1

2020 through June 30, 2024).
Chapter 11, Section 12, of General Laws requires “departments, offices, commissions, institutions
and activities of the commonwealth, including those of districts and authorities created by the
general court and the general court itself” to provide my office with “books, documents, vouchers
and other records relating to any matter within the scope of an audit.” (emphasis added).
Accordingly, my office requested the following on January 6, 2025 – a request that is within the
above-referenced scope of our audit of the General Court:
1. The official budgets for the House and Senate for Fiscal Years 2021, 2022, 2023 and 2024.
2. Copies of official audits of the House and Senate for Fiscal Years 2021, 2022, 2023 and
2024.
3. A listing of all transactions related to the House’s and Senate’s balance forward line item
for Fiscal Years 2021, 2022, 2023 and 2024.
4. A listing of all monetary settlement agreements entered into by the House and Senate with
any current or former employees or members of the House and Senate during Fiscal Years
2021, 2022, 2023 and 2024.
To date, my office’s request for the above-referenced records remains outstanding and unfulfilled.
Accordingly, I ask that all requested records and information be made available to my office by
Monday, September 29, 2025. Should the General Court continue to not comply with its
obligations under the law, my office will seek to enforce the production of the requested records
via litigation.
Sincerely,
Diana DiZoglio
Auditor of the Commonwealth
