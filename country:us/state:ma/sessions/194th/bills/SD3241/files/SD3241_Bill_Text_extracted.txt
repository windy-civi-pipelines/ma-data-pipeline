Overview of the Massachusetts Veterans Homes & Current Initiatives
The Commonwealth of Massachusetts operates two veterans’ homes: the Massachusetts Veterans Home
at Chelsea and the Massachusetts Veterans Home at Holyoke, which are collectively referred to in this
report as the “Homes.” The Homes focus primarily on providing two major services for Massachusetts
veterans: long-term care (i.e., nursing facility) and domiciliary residential services (i.e., room
accommodations, daily meals, and social services). Both Homes have a five-member Board of Trustees,
each appointed to a seven-year term. The Homes’ mission is to provide services and care to Massachusetts
veterans with dignity, honor, and respect.
Massachusetts Veterans Home at Chelsea
Long-term care residents have moved into the new, state-of-the-art 154-bed facility designed using the
small-home model recommended by the United States Department of Veterans Affairs to improve
resident-centered care. The residents have adjusted well to their new home, supported by the Homes’
focus on improving the overall quality of life and sense of well-being for veterans through quality care,
resident engagement, and programs that foster connection and community. The Home enhanced the
second-floor outdoor deck to ensure resident safety and now provides secure outdoor space for veterans
to relax and enjoy fresh air with fellow veterans and family.
The Home is recognized by the United States Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) as a state veterans’
home, is licensed by the Massachusetts Department of Public Health (DPH), and holds certification from
the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) as a skilled long-term care facility. Staff at the
Home are improving their understanding of VA, CMS, and DPH regulatory standards and have
implemented new policies and procedures.
The Home has focused on internal enhancements for operational efficiency, veteran quality of care, and
quality of life. It has implemented and is working toward full adoption and increased utilization of its
modern electronic medical record system, which supports coordinated resident care and eases
administrative burdens. EOVS leadership is actively engaged in supporting full adoption and utilization of
the system.
4
In addition to operational efficiency, the Home is enhancing its quality of care by expanding its Quality
Assurance and Performance Improvement program. This program identifies opportunities for
improvement in clinical care, resident satisfaction, and staff performance.
The domiciliary campus at the Home is undergoing significant investment and development through a
public-private partnership with Pennrose LLC. The project will create approximately 240 new, state-of-
the-art veterans’ preference affordable housing apartments, accommodating all current domiciliary
residents.
Massachusetts Veterans Home at Holyoke
Construction remains ahead of schedule for the state-of-the-art long-term care facility in Holyoke, with
occupancy planned for 2026. The Healey-Driscoll Administration celebrated the topping-off ceremony on
November 7, 2024, signifying that the new facility framework was complete. The project is funded with
$263.5 million in federal funding from the United States Department of Veterans Affairs and $141.9
million in funding from the Commonwealth, with the support of the Department of Capital Asset
Management and Maintenance (DCAMM) and the Executive Office of Technology Services and Security
(EOTSS) for technology and communications requirements.
The Home has taken several positive steps to augment quality of care, operational efficiency, and staff
recruitment and retention. Its first major achievement was securing Massachusetts Department of Public
Health licensure as a long-term care provider in July 2024. The Home and the Executive Office of Veterans
Services collaborated to achieve this accomplishment. Staff at the Home enhanced their understanding of
and compliance with regulatory standards and implemented new policies and procedures. In July 2025,
the Home achieved another significant milestone by receiving its initial certification from CMS.
The Home has also enhanced operational efficiency by implementing a modern electronic medical record
system in September 2024. This system supports coordinated patient care and eases administrative
burdens. EOVS leadership is actively engaged in supporting full adoption and utilization of the system. In
just two years, the Massachusetts Veterans Home at Holyoke earned CMS certification, DPH licensure,
and a perfect zero-deficiency VA rating — a trifecta of state and federal milestones reflecting its
turnaround.
Additionally, the Home has taken steps to increase veterans’ quality of life through activities and
enrichment events planned by the Employee Activities Committee. These activities include attending
baseball games, events at local lodges and posts, and other off-campus excursions, all of which foster
connection, community, and a sense of belonging. An Employee Engagement Committee organizes events
to support staff well-being, including arranging food trucks and hosting food and school supply drives.

Recommendations
Electronic Medical Record system (EMR)
Both Massachusetts Homes at Chelsea and Holyoke completed the implementation of an Electronic
Medical Record system, including the integration of pharmacy, laboratory and imaging services. This
report recommends that EOVS continue to work with and support the collaborative effort by the Homes,
the staff and leveraging the vendor to further the EMR’s use and enhance its adoption and functionality;
improving resident care, improving staff efficiency and regulatory compliance.
Standardize and Professionalize
This report recommends that EOVS continue to prioritize standardizing and professionalizing policies and
procedures at both Homes. EOVS has engaged with a professional consultant to inventory existing policies,
craft new policies, and work with EOVS and the Homes to implement them. The objective of this initiative
is to establish a single comprehensive policy framework to further support the operational and clinical
practice professionalization and standardization across both Homes, compliance CMS, DPH and the VA
and identification of opportunities to align with long-term care best practices. This transformational
initiative includes the training of staff at both Homes.
Equity
This report recommends that the Homes continue to focus on equity. In reviewing regional equity, the
Homes may consider how to reach and attract veteran residents from throughout the entire state, as well
as explore the possibility of expanding the Massachusetts Veterans Homes to additional regions. The
Homes may also explore staff equity, including further increasing staff diversity and supporting staff
through career pathways. Lastly, the Homes may consider methods to expand engagement with
prospective residents to promote a more diverse veteran resident population.
Engagement
The Massachusetts Veterans Homes have an opportunity to increase engagement with their host
communities, the veteran community, and the healthcare community. This report recommends exploring
partnerships and collaborations with all possible stakeholders, including local community groups, elected
officials, veteran volunteer groups, and healthcare institutions while continuing their collaboration with
their respective local VA medical centers and the VA. The updated definition of a veteran in the HERO Act
is a positive development that supports engagement efforts moving forward.

The Homes’ staffing pattern is developed by analyzing a variety of key factors, including resident needs,
census levels, and the complexity of care required. This involves reviewing shift coverage, staff-to-resident
ratios, and peak activity times to ensure an appropriate number of caregivers, nurses, and support staff
are on duty at all times.
The effectiveness of staffing levels is also monitored through incident reports, resident feedback, and staff
input. A balanced workforce is maintained by regularly assessing workload distribution and adjusting
schedules to ensure consistent, high-quality care for veterans. Staffing patterns are monitored and
informed through ongoing data analysis and performance reviews to ensure that staffing patterns are
consistent with safe, efficient, and compassionate care. Comparative analysis of staffing levels in long-
term care is often focused on direct care staff. The average direct care staffing in June was 5.98 staff Hours
per Resident Day - .68 RN, 1.18 LPN, 4.13 CNA, which exceeds industry standards.
The Home invests in the current staff, particularly through its new onboarding and training programs. The
Home’s Staff Development team provides onboarding staff with a 5-day orientation process, during which
new staff members are introduced to a variety of departments and complete hands-on competencies for
procedures, equipment, EMR documentation, and policy review. Staff also receive annual training, including
Dementia training, Infection Control requirements, Antibiotic Stewardship, Patient Centered Care, Medication
Administration and Management, Abuse, Neglect, Misappropriation and Exploitation, Environment of Care,
Safety and Security, Emergency Management, and the state-assigned MassAchieve classes.
11
The Home regularly hosts various types of professional development training designed to strengthen the
skills, knowledge, and competencies of staff through continuous training and professional development
opportunities. The training program keeps the team up to date on healthcare practices, regulations, and
resident care techniques. By focusing on clinical skills, leadership, and resident-centered care, the Home
builds a qualified workforce to deliver high-quality care. The goal of training is to increase mentorship,
career growth, and cross-functional collaboration to create cohesive and capable teams, resulting in
higher quality services for veterans.
Over the last year, the Home provided all staff with training for “LGBTQ Identities and Advocacy” and are in
the process of completing a course titled “Understanding Military Culture,” a course that provides education
on post-traumatic stress disorder, crisis response, and military culture. These courses increase staff cultural
awareness and fluency, improving veteran care and teamwork.
To further invest in frontline staff, EOVS worked with SEIU 888 to implement a Memorandum of
Agreement (MOA) to establish a career ladder for Certified Nursing Assistants (CNAs) at the Home. This
joint initiative aims to equitably recognize qualified bargaining unit staff and provides CNAs with an
opportunity for career advancement within their field. The MOA delineates the creation of position
descriptions, staffing needs assessments at each facility, and the promotion process for eligible
employees. It also memorializes the position descriptions to be used for all levels of the Nursing Assistant
job series, addresses current staffing needs at each Home, and describes the reclassification and
promotion process moving forward. With the introduction of the nurse career ladder, employees will now
progress through four levels of the CNA job series based on their skills, experience, and responsibilities.

The MVH Holyoke staffing pattern is developed by analyzing a variety of key factors, including resident
needs, census levels, and the complexity of care required. This involves reviewing shift coverage, staff-to-
resident ratios, and peak activity times to ensure an appropriate number of caregivers, nurses, and
support staff are on duty at all times.
The effectiveness of staffing levels is also monitored through incident reports, resident feedback, and staff
input. A balanced workforce is maintained by regularly assessing workload distribution and adjusting
schedules to ensure consistent, high-quality care for veterans. Staffing patterns are monitored and
informed through ongoing data analysis and performance reviews to ensure that staffing patterns are
consistent with safe, efficient, and compassionate care. Comparative analysis of staffing levels in long-
term care are often focused on direct care staff. The average direct care staffing for FY 24 were 6.72 staff
Hours per Resident Day – 1.0 RN, 1.3 LPN, 4.4 CNA – which is well above industry standards.
The Home has made significant investments in staff training and professional development.
The Home’s Staff Development team maintains a high level of education for both clinical and non-clinical
departments throughout the Home. They are the first team that new staff members interact with as they
attend orientation. During the 5-day orientation, the Executive Director and Director of Nursing greet new
staff, introduce them to departments, and guide them through hands-on competencies for procedures
and equipment. This education is refreshed annually at the Home’s Safety Fair. This fair includes
presentations from Human Resources, Occupational Health, Infection Prevention, Social Work, Facilities,
Informatics, and Central Supply. Other annual training includes dementia training, infection control
refreshers, Antibiotic Stewardship, Patient-Centered Care Fair/Annual Competencies, Medication
Administration and Management, Medication Administration Competency, Nebulizer Treatment
13
Competency, LGBTQ Identities and Advocacy, Effective Communication, Trauma Informed Care,
Behavioral Health/De-escalation, and the state-assigned MassAchieve classes.

four levels of the CNA job series based on their skills, experience, and responsibilities.
The Home Human Resources staff worked in collaboration with the Volunteer Coordinator to establish
relationships with surrounding schools. The team attends various hiring events to recruit both full-time
staff and volunteers.
The Home has three employee recognition programs. The first is the “You’re Awesome” kudos card. This
card is given to an employee by another employee to recognize a job well done, an extra effort, or a
helping hand in making the day better for veterans and staff. All recipients of a “You’re Awesome” card
are recognized in that week’s Staff Update email. The second employee recognition is the “Value Victor”
award. This is MVH Holyoke’s Employee of the Month. This staff member is nominated by another
employee. These nominations are blinded and reviewed by a committee of fellow staff members. This
committee makes the selection of that month’s Value Victor. The Value Victor gets a small party in their
honor with a snack of their choosing, their picture placed in the Value Victor display for the year, and they
get a preferred parking space. The third employee recognition is the MVH Holyoke Challenge Coin, which
is only issued by the Executive Director and the Director of Nursing to staff members who have truly gone
above and beyond.
The Home merged its two staff committees into the Employee Engagement Committee, which supports
staff through food trucks, supply drives, and an offsite party.
Grievances and Resolutions:
The EOVS Ombudsperson program was established in 2023 and includes two positions with responsibility
for each of the Massachusetts Veterans Homes. These individuals work closely with residents, families,
staff, and leadership with a focus on resident rights. One critical piece of this role is to receive concerns,
report them to EOVS, and engage in problem-solving to reach an effective resolution.
When issues or complaints are raised, follow-up includes reporting, investigation and collaboration with
personnel best able to resolve the issue. For example, if a resident reports to a nurse that they are
receiving the wrong meal, the nurse will connect with a food service supervisor, who will help resolve the
issue. The nurse then ensures the change was made. A supervisor or manager oversees the resolution
process with confirmation that the staff member was educated and is performing their work in a resident-
centered manner. Follow-up with the complainant provides updates and the status of the problem
resolution and validates that the issue was resolved. In the rare case that an issue is not resolvable, the
reason is explained to the complainant.
14
At the MVH Chelsea, a total of 67 issues or complaints were received, with all but one resolved. At the MVH
Holyoke, a total of 78 issues or complaints were received, all of which were resolved.
The Homes’ social work departments host monthly resident council meetings and other gatherings where
residents are encouraged to raise concerns and complaints. The executive directors and the ombudspersons
remind family members how to contact them with concerns and issues. The grievance process is also reviewed
at each family and veteran meeting. Resident care plan meetings with social work and nursing staff are held
regularly. Each unit provides grievance forms, and staff and residents receive training on how to use them.
When a resident decides that they would like to file a grievance, it is logged by the Director of Social Work,
who oversees the process through resolution. The communications director includes information in
newsletters and in the annual letter to residents and families about the state ombudsman program and the
EOVS ombudsperson roles. There is also annual training on resident rights and mandated reporting for
employees. At orientation for new staff, the ombudsperson reminds staff about resident rights and reporting.
The Homes also achieved a perfect, zero-deficiency rating in the VA’s annual survey. This recognition
reflects the Home’s commitment to meeting the highest standards of care and reinforces the confidence
families and veterans place in the facility.
15
Regional Equity and Access:
The Healey-Driscoll Administration reviewed the Massachusetts Veterans Homes as part of its inaugural
Equity Assessment, required through Executive Order No. 612, Instituting the Practice of Equity
Assessment Government-Wide and Creating the Inter-Agency Coordinating Committee on Increasing
Equity Through Data. The Homes received a grade of “On the Right Track” using criteria that assessed
access, fairness, transparency, accountability, and accessibility.
Massachusetts Veterans Home at Chelsea
The Home maintains relationships with many community groups and receives support from the City of Chelsea,
VFW, American Legion, Middlesex County Sheriff, Jewish War Veterans, Swampscott Kearsarge Lodge #217, and
the DAV. These organizations frequently sponsor recreational activities for the veterans, such as an annual
cookout, ice-cream socials, Navy Band Quartet, bingo, fishing trips, and expeditions. The Homes’ veterans
participate in all Memorial Day and Veterans Day events.
Additionally, the Home hosts monthly resident council and town hall meetings. These meetings are an opportunity
for residents to connect with leadership and staff at the Homes to collaborate on improvements and
enhancements. Staff at the Home record actionable items, explore resolutions, and work with residents and staff
to follow up with solutions.
The Home is committed to ensuring that all residents are fully aware of their rights as residents. These rights are
posted on each unit with the contact details for the EOVS ombudsperson, the Executive Office of Elder Affairs
ombudsman, and the MA Department of Public Health. This past year, EOVS created an Ombudsperson program.
The Ombudsperson educates staff about resident rights through one-on-one and larger training sessions. The
Ombudsperson is highly visible at the MVH and helps staff gain a fuller understanding of resident rights, including
their entitlements to respectful treatment, privacy, and participation in care decisions. Any resident or family
member may report an issue or request assistance. In addition, staff and residents are aware of the availability of
grievance forms, which are accessible on each unit.
Massachusetts Veterans Home at Holyoke
The Home holds an annual update call with Veteran Service Officers (VSOs) and veteran organizations.
Updates include information about admissions to the Home. The Home maintains strong relationships
with veterans’ groups in the area, including the Vietnam Veterans, VFW, American Legion, and the DAV.
The Home works to increase awareness of the Home through community events, like attendance at the
American Legion District 3 Testimonial Luncheon. The Home also presented at a meeting of the Ancient
& Honorable Artillery Company, providing admissions details and a review of the new building progress.
With the Hero Act, increased benefits are now available to veterans throughout the Commonwealth, and
the Homes serve as a resource for veterans across the Commonwealth. All Massachusetts veterans are
welcome, regardless of race, religion, sex, gender identity, or sexual orientation.
The Home has also been visiting local libraries, senior centers, and colleges. Staff from the Home are ready
and willing to attend various functions to speak about the Home and admissions/eligibility.
16
Conclusion
The Massachusetts Veterans Homes at Chelsea and Holyoke have made tremendous strides in resident
care, professionalization, and operational improvements over the last year. The Homes have both ushered
in a new era of veteran care with the opening of the new 154-bed facility in Chelsea and the completion
of the topping-off ceremony for the 234-bed replacement facility in Holyoke. Resident quality of care
continues to be enhanced with licensure and certifications from the Massachusetts Department of Public
Health and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, as well as the implementation of the EMR at
both Homes. The Homes have invested in existing staff through the implementation of the CNA career
ladder and numerous professional development training programs. The Ombudsperson program at both
Homes has further increased the quality of services provided to residents, families, and staff by ensuring
issues are recognized and addressed.
The Healey Driscoll Administration looks forward to implementing further improvements and attaining
new heights in providing services and care to Massachusetts veterans with dignity, honor, and respect.

related needs. This report shall be submitted to the governor, the clerks of the house of representatives
and senate, and the joint committee on veterans and federal affairs annually and not later than September
30.”
Overview of the Massachusetts Veterans Homes & Current Initiatives
The Commonwealth of Massachusetts operates two veterans’ homes: the Massachusetts Veterans Home
at Chelsea and the Massachusetts Veterans Home at Holyoke, which are collectively referred to in this
report as the “Homes.” The Homes focus primarily on providing two major services for Massachusetts
veterans: long-term care (i.e., nursing facility) and domiciliary residential services (i.e., room
accommodations, daily meals, and social services). Both Homes have a five-member Board of Trustees,
each appointed to a seven-year term. The Homes’ mission is to provide services and care to Massachusetts
veterans with dignity, honor, and respect.
Massachusetts Veterans Home at Chelsea
Long-term care residents have moved into the new, state-of-the-art 154-bed facility designed using the
small-home model recommended by the United States Department of Veterans Affairs to improve
resident-centered care. The residents have adjusted well to their new home, supported by the Homes’
focus on improving the overall quality of life and sense of well-being for veterans through quality care,
resident engagement, and programs that foster connection and community. The Home enhanced the
second-floor outdoor deck to ensure resident safety and now provides secure outdoor space for veterans
to relax and enjoy fresh air with fellow veterans and family.
The Home is recognized by the United States Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) as a state veterans’
home, is licensed by the Massachusetts Department of Public Health (DPH), and holds certification from
the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) as a skilled long-term care facility. Staff at the
Home are improving their understanding of VA, CMS, and DPH regulatory standards and have
implemented new policies and procedures.
The Home has focused on internal enhancements for operational efficiency, veteran quality of care, and
quality of life. It has implemented and is working toward full adoption and increased utilization of its
modern electronic medical record system, which supports coordinated resident care and eases
administrative burdens. EOVS leadership is actively engaged in supporting full adoption and utilization of
the system.
4

In addition to operational efficiency, the Home is enhancing its quality of care by expanding its Quality
Assurance and Performance Improvement program. This program identifies opportunities for
improvement in clinical care, resident satisfaction, and staff performance.
The domiciliary campus at the Home is undergoing significant investment and development through a
public-private partnership with Pennrose LLC. The project will create approximately 240 new, state-of-
the-art veterans’ preference affordable housing apartments, accommodating all current domiciliary
residents.
Massachusetts Veterans Home at Holyoke
Construction remains ahead of schedule for the state-of-the-art long-term care facility in Holyoke, with
occupancy planned for 2026. The Healey-Driscoll Administration celebrated the topping-off ceremony on
November 7, 2024, signifying that the new facility framework was complete. The project is funded with
$263.5 million in federal funding from the United States Department of Veterans Affairs and $141.9
million in funding from the Commonwealth, with the support of the Department of Capital Asset
Management and Maintenance (DCAMM) and the Executive Office of Technology Services and Security
(EOTSS) for technology and communications requirements.
The Home has taken several positive steps to augment quality of care, operational efficiency, and staff
recruitment and retention. Its first major achievement was securing Massachusetts Department of Public
Health licensure as a long-term care provider in July 2024. The Home and the Executive Office of Veterans
Services collaborated to achieve this accomplishment. Staff at the Home enhanced their understanding of
and compliance with regulatory standards and implemented new policies and procedures. In July 2025,
the Home achieved another significant milestone by receiving its initial certification from CMS.
The Home has also enhanced operational efficiency by implementing a modern electronic medical record
system in September 2024. This system supports coordinated patient care and eases administrative
burdens. EOVS leadership is actively engaged in supporting full adoption and utilization of the system. In
just two years, the Massachusetts Veterans Home at Holyoke earned CMS certification, DPH licensure,
and a perfect zero-deficiency VA rating — a trifecta of state and federal milestones reflecting its
turnaround.
Additionally, the Home has taken steps to increase veterans’ quality of life through activities and
enrichment events planned by the Employee Activities Committee. These activities include attending
baseball games, events at local lodges and posts, and other off-campus excursions, all of which foster
connection, community, and a sense of belonging. An Employee Engagement Committee organizes events
to support staff well-being, including arranging food trucks and hosting food and school supply drives.

Recommendations
Electronic Medical Record system (EMR)
Both Massachusetts Homes at Chelsea and Holyoke completed the implementation of an Electronic
Medical Record system, including the integration of pharmacy, laboratory and imaging services. This
report recommends that EOVS continue to work with and support the collaborative effort by the Homes,
the staff and leveraging the vendor to further the EMR’s use and enhance its adoption and functionality;
improving resident care, improving staff efficiency and regulatory compliance.
Standardize and Professionalize
This report recommends that EOVS continue to prioritize standardizing and professionalizing policies and
procedures at both Homes. EOVS has engaged with a professional consultant to inventory existing policies,
craft new policies, and work with EOVS and the Homes to implement them. The objective of this initiative
is to establish a single comprehensive policy framework to further support the operational and clinical
practice professionalization and standardization across both Homes, compliance CMS, DPH and the VA
and identification of opportunities to align with long-term care best practices. This transformational
initiative includes the training of staff at both Homes.
Equity
This report recommends that the Homes continue to focus on equity. In reviewing regional equity, the
Homes may consider how to reach and attract veteran residents from throughout the entire state, as well
as explore the possibility of expanding the Massachusetts Veterans Homes to additional regions. The
Homes may also explore staff equity, including further increasing staff diversity and supporting staff
through career pathways. Lastly, the Homes may consider methods to expand engagement with
prospective residents to promote a more diverse veteran resident population.
Engagement
The Massachusetts Veterans Homes have an opportunity to increase engagement with their host
communities, the veteran community, and the healthcare community. This report recommends exploring
partnerships and collaborations with all possible stakeholders, including local community groups, elected
officials, veteran volunteer groups, and healthcare institutions while continuing their collaboration with
their respective local VA medical centers and the VA. The updated definition of a veteran in the HERO Act
is a positive development that supports engagement efforts moving forward.

The Homes’ staffing pattern is developed by analyzing a variety of key factors, including resident needs,
census levels, and the complexity of care required. This involves reviewing shift coverage, staff-to-resident
ratios, and peak activity times to ensure an appropriate number of caregivers, nurses, and support staff
are on duty at all times.
The effectiveness of staffing levels is also monitored through incident reports, resident feedback, and staff
input. A balanced workforce is maintained by regularly assessing workload distribution and adjusting
schedules to ensure consistent, high-quality care for veterans. Staffing patterns are monitored and
informed through ongoing data analysis and performance reviews to ensure that staffing patterns are
consistent with safe, efficient, and compassionate care. Comparative analysis of staffing levels in long-
term care is often focused on direct care staff. The average direct care staffing in June was 5.98 staff Hours
per Resident Day - .68 RN, 1.18 LPN, 4.13 CNA, which exceeds industry standards.
The Home invests in the current staff, particularly through its new onboarding and training programs. The
Home’s Staff Development team provides onboarding staff with a 5-day orientation process, during which
new staff members are introduced to a variety of departments and complete hands-on competencies for
procedures, equipment, EMR documentation, and policy review. Staff also receive annual training, including
Dementia training, Infection Control requirements, Antibiotic Stewardship, Patient Centered Care, Medication
Administration and Management, Abuse, Neglect, Misappropriation and Exploitation, Environment of Care,
Safety and Security, Emergency Management, and the state-assigned MassAchieve classes.
11

The Home regularly hosts various types of professional development training designed to strengthen the
skills, knowledge, and competencies of staff through continuous training and professional development
opportunities. The training program keeps the team up to date on healthcare practices, regulations, and
resident care techniques. By focusing on clinical skills, leadership, and resident-centered care, the Home
builds a qualified workforce to deliver high-quality care. The goal of training is to increase mentorship,
career growth, and cross-functional collaboration to create cohesive and capable teams, resulting in
higher quality services for veterans.
Over the last year, the Home provided all staff with training for “LGBTQ Identities and Advocacy” and are in
the process of completing a course titled “Understanding Military Culture,” a course that provides education
on post-traumatic stress disorder, crisis response, and military culture. These courses increase staff cultural
awareness and fluency, improving veteran care and teamwork.
To further invest in frontline staff, EOVS worked with SEIU 888 to implement a Memorandum of
Agreement (MOA) to establish a career ladder for Certified Nursing Assistants (CNAs) at the Home. This
joint initiative aims to equitably recognize qualified bargaining unit staff and provides CNAs with an
opportunity for career advancement within their field. The MOA delineates the creation of position
descriptions, staffing needs assessments at each facility, and the promotion process for eligible
employees. It also memorializes the position descriptions to be used for all levels of the Nursing Assistant
job series, addresses current staffing needs at each Home, and describes the reclassification and
promotion process moving forward. With the introduction of the nurse career ladder, employees will now
progress through four levels of the CNA job series based on their skills, experience, and responsibilities.

The MVH Holyoke staffing pattern is developed by analyzing a variety of key factors, including resident
needs, census levels, and the complexity of care required. This involves reviewing shift coverage, staff-to-
resident ratios, and peak activity times to ensure an appropriate number of caregivers, nurses, and
support staff are on duty at all times.
The effectiveness of staffing levels is also monitored through incident reports, resident feedback, and staff
input. A balanced workforce is maintained by regularly assessing workload distribution and adjusting

informed through ongoing data analysis and performance reviews to ensure that staffing patterns are
consistent with safe, efficient, and compassionate care. Comparative analysis of staffing levels in long-
term care are often focused on direct care staff. The average direct care staffing for FY 24 were 6.72 staff
Hours per Resident Day – 1.0 RN, 1.3 LPN, 4.4 CNA – which is well above industry standards.
The Home has made significant investments in staff training and professional development.
The Home’s Staff Development team maintains a high level of education for both clinical and non-clinical
departments throughout the Home. They are the first team that new staff members interact with as they
attend orientation. During the 5-day orientation, the Executive Director and Director of Nursing greet new
staff, introduce them to departments, and guide them through hands-on competencies for procedures
and equipment. This education is refreshed annually at the Home’s Safety Fair. This fair includes
presentations from Human Resources, Occupational Health, Infection Prevention, Social Work, Facilities,
Informatics, and Central Supply. Other annual training includes dementia training, infection control
refreshers, Antibiotic Stewardship, Patient-Centered Care Fair/Annual Competencies, Medication
Administration and Management, Medication Administration Competency, Nebulizer Treatment

Competency, LGBTQ Identities and Advocacy, Effective Communication, Trauma Informed Care,
Behavioral Health/De-escalation, and the state-assigned MassAchieve classes.

four levels of the CNA job series based on their skills, experience, and responsibilities.
The Home Human Resources staff worked in collaboration with the Volunteer Coordinator to establish
relationships with surrounding schools. The team attends various hiring events to recruit both full-time
staff and volunteers.
The Home has three employee recognition programs. The first is the “You’re Awesome” kudos card. This
card is given to an employee by another employee to recognize a job well done, an extra effort, or a
helping hand in making the day better for veterans and staff. All recipients of a “You’re Awesome” card
are recognized in that week’s Staff Update email. The second employee recognition is the “Value Victor”
award. This is MVH Holyoke’s Employee of the Month. This staff member is nominated by another
employee. These nominations are blinded and reviewed by a committee of fellow staff members. This
committee makes the selection of that month’s Value Victor. The Value Victor gets a small party in their
honor with a snack of their choosing, their picture placed in the Value Victor display for the year, and they
get a preferred parking space. The third employee recognition is the MVH Holyoke Challenge Coin, which
is only issued by the Executive Director and the Director of Nursing to staff members who have truly gone
above and beyond.
The Home merged its two staff committees into the Employee Engagement Committee, which supports
staff through food trucks, supply drives, and an offsite party.
Grievances and Resolutions:
The EOVS Ombudsperson program was established in 2023 and includes two positions with responsibility
for each of the Massachusetts Veterans Homes. These individuals work closely with residents, families,
staff, and leadership with a focus on resident rights. One critical piece of this role is to receive concerns,
report them to EOVS, and engage in problem-solving to reach an effective resolution.
When issues or complaints are raised, follow-up includes reporting, investigation and collaboration with
personnel best able to resolve the issue. For example, if a resident reports to a nurse that they are
receiving the wrong meal, the nurse will connect with a food service supervisor, who will help resolve the
issue. The nurse then ensures the change was made. A supervisor or manager oversees the resolution
process with confirmation that the staff member was educated and is performing their work in a resident-
centered manner. Follow-up with the complainant provides updates and the status of the problem
resolution and validates that the issue was resolved. In the rare case that an issue is not resolvable, the
reason is explained to the complainant.
14

At the MVH Chelsea, a total of 67 issues or complaints were received, with all but one resolved. At the MVH
Holyoke, a total of 78 issues or complaints were received, all of which were resolved.
The Homes’ social work departments host monthly resident council meetings and other gatherings where
residents are encouraged to raise concerns and complaints. The executive directors and the ombudspersons
remind family members how to contact them with concerns and issues. The grievance process is also reviewed
at each family and veteran meeting. Resident care plan meetings with social work and nursing staff are held
regularly. Each unit provides grievance forms, and staff and residents receive training on how to use them.
When a resident decides that they would like to file a grievance, it is logged by the Director of Social Work,
who oversees the process through resolution. The communications director includes information in
newsletters and in the annual letter to residents and families about the state ombudsman program and the
EOVS ombudsperson roles. There is also annual training on resident rights and mandated reporting for
employees. At orientation for new staff, the ombudsperson reminds staff about resident rights and reporting.
The Homes also achieved a perfect, zero-deficiency rating in the VA’s annual survey. This recognition
reflects the Home’s commitment to meeting the highest standards of care and reinforces the confidence
families and veterans place in the facility.
15

Regional Equity and Access:
The Healey-Driscoll Administration reviewed the Massachusetts Veterans Homes as part of its inaugural
Equity Assessment, required through Executive Order No. 612, Instituting the Practice of Equity
Assessment Government-Wide and Creating the Inter-Agency Coordinating Committee on Increasing
Equity Through Data. The Homes received a grade of “On the Right Track” using criteria that assessed
access, fairness, transparency, accountability, and accessibility.
Massachusetts Veterans Home at Chelsea
The Home maintains relationships with many community groups and receives support from the City of Chelsea,
VFW, American Legion, Middlesex County Sheriff, Jewish War Veterans, Swampscott Kearsarge Lodge #217, and
the DAV. These organizations frequently sponsor recreational activities for the veterans, such as an annual
cookout, ice-cream socials, Navy Band Quartet, bingo, fishing trips, and expeditions. The Homes’ veterans
participate in all Memorial Day and Veterans Day events.
Additionally, the Home hosts monthly resident council and town hall meetings. These meetings are an opportunity
for residents to connect with leadership and staff at the Homes to collaborate on improvements and
enhancements. Staff at the Home record actionable items, explore resolutions, and work with residents and staff
to follow up with solutions.
The Home is committed to ensuring that all residents are fully aware of their rights as residents. These rights are
posted on each unit with the contact details for the EOVS ombudsperson, the Executive Office of Elder Affairs
ombudsman, and the MA Department of Public Health. This past year, EOVS created an Ombudsperson program.
The Ombudsperson educates staff about resident rights through one-on-one and larger training sessions. The
Ombudsperson is highly visible at the MVH and helps staff gain a fuller understanding of resident rights, including
their entitlements to respectful treatment, privacy, and participation in care decisions. Any resident or family
member may report an issue or request assistance. In addition, staff and residents are aware of the availability of
grievance forms, which are accessible on each unit.
Massachusetts Veterans Home at Holyoke
The Home holds an annual update call with Veteran Service Officers (VSOs) and veteran organizations.
Updates include information about admissions to the Home. The Home maintains strong relationships
with veterans’ groups in the area, including the Vietnam Veterans, VFW, American Legion, and the DAV.
The Home works to increase awareness of the Home through community events, like attendance at the
American Legion District 3 Testimonial Luncheon. The Home also presented at a meeting of the Ancient
& Honorable Artillery Company, providing admissions details and a review of the new building progress.
With the Hero Act, increased benefits are now available to veterans throughout the Commonwealth, and
the Homes serve as a resource for veterans across the Commonwealth. All Massachusetts veterans are
welcome, regardless of race, religion, sex, gender identity, or sexual orientation.
The Home has also been visiting local libraries, senior centers, and colleges. Staff from the Home are ready
and willing to attend various functions to speak about the Home and admissions/eligibility.
16

Conclusion
The Massachusetts Veterans Homes at Chelsea and Holyoke have made tremendous strides in resident
care, professionalization, and operational improvements over the last year. The Homes have both ushered
in a new era of veteran care with the opening of the new 154-bed facility in Chelsea and the completion
of the topping-off ceremony for the 234-bed replacement facility in Holyoke. Resident quality of care
continues to be enhanced with licensure and certifications from the Massachusetts Department of Public
Health and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, as well as the implementation of the EMR at
both Homes. The Homes have invested in existing staff through the implementation of the CNA career
ladder and numerous professional development training programs. The Ombudsperson program at both
Homes has further increased the quality of services provided to residents, families, and staff by ensuring
issues are recognized and addressed.
The Healey Driscoll Administration looks forward to implementing further improvements and attaining
new heights in providing services and care to Massachusetts veterans with dignity, honor, and respect.
