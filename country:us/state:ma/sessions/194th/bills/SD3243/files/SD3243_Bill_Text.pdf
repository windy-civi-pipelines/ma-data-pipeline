Landscape – how child care impacts Massachusetts’s workforce
In recent years, Massachusetts has experienced significant changes in its workforce—a
trend shared by other states across the country. As described in the Healey-Driscoll
Administration’s Workforce Agenda (2024), “an increasingly mobile, remote, and hybrid
workforce combined with accelerated technology, increased costs, downsized workplaces,
shifts in downtown districts” and more factors have impacted the needs of both employers
and workers in an ever-evolving and changing economic landscape. These factors have
also directly impacted the early education and care sector; and in turn, child care
availability and accessibility have also impacted Massachusetts’ workforce participation.
Specifically, the administration’s 2023 Economic Development Plan acknowledged how
the COVID-19 pandemic changed not only the way we work but also gave light to workforce
challenges and inequities that had existed long before, notably how caregiving demands

significantly impact the workforce. Those in early education have long called the early
education and care sector, “the workforce behind the workforce.” For working parents to be
able to fully participate in the workforce and achieve their family’s economic goals, the
early education and child care sector needs support, stability, and the ability to thrive. As
described in the administration’s Workforce Agenda, there are many critical “work
supports” and infrastructure investments needed to attract and retain talent in
Massachusetts. Affordable and accessible child care options remain critical elements for
supporting workers, and in turn, driving productivity for employers and economic
competitiveness in regions and industries across the Commonwealth. A 2022 report by the
Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation estimates a $2.7 billion annual loss for the
Commonwealth due to inadequate child care options for working families. The annual
estimated cost break down is as follows:
• Employers lose $812 million due to lower productivity and turnover/replacement
costs.
• Individuals and families lose $1.7 billion in wages from missing work or reducing
their hours.
• Massachusetts foregoes $188 million in tax revenues due to lower earnings and lost
wages.
The data also demonstrate that current child care challenges disproportionately impact
women. In 2022, the labor force participation rate for mothers was 72.9% compared to
92.9% for fathers in the same year.1
Recognizing child care and other caregiving needs as a necessity among employers to
attract, retain, and develop the workforce, employers are becoming increasingly involved in
finding ways to support their employees specifically for accessing high quality, affordable
child care for workers.
Several key business groups across the Commonwealth have made early education and
care a core policy priority and have focused on child care as an imperative workforce and
economic development issue. One example is the Massachusetts Business Coalition for
Early Childhood Education, which was created in partnership with the Massachusetts
Business Roundtable (MBR) and Eastern Bank Foundation in 2021 to establish a statewide
coalition of CEOs and employer executives dedicated to making early childhood education
more accessible, affordable, and stable for Massachusetts workers, more rewarding for
early childhood professionals, and a valuable asset in attracting and retaining talent. Since

the coalition’s launch, 85+ members have joined the coalition representing a range of
industries and employers across Massachusetts.
Employer Engagement, Research, and Learnings
In January 2024, Governor Healey signed Executive Order 625, which established an inter-
agency task force to take a whole-of-government approach for Massachusetts to lead the
nation with ensuring access to affordable, high quality child care. As part of the task force’s
series of listening sessions, members of the task force met with the business community to
better understand the impact of child care on the workforce. In FY2025, task force
representatives from the Executive Offices of Labor and Workforce Development (EOLWD)
and Economic Development (EOED) and the Department of Early Education and Care
(EEC) conducted an employer specific listening session, led focus groups, administered a
survey, and met individually with regionally and industry diverse employers.
Participating groups included the Associated Industries of Massachusetts (AIM),
Massachusetts Business Coalition for Early Childhood Education, Massachusetts
Business Roundtable (MBR), Kendall Square Association, local regional chambers of
commerce, and their respective members. The employer-specific listening session
included 70 attendees who engaged in both a survey and live discussion. In total, this part
of the task force’s engagement reached more than 100 members of the business
community throughout Massachusetts and across a diverse mix of industries and regions.
The primary questions addressed throughout the focus groups, survey, and individual
conversations included:
1. How does access to high quality, affordable child care impact an employer’s
workforce? In what ways is an employer’s ability to hire and retain employees
impacted?
2. How are Massachusetts employers supporting employees as it relates to accessing
high quality, affordable child care?
3. How might employers want to engage with the state in a public-private partnership
to address access to high quality, affordable child care? Which incentives would be
most compelling?
4. Recommendations: What recommendations do employers have for creating a
sustainable early education and child care infrastructure that works for an
employee population?

1. How does access to high quality, affordable child care impact an
employer’s workforce? In what ways is an employer’s ability to hire and
retain employees impacted?
Generally, employers expressed awareness that the lack of affordable or accessible quality
child care creates challenges for their employees, but many employers are still struggling
with a response to this need. Many employers shared experiences of seeing employees
struggle with or leave the workforce altogether due to a lack of care options. The survey
also indicated 17% of respondents do not yet understand employees’ needs, illustrating an
opportunity to increase understanding among employers on the specific needs of
employees. This survey response was supported by individual conversations with
employers as well.
In 2023, the Community Foundation of North Central Massachusetts in partnership with
the United Way of North Central Massachusetts presented findings on employer sentiment
as it relates to child care access in a report. According to this engagement, “Employers in
the region painted a stark picture of how care challenges ripple into the workplace. Issues
like absenteeism and turnover, particularly in industries such as healthcare,
manufacturing, and education, were frequently linked to employees’ struggles to secure
care.”2
As it relates to hiring and retention, the survey results showed that 60% of respondents
experienced employee retention challenges related to child care. 90% of respondents
stated that women have been most impacted by these challenges.
Challenges among small businesses are especially pronounced, and it can be much more
difficult to find solutions given their size. Startups expressed similar challenges as they
compete to attract a younger workforce.
2. How are Massachusetts employers supporting their employees as it
relates to accessing high quality, affordable child care?
Reported employer-to-employee engagement varies depending on several factors: the
employer itself and what resources they may or may not have available to address their
workforce’s child care challenges; region; industry; and general readiness level to engage.
Many employers reported engaging with employees by having one-on-one discussions,
giving annual benefits presentations, having informal conversations, and by sending

March 2025, 13.

surveys. Based on those learnings, some employers are offering benefits such as flexible
schedules, back-up care, subsidized care, access to flexible spending accounts (FSAs),
and even on-site care in some instances. Reported adoption of these benefits varied
across employers, but the unifying thread was that employers wanted to engage in this
area and better support parent and caregiver employees.
It is important to note that small businesses reported having difficulty offering support due
to cost and lack of scalability, but could consider pooling resources or efforts across small
business organizations for more viable child care support options.
Startups expressed a desire to provide some sort of child care benefit, but due to cost and
their focus on survival as a new business, startups reported not knowing how or what to
provide given the uncertainty of their businesses. However, what is certain is that they are
competing fiercely for talent and that supporting young families is becoming increasingly
important to the conversation.
Employers expressed some concerns about how to address child care supports equitably
in companies that have a wide spectrum of individuals, families and role types.
Additionally, as workforce demographics and trends have changed, employers have
expressed difficulty keeping up with changing demands. For example, one large employer
established an on-site child care center years ago that was very successful and worked
well for working parents; however, following the COVID-19 pandemic, more employees are
now staying home and this type of arrangement for an on-site center no longer meets their
needs.
The following are examples of employers directly supporting the early education and child
care workforce:
1. PNC Bank dedicated $500 million to support 9 million children nationally through
programs such as Grow Up Great3, backup child care and elder care, and Paid
Family Medical Leave (PFML).
2. Seamen’s Bank on Cape Cod partnered with Cape Cod Children’s Place and the
Wellfleet Senior Center to create the “Sea-babies” program, an early childhood
education and care program for infants and toddlers, specifically those ages 0-3.
Seamen’s continues to help subsidize child care for their employees today.4
3. Citizens Bank created additional capacity in a public-private partnership pilot that
trained and enabled 9 home-based providers in child care deserts to open and
sustain their own programs.

3. How might employers want to engage with the state in a public-
private partnership to address access to high quality, affordable child
care?
Employers who responded to the survey reported that they would be most interested in the
following government programs as incentives for engaging with the state to address access
to high quality, affordable child care. Respondents were able to select all that applied.
• Tax credits for contracting with qualified facility to provide child care: 59%
responded in favor.
• Operational grants to providers (e.g. salaries, training): 63% responded in favor.
• Cost-sharing programs such as a matching grant pilot program in which an
employer partners with the State and families to share the cost of child care: 59%
responded in favor.
When asked, which of the options would be the most important, 34% responded favorably
to the cost-sharing program, more than any other approach.
Through individual conversations, many employers who are already engaged in supporting
employees with early education and child care expressed they would be most interested in
taking advantage of a tax credit program to continue to expand their efforts. In contrast, for
employers earlier in their journeys, a mix of grant opportunities to help offset upfront costs,
tax credits, as well as technical assistance were raised as the most relevant programs to
consider.
Participants in an employer listening session expressed a need for technical assistance
and options for public-private partnerships for businesses to take advantage of in
Massachusetts and emphasized that they would be excited to participate in a partnership
program, if one existed.

4. Recommendations: What recommendations do employers have for
creating a sustainable early education and child care infrastructure
that works for an employee population?
When asked about solutions, employers uniformly responded that greater access to
affordable child care options is key. Several asked for low cost or free care for children ages
0-5, a system akin to the state’s K-12 public school system.
Absent of an entirely subsidized early education and child care system, employers noted a
solution that involves employers must be a win-win-win for the employer, employee, and
the state. Business leaders want to engage, but there needs to also be a return on
investment.
A notable response in the listening session called for solutions that are easy, accessible,
and responsive to the specific needs of their workforce, acknowledging again that a one-
size-fits all approach is not feasible. Several voiced a need for middle-class family support
as this demographic does not currently have access to state subsidies and are struggling to
stay in the workforce due to the high cost and lack of options for child care.

Some recognized the importance of supporting the early education workforce, recognizing
educators are key in meeting needs of employees especially as workers face limited
options with long waitlists and a lack of providers.
Finally, many voiced that changing the narrative to frame child care as a critical workforce
and economic development issue is critical to engaging the business community in
contributing time and funds to solutions.
There are also several recommendations to consider from published research and
literature. In March 2022, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce published the Employer
Roadmap: Childcare Solutions for Working Parents. The guide, intended for leadership
teams of companies, lays out various solutions available to employers based on a
complexity vs. feasibility framework. Regardless of the path an employer chooses to take,
the place to begin is the same:
1. Understand the needs of your working parents.
2. Find your partners and learn the landscape.
3. Go for some quick wins and build on them.

In Massachusetts, AIM has partnered with Best Place for Working Parents, to support
employers based in the Commonwealth with their efforts to support working families. Their
website provides a free 3-minute anonymous assessment to any Massachusetts-based

employer to determine if the company is among the Best Places for Working Parents. If so,
the business is awarded an official Best Place for Working Parents designation, which they
can use on all marketing materials to attract new employees. Additionally, the partnership
provides a recommended guide for how to become a Best Place for Working Parents
employer. This includes an overview of the top 10 policies that benefit families and have a
positive impact on business. Those are9:
1. Company-paid health coverage
2. Paid time off
3. Parental leave
4. Nursing benefits
5. “Best Place” designation
6. Onsite child care
7. Child care assistance
8. Backup child care
9. Flexible hours
10. Working remotely
Future Employer-Led Collaborations
EEC, in collaboration with EOED and EOLWD, will be testing and piloting ideas through the
$2.5 million budget line item included in the FY25 Budget that calls for a competitive
matching grant opportunity for an employer-supported pilot that addresses both
affordability for families and capacity building for the early education and child care sector.
With this funding, the testing and piloting of innovative ideas will explore sustainable early
education capacity building needed in the Commonwealth. The efforts generated through
the pilot will be additive to and supplement the programs EEC already has available to
address affordability and capacity building, such as Commonwealth Cares for Children
(C3) and Child Care Financial Assistance (CCFA).
The goals for the pilot are as follows:
1. Incentivize employers to advance family-friendly policies for their working parent
employees.
2. Expand access to affordable, high quality child care for working parents.
3. Expand capacity in the early education and child care sector.
9 Associated Industries of Massachusetts, “The Best Place for Working Parents”, AIM, URL.

This competitive matching grant opportunity will allow an employer or group of employers
to compete for state funds that will support family-friendly policies within the workplace.
Examples include:
1. Introducing flexible and predictable scheduling in a traditionally rigid workplace
environment, such as a manufacturing facility or retail.
2. Partnering with a local child care center or family child care (FCC) provider to both
add additional seats and subsidize the cost of those seats for a group of employees.
3. Building onsite child care for high demand, low wage employees.
4. Other innovative ways to support the parent employees supporting the need for a
“no one size fits all” solution.
The pilot is being designed to be a “proof of concept” to test various public-private
partnership models across different areas of the state.
In addition to providing a monetary grant, the Healey-Driscoll administration intends to
provide grant awardees with research support to document findings and learnings as well
as a Community of Practice in which grantees can learn from one another.
This pilot will also provide an opportunity to build upon the interagency work coming out of
the Task Force and the ongoing collaborations between EEC, EOED, and EOLWD to engage
employers effectively and ensure that the solutions for the pilot lead to positive economic
outcomes for the Commonwealth.
On behalf of the Healey-Driscoll administration’s Interagency Task Force on Early
Education and Child Care, EEC, EOED, and EOLWD look forward to the many learnings that
will come from this pilot that will yield long-term, sustainable positive impacts on the early
education and child care sector.
