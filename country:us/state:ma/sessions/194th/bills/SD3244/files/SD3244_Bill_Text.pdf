By Mr. Fernandes, a petition (accompanied by bill) (subject to Joint Rule 12) of Dylan A.
Fernandes for legislation to establish a sick leave bank for Jonathan Cadigan, an employee of the
Bristol County Sheriff's department. Public Service.

In the One Hundred and Ninety-Fourth General Court
(2025-2026)
_______________
An Act establishing a sick leave bank for Jonathan Cadigan, an employee of the Bristol County
Sheriff's department.
Whereas, The deferred operation of this act would tend to defeat its purpose, which is to
establish forthwith a sick leave bank for a certain employee of the department of the Bristol
County Sheriff, therefore it is hereby declared to be an emergency law, necessary for the
immediate preservation of the public convenience.
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives in General Court assembled, and by the authority
of the same, as follows:
1 Notwithstanding any general or special law to the contrary, the Bristol County Sheriff’s
2 Department shall establish a sick leave bank for Jonathan Cadigan, an employee of the Sheriff’s
3 Department. Any employee of the Sheriff's Department may voluntarily contribute 1 or more
4 sick, personal or vacation days to the sick leave bank for use by Jonathan Cadigan. If Jonathan
5 Cadigan terminates employment with the Sheriff’s Department or requests to dissolve the sick
6 leave bank, any remaining time in the sick leave bank shall be transferred to the extended illness
7 leave bank. Sick leave bank days shall not be used for absences unrelated to the illness or
8 disability that necessitated the establishment of the sick leave bank as determined by the
9 Sheriff’s Department.
