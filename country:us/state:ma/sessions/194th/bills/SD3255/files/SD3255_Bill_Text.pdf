Dear Chair Rodrigues, Chair Michlewitz, Mr. Hurley, and Mr. Carroll:
The purpose of this letter is to inform you of changes to certain fees charged for licensees administered by
the Division of Banks (Division), as established by the Executive Office for Administration and Finance’s
(A&F) regulation, 801 CMR 4.02.
This letter is submitted to you in accordance with the provisions of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 7,
section 3B.
The process to establish a new fee relative to the licensure of money transmitters and the repeal of the
existing fees relative to the licensure of check sellers and foreign transmittal agencies is being conducted
jointly by the Executive Office for Administration and Finance and the Division of Banks. The public
hearing on the following amendments to 801 CMR 4.02: 209 Division of Banks and Loan Agencies is
scheduled for October 7, 2025.
In continuation of that joint process, the Division is filing this letter as required by statute on behalf of and
in conjunction with A&F.
Purpose of Fee Amendments:
As noted above, the amendments establish a new fee relative to the licensure of money transmitters and the
repeal of the existing fees relative to the licensure of check sellers and foreign transmittal agencies in
accordance with the provisions M.G.L. c. 169B, as set forth in Chapter 312 of the Acts of 2024: An Act
Relative to the Regulation of Money Transmission by the Division of Banks (Chapter 312 or the Act).
Chapter 312 establishes a single statutory framework for the licensing, examination, and regulation of all
money transmitters, covering both foreign and domestic transmissions, as well as check sellers, in the
Commonwealth by the Division of Banks (Division), pursuant to the establishment of M.G.L. c. 169B. By
modernizing existing Massachusetts law governing money transmission services to reflect the current day

marketplace, this statute brings Massachusetts in line with the rest of the country in protecting consumers
engaging in money transfers. With regard to licensure, Chapter 312 repeals the enabling statutes for the
Division’s licensure of check sellers at M.G.L. c. 167F, § 4 and the licensure of foreign transmittal
companies at M.G.L. c. 169, replacing the statutes with new M.G.L. c. 169B regarding the licensure of
money transmitters, including foreign and domestic transmissions as well as check sellers, into one license
for money transmitters. The Act was signed into law on January 1, 2025. The Division began accepting
applications for licensure through the licensing portal of the Nationwide Multistate Licensing System &
Registry (NMLS) on July 1, 2025.
Current Fee Structure:
The Division currently has licensure fees for foreign transmittal agencies and check sellers set forth in 801
CMR 4.02: 209 Division of Banks and Loan Agencies:
(39) Check Sales Annual License 1,000 per year
(40) Foreign Transmittal Agencies
(a) Annual License 1,000 per year for initial licensed location
(b) License for Additional Locations 200 per year for each additional licensed
location
Proposed Amendments:
(39) Money Transmitters Annual License 1,000 per year
Note: Since existing clauses (39) and (40) would be replaced with proposed clause (39) re Money
Transmitters, presumably all the following enumeration of clauses would need to change as well.
Revenue Estimate:
The Division estimates that the fee revenue impact will be a combined increase of $250,000 for the first
and second years of implementation.
As currently scheduled, it is the goal of the joint regulation process by A&F and the Division to complete
the amendment process for 801 CMR 4.02 by December 5, 2025.
If you have any questions or would like additional information, please contact me at 617-956-1510; Barbara
Keefe, Deputy Commissioner of Banks and General Counsel at 617-956-1513; or Carlos E. Loredo,
Associate Counsel, Executive Office for Administration and Finance at 857-400-5456.
Sincerely,
Mary L. Gallagher
Commissioner of Banks
