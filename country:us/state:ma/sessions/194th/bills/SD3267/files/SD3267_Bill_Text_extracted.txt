Commonwealth has legal authority over the individual, regardless of where the
individual is being held including those incarcerated in MA DOC facilities as well
as those housed in correctional facilities outside of the MA DOC (Massachusetts
Houses of Correction, other states’ correctional facilities, and the Federal Bureau
of Prisons).
Custody Population

mental health or substance abuse issues present a danger to themselves or others.
Pre-Trial or “Detainee”
Individuals housed in MA DOC custody who are held for another MA authority and
are detained prior to and during a trial, conviction, and sentencing and not yet

Massachusetts DOC Jurisdiction Population: Males by Type of Sentence on January 1, 2024
Massachusetts DOC Jurisdiction Population: Females by Type of Sentence on January 1, 2024
The vast majority of males were state criminal commitments (90%) on January 1, 2024.
In previous years female state criminal commitments represented a smaller portion of their total commitments (39%
in 2019 vs. 59% in 2024) compared to males (90% in 2024). This is due in part to the MA DOC previously housing
numerous counties’ female population due to capacity issues/lack of housing. This trend shifted in 2020 because
several Massachusetts counties are now able to take criminally (county) sentenced and pre-trial detainees into their
own custody.
Page 18
POPULATION CHARTS & STATISTICS
Note: Monthly jurisdiction population is based on the end of the month count of the criminally sentenced
jurisdiction population and will not reflect the cumulative difference in admissions and releases.
Overall, throughout 2023 the number of criminally sentenced admissions was more than
the number of criminally sentenced releases, criminal admissions averaging 145 per
month and criminal releases averaging 130.
During the trend period criminal admissions ranged between 107 in July, and 198 in
March. Criminal releases ranged between 102 in February, and 181 in March.
The cumulative difference between admissions and releases resulted in a cumulative
increase of 178 in the criminally sentenced population by year’s end.
The criminally sentenced population at the end of 2023 was 5,676, a 3% increase from
the population at the end of 2022, at 5,507. This reversed the annual decrease from 2015
to 2023 when comparing year’s end criminally sentenced populations.

MA DOC Three Year Recidivism Rate (Re-incarceration) for
Releases to the Community 2010-2019
A recidivist is defined as any criminally sentenced incarcerated individual released to the community
via expiration of sentence/ parole from MA DOC jurisdiction during 2019 who is re-incarcerated for a
new sentence or violation of parole or probation to a Massachusetts state or county facility or to a
federal facility within three years of his/her release. Types of re-incarceration include technical
violation of parole, parole violation with a new offense, return to county custody, return to state or
federal custody, technical violation of probation, and probation violation with a new offense. An
incarcerated individual who recidivates due to a technical violation of parole or probation is re-
incarcerated for violating the terms of the conditions set forth regarding a release in the community,
not for committing a new offense.
Over the ten-year trend period, the three year recidivism rate has seen a strong negative trend, ending the
trend with an overall recidivism rate decrease of 13 percentage points compared to the high experienced in

Section 13:
2010.

Goal One
Maintain and enhance prison safety and security for the public,
staff and Incarcerated Individuals
The Office of Investigative Services established the Correctional Intelligence Initiative
Program (CIIP.) The program’s goal is to enhance communication between agencies by
establishing a network where information can be shared across the state. Multiple
agencies and municipalities have joined in the effort to support their investigations.
The Policy Development and Compliance Unit (PDCU) worked with Department
stakeholders to formulate policies and operating procedures for the roll out of the Body
Worn Camera (BWC) program statewide. The BWC policy was approved on 9/26/23.
In 2023, the Special Operations Division helped to successfully roll out Body Worn
Cameras at Souza Baranowski Correctional Center, MCI-Shirley, MCI Framingham and Old
Colony Correctional Center. BWC footage has been incorporated into the Use of Force
review process.
In 2023, The Division of Resource Management began the roll-out of the Alertus
Emergency Notification system at all facilities.
Grant awards were received, via EOPSS’ Office of Grants & Research, for federal funds
from the Department of Justice’s Prison Rape Elimination Act ($133,231 from Bureau of
Justice Assistance) as well as for the Violence Against Women Act ($80,360,000 from
Office on Violence Against Women).

Goal Two
Effectively prepare incarcerated individuals for transition into
communities to reduce crime and victimization, reduce
recidivism and promote reentry
Boston Pre-Release Center continued their partnership with the Future Hope Pre-
Apprenticeship Program, with a second incarcerated individual successfully completing
the program in March of 2023.
The Victim Services Unit rolled out a victim-centered Family Violence Education Group
and Piloted a Victim Impact Program at MCI-Norfolk, while working closely with Spectrum
to roll out Victim Impact Programming across multiple facilities.
MCI Concord participated in Medications for Opioid Use Disorders (MOUD) Programing.
Patients were discharged with a prescription for suboxone along with a medically assisted
treatment (MAT) appointment scheduled upon release, if indicated.
On November 6, 2023, Boston Pre-Release Center’s The Heart-to-Heart Program, a
volunteer facilitated program organized through the Catholic Chaplin based on Marshall
Rosenburg’s Non-Violent communication, began the first cycle open to all incarcerated
individuals.

D O C S t r a t e g i c P l a n
Goal Three
Collaborate with external stakeholders to achieve mutual goals
and objectives
Souza Baranowski Correctional Center’s (SBCC) volunteer run program, Speak Up,
graduated the first set of incarcerated individuals since the program began. Incarcerated
individuals were issued certificates for their completion.
The DOC’s Division of Staff Development partnered with Boulder Crest to bring the
“Struggle Well Initiative” to the agency. In collaboration, Boulder Crest personnel have
joined to create Strategic and Operational Plans to effectively saturate and
institutionalize the Struggle Well philosophy and training transversely within the
organization. This will be accomplished through weekly in-service and catalog courses.
The objective is to be a catalyst of healthy personal, professional, and organizational
change, while providing the proper follow-up departmental actions to influence a true
cultural shift as it concerns mental wellness. The overall philosophy is to integrate
Posttraumatic Growth into training, communications, and departmental processes. We
can commence to proactively address anxiety, depression, aggression, suicide, and create
healthy correctional professionals that aim to thrive in support of their communities.
New England Culinary Arts Training (NECAT), in partnership with Tech Goes Home
provides each releasing incarcerated individual, who participated in the culinary arts
program, with a Chromebook upon release at Northeast Correctional Center.

Goal Four
Maximize efficiency
through process improvements
MCI Cedar Junction officially closed on June 16, 2023. Beginning on May 18, 2022 at
Souza Baranowski Correctional Center (SBCC), and April 4, 2022 at all other male facilities,
the MA DOC transitioned away from the use of restrictive housing to a Behavioral
Adjustment Unit (BAU) model of intervention.
The high-level mid-year review exercise, conducted by Administrative Services, has
evolved into an ongoing process as opposed to an annual process. More consistent
reviews are occurring to better lay out the potential for transferring funds and identifying
any surplus or deficiencies. The approach to facility and division allocations has also
evolved from an annual exercise to an ongoing process on the budget side.
Massachusetts Correctional Industries’ signature Optical Shop, at NCCI Gardner,
produced over two hundred fifty thousand pairs of glasses annually and took on the
workload of the Oklahoma DOC, transitioning the work seamlessly. In addition, MassCor’s
Plate Shop, at MCI-Norfolk, entered year two of their contract with the Vermont RMV to
manufacture their motorcycle license plates. New equipment was ordered for the Plate
Shop to handle this.
The Research & Data Analytics Team led the collaboration with EOPSS, Sheriffs’ offices
and Parole to create live dashboards statewide, that are available to the public, with a
focus on the correctional population and recidivism.

D O C S t r a t e g i c P l a n
Goal Five
Achieve work force excellence and implement succession
planning strategies
Prison Rape Elimination Act (PREA) provided education and onboarding, through the
Office of Investigative Services, on Department of Justice (DOJ) standards that promote
a zero tolerance culture and the resources available under PREA, to new PREA
Compliance Managers.
The Special Operations Division organized training sessions for end-users and
administrators on Body Worn Cameras (BWCs). These sessions were designed to provide
staff and administrators with the essential skills required to effectively utilize BWCs and
navigate the online platform for operational success.
The Human Resources Division created an internal tracking system of candidates to
streamline and simplify the recruitment and hiring process for security positions.
Page 29
D O C S t r a t e g i c P l a n
Goal Six
Build an agency that promotes an awareness of services to
encourage an environment of healthy living for all
The Health Services Division and the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention joined
together and coordinated Walks for Suicide at all Department of Correction facilities. This
event gave the opportunity for staff and incarcerated individuals to remember those who
may have passed from suicide and discuss the importance of suicide prevention. The
Health Services Division is planning on this being an annual event held throughout the
Massachusetts Department of Correction.
In April, a “Restorative Justice Self-Improvement" group began at Northeastern
Correctional Center. This is an incarcerated individual run program granting incarcerated
individuals an opportunity to teach and participate.
In 2023, Support Services encouraged staff to look out for Department Wellness
activities, and participate in those that interest them, in an effort to make sure all
employees are aware of the availability and value of the Employee Assistance Unit.
Partnerships with Suffolk and Northeastern Universities was awarded a National Institute
of Justice research grant through the Department of Justice for over $960,000 to study
“Climate, Culture and Correction Officer Wellness.”

The mission of Massachusetts Correctional Industries is to offer diverse, self-sustaining programs
that are beneficial to offenders and economical for the Commonwealth. Participants are provided
with vocational instruction on current equipment and technologies while producing a variety of
high-quality products. These programs encourage the development of valuable skills along with a
positive work ethic, and better positioning offenders for success in the workforce and community
upon reentry.
Correctional Industries can employ up to four hundred seventy-five (475) incarcerated workers
among their fifteen (15) shops within seven (7) institutions. Certification programs are
continuously made available to all eligible incarcerated workers. The population within our prisons
has been down 50% over the past 5 years. (Between January 1, 2023 and December 31, 2023, the
total number of incarcerated individuals in our institutions averaged around 6500 with only 15%
of those being eligible to participate in Industries programs if they so choose.)
MassCor shops continue to encounter supply chain challenges such as difficulty procuring raw
materials, significant increases in pricing of these materials and long lead times receiving these
materials, once ordered.
Dealing with these issues has continued to be a challenge as
we don’t want to impact our delivery times on finished
projects or the price offered to our customers. By
continuously looking at alternate approaches to
manufacturing and keeping a close watch on our spending,
MassCor was able to maintain self-sustainability over the
past year.
During this reporting year, MassCor’s incarcerated workforce
averaged around three hundred sixty
(360) workers. This number tends to fluctuate due to
to uncontrollable factors while our goal remains to
employ the maximum number of incarcerated individuals
consistent with optimal program resources and effective use
of program capital.

2022.
MassCor Industries’ Shops:
Along with acquiring on-the-job training and a strong work ethic, incarcerated individuals choosing
to participate in the Correctional Industries program in one of our shops, gain the added benefit of
having a greater chance of obtaining meaningful employment and being successful after their
release.
MassCor Industries’ priority is the safety and security of the public, staff and incarcerated
individuals. Over the past year, MassCor continued to invest in its shops by adding new equipment
and upgrading and repairing existing equipment as needed. These new machines have additional
improved safety features and increased functionality which have helped to increase productivity.
MassCor Flag/Embroidery Shop at MCI Framingham:
MCI Framingham is home to MassCor’s Flag and Embroidery shops. Incarcerated individuals
working in the Flag Shop manufacture hand-sewn United States, Commonwealth of
Massachusetts, and POW/MIA flags, as well as custom flags. In the process, they learn and develop
basic to advanced sewing skills.
The Flag Shop fulfills orders for private customers as well as public entities including Veteran
Services, the State House, cemeteries, cities and towns, housing authorities, police and fire
departments and other state agencies. The Flag Shop also offers flag accessories such as finials,
tassels and cords. In addition, workers in this shop manufacture miscellaneous items such as
laundry bags and belt pouches.
Page 33
M a s s a c h u s e t t s
C o r r e c t i o n a l
I n d u s t r i e s
Over the past several years, the Flag Shop has experienced a significant increase in demand for
cemetery flags, especially around Memorial Day, Flag Day, Fourth of July and Veterans’ Day, as
these are displayed at many remembrance sites throughout the state and show support for our
Veterans.
The Embroidery Shop produces a variety of
embroidered designs and logos, both standard
and custom, applying them to caps, jackets,
sweaters, tee shirts and other articles of clothing
and accessories. Incarcerated workers in this
shop learn digitized design and manufacturing, in
addition to basic and advanced sewing skills.
These skills are useful for a variety of
employment opportunities within the state.
MassCor Industries at MCI-Norfolk:
MCI-Norfolk, MassCor’s largest operation, offers incarcerated individuals the opportunity to
work in a wide range of manufacturing settings within seven (7) distinct shops.
Incarcerated workers in the Clothing Shop cut and sew fabric to create garments used in
numerous areas throughout the Commonwealth and Department of Correction (DOC). Blankets
used by the DOC are manufactured here as well. The Clothing Shop also stepped up to assist the
Flag Shop at MCI-Framingham with manufacturing cemetery flags, alleviating the backlog they
were experiencing.
Over the past year, six (6) new JUKI sewing machines and two (2) new elastic machines were
added to this shop. In addition, we added a line to hem and stitch cemetery flag panels to
support our cemetery flag needs.
MassCor’s Auto Plate shop is now located in MCI-Norfolk (utilizing the space previously used for
our Janitorial shop production) after being fully transitioned from MCI-Cedar Junction (which
was shut down). This shop is a staple of the industries program, fulfilling all Massachusetts
Registry of Motor Vehicles requirements, including the actual manufacturing of license plates.
This move was completed in ten (10) months with absolutely no disruption of our service to the
RMV. This is a significant accomplishment!

MassCor Industries at MCI-Norfolk:
The Mattress Shop produces a variety of mattresses used in shelters, colleges and universities,
jails and prisons, local police and fire departments and nursing homes. When necessary, this
shop also produces emergency mattresses. Production capabilities in this shop and product
quality have improved over the past year due in large part to the upgraded sewing machines and
new border machines which were added last year. We also recently added a new mattress made
with Fibrix polyester approved materials which provides for a more rigid mattress.
The Norfolk Upholstery Shop continues with auditorium reupholstery projects for
Massachusetts middle and high schools. We have found our “sweet spot” in this area as we truly
excel in this type of project, our prices are competitive, and our customers are extremely
pleased with the results. In addition, we continue to work on upholstery projects for casinos
within the state as well as hospitals, libraries and churches.
The Upholstery Shop continues to provide
quality upholstering of sofas, chairs and other
furniture pieces to both public entities and
private customers.
MCI-Norfolk’s Furniture Assembly Shop
assembles a variety of items, most commonly,
office chairs, from a number of outstanding
furniture providers and office cubicle
structures for both internal and external
customers.
Our fully equipped Metal Shop creates custom-
fabricated metal products, such as benches, trash
receptacles and picnic tables, built upon provided
specifications. The Metal Shop’s customer base
includes cities, towns and state agencies, housing
authorities, DPWs, libraries, and jails and prisons. The
Metal Shop also manufactures products required in
our institutions and makes modifications to existing
fixtures on an as-needed basis.

MassCor Industries at MCI-Norfolk:
We recently added powder coating (using a Slocum Powder Coating System) which we are still
working on perfecting, to ultimately perform powder coating in-house rather than sending such
services out to a third party. This is a great educational opportunity as this is a valuable
transferable skill for incarcerated individuals upon their release. New machinery was purchased
to allow for better quality and increased job production.
One (1) Memoli ETM76 pipe bender, six (6) new
Dynasty 280 TIG welders, and one (1) HAAS TMP-Z
CNC machine were added to this shop. While these
new machines and equipment increase capacity and
improve quality and production of metal products,
this equipment was added with worker safety as the
priority. We also added a Mastercam Software license
and instructor training to supply proper job language
for the new HAAS CNC, required to operate new
equipment
Our Binder Shop provides products integral to the
MassCor product line and provides employees with
supplies to fulfill their office needs such as vinyl
binders and padfolios, in many different styles, sizes
and colors. These can be embossed with standard and
custom designs. Many of these products are available
in our showroom so that we can support many of our
law enforcement agencies and fire services agencies.

MassCor Print Shop at Old Colony Correctional Center:
Old Colony Correctional Center is the location of our full scale, state-of-the-art printing operation.
Incarcerated individuals working in the Print Shop are able to use current technology to produce
quality printed products and gain valuable skills, which are easily transferable to private industry.
Products offered include letterheads, business cards, multi-part forms, pamphlets and business
reports for many Massachusetts cities and towns.
Upgrades to this shop include upgrading old equipment, installing a new server for file storage and
backing up incarcerated workers’ PCs, installing UPS battery backup and purchasing a new Xerox
Iridesse Production Press which adds capacity and opportunity to this shop.
The Validation Shop is now housed in the Print Shop at Old Colony Correctional Center as well.
Validation stickers are the registration stickers found in the upper right corner of Massachusetts
license plates. This operation produces over 25 million stickers annually. A new perforation
machine was installed to improve safety and ultimately increase capacity.
MassCor Wood and Metal Finishing Shops at MCI-Concord:
MassCor has two shops located at MCI Concord – a wood shop and a metal finishing shop. The
Wood Shop is smaller than its counterpart in Shirley and helps to relieve some of Shirley’s
workload by taking on overflow orders that otherwise would not be completed on time, such as
wooden picnic tables ordered each year by DCR (Department of Conservation and Recreation). The
Wood shop did an outstanding job manufacturing picnic tables required by DCR for this year and
our internal drivers ensured on-time delivery.
The Metal Finishing Shop continues to provide painting/finishing services for metal products
coming out of our Norfolk Metal Shop requiring such services. In addition, this shop handles the
manufacturing of metal legs for and assembly of picnic tables.
MassCor Wood Shop and Sewing Shop at MCI-Shirley:
MassCor’s Wood Shop at MCI Shirley offers participating incarcerated individuals the opportunity
to work in a highly productive wood manufacturing plant where they are trained on current, state-
of-the-art equipment including CNC (Computer Numerical Control) machines and laser engraving
equipment. This equipment has improved the quality of work and increased productivity while
providing the opportunity to manufacture a wide range of specialized, custom-built products such
as desks, chairs, and other custom items from a wide variety of wood types.

C o r r e c t i o n a l
I n d u s t r i e s
Incarcerated workers also learn Mastercam software which is one of the most widely used software
offerings in the CNC industry.
The Wood Shop fulfills the needs of fire and police departments, municipal town halls, state
agencies, libraries, colleges, parks and recreation departments, schools, selectmen’s offices and
housing authorities.
MassCor’s Sewing Shop, also located within MCI Shirley,
continues to manufacture flagship products such as sheets,
towels and socks for DOC use. In addition, manufacturing
cemetery flags was added as a function of the Sewing Shop.
This shop, in conjunction with the wood shop, developed a
strong process to complete a high volume of cemetery flags
within a short time, thereby supporting the Flag Shop’s
overflow. In 2023, this shop processed over one hundred
twenty-nine thousand (129,000) panels to support our
cemetery flag needs.
Our Laser Engraving program is now located at Shirley (Medium) Wood Shop. This shop creates a
wide variety of options from engraved cutting boards, memorial bricks and retirement plaques to
holiday decorations and gifts.
MassCor Optical Shop at NCCI-Gardner:
MassCor’s Optical Shop, located at NCCI Gardner, is our signature shop, producing more than
two hundred fifty thousand (250K) pairs of eyeglasses annually. This shop also took on the optical
workload of the Oklahoma DOC and transitioned this work seamlessly.
This shop is a highly profitable, full-scale optical laboratory that utilizes the most current
technology and equipment. Incarcerated workers in this shop produce a wide variety of eyewear
and services for many providers throughout Massachusetts. Incarcerated individuals working at
this site learn skills such as lens grinding and polishing as well as assembling eyeglasses for a wide
variety of consumers within the Commonwealth.

A full optical lab upgrade is currently underway. We have purchased two (2) new lens edgers from
MEI, one of the world leaders in optical equipment, as well as other optical machinery including a
blocker and surfacing machine from Satisloh. This upgrade is scheduled to be completed in Spring
of 2024.
Despite some early challenges, MassCor’s Optical Shop was able to maintain ample inventory based
on supplier relationships.
Industrial Instructors at
the NCCI Gardner Optical
Shop facilitate the process
to recertify incarcerated
individuals in the American
Board of Optometry, a
nationally recognized
organization.
This enables incarcerated individuals to show these valuable qualifications and a strong work
history to potential employers upon their release. New machinery was added to this shop in order
to improve safety, streamline the process and cut down on manufacturing time, thereby increasing
production.
In our old Optical Lab, 30% of our older equipment was upgraded. Four (4) Coburn polishers, two (2)
wax blockers, seven (7) EX edgers and one (1) generator were added.
MassCor Silkscreen and Sign Shops at Massachusetts Treatment Center:
The Massachusetts Treatment Center (MTC) houses our Silkscreen Shop and our Sign Shop.
Incarcerated individuals working in the Sign Shop manufacture a variety of standard street signs
that are used on many roadways within the Commonwealth. In addition, they manufacture wall
mounted signs for indoor and outdoor use, and signs posted at parks, beaches, parking lots and
other recreational areas.
Workers in the Silkscreen Shop produce high-quality custom decals for a variety of uses and silk-
screened clothing. Creating decals for cornhole boards has become quite popular. Over the past
year, we have purchased two (2) new flash heater machines which are more energy-efficient and
produce better results.

MassCor Showroom:
The MassCor Showroom, located at Milford headquarters, continues to use the Point of Sale (POS)
system which streamlines showroom sales so that revenue is recognized sooner.
The Showroom carries both DOC work-related and non-work-related apparel that DOC employees
can purchase as well as a wide assortment of items manufactured in our Industries shops. Many of
the apparel items carried here such as shirts, jackets, caps and seasonal items are embroidered in
our Embroidery Shop in Framingham.
Other items found in the Showroom include flags from our Flag Shop, cutting boards from our
Wood Shop, fire pits from our Metal Shop, and seasonal and holiday-themed items. We continue to
expand product lines, keeping up with current trends. The Showroom is a highlight of Milford
Headquarters for people working in the building and visitors coming in.

Pursuant to M.G.L. 127, Sections 1A and 1B, the Commissioner of Correction is responsible
for conducting bi-annual inspection of all county correctional facilities. The Sheriff of each
county is responsible for implementing and monitoring the requirements set forth in 103
CMR 900.00 through 999.00. The purpose of the bi-annual inspection is to advise
appropriate county officials of any deficiencies identified regarding the standards found in
103 CMR 900 – 999.00 and to make recommendations for improvement. The process serves
as a management tool for county correctional administrators to operate within the
boundaries of 103 CMR 900.00 and to ensure safe and secure facilities for both staff and
incarcerated individuals alike.
To accomplish this mission, the standards found in 103 CMR 900 are divided into four
areas: Compliance, Non-compliance, Non-applicable, and Not assessed, with one area, or
cycle, audited per year. Each cycle consists of an initial and follow-up audit to access
facility operations and to gauge compliance with applicable standards. The follow-up audit
is conducted six months after the initial audit to assess if corrective action was taken on
noted deficiencies. As a response to the notice of non-compliance, each Sheriff/facility
administrator is required to file with the Commissioner of Correction a written response to
the audit report within a period of 60 days. The response is required to include a plan of
action and target date for completion for each standard noted as being out of compliance.

Massachusetts DOC Jurisdiction Population: Males by Type of Sentence on January 1, 2024
Massachusetts DOC Jurisdiction Population: Females by Type of Sentence on January 1, 2024
The vast majority of males were state criminal commitments (90%) on January 1, 2024.
In previous years female state criminal commitments represented a smaller portion of their total commitments (39%
in 2019 vs. 59% in 2024) compared to males (90% in 2024). This is due in part to the MA DOC previously housing
numerous counties’ female population due to capacity issues/lack of housing. This trend shifted in 2020 because
several Massachusetts counties are now able to take criminally (county) sentenced and pre-trial detainees into their
own custody.

Note: Monthly jurisdiction population is based on the end of the month count of the criminally sentenced
jurisdiction population and will not reflect the cumulative difference in admissions and releases.
Overall, throughout 2023 the number of criminally sentenced admissions was more than
the number of criminally sentenced releases, criminal admissions averaging 145 per
month and criminal releases averaging 130.
During the trend period criminal admissions ranged between 107 in July, and 198 in
March. Criminal releases ranged between 102 in February, and 181 in March.
The cumulative difference between admissions and releases resulted in a cumulative
increase of 178 in the criminally sentenced population by year’s end.
The criminally sentenced population at the end of 2023 was 5,676, a 3% increase from
the population at the end of 2022, at 5,507. This reversed the annual decrease from 2015
to 2023 when comparing year’s end criminally sentenced populations.

MA DOC Three Year Recidivism Rate (Re-incarceration) for
Releases to the Community 2010-2019
A recidivist is defined as any criminally sentenced incarcerated individual released to the community
via expiration of sentence/ parole from MA DOC jurisdiction during 2019 who is re-incarcerated for a
new sentence or violation of parole or probation to a Massachusetts state or county facility or to a
federal facility within three years of his/her release. Types of re-incarceration include technical
violation of parole, parole violation with a new offense, return to county custody, return to state or
federal custody, technical violation of probation, and probation violation with a new offense. An
incarcerated individual who recidivates due to a technical violation of parole or probation is re-
incarcerated for violating the terms of the conditions set forth regarding a release in the community,
not for committing a new offense.
Over the ten-year trend period, the three year recidivism rate has seen a strong negative trend, ending the
trend with an overall recidivism rate decrease of 13 percentage points compared to the high experienced in
2010.

Goal One
Maintain and enhance prison safety and security for the public,
staff and Incarcerated Individuals
The Office of Investigative Services established the Correctional Intelligence Initiative
Program (CIIP.) The program’s goal is to enhance communication between agencies by
establishing a network where information can be shared across the state. Multiple
agencies and municipalities have joined in the effort to support their investigations.
The Policy Development and Compliance Unit (PDCU) worked with Department
stakeholders to formulate policies and operating procedures for the roll out of the Body
Worn Camera (BWC) program statewide. The BWC policy was approved on 9/26/23.
In 2023, the Special Operations Division helped to successfully roll out Body Worn
Cameras at Souza Baranowski Correctional Center, MCI-Shirley, MCI Framingham and Old
Colony Correctional Center. BWC footage has been incorporated into the Use of Force
review process.
In 2023, The Division of Resource Management began the roll-out of the Alertus
Emergency Notification system at all facilities.
Grant awards were received, via EOPSS’ Office of Grants & Research, for federal funds
from the Department of Justice’s Prison Rape Elimination Act ($133,231 from Bureau of
Justice Assistance) as well as for the Violence Against Women Act ($80,360,000 from
Office on Violence Against Women).

D O C S t r a t e g i c P l a n
Goal Three
Collaborate with external stakeholders to achieve mutual goals
and objectives
Souza Baranowski Correctional Center’s (SBCC) volunteer run program, Speak Up,
graduated the first set of incarcerated individuals since the program began. Incarcerated
individuals were issued certificates for their completion.
The DOC’s Division of Staff Development partnered with Boulder Crest to bring the
“Struggle Well Initiative” to the agency. In collaboration, Boulder Crest personnel have
joined to create Strategic and Operational Plans to effectively saturate and
institutionalize the Struggle Well philosophy and training transversely within the
organization. This will be accomplished through weekly in-service and catalog courses.
The objective is to be a catalyst of healthy personal, professional, and organizational
change, while providing the proper follow-up departmental actions to influence a true
cultural shift as it concerns mental wellness. The overall philosophy is to integrate
Posttraumatic Growth into training, communications, and departmental processes. We
can commence to proactively address anxiety, depression, aggression, suicide, and create
healthy correctional professionals that aim to thrive in support of their communities.
New England Culinary Arts Training (NECAT), in partnership with Tech Goes Home
provides each releasing incarcerated individual, who participated in the culinary arts
program, with a Chromebook upon release at Northeast Correctional Center.

Goal Four
Maximize efficiency
through process improvements
MCI Cedar Junction officially closed on June 16, 2023. Beginning on May 18, 2022 at
Souza Baranowski Correctional Center (SBCC), and April 4, 2022 at all other male facilities,
the MA DOC transitioned away from the use of restrictive housing to a Behavioral
Adjustment Unit (BAU) model of intervention.
The high-level mid-year review exercise, conducted by Administrative Services, has
evolved into an ongoing process as opposed to an annual process. More consistent
reviews are occurring to better lay out the potential for transferring funds and identifying
any surplus or deficiencies. The approach to facility and division allocations has also
evolved from an annual exercise to an ongoing process on the budget side.
Massachusetts Correctional Industries’ signature Optical Shop, at NCCI Gardner,
produced over two hundred fifty thousand pairs of glasses annually and took on the
workload of the Oklahoma DOC, transitioning the work seamlessly. In addition, MassCor’s
Plate Shop, at MCI-Norfolk, entered year two of their contract with the Vermont RMV to
manufacture their motorcycle license plates. New equipment was ordered for the Plate
Shop to handle this.
The Research & Data Analytics Team led the collaboration with EOPSS, Sheriffs’ offices
and Parole to create live dashboards statewide, that are available to the public, with a
focus on the correctional population and recidivism.

Goal Five
Achieve work force excellence and implement succession
planning strategies
Prison Rape Elimination Act (PREA) provided education and onboarding, through the
Office of Investigative Services, on Department of Justice (DOJ) standards that promote
a zero tolerance culture and the resources available under PREA, to new PREA
Compliance Managers.
The Special Operations Division organized training sessions for end-users and
administrators on Body Worn Cameras (BWCs). These sessions were designed to provide
staff and administrators with the essential skills required to effectively utilize BWCs and
navigate the online platform for operational success.
The Human Resources Division created an internal tracking system of candidates to
streamline and simplify the recruitment and hiring process for security positions.

D O C S t r a t e g i c P l a n
Goal Six
Build an agency that promotes an awareness of services to
encourage an environment of healthy living for all
The Health Services Division and the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention joined
together and coordinated Walks for Suicide at all Department of Correction facilities. This
event gave the opportunity for staff and incarcerated individuals to remember those who
may have passed from suicide and discuss the importance of suicide prevention. The
Health Services Division is planning on this being an annual event held throughout the
Massachusetts Department of Correction.
In April, a “Restorative Justice Self-Improvement" group began at Northeastern
Correctional Center. This is an incarcerated individual run program granting incarcerated
individuals an opportunity to teach and participate.
In 2023, Support Services encouraged staff to look out for Department Wellness
activities, and participate in those that interest them, in an effort to make sure all
employees are aware of the availability and value of the Employee Assistance Unit.
Partnerships with Suffolk and Northeastern Universities was awarded a National Institute
of Justice research grant through the Department of Justice for over $960,000 to study
“Climate, Culture and Correction Officer Wellness.”

The mission of Massachusetts Correctional Industries is to offer diverse, self-sustaining programs
that are beneficial to offenders and economical for the Commonwealth. Participants are provided
with vocational instruction on current equipment and technologies while producing a variety of
high-quality products. These programs encourage the development of valuable skills along with a
positive work ethic, and better positioning offenders for success in the workforce and community
upon reentry.
Correctional Industries can employ up to four hundred seventy-five (475) incarcerated workers
among their fifteen (15) shops within seven (7) institutions. Certification programs are
continuously made available to all eligible incarcerated workers. The population within our prisons
has been down 50% over the past 5 years. (Between January 1, 2023 and December 31, 2023, the
total number of incarcerated individuals in our institutions averaged around 6500 with only 15%
of those being eligible to participate in Industries programs if they so choose.)
MassCor shops continue to encounter supply chain challenges such as difficulty procuring raw
materials, significant increases in pricing of these materials and long lead times receiving these
materials, once ordered.
Dealing with these issues has continued to be a challenge as
we don’t want to impact our delivery times on finished
projects or the price offered to our customers. By
continuously looking at alternate approaches to
manufacturing and keeping a close watch on our spending,
MassCor was able to maintain self-sustainability over the
past year.
During this reporting year, MassCor’s incarcerated workforce
averaged around three hundred sixty
(360) workers. This number tends to fluctuate due to
to uncontrollable factors while our goal remains to
employ the maximum number of incarcerated individuals
consistent with optimal program resources and effective use
of program capital.

2022.
MassCor Industries’ Shops:
Along with acquiring on-the-job training and a strong work ethic, incarcerated individuals choosing
to participate in the Correctional Industries program in one of our shops, gain the added benefit of
having a greater chance of obtaining meaningful employment and being successful after their
release.
MassCor Industries’ priority is the safety and security of the public, staff and incarcerated
individuals. Over the past year, MassCor continued to invest in its shops by adding new equipment
and upgrading and repairing existing equipment as needed. These new machines have additional
improved safety features and increased functionality which have helped to increase productivity.
MassCor Flag/Embroidery Shop at MCI Framingham:
MCI Framingham is home to MassCor’s Flag and Embroidery shops. Incarcerated individuals
working in the Flag Shop manufacture hand-sewn United States, Commonwealth of
Massachusetts, and POW/MIA flags, as well as custom flags. In the process, they learn and develop
basic to advanced sewing skills.
The Flag Shop fulfills orders for private customers as well as public entities including Veteran
Services, the State House, cemeteries, cities and towns, housing authorities, police and fire
departments and other state agencies. The Flag Shop also offers flag accessories such as finials,
tassels and cords. In addition, workers in this shop manufacture miscellaneous items such as
laundry bags and belt pouches.

Page 33
M a s s a c h u s e t t s
C o r r e c t i o n a l
I n d u s t r i e s
Over the past several years, the Flag Shop has experienced a significant increase in demand for
cemetery flags, especially around Memorial Day, Flag Day, Fourth of July and Veterans’ Day, as
these are displayed at many remembrance sites throughout the state and show support for our
Veterans.
The Embroidery Shop produces a variety of
embroidered designs and logos, both standard
and custom, applying them to caps, jackets,
sweaters, tee shirts and other articles of clothing
and accessories. Incarcerated workers in this
shop learn digitized design and manufacturing, in
addition to basic and advanced sewing skills.
These skills are useful for a variety of
employment opportunities within the state.
MassCor Industries at MCI-Norfolk:
MCI-Norfolk, MassCor’s largest operation, offers incarcerated individuals the opportunity to
work in a wide range of manufacturing settings within seven (7) distinct shops.
Incarcerated workers in the Clothing Shop cut and sew fabric to create garments used in
numerous areas throughout the Commonwealth and Department of Correction (DOC). Blankets
used by the DOC are manufactured here as well. The Clothing Shop also stepped up to assist the
Flag Shop at MCI-Framingham with manufacturing cemetery flags, alleviating the backlog they
were experiencing.
Over the past year, six (6) new JUKI sewing machines and two (2) new elastic machines were
added to this shop. In addition, we added a line to hem and stitch cemetery flag panels to
support our cemetery flag needs.
MassCor’s Auto Plate shop is now located in MCI-Norfolk (utilizing the space previously used for
our Janitorial shop production) after being fully transitioned from MCI-Cedar Junction (which
was shut down). This shop is a staple of the industries program, fulfilling all Massachusetts
Registry of Motor Vehicles requirements, including the actual manufacturing of license plates.
This move was completed in ten (10) months with absolutely no disruption of our service to the
RMV. This is a significant accomplishment!

MassCor Industries at MCI-Norfolk:
The Mattress Shop produces a variety of mattresses used in shelters, colleges and universities,
jails and prisons, local police and fire departments and nursing homes. When necessary, this
shop also produces emergency mattresses. Production capabilities in this shop and product
quality have improved over the past year due in large part to the upgraded sewing machines and
new border machines which were added last year. We also recently added a new mattress made
with Fibrix polyester approved materials which provides for a more rigid mattress.
The Norfolk Upholstery Shop continues with auditorium reupholstery projects for
Massachusetts middle and high schools. We have found our “sweet spot” in this area as we truly
excel in this type of project, our prices are competitive, and our customers are extremely
pleased with the results. In addition, we continue to work on upholstery projects for casinos
within the state as well as hospitals, libraries and churches.
The Upholstery Shop continues to provide
quality upholstering of sofas, chairs and other
furniture pieces to both public entities and
private customers.
MCI-Norfolk’s Furniture Assembly Shop
assembles a variety of items, most commonly,
office chairs, from a number of outstanding
furniture providers and office cubicle
structures for both internal and external
customers.
Our fully equipped Metal Shop creates custom-
fabricated metal products, such as benches, trash
receptacles and picnic tables, built upon provided
specifications. The Metal Shop’s customer base
includes cities, towns and state agencies, housing
authorities, DPWs, libraries, and jails and prisons. The
Metal Shop also manufactures products required in
our institutions and makes modifications to existing
fixtures on an as-needed basis.

MassCor Industries at MCI-Norfolk:
We recently added powder coating (using a Slocum Powder Coating System) which we are still
working on perfecting, to ultimately perform powder coating in-house rather than sending such
services out to a third party. This is a great educational opportunity as this is a valuable
transferable skill for incarcerated individuals upon their release. New machinery was purchased
to allow for better quality and increased job production.
One (1) Memoli ETM76 pipe bender, six (6) new
Dynasty 280 TIG welders, and one (1) HAAS TMP-Z
CNC machine were added to this shop. While these
new machines and equipment increase capacity and
improve quality and production of metal products,
this equipment was added with worker safety as the
priority. We also added a Mastercam Software license
and instructor training to supply proper job language
for the new HAAS CNC, required to operate new
equipment
Our Binder Shop provides products integral to the
MassCor product line and provides employees with
supplies to fulfill their office needs such as vinyl
binders and padfolios, in many different styles, sizes
and colors. These can be embossed with standard and
custom designs. Many of these products are available
in our showroom so that we can support many of our
law enforcement agencies and fire services agencies.

MassCor Print Shop at Old Colony Correctional Center:
Old Colony Correctional Center is the location of our full scale, state-of-the-art printing operation.
Incarcerated individuals working in the Print Shop are able to use current technology to produce
quality printed products and gain valuable skills, which are easily transferable to private industry.
Products offered include letterheads, business cards, multi-part forms, pamphlets and business
reports for many Massachusetts cities and towns.
Upgrades to this shop include upgrading old equipment, installing a new server for file storage and
backing up incarcerated workers’ PCs, installing UPS battery backup and purchasing a new Xerox
Iridesse Production Press which adds capacity and opportunity to this shop.
The Validation Shop is now housed in the Print Shop at Old Colony Correctional Center as well.
Validation stickers are the registration stickers found in the upper right corner of Massachusetts
license plates. This operation produces over 25 million stickers annually. A new perforation
machine was installed to improve safety and ultimately increase capacity.
MassCor Wood and Metal Finishing Shops at MCI-Concord:
MassCor has two shops located at MCI Concord – a wood shop and a metal finishing shop. The
Wood Shop is smaller than its counterpart in Shirley and helps to relieve some of Shirley’s
workload by taking on overflow orders that otherwise would not be completed on time, such as
wooden picnic tables ordered each year by DCR (Department of Conservation and Recreation). The
Wood shop did an outstanding job manufacturing picnic tables required by DCR for this year and
our internal drivers ensured on-time delivery.
The Metal Finishing Shop continues to provide painting/finishing services for metal products
coming out of our Norfolk Metal Shop requiring such services. In addition, this shop handles the
manufacturing of metal legs for and assembly of picnic tables.
MassCor Wood Shop and Sewing Shop at MCI-Shirley:
MassCor’s Wood Shop at MCI Shirley offers participating incarcerated individuals the opportunity
to work in a highly productive wood manufacturing plant where they are trained on current, state-
of-the-art equipment including CNC (Computer Numerical Control) machines and laser engraving
equipment. This equipment has improved the quality of work and increased productivity while
providing the opportunity to manufacture a wide range of specialized, custom-built products such
as desks, chairs, and other custom items from a wide variety of wood types.

Page 37
M a s s a c h u s e t t s
C o r r e c t i o n a l
I n d u s t r i e s
Incarcerated workers also learn Mastercam software which is one of the most widely used software
offerings in the CNC industry.
The Wood Shop fulfills the needs of fire and police departments, municipal town halls, state
agencies, libraries, colleges, parks and recreation departments, schools, selectmen’s offices and
housing authorities.
MassCor’s Sewing Shop, also located within MCI Shirley,
continues to manufacture flagship products such as sheets,
towels and socks for DOC use. In addition, manufacturing
cemetery flags was added as a function of the Sewing Shop.
This shop, in conjunction with the wood shop, developed a
strong process to complete a high volume of cemetery flags
within a short time, thereby supporting the Flag Shop’s
overflow. In 2023, this shop processed over one hundred
twenty-nine thousand (129,000) panels to support our
cemetery flag needs.
Our Laser Engraving program is now located at Shirley (Medium) Wood Shop. This shop creates a
wide variety of options from engraved cutting boards, memorial bricks and retirement plaques to
holiday decorations and gifts.
MassCor Optical Shop at NCCI-Gardner:
MassCor’s Optical Shop, located at NCCI Gardner, is our signature shop, producing more than
two hundred fifty thousand (250K) pairs of eyeglasses annually. This shop also took on the optical
workload of the Oklahoma DOC and transitioned this work seamlessly.
This shop is a highly profitable, full-scale optical laboratory that utilizes the most current
technology and equipment. Incarcerated workers in this shop produce a wide variety of eyewear
and services for many providers throughout Massachusetts. Incarcerated individuals working at
this site learn skills such as lens grinding and polishing as well as assembling eyeglasses for a wide
variety of consumers within the Commonwealth.

A full optical lab upgrade is currently underway. We have purchased two (2) new lens edgers from
MEI, one of the world leaders in optical equipment, as well as other optical machinery including a
blocker and surfacing machine from Satisloh. This upgrade is scheduled to be completed in Spring
of 2024.
Despite some early challenges, MassCor’s Optical Shop was able to maintain ample inventory based
on supplier relationships.
Industrial Instructors at
the NCCI Gardner Optical
Shop facilitate the process
to recertify incarcerated
individuals in the American
Board of Optometry, a
nationally recognized
organization.
This enables incarcerated individuals to show these valuable qualifications and a strong work
history to potential employers upon their release. New machinery was added to this shop in order
to improve safety, streamline the process and cut down on manufacturing time, thereby increasing
production.
In our old Optical Lab, 30% of our older equipment was upgraded. Four (4) Coburn polishers, two (2)
wax blockers, seven (7) EX edgers and one (1) generator were added.
MassCor Silkscreen and Sign Shops at Massachusetts Treatment Center:
The Massachusetts Treatment Center (MTC) houses our Silkscreen Shop and our Sign Shop.
Incarcerated individuals working in the Sign Shop manufacture a variety of standard street signs
that are used on many roadways within the Commonwealth. In addition, they manufacture wall
mounted signs for indoor and outdoor use, and signs posted at parks, beaches, parking lots and
other recreational areas.
Workers in the Silkscreen Shop produce high-quality custom decals for a variety of uses and silk-
screened clothing. Creating decals for cornhole boards has become quite popular. Over the past
year, we have purchased two (2) new flash heater machines which are more energy-efficient and
produce better results.

MassCor Showroom:
The MassCor Showroom, located at Milford headquarters, continues to use the Point of Sale (POS)
system which streamlines showroom sales so that revenue is recognized sooner.
The Showroom carries both DOC work-related and non-work-related apparel that DOC employees
can purchase as well as a wide assortment of items manufactured in our Industries shops. Many of
the apparel items carried here such as shirts, jackets, caps and seasonal items are embroidered in
our Embroidery Shop in Framingham.
Other items found in the Showroom include flags from our Flag Shop, cutting boards from our
Wood Shop, fire pits from our Metal Shop, and seasonal and holiday-themed items. We continue to
expand product lines, keeping up with current trends. The Showroom is a highlight of Milford
Headquarters for people working in the building and visitors coming in.

Pursuant to M.G.L. 127, Sections 1A and 1B, the Commissioner of Correction is responsible
for conducting bi-annual inspection of all county correctional facilities. The Sheriff of each
county is responsible for implementing and monitoring the requirements set forth in 103
CMR 900.00 through 999.00. The purpose of the bi-annual inspection is to advise
appropriate county officials of any deficiencies identified regarding the standards found in
103 CMR 900 – 999.00 and to make recommendations for improvement. The process serves
as a management tool for county correctional administrators to operate within the
boundaries of 103 CMR 900.00 and to ensure safe and secure facilities for both staff and
incarcerated individuals alike.
To accomplish this mission, the standards found in 103 CMR 900 are divided into four
areas: Compliance, Non-compliance, Non-applicable, and Not assessed, with one area, or
cycle, audited per year. Each cycle consists of an initial and follow-up audit to access
facility operations and to gauge compliance with applicable standards. The follow-up audit
is conducted six months after the initial audit to assess if corrective action was taken on
noted deficiencies. As a response to the notice of non-compliance, each Sheriff/facility
administrator is required to file with the Commissioner of Correction a written response to
the audit report within a period of 60 days. The response is required to include a plan of
action and target date for completion for each standard noted as being out of compliance.
