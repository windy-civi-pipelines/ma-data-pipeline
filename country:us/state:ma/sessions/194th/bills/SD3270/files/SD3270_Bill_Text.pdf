RE: Settlements and Judgments Report — Fiscal Year 2025 Accounts Payable Reporting
Dear Chair Michlewitz and Chair Rodrigues:
Pursuant to Section 2 of Chapter 140 of the Acts of 2024, the Office of the Comptroller hereby
submits to the House and Senate Committees on Ways and Means a report on payments made
from the Settlements and Judgments reserve (1599-3384) for the Accounts Payable period of
Fiscal Year 2025.
The attached report provides information on payees, amounts, and the associated department or
agency for settlements and judgments paid from appropriation account 1599-3384. This
information is also posted quarterly on the Comptroller’s transparency website, CTHRU, which
may be accessed via this portal link, https://www.macomptroller.org/cthru.
Spending in the accounts payable period of Fiscal Year 2025 (July 1, 2025 – August 31,
2025)
A total of $5,115,703.70 was paid from the Settlements and Judgements reserve account during
the accounts payable period of Fiscal Year 2025. As you know, the accounts payable period is
that limited time after July 1 of each year during which departments process payments that are
attributable to the just-ended prior fiscal year.
