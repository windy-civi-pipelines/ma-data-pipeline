Report
The State Office of Pharmacy Services (SOPS) within the Department of Public Health (DPH) provides the
Commonwealth of Massachusetts an integrated pharmacy health system benefiting several separate
and distinct agencies. SOPS currently provides pharmacy services to the following agencies: the
Department of Public Health; the Department of Mental Health; the Department of Developmental
Services; the Department of Correction; the Barnstable, Berkshire, Bristol, Dukes, Essex, Franklin,
Hampden, Hampshire, Middlesex, Norfolk, Plymouth, and Suffolk Houses of Correction; and the
Veterans’ Homes in the cities of Holyoke and Chelsea.
As part of the FY2025 budget, SOPS is statutorily required to report on recommendations for entities
that may realize cost savings through this program. Presently, SOPS has converted all of the named
agencies with the exception of the Worcester Sheriff’s Department. The Worcester Sheriff’s
Department has been reviewed and it would not be cost beneficial to convert them at this time. They
have contracted through their medical provider for the provision of pharmaceuticals, however, SOPS is
ready to service them should the need arise.
The Department of Public Health recommends removing the legislative reporting requirement going
forward. This mandate is no longer timely and was appropriate during the initial conversions to SOPS.
