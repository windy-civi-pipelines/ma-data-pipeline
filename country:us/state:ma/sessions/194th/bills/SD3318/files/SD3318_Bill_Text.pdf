_______________
In the One Hundred and Ninety-Fourth General Court
(2025-2026)
_______________
An Act to establish tenant escrow savings accounts.
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives in General Court assembled, and by the authority
of the same, as follows:
1 SECTION 1. Definitions
2 ''Eligible tenant'', a person who acquires occupancy, possession or control of real property
3 or a portion thereof for a period of no less than twelve months, which is owned by an individual
4 landlord.
5 “Eligible Landlord” an individual that owns and rents out and manages property, such as
6 houses, apartments, or land, to tenants. Said landlord may own no more than five rental units that
7 maintain responsibility for property maintenance, rent collection, and lease management in the
8 commonwealth. Said landlord will be registered with and approved by EOHLC according to
9 their regulations.
10 SECTION 2. Tenant Escrow Program Established
11 The Executive Office of Housing and Livable Communities (EOHLC) shall establish and
12 administer a voluntary savings initiative known as the Tenant Escrow Program to assist rental
1 of 4

13 tenants in building savings for the purchase of their first home. Under this program, eligible
14 tenants with the agreement of an eligible landlord may elect to contribute ten percent of their
15 monthly rent into a secure tenant escrow account managed by EOHLC.
16 SECTION 3. Use and Withdrawal of Funds
17 Funds in the tenant’s escrow account may only be withdrawn for use as a down payment
18 or closing costs associated with the purchase of their first primary residence. The funds in the
19 tenant escrow account may also be used as an emergency rent fund if the tenant cannot pay the
20 full rental amount and the tenant has received a Notice to Quit or an eviction notice. Any amount
21 taken out of the escrow account and used for an emergency rental payment will be subtracted
22 from that month’s ten percent contribution to the tenant escrow account.
23 SECTION 3. Tenant Contributions and State Match
24 Funds contributed by the tenant pursuant to Section 1 shall be matched by the
25 commonwealth on a twenty percent basis of the final total amount in the escrow account, upon
26 approval for the withdrawal of funds.
27 SECTION 4. Landlord Taxable Deductions
28 (a) A landlord whose tenant is contributing to a tenant’s escrow account may deduct an
29 amount equal to one and one half times the amount of the tenants’ contribution from the amount
30 of the annual taxable income derived from the contributing tenants’ lease established under
31 section 2 of this act, payable by the landlord to the commonwealth. Municipalities within the
32 commonwealth may elect to offer eligible landlords an additional deduction up to ten percent of
2 of 4

33 the annual taxable income derived from the contributing tenants’ lease established under section
34 2 of this act.
35 (b) A landlord whose tenant contributes to a tenant escrow account pursuant to section 2
36 of this chapter may deduct an amount equal to one and one-half times the total amount of the
37 tenant’s annual contribution from the landlord’s annual taxable income derived from the
38 contributing tenant’s lease, for the purpose of determining income subject to taxation by the
39 commonwealth.
40 (c) A city or town may, by a vote of its legislative body and with the approval of its chief
41 executive officer, adopt a local option to provide an additional tax deduction to landlords
42 participating in the Tenant Escrow Program. Such local option may authorize a deduction of up
43 to ten percent of the landlord’s annual taxable income derived from the contributing tenant’s
44 lease, provided that:
45 (i) the tenant is actively participating in the program; and
46 (ii) the landlord has complied with all reporting and verification requirements as
47 determined by the municipality.
48 (d) The additional deduction authorized under subsection (b) shall apply only to local
49 taxes or assessments, and shall not exceed ten percent of the landlord’s taxable income derived
50 from the applicable lease in any tax year.
51 (e) Municipalities electing to implement this provision shall notify the department of
52 revenue and the executive office of housing and livable communities of such adoption, and shall
3 of 4

53 file an annual report detailing the number of participating landlords and the total value of
54 deductions granted under this section.
55 SECTION 5. Tenant Escrow Fund
56 There shall be established a separate fund to be known as the Tenant’s Escrow Fund. The
57 Fund shall be administered by EOHLC and shall receive and hold tenant contributions and state
58 matching funds. The Fund shall not be subject to section 5C of Chapter 29 of the General Laws.
59 The state matching funds shall be appropriated through the budget annually.
60 SECTION 6. Program Design and Regulations
61 EOHLC shall promulgate regulations to govern program eligibility, account
62 administration, allowable uses, and compliance, including:
63 a) Safeguards to prevent landlords from raising rents to offset contributions.
64 b) Consumer protections to ensure account transparency and fund accessibility.
65 EOHLC shall submit any proposed regulations to the Joint Committee on Housing and
66 the House and Senate committees on Ways and Means at least 30 days before their adoption by
67 the department.
