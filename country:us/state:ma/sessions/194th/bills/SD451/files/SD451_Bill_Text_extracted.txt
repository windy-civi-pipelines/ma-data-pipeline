Attached to this memo are the individual submissions of the 11 District Attorney Offices.
The District Attorneys utilize the same outdated case management system (DAMION) but differ
significantly in how each office defines its data and inputs and reports that data, as well as whether
certain data is even tracked at all. Please also note that, due to administrative staffing issues, not
all offices are able to input all cases (especially those in the district courts) into DAMION, resulting
in underreporting of cases; and not all offices are able to quickly close disposed cases, resulting in
over reporting.

Re: Annual Report on the District Attorneys’ Prosecution Statistics

where the case includes charges for drug offenses under chapter 94C of the General Laws, motor vehicle
offenses under chapter 90 of the General Laws or firearm offenses under chapter 140 of the General

Attached to this memo are the individual submissions of the 11 District Attorney Offices.
The District Attorneys utilize the same outdated case management system (DAMION) but differ
significantly in how each office defines its data and inputs and reports that data, as well as whether
certain data is even tracked at all. Please also note that, due to administrative staffing issues, not
all offices are able to input all cases (especially those in the district courts) into DAMION, resulting
in underreporting of cases; and not all offices are able to quickly close disposed cases, resulting in
over reporting.
